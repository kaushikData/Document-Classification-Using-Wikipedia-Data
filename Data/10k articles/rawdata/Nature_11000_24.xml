}}
The type '''955 triode''' "[[acorn tube]]"  is a small [[triode]]  [[thermionic valve]] ([[vacuum tube]] in USA) designed primarily to operate at high frequency. Although data books specify an upper limit of 400–600&amp;nbsp;MHz, some circuits may obtain gain up to about 900&amp;nbsp;MHz. Interelectrode [[capacitance]]s and [[Miller effect|Miller capacitances]] are minimized by the small dimensions of the device and the widely separated pins. The connecting pins are placed around the periphery of the bulb and project radially outward: this maintains short internal leads with low [[inductance]], an important property allowing operation at high frequency. The pins fit a special socket fabricated as a ceramic ring in which the valve itself occupies the central space.  The 955 was developed by [[RCA]] and was commercially available in 1935. &lt;ref&gt; https://books.google.ca/books?id=lyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=acorn+tubes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiy8_w74rbAhVKxYMKHe1EDbcQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=acorn%20tubes&amp;f=false  ''Popular |Science'' January 1935, '' New Dwarf Tube Ready for Amateur'', page 58 &lt;/ref&gt;

The 955 is one of about a dozen types of "acorn valve", so called because their size and shape is similar to the [[acorn]] (nut of the oak tree), introduced starting in 1935 and designed to work in the [[VHF]] range.&lt;ref name=sibley /&gt; The 954 and 956 types are sharp and remote cut-off pentodes, respectively, both also with indirect 6.3&amp;nbsp;V, 150&amp;nbsp;mA heaters. Types 957, 958 and 959 are for portable equipment and have 1.25&amp;nbsp;V [[Nickel–cadmium battery|NiCd battery]] heaters. The 957 is a medium-μ signal triode, the 958 is a transmitting triode with dual, paralleled filaments for increased emission, and the 959 is a sharp cut-off pentode like the 954. The 957 and 959 draw 50&amp;nbsp;mA heater current, the 958 twice as much. In 1942, the 958A with tightened emission specs was introduced after it turned out that 958s with excessively high emission kept working after the filament power was turned off, the filament still sufficiently heating on the anode current alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/084/9/957.pdf |title= 957&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;958&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;959 (Acorn Types) |publisher=[[RCA|R.C.A. Manufacturing Company]], Harrison, New Jersey, USA |format=PDF |accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sibley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antiquewireless.org/uploads/1/6/1/2/16129770/55-the_vacuum_tube.pdf |title= The Acorn Tube |author=Ludwell A. Sibley |format=PDF |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pin connections==
[[File:AcornTubeSockets.agr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A box of Acorn sockets]]

When viewing the device from above (the end without the exhaust tip), the pins are arranged in a group of three and a group of two, starting with the centre pin in the group of three and going in a clockwise direction, the pins are ''cathode, heater, grid, anode, heater''.

==Ratings==
The 955 is an ''indirectly heated triode'' with heater electrically isolated from the cathode. The heater has a 6.3 volt rating, which it shares with many other common thermionic valves/electron tubes, and it draws about 150 mA.

The maximum anode voltage is 250&amp;nbsp;V, with an anode current of 420&amp;nbsp;microamperes and anode load 250&amp;nbsp;kilohm, and the maximum anode current is 4.5&amp;nbsp;mA at a voltage of 180&amp;nbsp;V with an anode load of 20 kilohm.&lt;ref&gt;Philips Valve Data Book, Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Ltd., 69-73 Clarence Street Sydney, Radio Valve Application Division, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; The 955 is designed to be used in the frequency range of 60–600&amp;nbsp;MHz (5-0.5&amp;nbsp;metres wavelength).
The amplification factor obtained is between 20 and 25 depending on details of the specific stage design and operating voltage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2357">'''Alpha Capricorni''' ('''α Capricorni''', abbreviated '''Alpha Cap''', '''α Cap''') is an [[double star|optical double]] star in the [[constellation]] of [[Capricornus]]. The two physically-unrelated components are designated:
*[[Alpha1 Capricorni|α¹ Capricorni]]
*[[Alpha2 Capricorni|α² Capricorni]] (also named Algedi&lt;ref name="IAU-CSN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/WGSN/IAU-CSN.txt | title=IAU Catalog of Star Names |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

They are separated by 0.11° on the sky, and resolvable with the naked eye, similar to [[Mizar and Alcor]]. α¹ Capricorni is fainter (apparent magnitude 4.27) than α² Capricorni (apparent magnitude 3.58).

==Nomenclature==
''α Capricorni'' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to ''Alpha Capricorni'') is the system's [[Bayer designation]]; ''α¹'' and ''α² Capricorni'', those of the two components.

Alpha Capricorni bore the traditional names ''Algedi'', ''Algiedi'', ''Al Giedi'' or ''Giedi'', derived from the [[Arabic]] ''الجدي'' ''al-jady'' "the billy goat" or "kid". It also refers to the entire constellation of Capricornus. ''Giedi'' is sometimes also associated with [[Beta Capricorni]]. ''α¹'' and ''α² Capricorni'' were also called ''Prima Giedi'' and ''Secunda Giedi'', respectively. In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organized a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)&lt;ref name="WGSN"&gt;{{citation
 | url=https://www.iau.org/science/scientific_bodies/working_groups/280/
 | title=IAU Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)
 | publisher=International Astronomical Union
 | accessdate=22 May 2016 | postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name ''Algedi'' for ''α² Capricorni'' on 21 August 2016 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.&lt;ref name="IAU-CSN"/&gt;

Alpha Capricorni is known as 牛宿二 (the Second Star of [[Ox (Chinese constellation)|the Ox]]) in Chinese astronomy.

'''Baseball rubbing mud''' is [[mud]] used to treat [[Baseball (ball)|balls]] in the sport of [[baseball]] to give [[pitcher]]s better control and a firmer grip on the balls.&lt;ref name=florida /&gt;

==History==
Before the use of rubbing mud, baseballs were rubbed in a mixture of [[water]] and infield [[soil]], but this method usually discolored the ball's [[leather]] surface.&lt;ref name=florida /&gt; Other alternatives at the time were [[Tobacco water|tobacco juice]], [[shoe polish]], and soil from under stadium [[bleacher]]s. They were able to successfully take off the [[:wikt:sheen|sheen]] from baseballs, but at the same time, they also damaged and scratched the ball's leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-10-06 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102804315 |title=Secret Dirt's Pivotal Role In Baseball |publisher=NPR |date=2009-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Lena Blackburne]] was a [[Coach (baseball)|third-base coach]] for the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] baseball team, an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] complained to him about the method used at the time, prompting Blackburne in 1938 to set out in search of better mud to use to rub against baseballs. Later that decade, Blackburne discovered the rubbing mud's location (said to be "near" [[Palmyra, New Jersey]]) and founded the company that he used to sell it.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-10-06 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/1018/p18s02-hfks.html?s=widep |title=The dirt on baseball |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=2005-10-18 |author=Nordell, John }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the company, the entire [[American League]] used the mud soon after its discovery, and by the 1950s, it was in use by every major league team, along with some minor league and college teams.&lt;ref name=florida /&gt;

When age prevented Blackburne from harvesting the mud, he left the company to a friend, John Haas;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/10/28/baseball.mud/index.html?iref=24hours |title=Harvesting baseball's 'magic mud' |first=Thomas |last=Andres |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=October 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the company, Haas had accompanied Blackburne during his searches for an appropriate mud. Haas later left the company to his son-in-law Burns Bintliff, who in turn selected one of his nine children, current owner Jim, to carry on the business.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Jim Bintliff told [[CNN]] reporter Thomas Andres in 2009 that the company only brought in about [[United States dollar|$]]20,000 per year; at the time, he worked full-time as a printing press operator.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

==Usage==
The mud originates from the New Jersey side of the [[Delaware River]]. The mud is cleaned and screened before sale.&lt;ref name=florida /&gt; Each year Jim Bintliff visits the mud's source and returns with 1,000 pounds of it to store over the winter and sells it the following baseball season.&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt; He told Andres:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If anybody happens to catch me in the act of harvesting mud, I come up with a story to give them a reason I'm putting mud in a bucket. I've told people I use it in my garden, I use it for my rose bushes, I use it for bee stings and poison ivy and any kind of story.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before all [[Major League Baseball|major-]] and [[Minor League Baseball|minor-league baseball]] games, an umpire or clubhouse attendant rubs six dozen or more balls with the mud to give them a rougher surface, to make them easier for pitchers to grip, and to comply with MLB Rule 4.01(c), which states that all baseballs shall be "properly rubbed so that the gloss is removed." The rubbing mud's unique feature is that it is "very fine, like thick chocolate pudding",&lt;ref name=florida /&gt; and it has been considered the "perfect baseball-rubbing mud".&lt;ref name=florida&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-10-06 |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/070406/sps_3737799.shtml |title=All-American mud needed to take shine off baseballs |work=The Florida Times-Union |date=2006-07-04 |author=Schneider, Jason }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Space tyrant refugee.jpg|200px|right]]

'''''Bio of a Space Tyrant''''' series is a six-book science-fiction series by [[Piers Anthony]] based within the [[solar system]]. The series revolves around the character Hope Hubris and his family, and charts Hope's ascent from poor [[Hispanic]] refugee to Tyrant of Jupiter, a single person heading the Executive, Judicial and Legislative branches of the government. It is considerably more adult-themed than many of Anthony's earlier works.

The novels are set in a future several hundred years distant at a point where the nations of Earth have expanded into and filled the [[solar system]]. Various planets, moons and asteroids within the solar system have political, religious and geographical affiliations similar to those on 1980s Earth. Many events in the series parallel modern-day situations; for instance, [[Mars]] is controlled by the countries formerly comprising the [[Middle East]], and has the largest supply of iron, the primary fuel in Anthony's universe. [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] parallels [[Cuba]], and has a Communist government allied with North [[Saturn]]'s, which corresponds to the [[Soviet Union]]. A [[Cuban Missile Crisis|"missile crisis"]] is an event in the series; many other such correspondences abound.

The series is presented as Hope's first-person [[autobiography]], and paints his life's broad strokes from the earliest pages, including his image as a tyrant and womanizer. It is clear from the introductions and epilogues that Hope died before his memoir's publication and that his career as military man, politician, executive and statesman was greatly misunderstood by the public, especially his various affairs with women, a major focus of the series.

==Series synopsis==
;1 ''Refugee'' (1983) {{ISBN|0-7388-0693-5}}: Follows Hope and his family's flight from their home on Callisto to Jupiter. Hope's family sets out in a "space bubble" with many other refugees. The group is attacked repeatedly by space pirates, and most of the adults are raped, killed, or kidnapped by the end of the story.
;2 ''Mercenary'' (1984) {{ISBN|0-380-87221-8}}: Chronicles Hope's years as a migrant laborer and 15-year career in the Navy, largely under his sister Spirit's guidance. One of the stranger aspects of the Navy is the Tail, a militarily administered bordello all servicemen are required to use.
;3 ''Politician'' (1985) {{ISBN|0-380-89685-0}}: Hope's marriage is a major focus of the story of his political career as he ascends through Jupiter's political system, culminating in his election as President. One of his chief rivals is Tocsin, a man with some of the characteristics of [[Richard Nixon]]. The book begins with Hope held captive on a spaceship while his captors attempt to brainwash him into being a pawn of unknown adversaries; it is implied that Tocsin is involved.
;4 ''Executive'' (1985) {{ISBN|0-380-89834-9}}: Follows Hope's career as President after his widely popular election and the subsequent [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] establishing him as the eponymous space tyrant. While Jupiter's political system is a more or less exact analogue of the current U.S. system, the constitutional convention is not. On the grounds that a constitutional convention set up the current system of government (three separate branches, Executive, Judicial, and Legislative, with built-in checks and balances), it is proposed that a second convention can dissolve it. The president of the convention then appoints Hope as the single, supreme head of the government.
;5 ''Statesman'' (1986) {{ISBN|0-7388-0701-X}}: Covers Hope's waning years in exile after leaving office, especially his advocacy of a new light-speed travel method and attempts to foster unity and peace in the solar system.
;6 ''The Iron Maiden'' (2001) {{ISBN|1-4010-4396-8}}: Covers the same period as the first five books from the point of view of Hope's sister, Spirit. Fills in many gaps when the two siblings were apart.

==Solar geography==

Many of the situations in the series are direct parallels to real situations on Earth. For instance, Hope at one point is stationed on Chiron (an analogue of [[Cyprus]]) in order to keep the peace between colonists of Greek and Turkish descent; the attempt by Hope's family, Hispanic refugees from a moon of Jupiter that is analogous to [[Hispaniola]], to enter Jupiter resembles problems in the U.S. with immigration, including Hope's inability to find work as anything other than a poorly paid agricultural worker.

The solar system of Anthony's universe directly parallels the political makeup of modern Earth, as outlined in appendices in the series. Following are the many correspondences:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21611">Biomaterials exhibit various degrees of compatibility with the harsh environment within a living organism. They need to be nonreactive chemically and physically with the body, as well as integrate when deposited into tissue.&lt;ref name=biomaterial&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00680113 |title=Biomaterials for abdominal wall hernia surgery and principles of their applications |year=1994 |last1=Amid |first1=P. K. |last2=Shulman |first2=A. G. |last3=Lichtenstein |first3=I. L. |last4=Hakakha |first4=M. |journal=Langenbecks Archiv für Chirurgie |volume=379 |issue=3 |pages=168–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of compatibility varies based on the application and material required. Often modifications to the surface of a biomaterial system are required to maximize performance. The surface can be modified in many ways, including plasma modification and applying coatings to the substrate. Surface modifications can be used to affect [[surface energy]], [[adhesion]], [[biocompatibility]], chemical inertness, lubricity, [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterility]], [[asepsis]], [[Thrombosis|thrombogenicity]], susceptibility to [[corrosion]], degradation, and [[hydrophile|hydrophilicity]].

== Background of Polymer Biomaterials ==

=== Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) ===

[[polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] is a hydrophobic polymer composed of a carbon chain saturated with fluorine atoms. The fluorine-carbon bond is largely ionic, producing a strong dipole. The dipole prevents Teflon from being susceptible to [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals forces]], so other materials will not stick to the surface.&lt;ref name=teflon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/material-matters/fluorinated-hyperbranched.html |title= Fluorinated Hyperbranched Polymers |last1= Mueller |first1= Anja |year= 2006 |work= Sigma Aldrich |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teflon is commonly used to reduce friction in biomaterial applications such as in arterial grafts, catheters, and guide wire coatings.

=== Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) ===

[[File:Polyetherketon.svg|thumb|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a thermoplastic, semicrystalline polymer. The backbone consists of ether, ketone, and benzene groups]]
[[PEEK]] is a semicrystalline polymer composed of benzene, ketone, and ether groups. PEEK is known for having good physical properties including high wear resistance and low moisture absorption &lt;ref name=teflon2&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boedeker.com/peek_p.htm |title= PEEK (PolyEtherEtherKetone) Specifications |year= 2013 |work= Boedeker Plastics |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has been used for biomedical implants due to its relative inertness inside of the human body.

== Plasma modification of biomaterials ==

Plasma modification is one way to alter the surface of biomaterials to enhance their properties. During plasma modification techniques, the surface is subjected to high levels of excited gases that alter the surface of the material. Plasma's are generally generated with a [[Radio frequency|radio frequency (RF)]] field. Additional methods include applying a large (~1KV) DC voltage across electrodes engulfed in a gas. The plasma is then used to expose the biomaterial surface, which can break or form chemical bonds. This is the result of physical collisions or chemical reactions of the excited gas molecules with the surface. This changes the surface chemistry and therefore surface energy of the material which affects the adhesion, biocompatibility, chemical inertness, lubricity, and sterilization of the material. The table below shows several biomaterial applications of plasma treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Loh |first=Ih-Houng |work=AST Technical Journal |title=Plasma Surface Modification In Biomedical Applications |url=http://www.astp.com/PDFs/PSBiomed.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514091530/http://www.astp.com/PDFs/PSBiomed.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface Energy ===

The [[surface energy]] is equal to the sum of disrupted molecular bonds that occur at the interface between two different phases. Surface energy can be estimated by [[contact angle]] measurements using a version of the [[Young–Laplace equation]]:

&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{SV} - \gamma_{SL}= \gamma_{LV} cos\theta &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1021/ba-1964-0043.ch001 |chapter=Relation of the Equilibrium Contact Angle to Liquid and Solid Constitution |title=Contact Angle, Wettability, and Adhesion |series=Advances in Chemistry |year=1964 |last1=Zisman |first1=W. A. |isbn=0-8412-0044-0 |volume=43 |pages=1–51 |editor1-first=Frederick M. |editor1-last=Fowkes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{SV}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension at the interface of solid and vapor, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{SL}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension at the interface of solid and liquid, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{LV}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension at the interface of liquid and vapor. Plasma modification techniques alter the surface of the material, and subsequently the surface energy. Changes in surface energy then alter the surface properties of the material.

=== Surface Functionalization ===

[[Surface modification]] techniques have been extensively researched for the application of adsorbing biological molecules. Surface functionalization can be performed by exposing surfaces to RF plasma. Many gases can be excited and used to functionalize surfaces for a wide variety of applications. Common techniques include using air plasma, oxygen plasma, and ammonia plasma as well as other exotic gases. Each gas can have varying effects on a substrate. These effects decay with time as reactions with molecules in air and contamination occur.

==== Plasma Treatment to Reduce Thrombogenesis ====

Ammonia plasma treatment can be used to attach amine functional groups.  These functional groups lock on to anticoagulants like Heparin decreasing thrombogenicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jbm.820270614 |title=Immobilization of high-affinity heparin oligosaccharides to radiofrequency plasma-modified polyethylene |year=1993 |last1=Yuan |first1=Shengmei |last2=Szakalas-Gratzl |first2=Gyongyi |last3=Ziats |first3=Nicholas P. |last4=Jacobsen |first4=Donald W. |last5=Kottke-Marchant |first5=Kandice |last6=Marchant |first6=Roger E. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=811–9 |pmid=8408111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Covalent Immobilization by Gas Plasma RF Glow Discharge ====

[[Polysaccharide]]s have been used as [[thin film]] coatings for biomaterial surfaces. Polysaccharides are extremely hydrophilic and will have small [[contact angle]]s. They can be used for a wide range of applications due to their wide range of compositions. They can be used to reduce the [[adsorption]] of proteins to biomaterial surfaces. Additionally, they can be used as receptor sites, targeting specific biomolecules. This can be used to activate specific biological responses.

Covalent attachment to a substrate is necessary to immobilize polysaccharides, otherwise they will rapidly desorb in a biological environment. This can be a challenge due to the fact that the majority of biomaterials do not possess the surface properties to covalently attach polysaccharides. This can be achieved by the introduction of [[amine|amine groups]] by RF glow discharge plasma.  Gases used to form amine groups, including ammonia or n-heptylamine vapor, can be used to deposit a thin film coating containing surface amines. Polysaccharides must also be activated by oxidation of anhydroglucopyranoside subunits. This can be completed with sodium metaperiodate (NaIO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). This reaction converts anhydroglucopyranoside subunits to cyclic hemiacetal structures, which can be reacted with amine groups to form a Schiff base linkage (a carbon-nitrogen double bond). These linkages are unstable and will easily [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]]. Sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN) can be used as a stabilizer by reducing the linkages back to an amine.&lt;ref name=immobilization&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9918(200001)29:1&lt;46::AID-SIA692&gt;3.0.CO;2-6 |title=Biomedical coatings by the covalent immobilization of polysaccharides onto gas-plasma-activated polymer surfaces |year=2000 |last1=Dai |first1=Liming |last2=Stjohn |first2=Heather A.

=== Surface Cleaning ===

There are many examples of contamination of biomaterials that are specific to the preparation or manufacturing process. Additionally, nearly all surfaces are prone to contamination of organic impurities in the air. Contamination layers are usually limited to a monolayer or less of atoms and are thus only detectable by surface analysis techniques, such as XPS. It is unknown whether this sort of contamination is harmful, yet it is still regarded as contamination and will most certainly affect surface properties.

Glow discharge plasma treatment is a technique that is used for cleaning contamination from biomaterial surfaces. Plasma treatment has been used for various biological evaluation studies to increase the surface energy of biomaterial surfaces, as well as cleaning.&lt;ref name=RFGD&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jbm.820290411|title=Effect of parallel surface microgrooves and surface energy on cell growth |year=1995 |last1=den Braber |first1=E.T. |last2=de Ruijter |first2=J.E. |last3=Smits |first3=H.T.J |last4=Ginsel |first4=L.A. |last5=von Recum |first5=A.F. |last6=Jamsen |first6=J.A. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research |volume=29 |pages=511–518 |pmid=7622536 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma treatment has also been proposed for [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of biomaterials for potential implants.&lt;ref name=glow&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199704)35:1&lt;49::AID-JBM6&gt;3.0.CO;2-M |title=Glow discharge plasma treatment for surface cleaning and modification of metallic biomaterials |year=1997 |last1=Aronsson |first1=B.-O. |last2=Lausmaa |first2=J. |last3=Kasemo |first3=B. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research |volume=35 |pages=49–73 |pmid=9104698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modification of Biomaterials with Polymer Coatings ==

Another method of altering surface properties of biomaterials is to coat the surface. Coatings are used in many applications to improve biocompatibility and alter properties such as adsorption, lubricity, thrombogenicity, degradation, and corrosion.

=== Adhesion of Coatings ===

In general, the lower the surface tension of a liquid coating, the easier it will be to form a satisfactory wet film from it. The difference between the surface tension of a coating and the surface energy of a solid substrate to which a coating is applied affects how the liquid coating flows out over the substrate. It also affects the strength of the adhesive bond between the substrate and the dry film. If for instance, the surface tension of the coating is higher than the surface tension of the substrate, then the coating will not spread out and form a film. As the surface tension of the substrate is increased, it will reach a point to where the coating will successfully wet the substrate but have poor adhesion. Continuous increase in the coating surface tension will result in better wetting in film formation and better dry film adhesion.&lt;ref name=SurfaceTension&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pra-world.com/technical_services/laboratory/testing/surface-tension |title= Surface Tension, Surface Energy, Contact Angle and Adhesion |year= 2013 |work= Paint Research Association |accessdate= 22 May 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130109105050/http://www.pra-world.com/technical_services/laboratory/testing/surface-tension |archivedate= 9 January 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically whether a liquid coating will spread across a solid substrate can be determined from the surface energies of the involved materials by using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; S =  \gamma_{SA} + (\gamma_{CA} - \gamma_{SC}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=teflonse /&gt;

Where S is the coefficient of spreading,  &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{SA} &lt;/math&gt; is the surface energy of the substrate in air, &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{CA} &lt;/math&gt; is the surface energy of the liquid coating in air and &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{SC} &lt;/math&gt; is the interfacial energy between the coating and the substrate. If S is positive the liquid will cover the surface and the coating will adhere well. If S is negative the coating will not completely cover the surface, producing poor adhesion.

==== Corrosion Protection ====

Organic coatings are a common way to protect a metallic substrate from [[corrosion]]. Up until ~1950 it was thought that coatings act as a physical barrier which disallows moisture and oxygen to contact the metallic substrate and form a corrosion cell. This cannot be the case because the [[Permeation|permeability]] of paint films is very high. It has since been discovered that corrosion protection of steel depends greatly upon the adhesion of a noncorrosive coating when in the presence of water. With low adhesion, osmotic cells form underneath the coating with high enough pressures to form blisters, which expose more unprotected steel. Additional non-osmotic mechanisms have also been proposed. In either case, sufficient adhesion to resist displacement forces is required for corrosion protection.&lt;ref name=CoatingsBook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Z.W. Wicks |author2=Frank N. Jones |author3=S Peter Pappas |author4=Douglas A. Wicks | title = Organic Coatings Science and Technology | edition = 2nd expanded | location = New Jersey | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] }}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guide Wires ===

Guide wires are an example of an application for biomedical coatings. Guide wires are used in [[percutaneous coronary intervention|coronary angioplasty]] to correct the effects of [[coronary artery disease]], a disease that allows plaque build up on the walls of the arteries. The guide wire is threaded up through the femoral artery to the obstruction. The guide wire guides the balloon catheter to the obstruction where the catheter is inflated to press the plaque against the arterial walls.&lt;ref name=angioplasty&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/anatomyvideos/000096.htm |title= Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) |last1= Gandelman |first1= Glenn |date= March 22, 2013 |work= Medline Plus |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guide wires are commonly made from stainless steel or [[Nickel Titanium|Nitinol]] and require polymer coatings as a surface modification to reduce friction in the arteries. The coating of the guide wire can affect the trackability, or the ability of the wire to move through the artery without kinking, the tactile feel, or the ability of the doctor to feel the guide wire's movements, and the thrombogenicity of the wire.

==== Hydrophilic Coatings ====

Hydrophilic coatings can reduce friction in the arteries by up to 83% when compared to bare wires due to their high surface energy.&lt;ref name=friction&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8485751 |year=1993 |last1=Schröder |first1=J |title=The mechanical properties of guidewires. Part III: Sliding friction |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=93–7 |journal=Cardiovascular and interventional radiology |doi=10.1007/BF02602986}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the hydrophilic coatings come into contact with bodily fluids they form a waxy surface texture that allows the wire to slide easily through the arteries. Guide wires with hydrophilic coatings have increased trackability and are not very thrombogenic; however the low coefficient of friction increases the risk of the wire slipping and perforating the artery.&lt;ref name=techniques&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andrejs |last1=Erglis |first2=Inga |last2=Narbute |first3=Dace |last3=Sondore |first4=Alona |last4=Grave |first5=Sanda |last5=Jegere |title=Tools &amp; Techniques: coronary guidewires  |journal=EuroIntervention |url=http://www.pcronline.com/eurointervention/tools-and-techniques/coronary-guidewires/download_pdf.php |pmid=20542813 |year=2010 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=168–9 |doi=10.4244/eijv6i1a24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hydrophobic Coatings ====

Teflon and [[Silicone]] are commonly used [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] coatings for coronary guide wires. Hydrophobic coatings have a lower surface energy and reduce friction in the arteries by up to 48%.&lt;ref name=friction/&gt;  Hydrophobic coatings do not need to be in contact with fluids to form a slippery texture. Hydrophobic coatings maintain tactile sensation in the artery, giving doctors full control of the wire at all times and reducing the risk of perforation; though, the coatings are more thrombogenic than hydrophilic coatings.&lt;ref name=techniques/&gt; The thrombogenicity is due to the proteins in the blood adapting to the hydrophobic environment when they adhere to the coating. This causes an irreversible change for the protein, and the protein remains stuck to the coating allowing for a blood clot to form.&lt;ref name=thrombo&gt;{{cite journal |first=Denis |last=Labarre |title=Improving blood compatibility of polymeric surfaces |journal=Trends in Biomaterials &amp; Artificial Organs |year=2001 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |url=http://www.biomaterials.org.in/ojs/index.php/tibao/article/view/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Magnetic Resonance Compatible Guide Wires ====

Using an [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] to image the guide wire during use would have an advantage over using x-rays because the surrounding tissue can be examined while the guide wire is advanced. Because most guide wires' core materials are stainless steel they are not capable of being imaged with an MRI. Nitinol wires are not magnetic and could potentially be imaged, but in practice the conductive nitinol heats up under the magnetic radiation which would damage surrounding tissues. An alternative that is being examined is to replace contemporary guide wires with PEEK cores, coated with iron particle embedded synthetic polymers.&lt;ref name=MRI&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jmri.20486 |title=A polymer-based MR-compatible guidewire: A study to explore new prospects for interventional peripheral magnetic resonance angiography (ipMRA) |year=2006 |last1=Mekle |first1=Ralf |last2=Hofmann |first2=Eugen |last3=Scheffler |first3=Klaus |last4=Bilecen |first4=Deniz |journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=145–55 |pmid=16374877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biosafety level''' is a set of [[biocontainment]] precautions required to isolate dangerous [[biological agent]]s in an enclosed laboratory facility. The levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) to the highest at level 4 (BSL-4). In the [[United States]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) have specified these levels.&lt;ref name=BMBL&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Richmond JY, McKinney RW | title = Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories | edition = 4th | publisher =  | year = 1999 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bmbl4/bmbl4toc.htm | isbn = 0-7881-8513-6 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110806163803/https://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bmbl4/bmbl4toc.htm | archivedate = 2011-08-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Union]], the same biosafety levels are defined in a [[European Union directive|directive]].&lt;ref&gt;Council Directive 90/679/EEC of 26 November 1990 on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work, OJ No. L 374, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]] the four levels are known as Containment Levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/canadian-biosafety-standards-guidelines/laboratory-biosafety-guidelines-3rd-edition-2004/chapter-2.html|title=Chapter 2: The Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines: 3rd Edition 2004 – Biological safety - Canada.ca|first=Public Health Agency of|last=Canada|date=|website=www.canada.ca|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223235144/https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/canadian-biosafety-standards-guidelines/laboratory-biosafety-guidelines-3rd-edition-2004/chapter-2.html|archivedate=23 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facilities with these designations are also sometimes given as P1 through P4 (for Pathogen or Protection level), as in the term "P3 laboratory".

At the lowest level of biosafety, precautions may consist of regular hand-washing and minimal protective equipment. At higher biosafety levels, precautions may include airflow systems, multiple containment rooms, sealed containers, [[positive pressure personnel suit]]s, established protocols for all procedures, extensive personnel training, and high levels of security to control access to the facility.

== History ==
The first prototype Class III (maximum containment) [[biosafety cabinet]] was fashioned in 1943 by Hubert Kaempf Jr., then a U.S. Army soldier, under the direction of Dr. Arnold G. Wedum, Director (1944–69) of Industrial Health and Safety at the [[United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories]], [[Camp Detrick]], [[Maryland]]. Kaempf was tired of his [[military police|MP]] duties at Detrick and was able to transfer to the sheet metal department working with the contractor, the H.K. Ferguson Co.&lt;ref&gt;Covt, Norman M. (1997), [http://www.detrick.army.mil/cutting_edge/index.cfm “A History of Fort Detrick, Maryland”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922133111/http://www.detrick.army.mil/cutting_edge/index.cfm |date=2008-09-22 }}, 3rd edition. Kaempf retired from Fort Detrick in 1994, having completed more than 50 years service. He was chief of the mechanical branch, Directorate of Engineering and Housing.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 April 1955, fourteen representatives met at Camp Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. The meeting was to share knowledge and experiences regarding [[biosafety]], chemical, radiological, and industrial safety issues that were common to the operations at the three principal biological warfare (BW) laboratories of the U.S. Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absa.org/abohist1.html|title=A History of the American Biological Safety Association|accessdate=2008-08-14|author=Manuel S.

Beginning in 1957, these conferences were planned to include non-classified sessions as well as classified sessions to enable broader sharing of biological safety information. It was not until 1964, however, that conferences were held in a government installation not associated with a biological warfare program.&lt;ref name="USDA-ABSA"&gt;{{cite web| url       =http://riley.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=8&amp;tax_level=4&amp;tax_subject=158&amp;topic_id=1982&amp;level3_id=6419&amp;level4_id=10967&amp;level5_id=0&amp;placement_default=0&amp;test| title       =American Biological Safety Association Collection : NAL Collections : National Agricultural Library| accessdate       =2009-02-11| author       =| last       =| first       =| authorlink       =| date       =2009-02-11| format       =| work       =| publisher       =United States Department of Agriculture: National Agricultural Library| location       =| pages       =| language       =| doi       =| map-format       =| quote       =| deadurl       =no| archiveurl       =https://web.archive.org/web/20090227023644/http://riley.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=8&amp;tax_level=4&amp;tax_subject=158&amp;topic_id=1982&amp;level3_id=6419&amp;level4_id=10967&amp;level5_id=0&amp;placement_default=0&amp;test| archivedate       =2009-02-27| df       =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next ten years, the biological safety conferences grew to include representatives from all federal agencies that sponsored or conducted research with pathogenic microorganisms. By 1966 it began to include representatives from universities, private laboratories, hospitals, and industrial complexes. Throughout the 1970s, participation in the conferences continued to expand and by 1983 discussions began regarding the creation of a formal organization.&lt;ref name="USDA-ABSA" /&gt; The [[American Biological Safety Association]] (ABSA) was officially established in 1984 and a constitution and bylaws were drafted the same year. As of 2008, ABSA includes some 1,600 members in its professional association.&lt;ref name="USDA-ABSA" /&gt;

== Levels ==

=== Biosafety level 1 ===

Biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) is suitable for work with well-characterized agents which do not cause disease in healthy humans. In general, these agents should pose minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety&gt;{{cite book |title=Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th ed. |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=December 2009 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/BMBL.pdf |section=Section IV-Laboratory Biosafety Level Criteria |accessdate=2 April 2016 |pages=30–59 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409233223/http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/BMBL.pdf |archivedate=9 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this level, precautions are limited relative to other levels. Laboratory personnel must wash their hands upon entering and exiting the lab. Research with these agents may be performed on standard open laboratory benches without the use of special containment equipment. However, eating and drinking are generally prohibited in laboratory areas.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; Potentially infectious material must be decontaminated before disposal, either by adding an appropriate disinfectant, or by packaging for decontamination elsewhere.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; Personal protective equipment is only required for circumstances where personnel might be exposed to hazardous material.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; BSL-1 laboratories must have a door which can be locked to limit access to the lab, however it is not necessary for BSL-1 labs to be isolated from the general building.&lt;ref name=richmond/&gt;

This level of biosafety is appropriate for work with several kinds of microorganisms including non-pathogenic ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and other organisms not suspected to contribute to human disease.&lt;ref name=ColumbiaEHS&gt;{{cite web |title=Health &amp; Safety Manual - Biological Safety |publisher=Columbia University Environmental Health and Safety |url=http://ehs.columbia.edu/Policy2.2.html |accessdate=2 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327090557/http://ehs.columbia.edu/Policy2.2.html |archivedate=27 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the relative ease and safety of maintaining a BSL-1 laboratory, these are the types of laboratories generally used as teaching spaces for [[Secondary school|high schools]] and [[University|colleges]].&lt;ref name=richmond&gt;{{cite web |title=The 1, 2, 3's of Biosafety Levels |author=Richmond JY |url=http://www.aphl.org/aphlprograms/preparedness-and-response/Smallpox/pdf/the-1-2-3s-of-biosafety-levels.pdf |accessdate=2 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319062105/http://www.aphl.org/aphlprograms/preparedness-and-response/Smallpox/pdf/the-1-2-3s-of-biosafety-levels.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biosafety level 2 ===

At this level, all precautions used at Biosafety Level 1 are followed, and some additional precautions are taken. BSL-2 differs from BSL-1 in that:
* Laboratory personnel have specific training in handling pathogenic agents and are directed by scientists with advanced training.
* Access to the laboratory is limited when work is being conducted.
* Extreme precautions are taken with contaminated sharp items.
* Certain procedures in which infectious aerosols or splashes may be created are conducted in [[Biosafety cabinet|biological safety cabinet]]s or other physical containment equipment.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt;

Biosafety level 2 is suitable for work involving agents of moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment.&lt;ref name=richmond/&gt; This includes various microbes that cause mild disease to humans, or are difficult to contract via [[aerosol]] in a lab setting.&lt;ref name=BMBLSec3&gt;{{cite book |title=Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th ed. |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=December 2009 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/bmbl5_sect_iii.pdf |section=Section III-Principles of Biosafety |accessdate=9 April 2016 |pages=22–28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310185023/http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/bmbl5_sect_iii.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Hepatitis [[Hepatitis A|A]], [[Hepatitis B|B]], and [[Hepatitis C|C]] viruses, [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), pathogenic ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', and ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''.&lt;ref name=BMBLSec3/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMBLRecs&gt;For a list of infectious agents and the recommended biosafety level at which they should be studied, see {{cite book |title=Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th ed. |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=December 2009 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/bmbl5_sect_viii.pdf |section=Section VIII-Agent Summary Statements |accessdate=9 April 2016 |pages=123–289 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327214745/http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/bmbl5_sect_viii.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biosafety level 3 ===
[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|Researcher at US Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, working with influenza virus under biosafety level 3 conditions, with [[Powered air-purifying respirator|respirator]] inside a biosafety cabinet ([[biological safety cabinet|BSC]]).]]

Biosafety level 3 is appropriate for work involving microbes which can cause serious and potentially lethal disease via the inhalation route.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; This type of work can be done in clinical, diagnostic, teaching, research, or production facilities.&lt;ref name=richmond/&gt; Here, the precautions undertaken in BSL-1 and BSL-2 labs are followed, as well as additional measures including:
*All laboratory personnel are provided medical surveillance and offered relevant immunizations (where available) to reduce the risk of an accidental or unnoticed infection.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt;
*All procedures involving infectious material must be done within a [[Biosafety cabinet|biological safety cabinet]].&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt;
*Laboratory personnel must wear solid-front protective clothing (i.e. gowns that tie in the back). This cannot be worn outside of the laboratory and must be discarded or decontaminated after each use.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt;
*A laboratory-specific biosafety manual must be drafted which details how the laboratory will operate in compliance with all safety requirements.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt;

In addition, the facility which houses the BSL-3 laboratory must have certain features to ensure appropriate containment. The entrance to the laboratory must be separated from areas of the building with unrestricted traffic flow.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; Additionally, the laboratory must be behind two sets of self-closing doors (to reduce the risk of aerosols escaping).&lt;ref name=richmond/&gt; The construction of the laboratory is such that it can be easily cleaned. Carpets are not permitted, and any seams in the floors, walls, and ceilings are sealed to allow for easy cleaning and decontamination.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; Additionally, windows must be sealed, and a ventilation system installed which forces air to flow from the "clean" areas of the lab to the areas where infectious agents are handled.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; Air from the laboratory must be filtered before it can be recirculated.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt;

Biosafety level 3 is commonly used for research and diagnostic work involving various microbes which can be transmitted by aerosols and/or cause severe disease. These include ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', ''[[Chlamydia psittaci]]'', [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]], [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]], [[SARS coronavirus]], ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', [[Rift Valley fever virus]], ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]'', several species of ''[[Brucella]]'', [[chikungunya]], [[yellow fever virus]], and [[West Nile virus]].&lt;ref name=BMBLRecs/&gt;

=== Biosafety level 4{{anchor|Level 4}} ===
[[Image:Galveston National Laboratory at UTMB.jpg|thumb|The [[Galveston National Laboratory]] BSL-4 lab on the Campus of the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]]]]

Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) is the highest level of biosafety precautions, and is appropriate for work with agents that could easily be aerosol-transmitted within the laboratory and cause severe to fatal disease in humans for which there are no available vaccines or treatments.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; BSL-4 laboratories are generally set up to be either cabinet laboratories or protective-suit laboratories.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; In cabinet laboratories, all work must be done within a [[Biosafety cabinet#Class III|class III biosafety cabinet]].&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; Materials leaving the cabinet must be decontaminated by passing through an [[autoclave]] or a tank of disinfectant.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; The cabinets themselves are required to have seamless edges to allow for easy cleaning. Additionally the cabinet and all materials within must be free of sharp edges in order to reduce the risk of damage to the gloves.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; In a protective-suit laboratory, all work must be done in a [[Biosafety cabinet#Class II|class II biosafety cabinet]] by personnel wearing a [[positive pressure personnel suit|positive pressure suit]].&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; In order to exit the BSL-4 laboratory, personnel must pass through a chemical shower for decontamination, then a room for removing the positive-pressure suit, followed by a personal shower.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; Entry into the BSL-4 laboratory is restricted to trained and authorized individuals, and all persons entering and exiting the laboratory must be recorded.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt;

As with BSL-3 laboratories, BSL-4 laboratories must be separated from areas that receive unrestricted traffic. Additionally airflow is tightly controlled to ensure that air always flows from "clean" areas of the lab to areas where work with infectious agents is being performed.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt; The entrance to the BSL-4 lab must also employ [[airlock]]s to minimize the possibility that aerosols from the lab could be removed from the lab. All laboratory waste, including filtered air, water, and trash must also be decontaminated before it can leave the facility.&lt;ref name=CDCBiosafety/&gt;

Biosafety level 4 laboratories are used for diagnostic work and research on easily transmitted pathogens which can cause fatal disease. These include a number of viruses known to cause [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] such as [[Marburg virus]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Lassa virus]], [[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever]]. Other pathogens handled at BSL-4 include [[Hendra virus]], [[Nipah virus]], and some [[Flavivirus]]es. Additionally, poorly characterized pathogens which appear closely related to dangerous pathogens are often handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or to work with them at a lower level.&lt;ref name=BMBLRecs/&gt; This level is also used for work with [[Variola virus]], the causative agent of [[smallpox]], though this work can only be done at the [[World Health Organization]] approved facilities at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in Atlanta, United States, as well as the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology]] in Koltsovo, Russia.&lt;ref name=BMBLSmallpox&gt;{{cite book |title=Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th ed. |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=December 2009 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/bmbl5_sect_viii.pdf |section=Section VIII-Agent Summary Statements |page=219 |accessdate=4 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513215241/http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/bmbl5_sect_viii.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====BSL-4 facilities for extraterrestrial samples====

{{main|Extraterrestrial sample curation}}
[[Sample-return mission]]s that bring back to Earth samples obtained from a [[Planetary protection#Category V|Category V]] body, must be curated at facilities rated BSL-4. Because the existing BSL-4 facilities in the world do not have the complex requirements to ensure the preservation and protection of Earth and the sample simultaneously,&lt;ref name='Hsu 2009'&gt;[https://www.space.com/7625-protect-mars-samples-earth.html How to Protect Mars Samples on Earth]. Jeremy Hsu, ''Space.com''. 3 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; there are currently at least two proposals to build a BSL-4 facility dedicated to curation of restricted (potentially [[biohazard]]) extraterrestrial materials. 

The first is the [[European Sample Curation Facility]] (ESCF),&lt;ref name='ESCF 2017'&gt;[https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/bitstream/handle/2346/73091/ICES_2017_323.pdf EURO EURO-CARES Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Facility: Architecture as an enabler of science].

==Safety concerns==
A North Carolina Mosquito &amp; Vector Control Association (NCMVCA) study highlighted safety concerns. In the United States, laboratories can be funded by federal, state, private, non-profit, or academically. The last accounts for 72% of the funding. There is no central monitoring agency accountable for monitoring laboratories and standards vary according to funding, the age of the laboratory, and is dependent on the size and whether it is SA approved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncmvca.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/12andersonlab.pdf NCMVCA study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131192531/http://www.ncmvca.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/12andersonlab.pdf |date=2017-01-31 }}- Retrieved 2017-01-19&lt;/ref&gt;

High-containment labs that are registered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Select Agent Program must adhere to Department of Defense standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/605518m.pdf DoD Safety Standards for Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125204212/http://dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/605518m.pdf |date=2017-01-25 }}- Retrieved 2017-01-19&lt;/ref&gt; No single federal agency, according to 12 agencies' responses to a GSA survey, has the mission to track the overall number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs in the United States. This means no agency is responsible for determining the risks associated with the proliferation of these labs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-108T GAO publication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120224803/http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-08-108T |date=2017-01-20 }}- Retrieved 2017-01-19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blanca Peak''' is the [[List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains#Highest prominent summits|fourth highest summit]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[North America]] and the [[U.S. state]] of [[Colorado]].  The [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent]] {{convert|14351|ft|m|0|adj=on}} peak is the [[List of mountain ranges of Colorado#Mountain ranges|highest summit]] of the Sierra Blanca Massif, the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]], and the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]].  The [[fourteener]] is located {{convert|15.5|km|order=flip}} north by east ([[Absolute bearing|bearing]] 9°) of the [[Blanca, Colorado|Town of Blanca]], on the [[drainage divide]] separating [[Rio Grande National Forest]] and [[Alamosa County, Colorado|Alamosa County]] from the [[Sangre de Cristo Land Grant]] and [[Costilla County, Colorado|Costilla County]].  The summit is the [[List of Colorado county high points|highest point]] of both counties and the entire [[drainage basin]] of the [[Rio Grande]]. Below the steep North Face of Blanca Peak two live Glaciers once developed, until extinction sometime after 1903.  North &amp; South Blanca Glaciers were located at 37° 35N.,longitude 105° 28W. Blanca Peak is higher than any point in the [[United States]] east of its [[longitude]].&lt;ref name=NAVD88&gt;The elevation of Blanca Peak includes an adjustment of +1.754&amp;nbsp;m (+5.75&amp;nbsp;ft) from [[Sea Level Datum of 1929|NGVD&amp;nbsp;29]] to [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD&amp;nbsp;88]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PB/&gt;&lt;ref name=GNIS/&gt;

The '''Blanca Peak Tripoint''' of [[Alamosa County, Colorado|Alamosa]], [[Costilla County, Colorado|Costilla]], and [[Huerfano County, Colorado|Huerfano counties]] is located on the same [[drainage divide]] approximately {{convert|251|ft|0}} northeast by north ([[Absolute bearing|bearing]] 30°) of the Blanca Peak summit at the boundary of the [[San Isabel National Forest]].  The Blanca Peak Tripoint is the [[List of Colorado county high points|highest point]] in Huerfano County.&lt;ref name=PB2/&gt;

==Geography==
Blanca Peak is located at the southern end of the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]], a subrange of the more extensive [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]], and is the highest peak in both ranges.  It lies approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} [[east-northeast]] of the town of [[Alamosa, Colorado|Alamosa]]. Approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} to the north-northwest is [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]].

Blanca Peak is notable not only for its absolute height, but also for its great local relief and dominant position at the end of the range, rising high above the [[San Luis Valley]] to the west. For example, it rises nearly {{convert|7000|ft|m}} over the edge of the San Luis Valley in only {{convert|6|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="topozone"&gt;[http://www.topoquest.com/map.asp?lat=37.5772&amp;lon=-105.4853&amp;s=200&amp;size=l&amp;u=4&amp;datum=nad27&amp;layer=DRG Blanca Peak on TopoQuest]&lt;/ref&gt;
Blanca is also the third most [[topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] peak in Colorado; it is separated from the higher peaks in the [[Sawatch Range]] by relatively low [[Poncha Pass]] at {{convert|9019|ft|m}}.

Blanca Peak heads up three major creeks. Holbrook Creek is on the west, flowing from a basin including Crater Lake, Blue Lakes, and Como Lake. An extremely challenging [[four wheel drive]] road accesses Como Lake {{convert|11750|ft|m}}, and provides the most common access to Blanca Peak. Most vehicles stop at an elevation of between {{convert|8000|ft|m}} and {{convert|10000|ft|m}} on this road. The Como Lake Road is a designated Alamosa County Road and runs to the edge of the [[Sangre de Cristo Wilderness]] just short of Blue Lakes. The Como Lake Road is rated as the most challenging 4WD road in Colorado. The [[Huerfano River]] flows from the north side of Blanca Peak. A road, starting out as a two-wheel drive road, then becoming a four-wheel drive road (less challenging than the Como Lake Road), provides access to the [[rock climbing|technical climbing]] on the North Face of Blanca Peak. Blanca Creek drains Blanca Basin under the south slopes of the peak, and Little Ute Creek descends from the Winchell Lakes on the southeast side. However these are not used to access the peak due to private property.

Three other fourteeners are nearby: [[Mount Lindsey]] to the east, [[Ellingwood Point]] to the north and [[Little Bear Peak]] to the southwest. Ellingwood Point is connected to Blanca by a short, high ridge, and is often climbed in conjunction with Blanca. Little Bear also has a high connecting ridge to Blanca, but it is a [[rock climbing|technical]] traverse, only recommended for highly experienced parties.&lt;ref name="dawson"&gt;Louis W. Dawson II, ''Dawson's Guide to Colorado's Fourteeners, Volume 2'', Blue Clover Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-9628867-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The granite that makes up the Blanca massif is [[pre-Cambrian]] in age, dated at approximately 1.8 billion years old. The major part of the [[Wet Mountains]] to the east and the [[Front Range]] to the northeast are also pre-Cambrian, also about 1.8 billion years old. In contrast, the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the north and the [[Culebra Range]] to the south are [[Permian]] rock between 250 and 300 million years old.

==History==
Blanca Peak is known to the [[Navajo people]] as the Sacred Mountain of the East: ''{{spell-nv|Sisnaajiní}}''&lt;ref name="mcpherson"&gt;Robert S. McPherson, ''Sacred Land, Sacred View: Navajo perceptions of the Four Corners Region'', [[Brigham Young University]], {{ISBN|1-56085-008-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (or ''Tsisnaasjiní''&lt;ref name="sacred"&gt;[http://www.lapahie.com/Sacred_Mts.cfm Lapahie.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814180907/http://www.lapahie.com/Sacred_Mts.cfm |date=August 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), the Dawn or White Shell Mountain. The mountain is considered to be the eastern boundary of the [[Dinetah]], the traditional Navajo homeland. It is associated with the color white, and is said to be covered in daylight and dawn and fastened to the ground with lightning. It is gendered male.&lt;ref name="mcpherson"/&gt;

Summitpost notes that "the first recorded ascent of Blanca by the [[Wheeler Survey]] was recorded on August 14, 1874, but to their surprise they found evidence of a stone structure possibly built by [[Ute Tribe|Ute Indians]] or wandering [[New Spain|Spaniards]]."&lt;ref name="summitpost"&gt;{{cite summitpost |id=150450 |name=Blanca Peak on Summitpost |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy)''' is a [[Comet#Long period|long-period]] [[comet]] discovered on 17 August 2014 by [[Terry Lovejoy]] using a {{convert|0.2|m|in|0|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-Q10"/&gt; It was discovered at [[apparent magnitude]] 15 in the southern [[constellation]] of [[Puppis]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2014-Q10"/&gt; It is the fifth comet discovered by Terry Lovejoy. Its blue-green glow is the result of organic molecules and water released by the comet fluorescing under the intense UV and optical light of the Sun as it passes through space.&lt;ref name="Biver2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate20150103"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/01/03/comet_lovejoy_stunning_photo_by_gerald_rhemann.html |title=Comet Lovejoy, Because Holy Wow |series=Bad Astronomy |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]] |first=Phil |last=Plait |date=3 January 2015 |accessdate=24 October 2015|authorlink=Phil Plait}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
By December 2014, the comet had brightened to roughly magnitude 7.4,&lt;ref name="Yoshida141207"/&gt; making it a small telescope and [[binoculars]] target.

'''Cats in ancient Egypt''' were represented in social and religious practices of [[Ancient Egypt]] for more than 30 centuries. Several [[Ancient Egyptian deities]] were depicted and sculptured with [[cat]]-like heads such as [[Mafdet]], [[Bastet]] and [[Sekhmet]], representing justice, fertility and power.&lt;ref name=Malek1997&gt;{{cite book |title=The cat in ancient Egypt |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |last=Malek |first=J. |date=1997 |location=Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The deity [[Mut]] was also depicted as a cat and in the company of a cat.&lt;ref name=Velde1982&gt;{{cite book |last=Te Velde |first=H. |chapter=The cat as sacred animal of the goddess Mut |title=Studies in Egyptian Religion dedicated to Professor Jan Zandee |publisher=Brill |date=1982 |location=Leiden |pages=127−137 |isbn=978-90-04-37862-9 |editor1-last=Van Voss |editor1-first=H. |editor2-last=Hoens |editor2-first=D.

Cats were praised for killing [[poisonous snake]]s and protecting the [[Pharaoh]] since at least the [[First Dynasty of Egypt]]. Skeletal remains of cats were found among funerary goods dating to the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]]. The protective function of cats is indicated in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', where a cat represents [[Ra]] and the benefits of the sun for life on Earth. Cat-shaped decorations used during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] indicate that the cat cult became more popular in daily life. Cats were depicted in association with the name of Bastet.&lt;ref name=Langton&gt;{{cite book |title=The cat in ancient Egypt, illustrated from the collection of cat and other Egyptian figures formed |publisher=Cambridge University Press |last1=Langton |first1=N. |last2=Langton |first2=M. B. |date=1940 |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1880s, more than 200,000 [[mummified]] animals, most of them cats, were found in the cemetery of [[Beni Hasan]] in central Egypt.&lt;ref name=Herdman&gt;{{cite journal |title=Notes on some mummy cats , &amp;co., from Egypt |last=Herdman |first=W.

Among the mummified animals [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] in [[Gizeh]], the [[African wildcat]] (''Felis lybica'') is the most common cat followed by the [[jungle cat]] (''Felis chaus'').&lt;ref name=Morrison-Scott1952&gt;{{cite journal |title=The mummified cats of ancient Egypt |last=Morrison-Scott |first=T.

In view of the huge number of cat mummies found in Egypt, the cat cult was certainly important for the country's economy, as it required breeding of cats and a trading network for the supply of food, oils and [[resin]]s for [[embalming]] them.&lt;ref name=Ikram2015&gt;{{cite book |title=Apprivoiser le sauvage / Taming the Wild |publisher=Cahiers de l’Égypte Nilotique et Méditerranéenne 11 |last=Ikram |first=S. |date=2015 |location=Montpellier |pages=211–228 |chapter=Speculations on the role of animal cults in the economy of Ancient Egypt |editor1-last=Massiera |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Mathieu |editor2-first=B. |editor3-last=Rouffet |editor3-first=F. |chapter-url= https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42893594/Ikram_2015_Role_of_Animal_Cults_Ancient_Egypt_Economy.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1539507437&amp;Signature=goJHqDCiFleYVqkd3mWT0cdlRDw%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D2015._Speculations_on_the_Role_of_Animal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mafdet was the first known cat-headed deity in ancient Egypt. During the First Dynasty 2920–2770 BC, she was regarded as protector of the Pharaoh's chambers against snakes, [[scorpion]]s and evil. She was often also depicted with a head of a [[leopard]] (''Panthera pardus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Divine Cat and the Snake in Egypt |last=Hornblower |first=G. D. |journal=Man |date=1943 |issue=43 |pages=85−87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Die Pantherkatze Mafdet |last=Westendorf |first=W. |journal=Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft |date=1968 |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=248−256}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was in particular prominent during the reign of [[Den (pharaoh)|Den]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Netjerikhet Stela and the Early Dynastic Cult of Ra |last=Reader |first=C. |journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology |date=2014 |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=421−435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deity [[Bastet]] is known from at least the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]] 2890 BC onwards. At the time, she was depicted with a [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'') head. Seals and stone vessels with her name were found in the tombs of the pharaohs [[Khafra]] and [[Nyuserre Ini]], indicating that she was regarded as protector since the mid 30th century BC during the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth]] and [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasties]].&lt;ref name=Raffaele2005&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raffaele |first=F. |title=An unpublished Early Dynastic stone vessel fragment with incised inscription naming the goddess Bastet |journal=Cahiers Caribéens d’Egyptologie |date=2005 |issue=7e8 |page=27e60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A wall painting in the Fifth Dynasty’s burial ground at [[Saqqara]] shows a small cat with a collar, suggesting that tamed [[African wildcat]]s were kept in the pharaonic quarters by the 26th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boettger |first=C. R. |date=1958 |title=Die Haustiere Afrikas: ihre Herkunft, Bedeutung und Aussichten bei der weiteren wirtschaftlichen Erschliessung des Kontinents |publisher=VEB Gustav Fischer Verlag |location=Jena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amulets with cat heads came into fashion during the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|11th Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Langton/&gt;

[[Flinders Petrie]] excavated 17 cat skeletons in a tomb at the [[necropolis]] [[Umm El Qa'ab]] dating to the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]] 1991–1783 BC. Next to the skeletons stood small pots that are thought to have contained milk for the cats.&lt;ref name=Velde1982/&gt;

From the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|22nd Dynasty]] at around the mid 950s BC onwards, the deity Bastet and her temple in the city of [[Bubastis]] became popular. She is now shown only with a [[Felis|small cat]] head.&lt;ref name=Malek1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Raffaele2005/&gt;
During the reign of Pharaoh [[Osorkon II]] in the 9th century BC, the temple of Bastet was enlarged by a festival hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bakr |first1=M.

I. |editor2-last=Brandl |editor2-first=H. |editor3-last=Kalloniatis |editor3-first=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cat statues and statuettes from this period exist in diverse sizes and materials, including solid and [[Permanent mold casting|hollow cast]] [[bronze]], [[alabaster]] and [[faïence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schorsch, D. |date=1988 |title=Conservation of Ancient Egyptian Materials, preprints of the conference organised by the United Kingdom Institute for Conservation, Archaeology Section, held at Bristol, December 15-16 |publisher=UKIC Archaeology Section |location=London |pages=41−50 |chapter=Technological Examinations of Ancient Egyptian Theriomorphic Hollow Cast Bronzes – Some Case Studies |editor1-last=Watkins |editor1-first=S.

By the end of the 10th century BC, [[Domestication of animals|domestic]] cats became popular. When they died, they were embalmed, coffined and buried in cat cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Notes and speculations on the domestication of the cat in Egypt |last=Baldwin |first=J. A. |journal=Anthropos |date=1975 |issue=3/4 |pages=428−448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The domestic cat (''Felis catus'') was regarded as living [[incarnation]] of Bastet who protects the household against [[granivore]]s, and the lion-headed deity Sekhmet was worshipped as protector of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Engels |first=D. W. |date=2001 |title=Classical Cats. The Rise and Fall of the Sacred Cat |publisher=Routledge |location=London / New York |isbn=0415261627}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mummifying animals grew in popularity during the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]] from 664 BC onwards. Mummies were used for [[votive offering]]s to the associated deity, mostly during festivals or by [[pilgrim]]s.&lt;ref name=Ikram2015/&gt; [[Catacomb]]s from the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] period in the Bubastis, Saqqara and [[Beni Hasan]] necropoli were reused as cemeteries for mummies offered to Bastet.&lt;ref name=Zivie2005/&gt;

As described by [[Diodorus Siculus]], killing a cat was regarded a serious crime. In the years between 60 and 56 BC, outraged people [[Lynching|lynched]] a Roman for killing a cat, although pharaoh [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]] tried to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Diodorus Siculus, Book 1: A Commentary |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |chapter=Chapter 4 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXiMtMnPHikC&amp;pg=PA39 |pages=38−42 |first=A. |last=Burton |date=1973 |isbn=978-9004035140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats and religion began to be disassociated from 30 [[Anno Domini|AD]] onwards, when Egypt became a [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman province]].&lt;ref name=Malek1997/&gt; A series of decrees and edicts issued by [[Roman Emperors]] in the 4th and 5th centuries AD gradually curtailed the practise of [[paganism]] and pagan rituals in Egypt. Pagan temples were impounded and sacrifices prohibited by 380 AD. Three edicts issued between 391 and 392 prohibited pagan rituals and burial ceremonies at all cult sites. Death penalty for offenders was introduced in 395, and destruction of pagan temples decreed in 399. By 415, the [[Christian church]] received all property that was formerly dedicated to paganism. Pagans were exiled by 423, and crosses replaced pagan symbols following a decree from 435.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tomorad |first=M. |title=The end of Ancient Egyptian religion: The prohibition of paganism in Egypt from the middle of the 4th to the middle of the 6th century A.D. |journal=The Journal of Egyptological Studies |date=2015 |volume=IV |pages=147−167 |url= https://egyptology-bg.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/egyptology-bg.org-JES4-pt9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt has since experienced a decline in the respect once held for cats; they are still kept as pets and tolerated outside the home because they catch pests. However, the cat has not lost all religious significance among modern Egypt's largely Islamic population, since cats are also [[Cats and Islam|revered to some extent in Muslim tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/040.sbt.html |work=Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 40 |title=Distribution of Water |via=University of Souther California Center for Muslim–Jewish Engagement |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110309200330/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/040.sbt.html |archive-date=9 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=3207|title=Cats and Islam |work=The Muslim Observer |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120711002321/http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=3207 |archive-date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations==
In 1890, [[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|William Martin Conway]] wrote about [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s in [[Speos Artemidos]] near [[Beni Hasan]]: "The plundering of the cemetery was a sight to see, but one had to stand well windward. The village children came from day to day and provided themselves with the most attractive mummies they could find. These they took down the river bank to sell for the smallest coin to passing travelers. The path became strewn with mummy cloth and bits of cats' skulls and bones and fur in horrid positions, and the wind blew the fragments about and carried the stink afar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Conway |first=M. |date=1890 |title=The Cats of Ancient Egypt |journal=English Illustrated Magazine |volume=7 |pages=251−254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Conway |first=M. |date=1891 |title=The Dawn of Art in the Ancient World: An Archaeological Sketch |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |location=New York |chapter=Chapter VII. The Cats of Ancient Egypt |pages=172−185 |chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/dawnartinancien01conwgoog/page/n187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1890, a shipment of thousands of animal mummies reached Liverpool. Most of them were cat mummies. A large part was sold as fertiliser, a small part was purchased by the zoological museum of the city's university college.&lt;ref name=Herdman/&gt;

In 1907, the [[British Museum Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan|British Museum]] received a collection of 192 mummified cats and 11 small carnivores excavated at Gizeh. The mummies probably date to between 600 and 200 BC.&lt;ref name=Morrison-Scott1952/&gt; Two of these cat mummies were [[radiography|radiograph]]ed in 1980. The analysis revealed that they were deliberately strangulated before they reached the age of two years. They were probably used to supply the demand for mummified cats as votive offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Armitage |first1=P.

Excavations in the [[Bubasteum]] area at Saqqara during the 1990s yielded 184 cat mummies, 11 packets with a few cat bones and 84 packets containing mud, clay and pebbles. Radiographic examination showed that mostly young cats were mummified; most cats died of skull fractures and had dislocated [[Vertebral column|spinal]] bones, indicating that they were beaten to death. In this site, the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]]'s wet nurse [[Maia (nurse)|Maia]] was discovered in 1996, which contained cat mummies next to human mummies.&lt;ref name=Zivie2005&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zivie |first1=A. |last2=Lichtenberg |first2=R. |date=2005 |title=Divine Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt |publisher=American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo | pages=106−119 |editor=Ikram, S. |chapter=The Cats of the Goddess Bastet |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=zz5oNwmdaTcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA106&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the skeleton of a male lion was found in this tomb that also showed signs of mummification.&lt;ref name=Calou_al2004&gt;{{cite journal |title=Le lion du Bubasteion à Saqqara (Égypte) |last1=Callou |first1=C. |last2=Samzun |first2=A. |last3=Zivie |first3=A. |journal=Nature |date=2004 |volume=427 |issue=6971 |pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was about nine years old, probably lived in captivity for many years and showed signs of malnutrition.

In the 2nd century, [[Polyaenus]] accounted of a [[Stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] allegedly deployed by the Persian king [[Cambyses II]] during the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)]]: Cambyses II ordered placing of cats and other animals venerated by Egyptians before the Persian front lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29126">The [[cruise ship]] industry is a significant and growing contributor to the [[United States economy]], providing more than $32 billion in benefits annually and generating more than 330,000 U.S. jobs, but also making the environmental impacts of its activities an issue to many. Although cruise ships represent a small fraction of the entire [[shipping]] industry worldwide, public attention to their environmental impacts comes in part from the fact that cruise ships are highly visible and in part because of the industry’s desire to promote a positive image.

[[Cruise ship]]s carrying several thousand passengers and crew have been compared to “floating cities,” and the volume of wastes that they produce is comparably large, consisting of sewage; [[wastewater]] from [[sink]]s, [[shower]]s, and [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]s ([[graywater]]); [[hazardous waste]]s; solid waste; oily [[bilge water]]; [[ballast water]]; and [[air pollution]]. The [[waste type|waste stream]]s generated by cruise ships are governed by a number of international protocols (especially [[MARPOL]]) and U.S. domestic laws (including the [[Clean Water Act]] and the [[Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships]]), regulations, and standards, but there is no single law or rule. Some cruise ship waste streams appear to be well regulated, such as solid wastes (garbage and plastics) and bilge water. But there is overlap of some areas, and there are gaps in others.

In 2000, the [[U.S. Congress]] enacted legislation restricting cruise ship discharges in U.S. navigable waters within the state of [[Alaska]]. [[California]], and [[Maine]] have enacted state-specific laws concerning cruise ship pollution, and a few other states have entered into voluntary agreements with industry to address management of cruise ship discharges. Meanwhile, the cruise industry has voluntarily undertaken initiatives to improve [[pollution prevention]], by adopting waste management guidelines and procedures and researching new technologies. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in three broad areas: adequacy of laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight and enforcement of existing requirements. Legislation to regulate cruise ship discharges of sewage, graywater, and bilge water nationally was introduced in the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]], but there was no further congressional action.

This article describes the several types of waste streams that cruise ships may discharge and emit. It identifies the complex body of international and domestic laws that address pollution from cruise ships. It then describes federal and state legislative activity concerning cruise ships in Alaskan waters and activities in a few other states, as well as current industry initiatives to manage cruise ship pollution.

==Background==
More than 46,000 commercial vessels — [[tanker (ship)|tanker]]s, [[bulk carrier]]s, [[container ship]]s, [[barge]]s, and [[passenger ship]]s — travel the oceans and other waters of the world, carrying cargo and passengers for [[commerce]], [[transport]], and [[recreation]]. Their activities are regulated and scrutinized in a number of respects by international [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocols]] and U.S. domestic laws, including those designed to protect against discharges of [[pollution|pollutants]] that could harm [[marine conservation|marine resources]], other parts of the ambient environment, and human [[health]]. However, there are overlaps of some requirements, gaps in other areas, geographic differences in jurisdiction based on differing definitions, and questions about the adequacy of enforcement.

Public attention to the environmental impacts of the maritime industry has been especially focused on the cruise industry, in part because its ships are highly visible and in part because of the industry’s desire to promote a positive image. It represents a relatively small fraction of the entire shipping industry worldwide. As of January 2008, passenger ships (which include cruise ships and [[ferry|ferries]]) composed about 12% of the world shipping fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marisec.org/shippingfacts/keyfacts/ Lloyd’s Maritime Information Services, on the website of the Maritime International Secretaries Services, Shipping and World Trade Facts.]&lt;/ref&gt; The cruise industry is a significant and growing contributor to the U.S. economy, providing more than $32 billion in total benefits annually and generating more than 330,000 U.S. jobs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkbc.ca/torc/downs1/2005CruiseEconImpactSummary.pdf International Council of Cruise Lines, “The Cruise Industry, 2005 Economic Summary.”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184414/http://www.linkbc.ca/torc/downs1/2005CruiseEconImpactSummary.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also making the environmental impacts of its activities an issue to many. Since 1980, the average annual growth rate in the number of cruise passengers worldwide has been 8.4%, and in 2005, cruises hosted an estimated 11.5 million passengers. Cruises are especially popular in the United States. In 2005, U.S. ports handled 8.6 million cruise embarcations (75% of global passengers), 6.3% more than in 2004. The worldwide cruise ship fleet consists of more than 230 ships, and the majority are [[flag of convenience|foreign-flagged]], with [[Liberia]] and [[Panama]] being the most popular flag countries.&lt;ref name=epawhitepaper&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/cruise_ships/white_paper.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, “Cruise Ship White Paper,” August 22, 2000, p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign-flag cruise vessels owned by six companies account for nearly 95% of passenger ships operating in U.S. waters. Each year, the industry adds new ships to the total fleet, vessels that are bigger, more elaborate and luxurious, and that carry  larger numbers of passengers and crew. Over the past two decades, the average ship size has been increasing at the rate of roughly {{convert|90|ft|m}} every five years. The average ship entering the market from 2008 to 2011 will be more than {{convert|1050|ft|m}} long and will weigh more than 130,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_widesearch=yes&amp;p_multi=ME|ME|&amp;p_product=MTNP1&amp;p_theme=mtnp1&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Experts:%20Mega-berth%20needed%20AND%20date%289/27/2007%20to%209/29/2007%29&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=9/27/2007%20to%209/29/2007%29&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28Experts:%20Mega-berth%20needed%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no Bell, Tom, “Experts: Mega-birth Needed for Cruise Ships,” Portland Press Herald, Sept. 28, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

To the cruise ship industry, a key issue is demonstrating to the public that cruising is safe and healthy for passengers and the tourist communities that are visited by their ships. Cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers and crew have been compared to “floating cities,” in part because the volume of wastes produced and requiring disposal is greater than that of many small cities on land. During a typical one-week voyage, a large cruise ship (with 3,000 passengers and crew) is estimated to generate {{convert|210,000|USgal|L}} of sewage; {{convert|1|e6USgal|m3}} of graywater (wastewater from sinks, showers, and laundries); more than {{convert|130|USgal|L}} of hazardous wastes; 8 tons of solid waste; and {{convert|25,000|USgal|m3}} of oily bilge water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bts.gov/publications/maritime_trade_and_transportation/2002/html/environmental_issues_table_01.html Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Department of Transportation, “Summary of Cruise Ship Waste Streams.”]  Accessed 28-Jul-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers can,singlehandedl, produce up to 7.7 pounds of waste in a single day aboard a cruise ship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umich.edu/~nppcpub/resources/compendia/CSTLpdfs/CSTLcruise.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Those wastes, if not properly treated and disposed of, can pose risks to human health, welfare, and the environment. Environmental advocates have raised concerns about the adequacy of existing laws for managing these wastes, and suggest that enforcement of existing laws is weak.

A 2000 [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) report focused attention on problems of cruise vessel compliance with environmental requirements.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00048.pdf U.S. General Accounting Office, Marine Pollution: Progress Made to Reduce Marine Pollution by Cruise Ships, but Important Issues Remain, GAO/RCED-00-48, February 2000. 70 pp.]&lt;/ref&gt; GAO found that between 1993 and 1998, foreign-flag cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters. A few of the cases included multiple illegal discharge incidents occurring over the six-year period. GAO reviewed three major waste streams (solids, hazardous chemicals, and oily bilge water) and concluded that 83% of the cases involved discharges of oil or oil-based products, the volumes of which ranged from a few drops to hundreds of gallons. The balance of the cases involved discharges of plastic or garbage. GAO judged that 72% of the illegal discharges were accidental, 15% were intentional, and 13% could not be determined. The 87 cruise ship cases represented 4% of the 2,400 illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships (including tankers, cargo ships and other commercial vessels, as well as cruise ships) confirmed during the six years studied by GAO. Although cruise ships operating in U.S. waters have been involved in a relatively small number of pollution cases, GAO said, several have been widely publicized and have led to criminal prosecutions and multimillion-dollar fines.

In 2000, a coalition of 53 environmental advocacy groups petitioned the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to take regulatory action to address pollution by cruise ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/cruise_ships/petition.pdf Bluewater Network, Petition to the Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, March 17, 2000.] The [http://www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/cruise_ships/airemissionssettle.pdf petition was amended] in 2000 to request that EPA also examine [[air pollution]] from cruise ships; see discussion below.&lt;/ref&gt; The petition called for an investigation of wastewater, oil, and solid waste discharges from cruise ships. In response, EPA agreed to study cruise ship discharges and waste management approaches. As part of that effort, EPA issued a background document in 2000 with preliminary information and recommendations for further assessment through data collection and public information hearings.&lt;ref name=epawhitepaper/&gt; The agency released its final ''Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report'' in 2009. The report summarized findings of recent data collection activities, especially from cruise ships operating in Alaskan waters.&lt;ref name="EPA 2008 report"&gt;{{cite report |date=2008-12-29 |title=Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1002SVS.txt |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 842-R-07-005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently, litigation regarding the [[NPDES|National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES) permit program led to a 2008 decision by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court]], ruling that EPA could not exclude vessel discharges from NPDES requirements.&lt;ref&gt;''Northwest Environmental Advocates et al. v. EPA,'' 537 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2008). Decided 2008-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently EPA issued an initial ''Vessel General Permit'' (VGP) with an effective date of February 6, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2008-12-29). [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/12/29/E8-30816/final-national-pollutant-discharge-elimination-system-npdes-general-permit-for-discharges-incidental "Final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of a Vessel."] ''Federal Register,'' 73 FR 79473.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cruise ship waste streams==
{{main|Cruise ship pollution}}
Cruise ships generate a number of waste streams that can result in discharges to the marine environment, including [[sewage]], [[graywater]], [[hazardous waste]]s, oily [[bilge]] water, [[ballast water discharge and the environment|ballast water]], and solid waste. They also emit [[air pollution|air pollutants]] to the air and water. These wastes, if not properly treated and disposed of, can be a significant source of [[pathogen]]s, [[nutrient]]s, and [[poison|toxic substance]]s with the potential to threaten human [[health]] and damage aquatic life. Cruise ships represent a small — although highly visible — portion of the entire international shipping industry, and the waste streams described here are not unique to cruise ships. However, particular [[waste types|types of wastes]], such as sewage, graywater, and solid waste, may be of greater concern for cruise ships relative to other seagoing vessels, because of the large numbers of passengers and crew that cruise ships carry and the large volumes of wastes that they produce. Further, because cruise ships tend to concentrate their activities in specific coastal areas and visit the same ports repeatedly (especially [[Florida]], [[California]], [[New York City]], [[Galveston]], [[Seattle]], and the waters of [[Alaska]]), their cumulative impact on a local scale could be significant, as can impacts of individual large-volume releases (either accidental or intentional).

==International laws and regulations==
{{see also|MARPOL 73/78|Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships}}
[[MARPOL 73/78]] is one of the most important treaties regulating pollution from ships. [[MARPOL 73/78#Annexes|Six Annexes of the Convention]] cover the various sources of pollution from ships and provide an overarching framework for international objectives. In the U.S., the Convention is implemented through the [[Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships]]. Under the provisions of the Convention, the United States can take direct enforcement action under U.S. laws against [[flag of convenience|foreign-flagged]] ships when pollution discharge incidents occur within U.S. jurisdiction. When incidents occur outside U.S. jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined, the United States refers cases to [[Flag State|flag state]]s, in accordance with MARPOL. These procedures require substantial coordination between the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], and other flag states, and the response rate from flag states has been poor.&lt;ref name=GAO /&gt;

==Federal laws and regulations==
{{main|Regulation of ship pollution in the United States}}
In the United States, several federal agencies have some jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters, but no one agency is responsible for or coordinates all of the relevant government functions. The U.S. Coast Guard and EPA have principal regulatory and standard-setting responsibilities.

Cruise ships that are {{convert|79|ft|m}} in length or greater, are subject to the requirements of the EPA ''Vessel General Permit'' (VGP). The most recent VGP was published in 2013.&lt;ref name="VGP-FR"&gt;EPA (2013-04-12). [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/04/12/2013-08662/final-national-pollutant-discharge-elimination-system-npdes-general-permit-for-discharges-incidental "Final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of a Vessel."] ''Federal Register.'' 78 FR 21938.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA issued a separate permit for smaller cruise ships,&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2014-09-10). Final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Small Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of Vessels Less Than 79 Feet. ''Federal Register.'' {{Federal Register|79|53702}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/vessels-svgp |title=Vessels-sVGP |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-05-13 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this permit currently only applies to ballast water. A Congressionally-imposed moratorium applied to other wastestreams for these vessels until January 19, 2018.&lt;ref name="SVGP moratorium"&gt;United States. ''An Act to extend the period during which vessels that are shorter than 79 feet in length and fishing vessels are not required to have a permit for discharges incidental to the normal operation of the vessel.'' {{USPL|115|100}}. Approved 2018-01-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] prosecutes violations of federal laws. In addition, the Department of State represents the United States at meetings of the [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] and in international treaty negotiations and is responsible for pursuing foreign-flag violations. Other federal agencies have limited roles and responsibilities. For example, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA, [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]) works with the Coast Guard and EPA to report on the effects of [[marine debris]]. The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) is responsible for ensuring [[quarantine]] inspection and disposal of food-contaminated garbage (these APHIS responsibilities are part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]). In some cases, states and localities have responsibilities as well.

===Sewage===
Commercial vessels are required to obtain NPDES permits pursuant to Section 402 of the [[Clean Water Act]]. Section 312 of the Act prohibits the dumping of untreated or inadequately treated sewage from vessels into the navigable waters of the United States (defined in the act as within {{convert|3|mi|km}} of shore). Cruise ships are subject to this prohibition. Commercial and recreational vessels with installed [[toilet]]s are required to have marine sanitation devices, which are designed to prevent the discharge of untreated sewage. Beyond {{convert|3|mi|km}}, raw sewage can be discharged. On some cruise ships, especially many of those that travel in Alaskan waters, sewage is treated using Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) systems that generally provide improved screening, treatment, disinfection, and sludge processing as compared with traditional MSDs. AWTs are believed to be very effective in removing [[pathogen]]s, [[biochemical oxygen demand|oxygen-demanding]] substances, suspended solids, [[oil]] and [[grease (lubricant)|grease]], and particulate metals from sewage, but only moderately effective in removing dissolved metals and nutrients ([[ammonia]], [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]).

States may also establish [[Regulation of ship pollution in the United States#No-discharge zones|no-discharge zones]] (NDZs) for vessel sewage, under section 312. A state may completely prohibit the discharge of both treated and untreated sewage from all vessels with installed toilets into some or all waters over which it has jurisdiction (up to {{convert|3|mi|km}} from land). As of 2017, this designation has been used for 72 areas representing part or all of the waters of 26 states, including a number of inland states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/vessels-marinas-and-ports/no-discharge-zones-ndzs-state |title=No-Discharge Zones by State |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-18 |website=Vessels, Marinas and Ports |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greywater===
[[Greywater|Graywater]] discharges from large cruise ships are regulated by the 2013 VGP.&lt;ref name="VGP-FR"/&gt; Under a Congressional moratorium, graywater discharges from small cruise ships were exempt from the EPA Small Vessel General Permit ("sVGP") until January 19, 2018.&lt;ref name="SVGP moratorium"/&gt;

Pursuant to a state law in [[Alaska]], greywater must be treated prior to discharge into that state’s waters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Solid waste===
Cruise ship discharges of solid waste are governed by two laws. Title I of the [[Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act]] makes it illegal to transport garbage from the United States for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters without a permit or to dump material from outside the U.S. into U.S. waters. Beyond U.S. waters, no MPRSA permit is required for a cruise ship to discharge solid waste. The routine discharge of [[effluent]] incidental to the propulsion of vessels is explicitly exempted from the definition of dumping in the MPRSA.28

The [[Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships]] prohibits the discharge of all garbage within {{convert|3|nmi|km}} of shore, certain types of garbage within {{convert|12|nmi|km}} offshore, and [[plastic]] anywhere. It applies to all vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters and the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ).

===Hazardous waste===
The [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) is the primary federal law that governs [[hazardous waste]] management. The owner or operator of a cruise ship may be a generator and/or a transporter of hazardous waste, and thus subject to RCRA rules. Issues that the cruise ship industry may face relating to RCRA include ensuring that hazardous waste is identified at the point at which it is considered generated; ensuring that parties are properly identified as generators, storers, treaters, or disposers; and  determining the applicability of RCRA requirements to each. Hazardous waste generated onboard cruise ships are stored onboard until the wastes can be offloaded for [[recycling]] or disposal in accordance with RCRA.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

A range of activities on board cruise ships generate hazardous wastes and [[poison|toxic substance]]s that would ordinarily be presumed to be subject to RCRA. Cruise ships are potentially subject to RCRA requirements to the extent that chemicals used for operations such as ship maintenance and passenger services result in the generation of hazardous wastes. However, it is not entirely clear what regulations apply to the management and disposal of these wastes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} RCRA rules that cover small-quantity generators (those that generate more than 100 kilograms but less than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month) are less stringent than those for large-quantity generators (generating more than 1,000 kilograms per month), and it is unclear whether cruise ships are classified as large or small generators of hazardous waste. Moreover, some cruise companies argue that they generate less than 100 kilograms per month and therefore should be classified in a third category, as “conditionally exempt small-quantity generators,” a categorization that allows for less rigorous requirements for notification, recordkeeping, and the like.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In addition to RCRA, hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are subject to Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines, or into or upon the waters of the [[territorial waters#Contiguous zone|contiguous zone]].

===Bilge water===
Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, as amended by the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]], applies to cruise ships and prohibits discharge of oil or hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon U.S. navigable waters, or into or upon the waters of the contiguous zone, or which may affect natural resources in the U.S. EEZ (extending {{convert|200|mi|km}} offshore).&lt;ref&gt;United States. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, {{USPL|101|380}}, {{USCode|33|2701}}. Approved 1990-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Coast Guard regulations prohibit discharge of oil within {{convert|12|mi|km}} from shore, unless passed through a 15-[[Parts-per notation#Parts-per expressions|ppm]] oil water separator, and unless the discharge does not cause a visible sheen.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Coast Guard. "Part 151—Vessels Carrying Oil, Noxious Liquid Substances, Garbage, Municipal or Commercial Waste, and Ballast Water." Control of Oil Discharges. ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|33|151|10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond {{convert|12|mi|km}}, oil or oily mixtures can be discharged while a vessel is proceeding en route and if the oil content without dilution is less than 100 ppm. Vessels are required to maintain an Oil Record Book to record disposal of oily residues and discharges overboard or disposal of bilge water.

In addition to Section 311 requirements, the [[Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships]] (APPS) implements [[MARPOL#Annexes|MARPOL Annex I]] concerning oil pollution. APPS applies to all U.S. flagged ships anywhere in the world and to all [[flag state|foreign flag]]ged vessels operating in the navigable waters of the United States, or while at a port under U.S. jurisdiction. To implement APPS, the Coast Guard has promulgated regulations prohibiting the discharge of oil or oily mixtures into the sea within {{convert|12|nmi|km}} of the nearest land, except under limited conditions. However, because most cruise lines are foreign registered and because APPS only applies to foreign ships within U.S. navigable waters, the APPS regulations have limited applicability to cruise ship operations. In addition, most cruise lines have adopted policies that restrict discharges of machinery space waste within three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from shore.

===Cruise Ship Efforts to Reduce Pollution===
After the intervention of the GAO, or Government Accountability Office, from 2003 to 2008, twelve cruise ship companies who violated pollution regulations implemented new environmental strategies. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/products/RCED-00-48&lt;/ref&gt; Several cruise lines within this group and others who have not been found guilty of previous violations have sought to ameliorate their pollution of marine waters. Some of these have reduced their waste production by transferring over from single use plastic packaging to reusable plastic containers for food being prepared on board and cutlery being used on the pool decks. Princess Cruises as well as the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line are two cruise lines that have acknowledged the waste problem, and have adopted reusable items to work towards a resolution.Recycling programs have also been implemented, and, because of the use of compactors on ships, plastics and aluminums are condensed and made easily recyclable upon ships return to port. The United States,alone,gains upward of 18,000 pounds of recycled goods from these practices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umich.edu/~nppcpub/resources/compendia/CSTLpdfs/CSTLcruise.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some cruise lines have also taken it upon themselves to reduce air pollution, by using alternative, cleaner energy sources which has positive implications for marine waters as well. Battery power, fuel cells, and liquified natural gas are two such sources that are being explored. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-magazine/feature-magazine-articles/16199-winter-2016-2017-alternative-fuels-technology-progress.html&lt;/ref&gt; Carnival Corporation is one example of a cruise liner that is currently pursuing cleaner energies. The company has agreed to partner with Shell and utilize liquefied natural gas, LNG, to power their next two ships.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carnival-corporation-signs-agreement-with-shell-to-fuel-worlds-first-lng-powered-cruise-ships-300337817.html&lt;/ref&gt; Liquefied natural gas, although still a  fossil fuel, is a much cleaner source of energy than oil and also much less expensive to the benefit of cruise companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uhero.hawaii.edu/news/view/276&lt;/ref&gt; Transitioning away from oil will help cruise liners combat their problems with bilge pollution. Cruise ships efforts to reduce their waste, recycle, and find more renewable energies will help alleviate their current rate of pollution of marine waters.

[[File:Deucalion.jpg|thumb|200px|Deucalin from "Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum"]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Deucalion''' ({{IPAc-en|dj|uː|ˈ|k|eɪ|l|i|ən}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Δευκαλίων#Ancient Greek|Δευκαλίων]]}}) was the son of [[Prometheus]]; ancient sources name his mother as [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]], [[Hesione (Oceanid)|Hesione]], or Pronoia.&lt;ref&gt;The [[scholia]] to ''Odyssey'' 10.2 names Clymene as the commonly identified mother, along with Hesione (citing [[Acusilaus]], ''FGrH'' 2 F 34) and possibly Pronoia.&lt;/ref&gt; He is closely connected with the [[flood myth]] in Greek mythology.

==Etymology==
According to [[folk etymology]], Deucalion's name comes from δεῦκος, ''deukos'', a variant of γλεῦκος, ''gleucos'', i.e. "sweet new wine, must, sweetness"&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|deu{{=}}kos|δεῦκος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ1&gt;{{LSJ|gleu{{=}}kos|γλεῦκος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from ἁλιεύς, ''haliéus'', i.e. "sailor, seaman, fisher".&lt;ref name=LSJ2&gt;{{LSJ|a(lieu/s|ἁλιεύς|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Pyrrha's name derives from the adjective πυρρός, -ά, -όν, ''pyrrhós, -á, -ón'', i.e. "flame-colored, orange".&lt;ref name=LSJ3&gt;
{{LSJ|purro/s|πυρρός|ref}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ancient Greek mythography==
[[Image:Virgil Solis - Deucalion Pyrrha.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Deucalion and [[Pyrrha]] from a 1562 version of Ovid's [[Metamorphoses]].]]

=== Family ===
Of Deucalion's birth, the ''[[Argonautica]]'' (from the 3rd century BC) states:

{{quote|text=There [in [[Achaea]], i.e. Greece] is a land encircled by lofty mountains, rich in sheep and in pasture, where [[Prometheus]], son of [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], begat goodly Deucalion, who first founded cities and reared temples to the immortal gods, and first ruled over men. This land the neighbours who dwell around call ''Haemonia'' [i.e. [[Thessaly]]].}}

Deucalion and [[Pyrrha]] had at least two children, [[Hellen]] and [[Protogenea]], and possibly a third, [[Amphictyon]] (who is [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] in other traditions).

Their children as apparently named in one of the oldest texts, ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'', include daughters [[Pandora]] and [[Thyia]], and at least one son, Hellen.&lt;ref&gt;Hes. ''Catalogue'' fragments 2, 5 and 7; cf. M.L. West (1985) ''The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women''. Oxford, pp. 50–2, who posits that a third daughter, Protogeneia, who was named at (e.g.) Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=3503A1B6D4134062D00965BD225DDB77?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D3 5.1.3], was also present in the ''Catalogue''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their descendants were said to have dwelt in Thessaly. One corrupt fragment might make Deucalion the son of Prometheus and Pronoea.&lt;ref name="Pronoia"&gt;A [[Scholia|scholium]] to ''Odyssey'' 10.2 (=''[[Catalogue of Women|Catalogue]]'' fr. 4) reports that Hesiod called Deucalion's mother "Pryneie" or "Prynoe", corrupt forms which [[Karl Wilhelm Dindorf|Dindorf]] believed to conceal Pronoea's name. The emendation is considered to have "undeniable merit" by A. Casanova (1979) ''La famiglia di Pandora: analisi filologica dei miti di Pandora e Prometeo nella tradizione esiodea''. Florence, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deluge accounts ===
The flood in the time of Deucalion was caused by the anger of [[Zeus]], ignited by the [[hubris]] of the [[Pelasgians]]. So Zeus decided to put an end to the [[Ages of Man|Bronze Age]]. According to this story, [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]], the king of [[Arcadia]], had sacrificed a boy to Zeus, who was appalled by this savage offering. Zeus unleashed a deluge, so that the rivers ran in torrents and the sea flooded the coastal plain, engulfed the foothills with spray, and washed everything clean. Deucalion, with the aid of his father Prometheus, was saved from this deluge by building a chest.&lt;ref name="When the Great Abyss Opened"&gt;{{cite book|title=When the great abyss opened : classic and contemporary readings of Noah's flood|last=Pleins|first=J. David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-973363-7|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|location=New York|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Biblical [[Noah]] and the Mesopotamian counterpart [[Utnapishtim]], he uses his device to survive the deluge with his wife, Pyrrha.

The fullest accounts are provided in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (8 AD) and in the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|''Library'']] of Pseudo-Apollodorus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html Apollodorus' library] at [http://www.theoi.com theoi.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Deucalion, who reigned over the region of [[Phthia]], had been forewarned of the flood by his father, Prometheus. Deucalion was to build a chest and provision it carefully (no animals are rescued in this version of the Flood myth), so that when the waters receded after nine days, he and his wife [[Pyrrha]], daughter of [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]], were the one surviving pair of humans. Their chest touched solid ground on [[Mount Parnassus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''[[Olympian Odes]]'', 9.43; cf. [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', [http://www.mythology.us/ovid_metamorphoses_book_1.htm I.313–347]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Mount Etna]] in [[Sicily]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/flood/flood4-t-hyginus.html |title=Hyginus' Fabulae 153 |publisher=Livius.org |date=2007-09-26 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Mount Athos]] in [[Chalkidiki]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius']] commentary on Virgil's ''[[Bucolics]]'', 6:41&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Mount Othrys]] in Thessaly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hellanicus of Lesbos|Hellanicus]], ''[[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker|FGrH]]'' 4 F 117, quoted by the [[scholia]] to Pindar, ''Olympia'' 9.62b: "Hellanicus says that the chest didn't touch down on Parnassus, but by Othrys in Thessaly.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] mentions the opinion of a [[Hegesianax]] that Deucalion is to be identified with [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]], "because during his reign such quantities of water poured from the sky that the great Flood resulted."

Once the deluge was over and the couple had given thanks to Zeus, Deucalion (said in several of the sources to have been aged 82 at the time) consulted an [[oracle]] of [[Themis]] about how to repopulate the earth.  He was told to "cover your head and throw the bones of your mother behind your shoulder".  Deucalion and Pyrrha understood that "mother" is [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the mother of all living things, and the "bones" to be rocks.  They threw the rocks behind their shoulders and the stones formed people. Pyrrha's became women; Deucalion's became men.

The 2nd-century writer [[Lucian]] gave an account of the Greek Deucalion in ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' that seems to refer more to the Near Eastern flood legends: in his version, Deucalion (whom he also calls ''Sisythus'')&lt;ref&gt;The manuscripts transmit scythea, "Scythian", rather than Sisythus, which is conjectural.&lt;/ref&gt;  took his children, their wives, and pairs of animals with him on the ark, and later built a great temple in [[Manbij]] (northern Syria), on the site of the chasm that received all the waters; he further describes how pilgrims brought vessels of sea water to this place twice a year, from as far as Arabia and Mesopotamia, to commemorate this event.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Variant stories ===
On the other hand, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] stated his parents to be Prometheus and [[Asia (mythology)|Clymene]], daughter of [[Oceanus]] and mentions nothing about a flood, but instead names him as commander of those from Parnassus who drove the "sixth generation" of [[Pelasgians]] from Thessaly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassensis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NwEMAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22by+Deucalion%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22by%20Deucalion%22&amp;f=false ''The Roman Antiquities of Dionysius Halicarnassensis'', volume 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest Greek historians, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], was said to have written a book about Deucalion, but it no longer survives.  The only extant fragment of his to mention Deucalion does not mention the flood either, but names him as the father of [[Orestheus]], king of [[Aetolia]]. The much later geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], following on this tradition, names Deucalion as a king of [[Ozolian Locris]] and father of Orestheus.

[[Plutarch]] mentions a legend that Deucalion and Pyrrha had settled in [[Dodona]], [[Epirus]]; while [[Strabo]] asserts that they lived at [[Opus, Greece|Cynus]], and that her grave is still to be found there, while his may be seen at [[Athens]]; he also mentions a pair of Aegean islands named after the couple.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Mosaic accretions===
The 19th century classicist John Lemprière, in ''Bibliotheca Classica'', argued that as the story had been re-told in later versions, it accumulated details from the stories of Noah and Moses: "Thus Apollodorus gives Deucalion a great chest as a means of safety; Plutarch speaks of the pigeons by which he sought to find out whether the waters had retired; and Lucian of the animals of every kind which he had taken with him. &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;Lemprière, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xeE_AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bibliotheca Classica], page 475.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating by early scholars===

For some time during the Middle Ages, many European Christian scholars continued to accept Greek mythical history at face value, thus asserting that Deucalion's flood was a regional flood, that occurred a few centuries later than the global one survived by Noah's family. On the basis of the archaeological ''[[stele]]'' known as the [[Parian Chronicle]], Deucalion's Flood was usually fixed as occurring sometime around c. 1528 BC. Deucalion's flood may be dated in the [[Chronicon (Jerome)|chronology]] of Saint [[Jerome]] to {{circa}} 1460 BC. According to [[Augustine of Hippo]] (''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' XVIII,8,10,&amp;11), Deucalion and his father Prometheus were contemporaries of Moses. According to [[Clement of Alexandria]] in his [[Stromata]], "...in the time of [[Crotopus]] occurred the burning of [[Phaethon]], and the deluges of Deucalion."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Deucalionids==
The descendants of Deucalion and Pyrrha are below:

*[[Hellen]], [[Amphictyon]], [[Orestheus]], [[Protogeneia]], [[Pandora II]] and [[Thyia]] are their children.

A '''field emission gun''' is a type of [[electron gun]] in which a sharply pointed Müller-type{{clarify|reason=what is this?|date=July 2014}} emitter&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Forbes, "Gas Field Ionization Sources," in [[Jon Orloff]], ed., ''Handbook of Charged Particle Optics, Second Edition'', CRC Press, 2009, p 87-128, {{ISBN|978-1-4200-4554-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is held at several kilovolts negative [[potential]] relative to a nearby [[electrode]], so that there is sufficient potential [[gradient]] at the emitter surface to cause [[field electron emission]]. Emitters are either of [[cold-cathode]] type, usually made of single crystal tungsten sharpened to a tip radius of about 100 nm, or of the [[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] type,&lt;ref&gt;L.W. Swanson &amp; G.A. Schwind, "Review of ZrO/W Schottky Cathode," in [[Jon Orloff]], ed., ''Handbook of Charged Particle Optics, Second Edition'', CRC Press, 2009, p 1-28, {{ISBN|978-1-4200-4554-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[thermionic emission]] is enhanced by barrier lowering in the presence of a high electric field. Schottky emitters are made by coating a tungsten tip with a layer of [[zirconium oxide]], which has the unusual property of increasing in [[electrical conductivity]] at high temperature.  

In  [[electron microscope]]s, a field emission gun is used to produce an electron beam that is smaller in diameter, more coherent and with up to three orders of magnitude greater current density or brightness than can be achieved with conventional [[thermionic emission|thermionic emitters]] such as tungsten or [[lanthanum hexaboride]] ({{chem|LaB|6}})-tipped filaments. The result in both [[scanning electron microscope|scanning]] and [[transmission electron microscope|transmission electron microscopy]] is significantly improved [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and spatial resolution, and greatly increased emitter life and reliability compared with thermionic devices.

== Coefficient of Conservatism ==
Each plant species in a region is assigned a '''coefficient of conservatism''', also known as a C-value, ranging between 0 and 10.&lt;ref name=fqa95 /&gt; A plant species with a higher score (e.g. 10) has a ''lower'' tolerance to [[environmental degradation]] such as [[grazing]] or [[land development|development]] and therefore is naturally restricted to undisturbed, [[remnant natural area|remnant habitats]]. Non-native plants are either assigned a C-value of 0 or are excluded from assessments.&lt;ref name=freyman16&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freyman |first1=William A. |last2=Master |first2=Linda A. |last3=Packard |first3=Stephen |date=2016 |title=The Universal Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) Calculator: an online tool for ecological assessment and monitoring |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12491/abstract |journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution |volume=7 |issue= |pages=380-383 |doi=10.1111/2041-210X.12491 |access-date=2018-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chicago Region, 84% of the native plant species have a C-value of 4 or greater.&lt;ref name=FCR17&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Gerould |last2=Rericha |first2=Laura |authorlink2=Laura Rericha |date=2017 |title=Flora of the Chicago Region: A Floristic and Ecological Synthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants with a C-value of 4 or greater rarely naturally move from a remnant area to surrounding degraded land.&lt;ref name=FCR17 /&gt;

C-values are assigned within specific ecological and geographic regions. As of February 2018, there were at least 50 different FQA databases ranging from the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] to western [[Washington (state)|Washington]], though most databases represented regions in the eastern and central United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=universalfqa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://universalfqa.org |title=Universal FQA|date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mean C-value''' (&lt;math&gt; \bar{C}&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated based on an inventory of plants. An area with a native mean C-value of 3.5  or higher likely has "sufficient floristic quality to be of at least marginal natural area quality."&lt;ref name=swink94 /&gt; Remnant natural areas with mean C-values of 4.0 or greater are [[environmental mitigation|unmitigable]].&lt;ref name=FCR17 /&gt;

== Floristic Quality Index ==
The '''Floristic Quality Index''' (FQI) is calculated by multiplying the mean C value by the square root of the total number of species:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16284">'''Groundwater remediation''' is the process that is used to treat [[groundwater pollution|polluted groundwater]] by removing the pollutants or converting them into harmless products. [[Groundwater]] is water present below the ground surface that saturates the pore space in the subsurface. Globally, between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of the world's [[drinking water]] is drawn from boreholes and dug [[water well|well]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngwa.org/Fundamentals/use/Documents/global-groundwater-use-fact-sheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228024655/http://www.ngwa.org/Fundamentals/use/Documents/global-groundwater-use-fact-sheet.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundwater is also used by farmers to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and by industries to produce everyday goods. Most groundwater is clean, but groundwater can become polluted, or contaminated as a [[human impact on the environment|result of human activities]] or as a result of natural conditions.

The many and diverse activities of humans produce innumerable [[waste]] materials and by-products. Historically, the disposal of such waste have not been subject to many regulatory controls. Consequently, waste materials have often been disposed of or stored on land surfaces where they percolate into the underlying groundwater. As a result, the contaminated groundwater is unsuitable for use.

Current practices can still impact groundwater, such as the over application of [[fertilizer]] or [[pesticide]]s, [[chemical spill|spills]] from [[industrialization|industrial]] operations, infiltration from [[urban runoff]], and leaking from [[landfill]]s. Using contaminated groundwater causes hazards to [[public health]] through [[poisoning]] or the spread of disease, and the practice of groundwater remediation has been developed to address these issues. Contaminants found in groundwater cover a broad range of physical, inorganic chemical, organic chemical, bacteriological, and radioactive parameters. Pollutants and contaminants can be removed from groundwater by applying various techniques, thereby bringing the water to a standard that is commensurate with various intended uses.

== Techniques ==
Ground water remediation techniques span biological, chemical, and physical [[water treatment|treatment]] technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the biological treatment techniques include [[bioaugmentation]], [[bioventing]], [[biosparging]], [[bioslurping]], and [[phytoremediation]]. Some chemical treatment techniques include [[ozone and oxygen gas injection]], [[chemical precipitation]], [[Membrane technology|membrane separation]], [[ion exchange]], [[carbon absorption]], [[aqueous chemical oxidation]], and [[surfactant enhanced recovery]]. Some chemical techniques may be implemented using [[nanoremediation|nanomaterials]]. Physical treatment techniques include, but are not limited to, [[pump and treat]], [[air sparging]], and [[dual phase extraction]].

=== Biological treatment technologies ===

==== Bioaugmentation ====
If a treatability study shows no degradation (or an extended lab period before significant degradation is achieved) in contamination contained in the groundwater, then inoculation with strains known to be capable of degrading the contaminants may be helpful. This process increases the reactive enzyme concentration within the [[bioremediation]] system and subsequently may increase contaminant degradation rates over the nonaugmented rates, at least initially after inoculation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Hayman, M, &amp; Dupont, R. R. (2001). Groundwater and Soil Remediation: Process Design and Cost Estimating of Proven Technologies. Reston, Virginia: ASCE Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bioventing ====
Bioventing is an [[in situ]] remediation technology that uses [[microorganism]]s to biodegrade [[organic matter|organic]] constituents in the groundwater system. Bioventing enhances the activity of indigenous bacteria and archaea and stimulates the natural in situ biodegradation of [[hydrocarbon]]s by inducing air or [[oxygen]] flow into the unsaturated zone and, if necessary, by adding nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Akaya FAQs|url = http://www.akayaenvironmental.com/faqs.html|website = Akaya|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During bioventing, oxygen may be supplied through direct air injection into residual contamination in soil. Bioventing primarily assists in the degradation of adsorbed fuel residuals, but also assists in the degradation of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) as vapors move slowly through biologically active soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/bioven.htm "Bioventing"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Biosparging ====
Biosparging is an [[in situ]] remediation technology that uses indigenous microorganisms to biodegrade organic constituents in the saturated zone. In biosparging, air (or oxygen) and nutrients (if needed) are injected into the [[saturated zone]] to increase the biological activity of the indigenous microorganisms. Biosparging can be used to reduce concentrations of [[petroleum]] constituents that are dissolved in groundwater, adsorbed to [[soil]] below the [[water table]], and within the [[capillary fringe]].

==== Bioslurping ====
Bioslurping combines elements of bioventing and vacuum-enhanced pumping of free-product that is lighter than water ([[light non-aqueous phase liquid]] or LNAPL) to recover free-product from the groundwater and soil, and to bioremediate soils. The bioslurper system uses a “slurp” tube that extends into the free-product layer. Much like a straw in a glass draws liquid, the pump draws liquid (including free-product) and soil gas up the tube in the same process stream. Pumping lifts LNAPLs, such as oil, off the top of the water table and from the capillary fringe (i.e., an area just above the saturated zone, where water is held in place by capillary forces). The LNAPL is brought to the surface, where it is separated from water and air. The biological processes in the term “bioslurping” refer to aerobic biological degradation of the hydrocarbons when air is introduced into the unsaturated zone contaminated soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/bislurp.htm "Bioslurping"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phytoremediation ====
In the [[phytoremediation]] process [[:Category:Phytoremediation plants|certain plants and trees]] are planted, whose roots absorb contaminants from ground water over time. This process can be carried out in areas where the roots can tap the ground water. Few examples of plants that are used in this process are [[Chinese Ladder fern]] Pteris vittata, also known as the brake fern, is a highly efficient accumulator of [[arsenic]]. Genetically altered [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]] trees are good absorbers of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and transgenic Indian mustard plants soak up [[selenium]] well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Robert. [http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/environment-book/groundwaterremediation.html "Groundwater Remediation"], 2008-12-23. Retrieved on 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permeable reactive barriers====
{{Main article|Permeable reactive barriers}}
Certain types of [[permeable reactive barriers]] utilize biological organisms in order to remediate groundwater.

=== Chemical treatment technologies ===

==== Chemical precipitation ====
[[Precipitation (chemistry)|Chemical precipitation]] is commonly used in [[wastewater treatment]] to remove [[Water hardness|hardness]] and [[heavy metals]]. In general, the process involves addition of agent to an aqueous waste stream in a stirred reaction vessel, either batchwise or with steady flow. Most metals can be converted to insoluble compounds by chemical reactions between the agent and the dissolved metal ions. The insoluble compounds (precipitates) are removed by settling and/or filtering.

==== Ion exchange ====
[[Ion exchange]] for ground water remediation is virtually always carried out by passing the water downward under pressure through a fixed bed of granular medium (either cation exchange media and anion exchange media) or spherical beads. [[Cations]] are displaced by certain cations from the solutions and [[ions]] are displaced by certain anions from the solution. Ion exchange media most often used for remediation are [[zeolite]]s (both natural and synthetic) and synthetic resins.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt;

==== Carbon absorption ====
The most common activated carbon used for remediation is derived from [[bituminous coal]]. [[Activated carbon]] absorbs volatile organic compounds from ground water by chemically binding them to the carbon atoms.

==== Chemical oxidation ====
In this process, called [[In situ oxidation|In Situ Chemical Oxidation]] or ISCO, chemical [[oxidant]]s are delivered in the subsurface to destroy (converted to water and carbon dioxide or to nontoxic substances) the organics molecules. The oxidants are introduced as either liquids or gasses. Oxidants include air or oxygen, [[ozone]], and certain liquid chemicals such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[permanganate]] and [[persulfate]].
[[Ozone and oxygen]] gas can be generated on site from air and electricity and directly injected into soil and groundwater contamination. The process has the potential to oxidize and/or enhance naturally occurring aerobic degradation. Chemical oxidation has proven to be an effective technique for [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]] or DNAPL when it is present.

==== Surfactant enhanced recovery ====
Surfactant enhanced recovery increases the mobility and solubility of the  contaminants absorbed to the saturated soil matrix or present as [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]]. Surfactant-enhanced recovery injects [[surfactant]]s (surface-active agents that are primary ingredient in soap and detergent) into contaminated  groundwater. A typical system uses an extraction pump to remove groundwater downstream from the injection point. The extracted groundwater is treated aboveground to separate the injected surfactants from the contaminants and groundwater. Once the surfactants have separated from the groundwater they are re-used. The surfactants used are non-toxic, food-grade, and biodegradable. Surfactant enhanced recovery is used most often when the groundwater is contaminated by [[dense non-aqueous phase liquids]] (DNAPLs). These dense compounds, such as [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE), sink in groundwater because they have a higher density than water. They then act as a continuous source for [[contaminant plume]]s that can stretch for miles within an aquifer. These compounds may biodegrade very slowly. They are commonly found in the vicinity of the original spill or leak where capillary forces have trapped them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/surfenh.htm "Surfactant Enhanced Recovery"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permeable reactive barriers====
{{Main article|Permeable reactive barriers}}
Some permeable reactive barriers utilize chemical processes to achieve groundwater remediation.

=== Physical treatment technologies ===

==== Pump and treat ====
Pump and treat is one of the most widely used ground water remediation technologies. In this process ground water is pumped to the surface and is coupled with either biological or chemical treatments to remove the impurities.

==== Air sparging ====
Air sparging is the process of blowing air directly into the ground water. As the bubbles rise, the contaminants are removed from the groundwater by physical contact with the air (i.e., stripping) and are carried up into the unsaturated zone (i.e., soil). As the contaminants move into the soil, a [[soil vapor extraction]] system is usually used to remove vapors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/airspa.htm "Air Sparging"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dual phase vacuum extraction ====
Dual-phase vacuum extraction (DPVE), also known as multi-phase extraction, is a technology that uses a high-vacuum system to remove both contaminated groundwater and soil vapor. In DPVE systems, a high-vacuum extraction well is installed with its screened section in the zone of contaminated soils and groundwater. Fluid/vapor extraction systems depress the water table and water flows faster to the extraction well. DPVE removes contaminants from above and below the water table. As the water table around the well is lowered from pumping, unsaturated soil is exposed. This area, called the [[capillary fringe]], is often highly contaminated, as it holds undissolved chemicals, chemicals that are lighter than water, and vapors that have escaped from the dissolved groundwater below. Contaminants in the newly exposed zone can be removed by vapor extraction. Once above ground, the extracted vapors and liquid-phase organics and groundwater are separated and treated. Use of dual-phase vacuum extraction with these technologies can shorten the cleanup time at a site, because the [[capillary fringe]] is often the most contaminated area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpeo.org/techtree/ttdescript/dualphex.htm "Dual Phase Extraction"], ''The Center for Public Environmental Oversight (CPEO)''. Retrieved 2009-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monitoring-Well Oil Skimming ====
Monitoring-wells are often drilled for the purpose of collecting ground water samples for analysis. These wells, which are usually six inches or less in diameter, can also be used to remove hydrocarbons from the contaminant plume within a groundwater aquifer by using a belt-style oil skimmer. Belt oil skimmers, which are simple in design, are commonly used to remove oil and other floating hydrocarbon contaminants from industrial water systems.

A monitoring-well oil skimmer remediates various oils, ranging from light fuel oils such as petrol, light diesel or kerosene to heavy products such as No. 6 oil, creosote and coal tar. It consists of a continuously moving belt that runs on a pulley system driven by an electric motor. The belt material has a strong affinity for [[hydrocarbon]] liquids and for shedding water. The belt, which can have a vertical drop of 100+ feet, is lowered into the monitoring well past the LNAPL/water interface. As the belt moves through this interface, it picks up liquid hydrocarbon contaminant which is removed and collected at ground level as the belt passes through a wiper mechanism. To the extent that [[DNAPL]] hydrocarbons settle at the bottom of a monitoring well, and the lower pulley of the belt skimmer reaches them, these contaminants can also be removed by a monitoring-well oil skimmer.

Typically, belt skimmers remove very little water with the contaminant, so simple weir-type separators can be used to collect any remaining hydrocarbon liquid, which often makes the water suitable for its return to the aquifer. Because the small electric motor uses little electricity, it can be powered from [[solar panels]] or a [[wind turbine]], making the system self-sufficient and eliminating the cost of running electricity to a remote location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wateronline.com/article.mvc/The-Alternative-To-Pump-And-Treat-0001 "The Alternative To Pump And Treat"] Bob Thibodeau, Water Online Magazine, December 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hydrogen atom''' is an [[atom]] of the [[chemical element]] [[hydrogen]]. The [[Electric charge|electrically]] neutral atom contains a single positively charged [[proton]] and a single negatively charged [[electron]] bound to the nucleus by the [[Coulomb force]]. '''Atomic hydrogen''' constitutes [[abundance of the chemical elements|about 75%]] of the [[baryon]]ic mass of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

In everyday life on Earth, isolated hydrogen atoms (called "atomic hydrogen") are extremely rare. Instead, hydrogen tends to combine with other atoms in compounds, or with itself to form ordinary ([[diatomic]]) hydrogen gas, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. "Atomic hydrogen" and "hydrogen atom" in ordinary English use have overlapping, yet distinct, meanings. For example, a water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms, but does not contain atomic hydrogen (which would refer to isolated hydrogen atoms).

[[Atomic spectroscopy]] shows that there is a discrete infinite set of states in which a hydrogen (or any) atom can exist, contrary to the predictions of [[classical physics]]. Attempts to develop a theoretical understanding of the states of the hydrogen atom have been important to the [[history of quantum mechanics]], since all other atoms can be roughly understood by knowing in detail about this simplest atomic structure.

==Isotopes==
{{Main|Isotopes of hydrogen}}
The most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]] [[isotope]], '''hydrogen-1''', '''protium''', or '''light hydrogen''', contains no [[neutron]]s and is simply a [[proton]] and an [[electron]]. Protium is [[Proton decay|stable]] and makes up 99.985% of naturally occurring hydrogen atoms.&lt;ref name=Housecroft&gt;{{cite book |last1=Housecroft |first=Catherine E. |last2=Sharpe |first2=Alan G. |edition=2nd |date=2005 |title=Inorganic Chemistry |publisher=Pearson Prentice-Hall |page=237 |isbn=0130-39913-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deuterium]] contains one neutron and one proton. Deuterium is stable and makes up 0.0156% of naturally occurring hydrogen&lt;ref name=Housecroft/&gt; and is used in industrial processes like [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[Deuterium NMR|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]].

[[Tritium]] contains two neutrons and one proton and is not stable, decaying with a [[half-life]] of 12.32 years. Because of the short half life, tritium does not exist in nature except in trace amounts.

Higher isotopes of hydrogen are only created in artificial [[Particle accelerator|accelerators]] and reactors and have half lives around the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

The formulas below are valid for all three isotopes of hydrogen, but slightly different values of the [[Rydberg constant]] (correction formula given below) must be used for each hydrogen isotope.

==Hydrogen ion==
{{Main|Hydron (chemistry)}}
Hydrogen is not found without its electron in ordinary chemistry (room temperatures and pressures), as ionized hydrogen is highly chemically reactive. When ionized hydrogen is written as "H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;" as in the solvation of classical acids such as [[hydrochloric acid]], the [[hydronium ion]], [[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is meant, not a literal ionized single hydrogen atom. In that case, the acid transfers the proton to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to form H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Ionized hydrogen without its electron, or free protons, are common in the [[interstellar medium]], and [[solar wind]].

==Theoretical analysis==
The hydrogen atom has special significance in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] as a simple [[two-body problem]] physical system which has yielded many simple [[closed-form expression|analytical]] solutions in closed-form.

=== Failed classical description ===
[[Rutherford model|Experiments]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1909 showed the structure of the atom to be a dense, positive nucleus with a light, negative charge orbiting around it. This immediately caused problems on how such a system could be stable. [[Classical electromagnetism]] had shown that any accelerating charge radiates energy described through the [[Larmor formula]]. If the electron is assumed to orbit in a perfect circle and radiates energy continuously, the electron would rapidly spiral into the nucleus with a fall time of:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/orbitdecay.pdf|title = Classical Lifetime of a Bohr Atom|date = March 7, 2005|website = |publisher = Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University|last = Olsen|first = James|last2 = McDonald|first2 = Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t_\text{fall} \approx \frac{ a_0^3}{4 r_0^2 c} \approx 1.6 \cdot 10^{-11} \text{s}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr radius]] and &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[classical electron radius]]. If this were true, all atoms would instantly collapse, however atoms seem to be stable. Furthermore, the spiral inward would release a smear of electromagnetic frequencies as the orbit got smaller. Instead, atoms were observed to only emit discrete frequencies of radiation. The resolution would lie in the development of [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Bohr-Sommerfeld Model ===
{{Main|Bohr model}}In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] obtained the energy levels and spectral frequencies of the hydrogen atom after making a number of simple assumptions in order to correct the failed classical model. The assumptions included:
# Electrons can only be in certain, discrete circular orbits or ''stationary states'', thereby having a discrete set of possible radii and energies.
# Electrons do not emit radiation while in one of these stationary states.
# An electron can gain or lose energy by jumping from one discrete orbital to another. 
Bohr supposed that the electron's angular momentum is quantized with possible values:

&lt;math&gt;L = n \hbar&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;n = 1,2,3,...&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck constant]] over &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;. He also supposed that the [[centripetal force]] which keeps the electron in its orbit is provided by the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], and that energy is conserved. Bohr derived the energy of each orbit of the hydrogen atom to be:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://alpha.chem.umb.edu/chemistry/ch115/carter/files/103more/BohrEquations.pdf|title = Derivation of Bohr’s Equations for the One-electron Atom|website = |publisher = University of Massachusetts Boston|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;E_n = - \frac{  m_e e^4}{2 ( 4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2 } \frac{1}{n^2}   &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;m_e   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron mass]], &lt;math&gt;e   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron charge]], &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]], and &lt;math&gt;n   &lt;/math&gt; is the [[quantum number]] (now known as the [[principal quantum number]]). Bohr's predictions matched experiments measuring the [[hydrogen spectral series]] to the first order, giving more confidence to a theory that used quantized values.

For &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, the value
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{  m_e e^4}{2 ( 4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2 } =\frac{m_{\text{e}} e^4}{8 h^2 \varepsilon_0^2}= 1 \,\text{Ry} = 13.605\;692\;53(30) \,\text{eV} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="codata"&gt;P.J. Mohr, B.N. Taylor, and D.B. Newell (2011), "The 2010 CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants" (Web Version 6.0). This database was developed by J. Baker, M. Douma, and S. Kotochigova. Available: http://physics.nist.gov/constants. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?ryd Link to R&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;], [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rydhcev Link to hcR&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
is called the Rydberg unit of energy. It is related to the [[Rydberg constant]] &lt;math&gt;R_\infty&lt;/math&gt; of [[atomic physics]] by &lt;math&gt;1 \,\text{Ry} \equiv h c R_\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The exact value of the Rydberg constant assumes that the nucleus is infinitely massive with respect to the electron. For hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]]), and hydrogen-3 ([[tritium]]) the constant must be slightly modified to use the [[reduced mass]] of the system, rather than simply the mass of the electron. However, since the nucleus is much heavier than the electron, the values are nearly the same. The Rydberg constant ''R&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a hydrogen atom (one electron), ''R'' is given by

&lt;math&gt;R_M = \frac{R_\infty}{1+m_{\text{e}}/M},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the atomic nucleus.  For hydrogen-1, the quantity &lt;math&gt;m_{\text{e}}/M,&lt;/math&gt; is about 1/1836 (i.e. the electron-to-proton mass ratio). For deuterium and tritium, the ratios are about 1/3670 and 1/5497 respectively. These figures, when added to 1 in the denominator, represent very small corrections in the value of ''R'', and thus only small corrections to all energy levels in corresponding hydrogen isotopes.

There were still problems with Bohr's model: 
# it failed to predict other spectral details such as [[fine structure]] and [[hyperfine structure]]
# it could only predict energy levels with any accuracy for single–electron atoms (hydrogen–like atoms)
# the predicted values were only correct to &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2 \approx 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine-structure constant]].

Most of these shortcomings were repaired by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Arnold Sommerfeld's]] modification of the Bohr model. Sommerfeld introduced two additional degrees of freedom allowing an electron to move on an elliptical orbit, characterized by its [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[declination]] with respect to a chosen axis. This introduces two additional quantum numbers, which correspond to the orbital [[angular momentum]] and its projection on the chosen axis. Thus the correct multiplicity of states (except for the factor 2 accounting for the yet unknown electron spin) was found. Further applying special relativity theory to the elliptic orbits, Sommerfeld succeeded in deriving the correct expression for the fine structure of hydrogen spectra (which happens to be exactly the same as in the most elaborate Dirac theory). However some observed phenomena such as the anomalous [[Zeeman effect]] remain unexplained. These issues were resolved with the full development of quantum mechanics and the [[Dirac equation]]. It is often alleged, that the [[Schrödinger equation]] is superior to the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory in describing hydrogen atom. This is however not the case, as the most results of both approaches coincide or are very close (a remarkable exception is the problem of hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields, which cannot be solved in the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory self-consistently), and their main shortcomings result from the absence of the electron spin in both theories.  It was the complete failure of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to explain many-electron systems (such as helium atom or hydrogen molecule) which demonstrated its inadequacy in describing quantum phenomena.

=== Schrödinger equation ===
The Schrödinger equation allows one to calculate the development of quantum systems with time and can give exact, analytical answers for the non-relativistic hydrogen atom.

==== Wavefunction ====
The [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] of the hydrogen atom is the radial kinetic energy operator and coulomb attraction force between the positive proton and negative electron. Using the time-independent Schrödinger equation, ignoring all spin-coupling interactions and using the [[reduced mass]] &lt;math&gt;\mu=m_e M/(m_e + M)&lt;/math&gt;, the equation is written as:

&lt;math&gt;\left(- \frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu} \nabla^2  - \frac{  e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \right) \psi(r,\theta, \phi) = E \psi(r, \theta, \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the [[Laplace operator|Laplacian]] in spherical coordinates:

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu} \left[ \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial }{\partial r} \left( r^2 \frac{ \partial \psi}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta} \left( \sin \theta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \phi^2} \right] - \frac{e^2}{ 4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \psi= E \psi&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[Separation of variables|separable]], [[partial differential equation]] which can be solved in terms of special functions.  The normalized position [[wavefunction]]s, given in [[spherical coordinates]] are:
::&lt;math&gt; \psi_{n\ell m}(r,\vartheta,\varphi) = \sqrt {{\left (  \frac{2}{n a^*_0} \right )}^3 \frac{(n-\ell-1)!}{2n(n+\ell)!}} e^{- \rho / 2} \rho^{\ell} L_{n-\ell-1}^{2\ell+1}(\rho) Y_{\ell}^{m}(\vartheta, \varphi ) &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Hydrogen eigenstate n4 l3 m1.png|thumb|right|3D illustration of the eigenstate &lt;math&gt;\psi_{4,3,1}&lt;/math&gt;. Electrons in this state are 45% likely to be found within the solid body shown.]]
where:
::&lt;math&gt; \rho = {2r \over {n a^*_0}} &lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt; a^*_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Bohr radius]], &lt;math&gt;a^*_0={{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2}\over{\mu e^2}}&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt; L_{n-\ell-1}^{2\ell+1}(\rho) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Laguerre polynomial#Generalized Laguerre polynomials|generalized Laguerre polynomial]] of degree {{nowrap|''n'' − ''ℓ'' − 1}}, and
::&lt;math&gt; Y_{\ell}^{m}(\vartheta, \varphi ) \,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[spherical harmonic]] function of degree ''ℓ'' and order ''m''. Note that the generalized Laguerre polynomials are defined differently by different authors. The usage here is consistent with the definitions used by Messiah,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Messiah|first=Albert|title=Quantum Mechanics|date=1999|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0-486-40924-4|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mathematica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/LaguerreL.html LaguerreL]. Wolfram Mathematica page&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, the Laguerre polynomial includes a factor of &lt;math&gt;(n+\ell)!&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; or the generalized Laguerre polynomial appearing in the hydrogen wave function is &lt;math&gt; L_{n+\ell}^{2\ell+1}(\rho)&lt;/math&gt; instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condon and Shortley|title=The Theory of Atomic Spectra|date=1963|publisher=Cambridge|location=London|pages=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum numbers can take the following values: 
::&lt;math&gt; n=1,2,3,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\ell=0,1,2,\ldots,n-1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;m=-\ell,\ldots,\ell.&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, these wavefunctions are ''normalized'' (i.e., the integral of their modulus square equals 1) and [[Orthogonal functions|orthogonal]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\infty} r^2 dr\int_0^{\pi} \sin \vartheta d\vartheta \int_0^{2 \pi} d\varphi\; \psi^*_{n\ell m}(r,\vartheta,\varphi)\psi_{n'\ell'm'}(r,\vartheta,\varphi)=\langle n,\ell, m | n', \ell', m' \rangle = \delta_{nn'} \delta_{\ell\ell'} \delta_{mm'},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;| n, \ell, m \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the state represented by the wavefunction &lt;math&gt; \psi_{n\ell m} &lt;/math&gt; in [[Dirac notation]], and &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] function.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Ch. 4 p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

The wavefunctions in momentum space are related to the wavefunctions in position space through a Fourier transform

::&lt;math&gt; \phi(p, \vartheta_p, \varphi_p) = (2\pi\hbar)^{-3/2} \int e^{-i \vec{p} \cdot \vec{r} / \hbar} \psi(r,\vartheta,\varphi) dV, &lt;/math&gt;

which, for the bound states, results in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

::&lt;math&gt; \phi(p, \vartheta_p, \varphi_p) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi} \frac{(n-l-1)!}{(n+l)!}} n^2 2^{2l+2} l! \frac{n^l p^l}{(n^2 p^2 + 1)^{l+2}} C_{n-l-1}^{l+1}\left(\frac{n^2 p^2 - 1}{n^2 p^2 + 1}\right) Y_l^m({\vartheta_p, \varphi_p}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; C_N^\alpha(x) &lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[Gegenbauer polynomial]] and &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is in units of &lt;math&gt; \hbar/a^*_0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The solutions to the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen are [[analytical expression|analytical]], giving a simple expression for the hydrogen [[energy levels]] and thus the frequencies of the hydrogen [[spectral line]]s and fully reproduced the Bohr model and went beyond it. It also yields two other quantum numbers and the shape of the electron's wave function ("orbital") for the various possible quantum-mechanical states, thus explaining the [[anisotropic]] character of atomic bonds.

The Schrödinger equation also applies to more complicated atoms and [[molecule]]s. When there is more than one electron or nucleus the solution is not analytical and either computer calculations are necessary or simplifying assumptions must be made.

Since the Schrödinger equation is only valid for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the solutions it yields for the hydrogen atom are not entirely correct. The [[Dirac equation]] of relativistic quantum theory improves these solutions (see below).

==== Results of Schrödinger equation ====
The solution of the Schrödinger equation (wave equation) for the hydrogen atom uses the fact that the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb potential]] produced by the nucleus is [[isotropic]] (it is radially symmetric in space and only depends on the distance to the nucleus). Although the resulting [[energy eigenfunctions]] (the ''orbitals'') are not necessarily isotropic themselves, their dependence on the [[Spherical coordinate system|angular coordinates]] follows completely generally from this isotropy of the underlying potential: the [[eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] (that is, the energy eigenstates) can be chosen as simultaneous eigenstates of the [[angular momentum operator]]. This corresponds to the fact that angular momentum is conserved in the [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] of the electron around the nucleus. Therefore, the energy eigenstates may be classified by two angular momentum [[quantum number]]s, ''ℓ'' and ''m'' (both are integers). The angular momentum quantum number {{nowrap|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, ...}} determines the magnitude of the angular momentum. The magnetic quantum number {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} −''ℓ'', ..., +''ℓ''}} determines the projection of the angular momentum on the (arbitrarily chosen) ''z''-axis.

In addition to mathematical expressions for total angular momentum and angular momentum projection of wavefunctions, an expression for the radial dependence of the wave functions must be found. It is only here that the details of the 1/''r'' Coulomb potential enter (leading to [[Laguerre polynomials]] in ''r''). This leads to a third quantum number, the principal quantum number {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3, ...}}. The principal quantum number in hydrogen is related to the atom's total energy.

Note that the maximum value of the angular momentum quantum number is limited by the principal quantum number: it can run only up to ''n'' − 1, i.e. {{nowrap|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0, 1, ..., ''n'' − 1}}.

Due to angular momentum conservation, states of the same ''ℓ'' but different ''m'' have the same energy (this holds for all problems with [[rotational symmetry]]). In addition, for the hydrogen atom, states of the same ''n'' but different ''ℓ'' are also [[degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] (i.e. they have the same energy). However, this is a specific property of hydrogen and is no longer true for more complicated atoms which have an (effective) potential differing from the form 1/''r'' (due to the presence of the inner electrons shielding the nucleus potential).

Taking into account the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the electron adds a last quantum number, the projection of the electron's spin angular momentum along the ''z''-axis, which can take on two values. Therefore, any [[eigenstate]] of the electron in the hydrogen atom is described fully by four quantum numbers. According to the usual rules of quantum mechanics, the actual state of the electron may be any [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of these states. This explains also why the choice of ''z''-axis for the directional [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of the angular momentum vector is immaterial: an orbital of given ''ℓ'' and ''m''&amp;prime; obtained for another preferred axis ''z''&amp;prime; can always be represented as a suitable superposition of the various states of different ''m'' (but same ''l'') that have been obtained for ''z''.

==== Mathematical summary of eigenstates of hydrogen atom ====
{{main|Hydrogen-like atom}}

In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]] found [[Dirac equation|an equation]] that was fully compatible with [[Special Relativity]], and (as a consequence) made the wave function a 4-component "[[Dirac spinor]]" including "up" and "down" spin components, with both positive and "negative" energy (or matter and antimatter). The solution to this equation gave the following results, more accurate than the Schrödinger solution.

=====Energy levels=====
The energy levels of hydrogen, including [[fine structure]] (excluding [[Lamb shift]] and [[hyperfine structure]]), are given by the [[Fine-structure constant|Sommerfeld fine structure]] expression:&lt;ref name="Sommerfeld"&gt;{{cite book|first=Arnold |last= Sommerfeld|title=Atombau und Spektrallinien'|  publisher=Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn|location=Braunschweig|year=1919|isbn=3-87144-484-7}} [https://archive.org/stream/atombauundspekt00sommgoog German] [https://archive.org/details/AtomicStructureAndSpectralLines English]&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl} E_{j\,n} &amp; = -\mu c^2\left[1-\left(1+\left[\dfrac{\alpha}{n-j-\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{\left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2-\alpha^2}}\right]^2\right)^{-1/2}\right] \\ &amp; \approx -\dfrac{\mu c^2\alpha^2}{2n^2} \left[1 + \dfrac{\alpha^2}{n^2}\left(\dfrac{n}{j+\frac{1}{2}} - \dfrac{3}{4} \right) \right] , \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' is the [[fine-structure constant]] and ''j'' is the "total angular momentum" [[quantum number]], which is equal to |''ℓ'' ± {{sfrac|1|2}}| depending on the direction of the electron spin. This formula represents a small correction to the energy obtained by Bohr and Schrödinger as given above. The factor in square brackets in the last expression is nearly one; the extra term arises from relativistic effects (for details, see [[#Features going beyond the Schrödinger solution]]). It is worth noting that this expression was first obtained by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|A. Sommerfeld]] in 1916 based on the relativistic version of the [[Old quantum theory|old Bohr theory]]. Sommerfeld has however used different notation for the quantum numbers.

For all pictures the magnetic quantum number ''m'' has been set to 0, and the cross-sectional plane is the ''xz''-plane (''z'' is the vertical axis). The probability density in three-dimensional space is obtained by rotating the one shown here around the ''z''-axis.

The "[[ground state]]", i.e. the state of lowest energy, in which the electron is usually found, is the first one, the 1''s'' state ([[principal quantum level]] ''n'' = 1, ''ℓ'' = 0).

Black lines occur in each but the first orbital: these are the nodes of the wavefunction, i.e. where the probability density is zero.  (More precisely, the nodes are [[spherical harmonics]] that appear as a result of solving [[Schrödinger equation]] in polar coordinates.)

The [[quantum number]]s determine the layout of these nodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.byu.edu/faculty/durfee/courses/Summer2009/physics222/AtomicQuantumNumbers.pdf Summary of atomic quantum numbers]. Lecture notes. 28 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There are:
* &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; total nodes,
* &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of which are angular nodes:
** &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; angular nodes go around the &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; axis (in the xy plane). &lt;small&gt;(The figure above does not show these nodes since it plots cross-sections through the xz-plane.)&lt;/small&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;l-m&lt;/math&gt; (the remaining angular nodes) occur on the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (vertical) axis.
* &lt;math&gt;n - l - 1&lt;/math&gt; (the remaining non-angular nodes) are radial nodes.

==== Features going beyond the Schrödinger solution ====
There are several important effects that are neglected by the Schrödinger equation and which are responsible for certain small but measurable deviations of the real spectral lines from the predicted ones:

* Although the mean speed of the electron in hydrogen is only 1/137th of the [[speed of light]], many modern experiments are sufficiently precise that a complete theoretical explanation requires a fully relativistic treatment of the problem. A relativistic treatment results in a momentum increase of about 1 part in 37,000 for the electron. Since the electron's wavelength is determined by its momentum, orbitals containing higher speed electrons show contraction due to smaller wavelengths.
* Even when there is no external [[magnetic field]], in the [[inertial frame]] of the moving electron, the electromagnetic field of the nucleus has a magnetic component. The spin of the electron has an associated [[magnetic moment]] which interacts with this magnetic field. This effect is also explained by special relativity, and it leads to the so-called ''[[spin-orbit coupling]]'', i.e., an interaction between the [[electron]]'s [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] around the nucleus, and its [[spin (physics)|spin]].

Both of these features (and more) are incorporated in the relativistic [[Dirac equation]], with predictions that come still closer to experiment. Again the Dirac equation may be solved analytically in the special case of a two-body system, such as the hydrogen atom. The resulting solution quantum states now must be classified by the [[Total angular momentum quantum number|total angular momentum number]] ''j'' (arising through the coupling between [[electron spin]] and [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]]). States of the same ''j'' and the same ''n'' are still degenerate. Thus, direct analytical solution of [[Dirac equation]] predicts 2S({{sfrac|1|2}}) and 2P({{sfrac|1|2}}) levels of Hydrogen to have exactly the same energy, which is in a contradiction with observations ([[Lamb shift|Lamb-Retherford experiment]]).

* There are always [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s of the [[electromagnetic field]], according to quantum mechanics. Due to such fluctuations degeneracy between states of the same j but different l is lifted, giving them slightly different energies. This has been demonstrated in the famous [[Lamb shift|Lamb-Retherford experiment]] and was the starting point for the development of the theory of [[Quantum electrodynamics]] (which is able to deal with these vacuum fluctuations and employs the famous [[Feynman diagram]]s for approximations using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]). This effect is now called [[Lamb shift]].

For these developments, it was essential that the solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom could be worked out exactly, such that any experimentally observed deviation had to be taken seriously as a signal of failure of the theory.

== Alternatives to the Schrödinger theory ==
In the language of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[matrix mechanics]], the hydrogen  atom was first solved by [[Wolfgang Pauli]]&lt;ref name="pauli_1926"&gt;

and the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]]. By extending the symmetry group O(4) to the [[dynamical group]] O(4,2),
the entire spectrum and all transitions were embedded in a single irreducible group representation.&lt;ref&gt;

'''i-Tree''' is a collection of urban and rural [[forestry]] analysis and benefits assessment tools.  It was designed and developed by the [[United States Forest Service]] to quantify and value [[ecosystem services]] provided by trees including pollution removal, [[carbon sequestration]], avoided [[carbon emissions]], avoided [[stormwater runoff]], and more. i-Tree provides baseline data so that the growth of trees can be followed over time, and is used for planning purposes. Different tools within the i-Tree Suite use different types of inputs and provide different kinds of reports; some tools use a 'bottom up' approach based on tree inventories on the ground, while other tools use a 'top down' approach based on [[remote sensing]] data. i-Tree is peer-reviewed and has a process of ongoing collaboration to improve it.

There are seven different i-Tree applications which can enhance an individual's or organization's understanding of the benefits which trees provide in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itreetools.org/applications.php|title=i-Tree Applications|website=www.itreetools.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of many years the U.S. Forest Service has developed and refined these different applications: i-Tree Eco, i-Tree Landscape, i-Tree Hydro, i-Tree Design, i-Tree Canopy, i-Tree Species, i-Tree MyTree, i-Tree Streets, and i-Tree Vue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itreetools.org/applications.php|title=i-Tree Applications|website=www.itreetools.org|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

i-Tree began in 2002 as survey of a sample of urban forest to simulate taking a [[tree inventory]] of an entire urban forest.  It then added hand held devices for efficient inventory of street trees.  The current version of i-Tree includes different tools which allow for several sources of data to be used, such as National Land Cover Data, Google Maps, and tree inventories. Some tools use continuous data on air pollution and meteorology for more accurate results.

== Research ==

Researchers using i-Tree have examined:

* The benefits of urban trees&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Selecting the best tree planting locations&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Storm damage to urban forests&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Potential bird habitats&lt;ref&gt;Lerman, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* PM2.5 removal and health effect&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gunnbjørn Fjeld 1400x1320.jpg|thumb|400px|The summit of [[Gunnbjørn Fjeld|Gunnbjørn&amp;nbsp;Fjeld]] is the highest point on the [[Island of Greenland|Island&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Greenland]], [[Kalaallit Nunaat|Kalaallit&amp;nbsp;Nunaat]], the [[Kingdom of Denmark|Kingdom&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Denmark]], and the entire [[Arctic]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''38 [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summits]] of the nation of [[Greenland]] ([[Kalaallit Nunaat]])'''.  Each of these peaks has at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]].&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some type of foods were always common in every continent, such as many [[seafood]] and plants. Examples of these types of food are [[honey]], [[ants]], [[mussels]], [[crabs]] and [[coconuts]]. [[Nikolai Vavilov]] initially identified the [[centers of origin]] for eight crop plants, subdividing them further into twelve groups in 1935.&lt;ref name="Corinto 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corinto|first=Gian Luigi|date=2014|title=Nikolai Vavilov’s Centers of Origin of Cultivated Plants With a View to Conserving Agricultural Biodiversity. |journal=Human Evolution||volume=29|issue=4|pages=285-301 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267349404_Nikolai_Vavilov's_Centers_of_Origin_of_Cultivated_Plants_With_a_View_to_Conserving_Agricultural_Biodiversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacific Northwest====

Provisionally, this is primarily southern [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]], though much is in common with Coast Salish overall.

Anthropogenic [[grassland]]s were maintained.  The south Coast Salish may have had more vegetables and land game than people farther north or on the outer coast. [[Salmon]] and other [[fish]] were staples in this area.  There was ''[[Kokanee salmon|kokanee]]'', a freshwater fish in the [[Lake Washington]] and [[Lake Sammamish]] watersheds.  [[Shellfish]] were abundant.  [[Butter clams]], [[horse clams]], and [[Lolium temulentum|cockles]] were dried for trade.

Hunting was specialized; professions were probably sea hunters, land hunters, and fowlers.  Water fowl were captured on moonless nights using strategic flares.

The managed [[grassland]]s not only provided game habitat, but vegetable sprouts, roots, bulbs, berries, and nuts were foraged from them as well as found wild.  The most important were probably [[bracken]] and [[Camassia|camas]], and [[Sagittaria|wapato]] especially for the [[Duwamish (tribe)|Duwamish]].  Many, many varieties of berries were foraged; some were harvested with comblike devices not reportedly used elsewhere.  [[Acorn]]s were relished but were not widely available.  Regional tribes went in autumn to the [[Nisqually River|Nisqually]] Flats (Nisqually plains) to harvest them.&lt;ref name=Suttle&amp;Lane488-9 &gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last =Suttle | first =Wayne P. |author2=Lane, Barbara  | editor =Sturtevant, William C. | encyclopedia =Handbook of North American Indians | title =South Coast Salish | url = | edition = | date =1990-08-20 | publisher =Smithsonian Institution | volume =7.

The Neolithic founder crops (or primary domesticates) are the eight plant [[species]] that were [[Domestication|domesticated]] by early [[Holocene]] ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) farming communities in the [[Fertile Crescent]] region of [[southwest Asia]], and which formed the basis of systematic [[agriculture]] in the Middle East, North Africa, India, [[Persia]] and (later) Europe. They consist of [[flax]], three [[cereal]]s and four [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]], and are the first known domesticated plants in the world. Although domesticated [[rye]] (''Secale cereale'') occurs in the final Epi-Palaeolithic strata at [[Tell Abu Hureyra]] (the earliest instance of a domesticated plant species), it was insignificant in the Neolithic Period of southwest Asia and only became common with the spread of farming into [[northern Europe]] several millennia later.

===Mediterranean===
There was a great deal of commerce between the provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. All the regions of the empire became interdependent with one another; some provinces specialized in the production of grain, others in [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] and others in [[olive oil]], depending on the soil type.  Columella writes in his ''Res Rustica'', "Soil that is heavy, chalky, and wet is not unsuited to the growing for [[winter wheat]]  and [[spelt]]. [[Barley]] tolerates no place except one that is loose and dry."&lt;ref&gt;Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella, On Agriculture (Res Rustica), (Loeb Classical Library), Book II page 145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] writes extensively about agriculture from books XII to XIX; in fact, XVIII is ''The Natural History of Grain''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+toc&lt;/ref&gt; Crops grown on Roman farms included [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[millet]], [[pea]], [[broad bean]], [[lentil]], [[flax]], [[sesame]], [[chickpea]], [[hemp]], [[turnip]], [[olives]], [[pear]], [[apples]], [[figs]], and [[plums]]. Others in the Mediterranean include:
* [[Beet]]s

The first instances of domestication of plants for agricultural purposes in Africa occurred in the [[Sahel]] region circa 5000 BCE, when [[sorghum]] and [[Oryza glaberrima|African Rice]] (''Oryza glaberrima'') began to be cultivated. Around this time, and in the same region, [[Fonio]] and the small [[guineafowl]] were domesticated.

Around 4000 BCE the climate of the Sahara and the Sahel started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace. This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing [[desertification]]. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more humid climate of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Patrick K. (General Editor). ''Oxford Atlas of World History''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous crop domesticated in the [[Ethiopian highlands]] is [[coffee]]. [[Khat]], [[ensete]], [[noog]], [[teff]] and [[finger millet]] were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands. Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include [[sorghum]] and [[pearl millet]]. The [[kola nut]], extracts from which became an ingredient in [[Coca-Cola]], was first domesticated in West Africa. Other crops domesticated in West Africa include [[African rice]], [[African yam]]s,  [[black-eyed pea]]s and the [[oil palm]].&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

==Polynesia==
* ''[[Alpinia galanga]]''
* [[Casuarina]]

===Australia===
* [[Aniseed myrtle]]
* [[Macadamia nut]]s

====Fruits of Australian origin====
Although the fruits of Australia were eaten for thousands of years as [[bushfood]] by [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] people, they have only been recently recognized for their culinary qualities by non-indigenous people. Many are regarded for their piquancy and spice-like qualities for use in cooking and [[preserves]]. Some Australian fruits also have exceptional nutritional qualities, including high [[vitamin C]] and other [[antioxidants]].

==Current importance of food origins==

In 2016, researchers linked the origins and primary regions of diversity ("areas typically including the locations of the initial domestication of crops, encompassing the primary geographical zones of crop variation generated since that time, and containing relatively high species richness in crop wild relatives") of food and agricultural crops with their current importance around the world in modern national food supplies and agricultural production. The results indicated that national diets and farm production around the world were generally composed of a large set of crops from many diverse origins. Foreign crops (crops whose origins do not include the same region as the country) comprised 68.7% of national food supplies as a global mean, and their usage has increased in the last fifty years.&lt;ref name=Khouryorigins&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Khoury, C.K.; Achicanoy, H.A.; Bjorkman, A.D.; Navarro-Racines, C.; Guarino, L.; Flores-Palacios, X.; Engels, J.M.M.; Wiersema, J.H.; Dempewolf, H.; Sotelo, S.; Ramírez-Villegas, J.; Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P.; Fowler, C.; Jarvis, A.; Rieseberg, L.H.; Struik, P.C. |title=Origins of food crops connect countries worldwide |journal=Proc.

{{Weather}}

== Examples Include ==
Severe weather can occur under a variety of situations, but three characteristics are generally needed:  a temperature or moisture boundary, moisture, and (in the event of severe, precipitation-based events) instability in the atmosphere.

* [[Cyclone]] (generic)
** [[Arctic cyclone]]
* [[Fog]]
* [[Heat wave]]
* [[Cold wave]]
* [[Severe thunderstorm]] ([[hail]]storm, [[downburst]]: [[microburst]]/[[macroburst]])
** [[Supercell]]
** [[Derecho]]
** [[Squall line]]
* [[Tornado]] (also colloquially referred to as a "whirlwind" or "twister")
** [[Waterspout]]
* [[Tropical cyclone]] (also called a hurricane, typhoon, or "cyclone")
* [[Windstorm]] (gradient pressure induced)
** [[European windstorm]]s
* [[Winter storms]]
** [[Blizzard]]
** [[Ice storm]]
** [[Hurricane]]

== Phenomena not caused by thunderstorms==
* [[Avalanche]]

* [[Dust storm]], [[haboob]], [[Dust devil]]
* [[Landslide]], [[mudslide]]
* [[Flood]], [[flash flood]]
* [[Wildfire]], [[firestorm]]
** [[Fire whirl]]
* High Seas
* [[Zud]]

== Phenomena caused by severe thunderstorms ==
* [[Hail|Large Hail]]

'''Mare Serenitatis''' ("'''Sea of Serenity'''") is a [[lunar mare]] located to the east of [[Mare Imbrium]] on the [[Moon]].  Its diameter is {{convert|674|km|mi|abbr=on}} long covering about 7.5% of the circumference of the Moon.

==Geology==
Mare Serenitatis is located within the Serenitatis basin, which is of the [[Nectarian]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]. The material surrounding the mare is of the [[Lower Imbrian]] epoch, while the mare material is of the [[Upper Imbrian]] epoch. The mare [[basalt]] covers a majority of the basin and overflows into [[Lacus Somniorum]] to the  northeast. The most noticeable feature is the crater [[Posidonius (crater)|Posidonius]] on the northeast rim of the mare.&lt;ref name="ccastronomy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lunar Map |publisher=[http://www.ccastronomy.org/ Central Coast Astronomical Society] |url=http://www.ccastronomy.org/photo_tour_Moon_Map.jpg |accessdate=2009-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718055301/http://www.ccastronomy.org/photo_tour_Moon_Map.jpg |archivedate=July 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ring feature to the west of the mare is indistinct, except for [[Montes Haemus]]. Mare Serenitatis connects with [[Mare Tranquillitatis]] to the southeast and borders [[Mare Vaporum]] to the southwest.  Mare Serenitatis is an example of a [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascon]], an anomalous gravitational region on the moon.

A [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]] (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Serenitatis from Doppler tracking of the five [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]] spacecraft in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.161.3842.680 | title = Mascons: Lunar Mass Concentrations | year = 1968 | author = P. M. Muller, W. L. Sjogren | journal = Science | volume =  161 | issue = 3842  | pages = 680–684 | pmid=17801458| bibcode = 1968Sci...161..680M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mascon was confirmed and mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as [[Lunar Prospector]] and [[Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory|GRAIL]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Serenitatis was named by [[Giovanni Riccioli]], whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] had included it among the Regio Magna Occidentalis ("Large Western Region") in his map of ''c''.1600.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Gassendi]] had included it among the 'Homuncio' ('little man'), referring to a small humanoid figure that he could see among the maria; Gassendi also referred to it as 'Thersite' after [[Thersites]], the ugliest warrior in the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Van Langren]] had labelled it the Mare Eugenianum ("Eugenia's Sea") in his 1645 map,&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.41, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; in honour of [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]], queen of the [[Spanish Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/langren.html&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Johannes Hevelius]] included it within Pontus Euxinus (after the classical name for the [[Black Sea]]) in his 1647 map.

==Exploration==
Both [[Luna 21]] and [[Apollo 17]] landed near the eastern border of Mare Serenitatis, in the area of the [[Montes Taurus]] range. Apollo 17 landed specifically in the [[Taurus-Littrow]] valley, and Luna 21 landed in [[Le Monnier (crater)|Le Monnier]] crater.

==Selenography==
Numerous craters in and touching the sea include [[Abetti (crater)|Abetti]], [[Banting (crater)|Banting]], [[Bessel (crater)|Bessel]], [[Bobillier (crater)|Bobillier]], [[Borel (crater)|Borel]], [[Deseilligny (crater)|Deseilligny]], [[Finsch (crater)|Finsch]], [[Linné (crater)|Linné]], [[Le Monnier (crater)|Le Monnier]], [[Luther (crater)|Luther]], [[Sarabhai (crater)|Sarabhai]] and [[Very (lunar crater)|Very]] and a few more. Ridges inside and touching the sea (plain) include [[Dorsa Aldrovandi]], [[Dorsum Azara]], [[Dorsum Buckland]], [[Dorsum Von Cotta]], [[Dorsum Gast]], [[Dorsa Lister]], [[Dorsum Nicol]], [[Dorsum Owen]], [[Dorsa Smirnov]] and [[Dorsa Sorby]].

Image:Mare Serenetatis AS17-M-0940-0947-0954.jpg|These are three views of Mare Serenitatis, taken by the mapping camera of the [[Apollo 17]] mission in 1972, facing north-northeast from an average altitude of 107&amp;nbsp;km.  At the right is the east margin of Mare Serenitatis, with the 95&amp;nbsp;km diameter crater [[Posidonius (crater)|Posidonius]] at the central horizon, the basalt-flooded [[Le Monnier (crater)|Le Monnier]] crater to the south, the mare ridge (or [[wrinkle ridge]]) [[Dorsa Aldrovandi]] at center, [[Littrow (crater)|Littrow]] crater at the right, and the landing site of Apollo 17 in the lower right corner in the [[Taurus–Littrow]] valley. In the center is the relatively small crater [[Bessel (crater)|Bessel]] (16&amp;nbsp;km), and two prominent rays probably from the [[Tycho (lunar crater)|Tycho]] impact far to the south. At the left is the western margin of the mare, with the [[Montes Caucasus|Caucasus Mountains]] at the central horizon, the [[Montes Apenninus|Apennine Mountains]] at left, and the [[Sulpicius Gallus (crater)|Sulpicius Gallus Rilles]] at the lower right. The sun elevation drops from 24 degrees at right to 5 degrees at left as the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] ''America'' orbited the moon.
Image:Mare Serenitatis AS17-150-23069.jpg|Some of the strongest tonal, color, and structural contrasts among mare materials occur in Mare Serenitatis. This color Apollo 17 image shows that the dark materials were emplaced before the lighter materials near the top.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Mare Serenitatis forms one of the eyes for the [[Man in the Moon]].
*In ''[[Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal]]'', Mare Serenitatis is the location of Silver Millennium and the original Moon Castle.
*Mare Serenitatis is also mentioned in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s [[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]].
*Most of the action in [[John Wyndham]]'s 1933 short story "The Last Lunarians" takes place on the edge of the Sea of Serenity.
*Mare Serentitatis borders the Authority moon colony in Robert Heinlein's "[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]".

'''Measurement and Verification''' (M&amp;V) is the term given to the process for quantifying savings delivered by an [[Energy conservation measure|Energy Conservation Measure]] (ECM), as well as the sub-sector of the energy industry involved with this practice.

Measurement and Verification demonstrates how much energy the ECM has avoided using, rather than the total ''cost'' saved. The latter can be affected by many factors, such as energy prices. The Measurement and Verification process enables the energy savings delivered by the ECM to be isolated and fairly evaluated.

Various protocols for good practice in Measurement and Verification exist, including the [[IPMVP|International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol]] (IPMVP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.evo-world.org | title= Efficiency Valuation Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; which defines common terminology and the key steps in implementing a robust M&amp;V process.

A key part of the M&amp;V process is the development of an ‘M&amp;V Plan’, which defines how the savings analysis will be conducted before the ECM is implemented.  This provides a degree of objectivity that is absent if the savings are simply evaluated after implementation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11280">'''Microspherulites''' are microscopic spherical particles with diameter less than two&amp;nbsp;mm, usually in the 100 micrometre range, mainly consisting of mineral material (the Greek ''litos'' means "stone"). Only bodies created by natural physico-chemical processes, with no contribution of either biological (in [[aqueous]] [[depositional environment|sedimentary environments]] this contribution is possible) or human activity, are considered to be microspherulites.
Generally speaking, the common feature ([[sphericity]]) indicates that each sphere represents an internal equilibrium of forces within a fluid medium (water, air).

==Classification==

Several types of these forms are found in nature. Depending on the formational environment, microspherulites can be classed as [[oolite]]s, [[micrometeorite]]s, impact spherulites, [[iberulite]]s, [[pisolite]]s, [[Meteorite|aerolites]], [[chondrule]]s, [[biolite]]s, pellets, bubbles, or carbonaceous microspherules.

===Aqueous environment===
[[File:Detailed group of oolites.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Figure 1: Oolites observed with a transmitted light microscope.]]

* Oolites are internally structured spheres, composed mainly by [[calcium carbonate]] (Figure 1).  They are a type of constituent in [[limestone]]. The size of these [[ooid]]s ranges between 0.25 and 2&amp;nbsp;mm. The name derives from the Greek ''ooion'' (egg). They are formed by growing larger and accreting material as they move around. They accomplish this either (a) by physical attachment of [[Granularity|fine-grained]] material as they roll around, much in the manner of a snowball, and (b) by the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] of material in solution, much as salt crystallizes from water during evaporation. In the former case they have thin concentric layers, and in the latter they have radiating sprays of crystals. However, a combination of both processes can be found. Microbes could contribute to their development.

===Aerial environment===

* Micrometeorites are typically metallic microspherules (iron or iron and nickel) but can also be formed by [[silicate minerals]], whose dimensions must range from tens of micrometres to one millimetre. They correspond to pieces of extraterrestrial [[meteoroids]], resulting from melting and vaporization during entry into the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth’s atmosphere]]. During this melt stage a significant loss of mass can occur through holes in their surface. The degree of heating and their original composition determine that only a few minerals have been founded in micrometeorites. They have not yet been properly classified.
* Impact spherulites occur when a large extraterrestrial object strikes Earth at cosmic velocity, melts and vaporizes, silicate materials can condense into high spheroidal, sand-sized particles deposited around the point of impact. Unaltered impact spherulites consist entirely of glass ([[Tektite|microtektites]]) or a combination of glass and crystals grown in flight (microkrystites). Primary crystals are only common in microspherulites from two [[Phanerozoic]] impact layers: the Upper Eocene microkrystite or [[clinopyroxene]] spherule layer &lt;ref name="vr1"&gt;Glass, B.P., Burns, C.A., Crosbie, J.R., DuBois, D.L., 1985. Late Eocene North American Microtektites and Clinopyroxene-Bearing Spherules, Proceedings of the Sixteenth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Part 1. [[Journal of Geophysical Research]] 90, D 175-D 196.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary]] (K/T boundary) layer.&lt;ref name="vr2"&gt;Smit, J., 1999: The global stratigraphy of the. Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact ejecta. Annu. Rev. Earth Planetary Science, 27: 75-113. [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/action/doSearch?action=runSearch&amp;type=advanced&amp;result=true&amp;prevSearch=%2Bauthorsfield%3A(Smit%2C+J.)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other crystalline phases may be [[olivine]], ''Fe-rich pyroxene'', [[spinel]]s and [[feldspar]]s. Frequently the crystals are replaced by [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]] phases such as [[goethite]], [[pyrite]], [[glauconite]], ''[[K-feldspar]]s'', [[quartz]], [[sericite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], and ''carbonates''.

[[File:Group of iberulites.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 2: Group of iberulites observed under Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The arrows show vortex position.]]
* [[Iberulite]]s are ''co-associations'' of well-defined minerals, together with non-crystalline compounds, with axial geometry and a characteristic depression (vortex), structured around a coarse-grained core with a [[Clay minerals|smectite]]  rind, and pinkish colour (Figure 2). They are formed at present in the [[troposphere]] by complex [[aerosol]]-water-gas interactions. The modal size is in the 60-90 micrometre range, and the shapes are almost perfect spheres. Their name comes from the [[Iberian Peninsula]], indicating the place where they were discovered.&lt;ref name="vr3"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L., 2000. Aportaciones sólidas a la atmósfera originadas por un incendio forestal en el ámbito mediterráneo. Estudios Geológicos 56, 153–161. [http://estudiosgeol.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgeol/article/viewFile/147/146]&lt;/ref&gt;  They are related to intrusions of aerosol plumes from the [[Sahara desert]]. The mineralogy of the core (tens of micrometres thick) is commonly formed by [[quartz]], [[calcite]], [[dolomite]]  and [[feldspar]]s, while the most frequent minerals of the rind (a few micrometres thick) are [[clay minerals]], mainly smectites (beidellite, [[montmorillonite]]) and [[illite]], amorphous [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]  and impregnation of [[sulfate minerals]]   (mainly [[gypsum]], [[alunite]] and [[jarosite]]) and [[halide minerals|chlorides]].&lt;ref name="vr4"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L., Párraga, 2008.

==Other related terms==

* Pisolites are spheroidal particles, larger in size and commonly more distorted than ooids. The name derives from the Greek ''pisos'' (pea). Mineral concentrations ([[bauxite]]s, [[limonite]]s, [[siderite]]s) and the pedogenic [[Caliche (mineral)|caliches]] (subaerial environment) can have pisolitic structure. They usually reach 5–8&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and for this reason they can not strictly be considered microspherulites. Dunham (1969) &lt;ref name="vr5"&gt;Dunham, R.J., 1969. Vadose pisolites in the Capitan Reefs (Permian) New Mexico and Texas, in Depositional Environments in carbonate rocks: Soc. Econ. Palaeontologists and Mineralogists Spec. Publ. 14, 182-191.&lt;/ref&gt;  considered them associated to caliches, while Pray and Esteban (1977) &lt;ref name="vr6"&gt;Esteban, M., Pray, L.C., 1977. Origin of the pisolite facies of the shelf crest. In: Upper Guadalupian facies Permian Reef complex, Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico and West Texas. 1977 Field Conference Guidebook. Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, Permian Basin Section, Publication 77-16: 479-483.
[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/gumo/1993_26/bibliography.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; suggested they were formed by inorganic precipitation from [[brine]]s.

* Aerolite is a generic term indicating lithogenic elements gathered from the atmosphere. This term does not imply sphericity or microscopic size.
* Chondrules are the microscopic constituents of [[chondrite]]s that represent 80% of the [[meteorite]]s that fall to the Earth per the   [[Meteoritical Society]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Chondrules range in diameter from a few micrometres to over 1&amp;nbsp;cm. They are formed by rapid heating of solid precursor material and subsequent melting, followed by slow cooling. Their main composition is silicate minerals such as olivine and [[pyroxene]], surrounded by feldspars (crystalline or glassy); minor minerals are ''Fe-sulfide'', metallic Fe-Ni and [[oxide]]s.
* Biolites are biologically produced, many organisms can produce mineral particles dubbed in general biolites. Their shape, size and composition may be very varied. As examples we can cite [[otolith|otolites]] (compounds of the [[vestibular system]] of the [[inner ear]]) and the calculi resulting from various [[histopathology|histopathologies]]. Studies have confirmed that microorganisms are able to precipitate minerals.&lt;ref name="vr7"&gt;Verrecchia, E.P., Freytet, P., Verrecchia, K.E., Dumont, J.L., 1995. Spherulites in calcrete laminar crusts: biogenic CaCO3, precipitation as a major contributor to crust formation. J. Sed. Research A65, 690–700.
[http://jsedres.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/reprint/65/4a/690?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;author1=Verrecchia&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;field_name=fulltext&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;fdate=5/1/1931&amp;tdate=10/31/2008&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pellets are those homogeneous aggregates with no internal structure, consisting of [[Micrite|micritic calcite]], spherical to ellipsoidal in shape and with sizes between 0.03 and 0.15&amp;nbsp;mm. They are thought to be faecal particles from aquatic organisms.

[[File:Glass microspherulites.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 3: Solid glass microspheres used like ingredients in road and street signaling paintings.]]
* Bubbles include frequently unstable spherules which may be produced by the dispersion of two immiscible fluids forming an emulsion. Usually this term is applied to air-water [[emulsion]]s, but it is also valid for water-air (hazes, drops) or other liquid fluids (oil-water).
* Carbonaceous microspherules are a type of [[soot]] particle floating in the atmosphere, produced by [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] combustion processes of fuels, and may be coated with a layer of adsorbed hydrocarbons, sulfates or both. These particles are hollow microspherules that are black in colour, and made up of carbon or [[graphite]]. The size ranges from tens to a hundred micrometres.
* Artefacts are spherules intentionally produced spherical particles for use in industry or medicine. The shape is often perfectly spherical, truly uniform and size ranging ~ 50&amp;nbsp;nm to 1000&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Nanoparticle|nanospheres]]), or 1&amp;nbsp;µm to 1000&amp;nbsp;µm ([[microsphere]]s). They may be made up of organic-inorganic compounds and provided with different properties. In fact, commercially, microspheres can be found manufactured from materials such as glass, polymers (polyethylene, polystyrene) or ceramic. Microspheres can be solid or hollow, and so their density will be very different as well as their applications. Hollow microspheres usually are added to reduce the density of a material. Solid microspheres have numerous applications depending on their size and their manufacture material. Solid glass microspheres are used in fields such as roads and streets signaling (Figure 3). They are added to paintings used for traffic signs and roadway surface signaling to incorporate the retroreflective effect. So they improve the night visibility of the way.

The '''New Caledonia rain forests''' are a [[terrestrial ecoregion]], located in [[New Caledonia]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. It is a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] ecoregion, part of the [[Australasia ecozone]].

==Setting==
[[File:Melaleuca quinquenervia in Australia.jpg|thumb|200px|Original distribution area of [[Melaleuca quinquenervia]] or Niaouli]]
[[File:Nothofagus demis.JPG|thumb|200px|''[[Nothofagus]]'' is a plant genus that illustrates Gondwanan distribution, having descended from the supercontinent and existing in current day Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia and Chile. Fossils have also recently been found in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = H.M. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Z.K. | year = 2007 | title = Fossil nothofagaceous leaves from the Eocene of western Antarctica and their bearing on the origin, dispersal and systematics of Nothofagus | url = | journal = Science in China | volume = 50 | issue = 10| pages = 1525–1535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ecoregion covers the [[windward]] eastern side of Grand Terre, New Caledonia's mountainous main island, as well as the smaller [[Loyalty Islands]] to the east and the [[Isle of Pines, New Caledonia|Isle of Pines]] to the south of Grand Terre. The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|14,600|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.

Grand Terre is a long island that runs approximately north-south, with a mountain range down the center with five peaks that exceed 1500 meters elevation. The Loyalty Islands and Ile des Pins are much lower.
New Caledonia lies astride the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], between 19° and 23° south [[latitude]], 1,200&amp;nbsp;km east of Australia and 1,500&amp;nbsp;km northeast of New Zealand.

The climate of the islands is [[tropical]], and [[rainfall]] is highly seasonal, brought by [[trade winds]] that usually come from the east. Rainfall averages about 1,500&amp;nbsp;mm  yearly on the Loyalty Islands, 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm at low elevations on eastern Grand Terre, and 2,000-4,000&amp;nbsp;mm at high elevations on Grand Terre. The western slopes of Grand Terre, which are in the [[rain shadow]] of the central mountain range, are much drier, and are home to the [[New Caledonia dry forests]] ecoregion.

New Caledonia is an ancient fragment of [[Gondwana]], the southern supercontinent. It separated from [[Australia]] 85 million years ago, and remained attached to [[New Zealand]] until 55 million years ago. It has been islolated from other land masses since then, although a number of plants and animals have been able to cross the straits separating New Caledonia from neighboring islands.

The forests are made up of laurel-leaved [[evergreen]] [[hardwood]] [[tree]]s, reaching up to 40&amp;nbsp;m in height. Many of the [[species]] are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the islands, and harbour and rich [[biota (ecology)|biota]] of [[understorey]] plants, [[invertebrate]]s, and [[bird]]s and [[bat]]s.

New Caledonia’s fauna and flora derive from ancestral species isolated in the region when it broke away from Gondwana many tens of millions of years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = Alan S. | last2 = Pisarevsky | first2 = Sergei A. | year = 2005 | title = Amalgamating eastern Gondwana: The evolution of the Circum-Indian Orogens | url = | journal = Earth-Science Reviews | volume = 71 | issue = 3–4| pages = 229–270 | doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2005.02.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only endemic species have evolved here, but entire genera and even families are unique to the islands.

More tropical [[Gymnosperm]] species are endemic to New Caledonia than to any similar region on Earth. Of the 44 indigenous species of gymnosperms, 43 are endemic, including the only known parasitic Gymnosperm (''[[Parasitaxus usta]]'').&lt;ref name="futura1"&gt;[http://www.futura-sciences.com/fr/doc/t/zoologie-1/r/nouvelle-caledonie/d/la-faune-et-la-flore-de-nouvelle-caledonie_468/c3/221/p2/ Dossier, La flore de Nouvelle-Calédonie - Première partie]&lt;/ref&gt; Again, of the 35 known species of ''[[Araucaria]]'', 13 are endemic to New Caledonia.&lt;ref name="hjnc"&gt;{{Google books|lly95WF8n-cC|page=26|New Caledonia}} By Leanne Logan, Geert Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's largest extant species of [[fern]], ''[[Cyathea intermedia]]'', also is endemic to New Caledonia. It is very common on acid ground, and grows about one metre per year on the east coast, usually on fallow ground or in forest clearings. There also are other species of ''Cyathea'', notably [[Cyathea novae-caledoniae]].&lt;ref name="ncd2"&gt;[http://www.futura-sciences.com/fr/doc/t/zoologie-1/r/nouvelle-caledonie/d/la-faune-et-la-flore-de-nouvelle-caledonie_468/c3/221/p3/ Dossier &gt; La flore de Nouvelle-Calédonie - Deuxième partie]&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands soils derived largely from [[ultramafic]] rocks, and have been a refuge for many native flora species that have adapted to their composition a long time ago; such flora can survive on acid soils with unfavourable compositions of nutrient elements. On New Caledonia examples of such soils commonly have an excess of magnesium, plus unusually high concentrations of [[phytotoxic]] compounds of heavy metals such as nickel. Not many invader species can compete successfully with plants adapted to such challenging soils.

New Caledonia also is one of five regions on the planet where species of ''[[Nothofagus]]'' are indigenous; five species are known to occur here.&lt;ref name="futura1"/&gt;

''[[Cloud forest]]'' formerly covered much of the tropical mountain and coastal areas of the world.
The [[laurel forest]]s are found in the islands of the Oceans, some tropical mountains and locally on favourable wet climate microenvironments of the coast and coastal mountains of the mainland, but the forests have been much reduced in extent by [[logging]], clearance for [[agriculture]] and [[grazing]], and the invasion of [[exotic species]].
The decline of much of the endemic fauna and flora is largely due to deforestation to accommodate [[agricultural expansion]]. This is accompanied by displacement of native flora by invasive alien weeds and crop plants. The most famous ''[[laurisilva]]'' forests remain on Madeira, where they are found between 300&amp;nbsp;m and 1400&amp;nbsp;m altitude on the northern slope, and 700&amp;nbsp;m to 1600&amp;nbsp;m on the southern slope, and cover 149,5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The laurifolia appears in mountains  of the coastal strip of New South Wales in [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Tasmania]], and [[New Zealand]]. The laurel forests of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand are home to species related to those in [[South Africa]], [[Macaronesia]], [[Madagascar]], South Japan, Jeju island in Korea, Taiwan, South China coast, North America coasts to Panama and the Valdivian laurel forests, including southern beech (''[[Nothofagus]]'') through the connection of the [[Antarctic flora]]. Other typical flora include [[Winteraceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], southern sassafras ([[Atherospermataceae]]), conifers of [[Araucariaceae]], [[Podocarpaceae]], and [[Cupressaceae]], and [[tree fern]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, Kazue and Elgene O.

Klötzli, G.-R. Walther, eds. Birkhauser, Basel.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Caledonia was an ancient fragment of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Unlike many of the Pacific Islands, which are of relatively recent volcanic origin, New Caledonia is part of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], a fragment of the ancient [[Gondwana]] super-continent. Zealandia separated from Australia 60–85&amp;nbsp;million years ago,&lt;ref name="Te Ara"&gt;{{cite web |author=Keith Lewis |author2=Scott D.

This isolated New Caledonia from the rest of the world's landmasses, preserving a snapshot of Gondwanan forests. New Caledonia and New Zealand are separated by [[continental drift]] of Australia 85 million years ago. The islands still shelters an extraordinary diversity of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plants and animals of Gondwanan origin have spread to the southern continents later.

The laurel forest of Australia, [[New Caledonia]] (''[[Adenodaphne]]''), and New Zealand have a number of other related species of the Valdivian laurel forest, through the connection of the [[Antarctic flora]] of gymnosperms like the   podocarpus and deciduous Nothofagus.
New Caledonia lies at the northern end of the ancient continent [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], while New Zealand rises at the plate boundary that bisects it. These land masses are two outposts of the [[Antarctic flora]], including [[Araucaria]]s and [[Podocarp]]s. At [[Curio Bay]], logs of a [[fossil]]ized [[forest]] closely related to modern [[kauri]] and [[Norfolk pine]] can be seen that grew on Zealandia about 180 million years ago during the [[Jurassic]] period, before it split from Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 Fossil forest: Features of Curio Bay/Porpoise Bay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017015051/http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |date=2008-10-17 }} Retrieved on 2007-11-06&lt;/ref&gt;

During glacial periods more of Zealandia becomes a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] rather than a marine environment. Zealandia was originally thought to have no native land [[mammal]] fauna, but a recent discovery in 2006 of a fossil mammal jaw from the Miocene in the Otago region shows otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Ancient New Zealand|last=Campbell|first=Hamish|authorlink=|author2=Gerard Hutching |year=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=North Shore, New Zealand|isbn=978-0-14-302088-2|pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Guinea and Northern Australia ecoregion  are closely related. Over time Australia and New Caledonia drifted north. New Caledonia protected by the ocean remained unchanged preserving their species and Australia became drier; the humid [[Antarctic flora]] from Gondwana retreated to the east coast and Tasmania, while the rest of Australia became dominated by ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus]]'', and ''[[Casuarinaceae|Casuarina]]'', as well as xeric shrubs and grasses. [[Human]]s arrived in Australia 50-60,000 years ago, and used fire to reshape the vegetation of the continent; as a result, the Antarctic flora, also known as the ''rainforest flora'' in Australia, retreated to a few isolated areas composing less than 2% of Australia's land area.

==Flora==
The New Caledonia rain forests are made up of three predominant forest types. The lowland rain forests cover the Loyalty Islands, and the Iles des Pines and the lower elevations of Grand Terre. Montane forests cover the higher elevations of Grand Terre. The wet [[maquis shrubland|maquis]] forests of Grand Terre are low shrub forests found on rocky soils derived from [[ultramafic]] rocks.

The predominant flora of New Caledonia rain forests is derived from the [[Antarctic flora]] of ancient southern Gondwana. Like the Australian rainforests and the temperate forests of New Zealand, [[conifer]]s of the Southern Hemisphere families [[Araucariaceae]] and [[Podocarpaceae]] are mixed with [[angiosperm]] trees, including the Southern Hemisphere genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' and trees and shrubs of families [[Myrtaceae]] and [[Proteaceae]].

The lowland forests are a generally a mixed-species composition, interspersed with some single species stands. The predominant conifers are ''[[Araucaria]] columnaris'', ''A. bernieri'', ''[[Agathis]] lanceolata'', ''A. ovata'' (Araucariaceae), and ''[[Dacrydium]] araucarioides'', ''[[Dacrycarpus]] vieillardii'' and ''[[Falcatifolium]] taxoides'' (Podocarpaceae). Predominant angiosperm trees include ''Montrouziera cauliflora'', ''Calophyllum neocaledonicum'', ''Dysoxylum'' spp., ''Neogullauminia cleopatra'', and ''Hernandia cordigera'', together with species of the [[Proteaceae]] genera ''[[Kermadecia]], [[Macadamia]],'' and ''[[Sleumerodendron]]''. ''[[Araucaria]]'', ''[[Callistemon]]'', and ''Nothofagus'' predominate in the single-species stands.

The Montane rain forests are also mixed-species, predominantly the conifers ''Araucaria'', ''Agathis'', ''Podocarpus'', ''Dacrydium'', ''Libocedrus'', and ''Acmopyle'', and the angiosperms ''[[Metrosideros]]'', ''[[Weinmannia]]'', ''[[Quintinia]]'', and ''[[Nothofagus]]''
There are rutaceas in New Caledonia as  Citrus macroptera Montr.
Melodinus insulae-pinorum Boiteau, Melodinus phylliraeoides Labill.

The Maquis forests hold a great variety of species, with many [[endemic (ecology)|endemics]]. The ultramafic rocks, which formed in the deep ocean, are rich in metals, including [[nickel]], [[magnesium]], [[chromium]], and [[manganese]], which are toxic to many plants. The predominant trees are stunted Araucarias.

==Fauna==

New Caledonia has one of the most enigmatic birds of the world, the endangered [[kagu]]. It is related to the cranes and it lives very hidden. It is also the heraldic bird of the island. Another endemic bird is the [[New Caledonian rail]]. This critically endangered bird could be extinct but many believe that it still persists. Both the [[New Caledonian owlet-nightjar]] and the [[New Caledonian lorikeet]] are believed to persist under similar circumstances. There are also another twenty or so endemic birds on the island, including the tool-using [[New Caledonian crow]]. See [[Endemic birds of New Caledonia]] for more details. The seashells from New Caledonia are in great demand by collectors.

Chem. 2014 , 27, 374-379 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/poc.3290]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonclassical ions have been extensively studied with the [[2-Norbornyl cation|2-norbornyl system]], which as “naked” ion unambiguously exhibit such a bridged structure. The landmark of nonclassical ions are unexpectedly fast [[Solvolysis|solvolysis]] rates and large differences between epimeric esters. Such behaviour is not restricted to 2-norbornyl esters, as has been shown with some cyclopentyl and steroidal esters with the tosyloxy leaving group.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, H.-J.   ''The Controversy about Nonclassical Ions – Abandoned too Early?'' J. Phys. Org. Chem. '''2018''',[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/poc.3846]&lt;/ref&gt;

Substitution reactions of secondary esters occur by S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2- or S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1-like mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt; Anslyn, E.V.,  Dougherty, D.A ''Modern Physical Organic Chemistry'' University Science Books '''2005'''[http://www.uscibooks.com/adfm_new.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Sykes P.

The solvolysis of several cyclopentyl and steroidal esters show that large solvolysis rates and differences between epimers can occur which surpass those of the 2-norbornyl system. In these cases a vicinal  C–C or C–H bond can lead to significant delocalization of the positive charge, if these  bonds are close to [[Anti-periplanar|antiperiplanar]] to the leaving group, and the migration leads to a more stable tertiary carbocation. The reaction products in these cases always result from the migration of the neighbouring bond.

The reaction of [[epimer]]ic esters can be severely slowed by [[Steric hindrance|steric]] hindrance of [[solvation]].

Solvolysis of cyclopropylcarbinyl, cyclobutyl and homoallyl esters are also characterized by very large rates, and have been shown to occur via a common nonclassical ion structure in the form of a bicyclobutonium ion.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, M., Laidig, K.E., Wiberg, K.B. , Schleyer  ''Structures, energies, and modes of interconversion of {{chem|C|4|H|7|+}} ions''  J.

[[File:Magnetic cv.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|Polar variables are magnetic white dwarfs accreting material from a low mass donor, with no accretion disk due to the intense magnetic field]]
A '''Polar''' is a highly magnetic type of [[cataclysmic variable]] [[binary star]] system, originally known as an '''AM Herculis star''' after the prototype member [[AM Herculis]].  Like other cataclysmic variables (CVs), polars contain two stars: an accreting [[white dwarf]] (WD), and a low-mass donor star (usually a [[red dwarf]]) which is transferring mass to the WD as a result of the WD's gravitational pull, overflowing its [[Roche lobe]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cataclysmic Variable Stars|last = Hellier|first = Coel|publisher = Springer|year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Polars are distinguished from other CVs by the presence of a very strong [[magnetic field]] in the WD.  Typical magnetic field strengths of polar systems are 10 million to 80 million gauss (1000&amp;ndash;8000 [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The polars|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00177799|journal = Space Science Reviews|date = 1990-12-01|issn = 0038-6308|pages = 195–295|volume = 54|issue = 3-4|doi = 10.1007/BF00177799|language = en|first = Mark|last = Cropper|bibcode = 1990SSRv...54..195C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WD in the polar [[AN Ursae Majoris]] has the strongest known magnetic field among cataclysmic variables, with a field strength of 230 million gauss (23 kT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Krzeminski, W. | author2=Serkowski, K. | last-author-amp=yes | title=Extremely high circular polarization of AN Ursae Majoris | journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] Letters | volume=216 | pages=L45 | date=August 1977 | doi=10.1086/182506 | bibcode=1977ApJ...216L..45K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Accretion mechanism ==
One of the most critical consequences of the WD's magnetism is that it synchronizes the rotational period of the WD with the orbital period of the binary;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to first order, this means that the same side of the WD always faces the donor star. This synchronous rotation is considered a defining feature of polars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, the WD's magnetic field captures the accretion stream from the donor star before it can develop into an [[accretion disk]]. The capture of the accretion stream is known as threading, and it occurs when the [[magnetic pressure]] from the WD matches the stream's [[ram pressure]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The captured material flows along the WD's magnetic field lines until it violently accretes onto the WD in a shock near one or more of the star's [[poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic poles]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This accretion region covers only a fraction of the WD's surface, but it can contribute half of the system's optical light.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Indirect imaging of the accretion stream in eclipsing polars — II. HU Aquarii|url = http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/308/3/807|journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date = 1999-09-23|issn = 0035-8711|pages = 807–817|volume = 308|issue = 3|doi = 10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02780.x|language = en|first = M.

J.|last3 = Hakala|first4 = C.|last4 = Hellier|first5 = T.|last5 = Ramseyer|bibcode = 1999MNRAS.308..807H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to optical and near-infrared [[cyclotron radiation]], the accretion region also produces X-rays due to the high temperature of gas within the shock, so polars are frequently brighter in X-rays than non-magnetic CVs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Whereas accretion in a non-magnetic system is governed by [[viscosity]] within the accretion disk, accretion in a polar is entirely magnetic. Additionally, while an accretion disk can be crudely envisioned as a two-dimensional structure with no significant thickness, the accretion flow in a polar has complex three-dimensional structure because the magnetic field lines lift it out of the orbital plane.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Indeed, in some polars, the vertical extent of the accretion flow enables it to regularly pass in front of the WD's accretion spot as seen from Earth, causing a temporary decrease in the system's observed brightness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Polars derive their name from the [[Linear polarization|linearly]] and [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light that they produce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Information about the accretion geometry of a polar can be found by studying its polarization.

The 1:1 ratio of the WD rotational period and the binary orbital period is a fundamental property of polars, but in four polars ([[V1500 Cygni|V1500 Cyg]], BY Cam, V1432 Aql, and CD Ind), these two periods are different by ~1% or less.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = General Properties of Quiescent Novae|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/proceeding/aipcp/10.1063/1.1518170|publisher = AIP Publishing|journal = AIP Conference Proceedings|date = 2002-11-05|pages = 3–15|volume = 637|doi = 10.1063/1.1518170|first = Brian|last = Warner|arxiv = astro-ph/0206452 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common explanation for the WD's asynchronous rotation is that each of these systems had been synchronous until a [[nova]] eruption broke the synchronization by changing the WD's rotation period.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = V1500 Cygni - Discovery of a magnetic nova|url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1086/166652|journal = The Astrophysical Journal|date = 1988-09-01|volume = 332|doi = 10.1086/166652|language = en|first = H. S.|last = Stockman|first2 = Gary D.|last2 = Schmidt|first3 = D. Q.|last3 = Lamb|bibcode = 1988ApJ...332..282S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known asynchronous polar, V1500 Cyg, underwent a nova in 1975, and its asynchronous rotation was discovered after the nova faded, providing the best observational evidence of this scenario.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In V1500 Cyg, BY Cam, and V1432 Aql, there is observational evidence that the WD is resynchronizing its spin period with the orbital period, and these systems are expected to become synchronous on a timescale of centuries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Due to the slight difference between the orbital and WD rotation periods, the WD and its magnetosphere slowly rotate as seen from the donor star. Critically, this asynchronous rotation causes the accretion stream to interact with different [[magnetic field lines]]. Since the accretion flow travels along the field lines which have captured it, it will follow different trajectories when it interacts with different field lines. As a concrete example, the accretion flow in the eclipsing polar V1432 Aql sometimes threads onto field lines which carry it so far above the orbital plane that the flow is not obscured when the donor star eclipses the WD, but at other times, it threads onto field lines with less vertical extent, causing the accretion flow to be much more fully eclipsed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Periodic eclipse variations in asynchronous polar V1432 Aql: evidence of a shifting threading region|url = http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/449/3/3107|journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date = 2015-05-21|issn = 0035-8711|pages = 3107–3120|volume = 449|issue = 3|doi = 10.1093/mnras/stv462|language = en|first = Colin|last = Littlefield|first2 = Koji|last2 = Mukai|first3 = Raymond|last3 = Mumme|first4 = Ryan|last4 = Cain|first5 = Katrina C.|last5 = Magno|first6 = Taylor|last6 = Corpuz|first7 = Davis|last7 = Sandefur|first8 = David|last8 = Boyd|first9 = Michael|last9 = Cook|bibcode = 2015MNRAS.449.3107L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding variations in eclipse depth were shown to depend very strongly on the orientation of the WD's magnetic field with respect to the donor star.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For comparison, in a synchronous polar, the WD does not rotate with respect to the donor star, and the stream always interacts with the same field lines, resulting in a stable accretion geometry.

There is also evidence in each of the four asynchronous polars that the accretion stream is able to travel much deeper into the WD's magnetosphere than in synchronous systems, implying an unusually high rate of mass transfer from the donor star or a low magnetic field strength, but this has not been studied in detail.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Intermediate polars ==
{{main|Intermediate polar}}
Another class of cataclysmic variables with magnetic white dwarfs accreting material from a main sequence donor star are the intermediate polars.  These have less strong magnetic fields and the rotation of the white dwarf is not synchronised with the orbital period.  It has been proposed that intermediate polars may evolve into polars as the donor is depleted and the orbit shrinks.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Within the site of the park and woodland, stood Preston Hill farmhouse. This was then damaged in 1944 after a 1000&amp;nbsp;kg [[parachute]] [[bomb]] or mine was dropped, in the early hours of 22 January 1944. Three of the farmhouse occupants were killed and 8 others were injured, later the ruined farmhouse was demolished. The site was then used as a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] [[firing range]] (up to the 1940s); the remnants of the range can still be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sussexhistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=3283.0 | publisher=sussexhistoryforum.co.uk |date=17 October 2012 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |title=Explosion at Preston Hill, Shoreham (Kent), 22/1/44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1951 it has been a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (part of {{convert|363.7|acre|m2}} ''Otford To Shoreham Downs site'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000333.pdf |title=SSSI name: Otford To Shoreham Downs | publisher=www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk |year=1951 |accessdate=12 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preston Hill has extensive views across the countryside from the Darenth Valley (following the [[River Darent]]) to [[Lullingstone Country Park]].
The site has {{convert|232|acre|m2}} of [[chalk grassland]] and woodland with many wild flowers and rare butterflies at this site of outstanding natural beauty located within the [[Kent Downs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverthegardenofengland.com/things-to-do/preston-hill-p223891 | publisher=www.discoverthegardenofengland.com | accessdate=7 November 2013 |title=Preston Hill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the grasslands, a variety of butterflies including [[chalkhill blue]]s and [[dark green fritillary|dark green fritillaries]] can be seen. Since the site is relatively quiet, [[Vipera berus|common adder]]s and [[grass snake]]s can also be found.&lt;ref name="kent.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kent.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture/countryside_and_coast/parks_and_open_spaces/country_parks/preston_hill.aspx |publisher=kent.gov.uk |accessdate=7 November 2013 |title=Preston Hill |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112160221/http://www.kent.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture/countryside_and_coast/parks_and_open_spaces/country_parks/preston_hill.aspx |archivedate=12 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The grassland is grazed occasionally by a herd of [[feral goats]], which came from the [[Great Orme]], near [[Colwyn Bay]] in [[North Wales]].These are used to further encourage the growth of wildflowers.&lt;ref name="Kent Downs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentdowns.org.uk/interactive-map/preston-hill-picnic-site | publisher=www.kentdowns.org.uk | accessdate=7 November 2013 |title=Preston Hill Picnic Site }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are paths through the woodland (called 'Preston Plantation') at the top of the hill although they are steep in places and some have become overgrown.&lt;ref name="kent.gov" /&gt;

The park also is acreddited with a [[Green Flag Award]] by [[Natural England]] (linked with Lullingstone Country Park).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/enjoying/places/countryparks/countryparksnetwork/findacountrypark/southeastregion.aspx |title =Country Parks in the South East |publisher = Natural England |year = 2013 |website = www.naturalengland.org.uk |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How to get there==
Situated along [[A225 road|A225]] Station road, cross the railway (between [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]] and [[Eynsford]]) then head up Preston Hill. 
The site has no official car park, but the site is only about 1 mile from Lullingstone Country Park.

'''Sarraounia Mangou''' was a chief/priestess of the animist Azna subgroup of the [[Hausa people | Hausa]], who fought French colonial troops of the [[Voulet–Chanoine Mission]] at the [[Battle of Lougou]] (in present-day [[Niger]]) in 1899. She is the subject of the 1986 film ''[[Sarraounia (film)|Sarraounia]]'' based on the novel of the same name by Nigerien writer [[Abdoulaye Mamani]].&lt;ref name="alou2009"&gt;Alou, Antoinette Tidjani. (2009). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30131185 "Niger and Sarraounia: One Hundred Years of Forgetting Female Leadership."] ''Research in African Literatures'' 40(1): 42–56 (Spring 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
''Sarraounia'' means ''queen'' or ''female chief'' in the Hausa language. Among the predominately animist Azna people of Lougou and surrounding Hausa towns and villages, the term refers to a lineage of female rulers who exercised both political and religious power.&lt;ref name="alou2009"/&gt; Sarraounia Mangou was the most famous of the Sarraounias due to her resistance against French colonial troops at the [[Battle of Lougou]] in 1899. While most chiefs in Niger pragmatically submitted to French power,&lt;ref name="alou2009"/&gt; Sarraounia Mangou mobilized her people and resources to confront the French forces of the [[Voulet–Chanoine Mission]], which [[Battle of Lougou|launched a fierce attack on her fortress capital of Lougou]].

Overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the French, she and her fighters retreated tactically from the fortress, and engaged the attackers in a protracted guerrilla battle which eventually forced the French to abandon their project of subduing her.

The 1986 film ''[[Sarraounia (film)|Sarraounia]]'' is a retelling of her struggle against Voulet and Chanoine's troops.

In the [[United Kingdom]] and in some other places, the '''silly season''' is the period lasting for a few summer months typified by the emergence of frivolous news stories in the [[mass media|media]]. It is known in many languages as the '''cucumber time'''. The term was coined in an 1861 [[Saturday Review (London)|''Saturday Review'']] article,&lt;ref&gt;"The Silly Season", ''Saturday Review'', Vol. 12 (No. 298, 13 Jul. 1861), pp. 37–38. Cited as first usage by the [[OED]].&lt;/ref&gt; and was listed in the second edition of ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' (1894) and remains in use at the start of the 21st century. The fifteenth edition of ''Brewer's'' expands on the second, defining the silly season as "the part of the year when Parliament and the Law Courts are not sitting (about August and September)".

In [[North America]] the period is often referred to prosaically as the '''slow news season''', or less commonly with the phrase '''dog days of summer'''.  In [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]], the silly season has come to refer to the [[Christmas]]/New Year festive period (which occurs during the summer season in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]) on account of the higher than usual number of social engagements where the consumption of alcohol is typical.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The term is also used in sports, to describe periods outside traditional competitive sporting seasons.

==Motivation==
Typically, the latter half of the summer is slow in terms of newsworthy events. Newspapers as their primary means of income rely on [[Advertising|advertisements]], which rely on readers seeing them, but historically newspaper readership drops off during this time. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] takes its summer recess, so that parliamentary debates and [[Prime Minister's Questions]], which generate much news coverage, do not happen.  This period is also a summer school holiday, when many families with children choose to take holidays, and there is accordingly often a decline of business news, as many employers reduce their activity.  Similar recesses are typical of legislative bodies elsewhere. To retain (and attract) subscribers, newspapers would print attention-grabbing headlines and articles to boost sales, often to do with minor [[moral panic]]s or [[child abduction]]s. For example, the extensive British press coverage devoted to [[Operation Irma]], a humanitarian airlift during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], was criticised as a "silly season" tactic.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Mercy's short shelf life |work=Financial Times |date=24 December 1993 |first=John |last=Willman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==
[[Image:Cucumis sativus1.jpg|thumb|right|In many languages, the silly season is called "[[cucumber]] time" or similar.]]
Other countries have comparable periods, for example the ''Sommerloch'' ("summer [news]hole") in [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking Europe]]; [[French language|French]] has ''la morte-saison'' ("the dead season" or "the dull season") or "la saison des marronniers" ("the conker tree season"), and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] has ''nyhetstorka'' ("news drought").

In many languages, the name for the silly season references [[cucumber]]s (more precisely: [[gherkin]]s or [[pickled cucumber]]s). ''Komkommertijd'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Danish ''agurketid'', Icelandic ''gúrkutíð'', Norwegian ''agurktid ''(a piece of news is called ''agurknytt ''or ''agurknyhet'', i.e., "cucumber news"), Czech ''okurková sezóna'', Slovak ''uhorková sezóna'', Polish ''Sezon ogórkowy'', Hungarian ''uborkaszezon'', and Hebrew עונת המלפפונים (''onat ha'melafefonim'', "season of the cucumbers") all mean "cucumber time" or "cucumber season". The corresponding term in German is ''Sauregurkenzeit'' and in Estonian ''hapukurgihooaeg'' ("pickled cucumber season"); the same term is also used in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] as ''čas kislih kumaric''.

The term "cucumber time" was also used in England in the 1800s to denote the slow season for tailors.&lt;ref name="brewer-cucumber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/4449.html|title=Brewer, E. Cobham. Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable. Cu’cumber Time.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="n-q-cucumber"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Brri34stXrwC&amp;pg=PA439&amp;dq=%22cucumber+time%22&amp;ei=EhxvSvjFEYTiywTazs3VDg Notes and Queries, 1853] – Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

A silly season news item is called ''rötmånadshistoria'' in [[Sweden]] and ''mätäkuun juttu'' in [[Finland]], both literally meaning "[[Dog Days|rotting-month]] story".

In [[Spain]] the term ''serpiente de verano'' ("summer snake") is often used, not for the season, but for the news items. The term is a reference to the [[Loch Ness Monster]] and similar creatures, who are reputed to get more headlines in summer.

==Side effects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
A side effect of stirring up the public in this manner comes when an authentic story is dismissed as a prank, or when a superfluous story is taken as legitimate.

A 1950 short story by [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]], titled "The Silly Season", makes use of this concept by having invading aliens stage one strange but harmless event after another. All are duly reported by the newspapers until the public is bored with them, and when a final "strange event" occurs, no one is prepared to accept it as an invasion until it is too late. The story was included in the 1952 anthology ''[[Tomorrow, the Stars]]'', edited by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].

==Sports==
Silly Season also refers to time periods outside traditional season-long competitive sporting competitions.  In team sports such as [[association football]]&lt;ref name="reds-rumours"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_5446013,00.html |title=Sky Sports, 2009 |publisher=Skysports.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and professional [[ice hockey]],&lt;ref name="grading-day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/columns/story?id=3470156&amp;columnist=burnside_scott|title=Burnside: Grading Day 1 of free agency|date=2 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leagues such as [[Formula One]],&lt;ref name="formula-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/racing/racing/f1/columns/story?id=3503809&amp;columnist=knutson_dan|title=Knutson: It's Silly Season in F1, too|date=24 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASCAR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/news/120111/dcaraviello-silly-season-offseason-moves/index.html|title=NASCAR's 'silly season' takes crazy to higher level|work=[[NASCAR]]|date=2012-01-11|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[NBA]],&lt;ref name="NBA-offseason"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=ford_chad&amp;page=Offseason-080804|title=Ford: Winners and losers of the summer|date=29 August 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[NFL]],&lt;ref name="view-from-america"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/opinion/story/0,25212,13283_5137546,00.html |title=Sky Sports, 2009 |publisher=Skysports.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the final weeks of the season leading into off-time between one season and the next is filled with speculation regarding possible changes involving players, staff, and teams.  Regardless of whether the speculation remains just that or indeed bears fruit, the moves and the discussions they generate help build interest in the leagues, their teams, and their upcoming seasons.

Silly season is also used in professional [[golf]] to describe tournaments that are not official [[PGA Tour]] or [[LPGA Tour]] events.  Normally scheduled at or near the end of the calendar year, when PGA and LPGA tournaments are not usually scheduled, these events also employ formats of play not normally seen on those tours.  [[The Shark Shootout]] and the [[Skins Game (PGA Tour)|Skins Game]] are two such examples of silly season events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/od/golfterms/g/silly-season.htm|title=96 Fun and Odd Slang Terms Used By Golfers and What They Mean|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
In [[US politics]] and lifestyle, the silly season is a period from early summer until the first week of October of election years. Primary elections are over at this time, but formal debates have not started and the general election is still many weeks away. Issues raised during this period are likely to be forgotten by the election, so candidates may rely on frivolous political posturing and [[hyperbole]] to get media attention and raise money.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In [[astrology]], certain '''stars''' are considered significant.  Historically, all of the various heavenly bodies considered by astrologers were considered "stars", whether they were [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, other stellar phenomena like [[nova]]s and [[supernova]]s, or other solar system phenomena like [[comet]]s and [[meteor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Fixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology |author=Vivian E. Robson | date=2003 |isbn=978-0-7661-4228-2 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy]], ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', book 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fixed and wandering stars==
{{astrology | upright}}
In traditional astrological nomenclature, the stars were divided into [[fixed star]]s, Latin ''stellæ fixæ'', which in astrology means the stars and other galactic or intergalactic bodies as recognized by [[astronomy]]; and "wandering stars" (Greek: ''πλανήτης αστήρ'', ''planētēs astēr''), which we know as the [[planet]]s of the [[solar system]].  Astrology also treats the [[Sun]], a star, and Earth's [[Moon]] as if they were planets in the [[horoscope]].  These stars were called "fixed" because it was thought that they were attached to the [[firmament]], the most distant from [[Earth]] of the [[heavenly sphere]]s.

==Stars and astrological degrees==
Certain of the [[astrological degrees]] were identified and known due to their association with a corresponding star.&lt;ref&gt;Vivian E. Robson, ''The Fixed Stars and Constellations in Astrology'' (Astrology Center of America, 2005, repr.; {{ISBN|1-933303-13-1}}), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=me7_4RdVwxsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=astrological+degrees+and+fixed+stars&amp;ots=5kjec_Ggjg&amp;sig=5SuLUcQrwPKfnP4Daw1EDGKSMhk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 11 et. seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The astrological degrees that correspond to individual stars must be corrected for the precession of the equinoxes, and as such the astrologer must know when any given position of a fixed star was noted, to make the necessary corrections.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas DeVore. ''Encyclopedia of Astrology'' (Philosophical Library, 1947), sub. tit, "Degree"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stars in sidereal and tropical astrology==
Traditional Western astrology is based on [[tropical astrology]], which presumes an equal division of the [[celestial sphere]] along the [[ecliptic]] into twelve equal parts, starting with [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]].  [[Sidereal astrology]], at once the oldest and a recently revived astrological tradition, is more observationally oriented and uses the actual observed position of the stars and the traditional divisions of the zodiac constellations as its starting point.  As a result of the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the observed positions of the zodiac signs no longer correspond to the signs of tropical astrology.

==Zodiac==
Traditionally, the most important fixed points in the heavens were described by the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]]. [[Ptolemy]]'s account likens the influence of some of the stars in the zodiac constellations to the planets; he writes, for example, that "The stars in the feet of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] ([[Alhena]] and [[Tejat Posterior]]) have an influence similar to that of [[Mercury (astrology)|Mercury]], and moderately to that of [[Venus (astrology)|Venus]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy]], ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ptb/ptb12.htm book 1 ch. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene32 Halley comet.jpg|right|thumb|"Those people wonder at the star." The stitchers of the [[Bayeux tapestry]] believed that the return of [[Halley's Comet]] related to the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066.]]

==Non-zodiac constellations in astrology==
Vivian E. Robson notes that many of the traditional constellations outside of the zodiac constellations occupy large degrees of arc and typically compass several of the tropical zodiac signs.  [[Ptolemy]] referred to stars by reference to the anatomy or parts of the constellations in which they appeared; thus [[Arcturus]] he named the "right knee of [[Boötes]]".  Most of the Western names of stars, such as [[Algol]] or [[Betelgeuse]], are [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in origin.  In 1603 the Augsburg lawyer-uranographer [[Johann Bayer]] introduced the current classificatory system for the brighter stars, in which stars are identified as belonging to their constellations by Greek letters, in (roughly) descending order of brightness; so that [[Regulus]], brightest star in [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], is called ''&amp;alpha; Leonis'', the brightest star of the Lion.&lt;ref&gt;Robson, supra, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astrological meteors==
Unpredictable observations in the heavens, including [[nova]]s and [[supernova]]s as well as other phenomena in the heavens such as [[comet]]s, [[meteor]]s, [[parhelion]]s, and even [[rainbow]]s, were all collected under the name of astrological meteors.  According to [[Ptolemy]], variations in the magnitude of fixed stars portends wind from the direction in which the star lies.&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy, ''Tetrabiblos'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ptb/ptb44.htm book 2 ch. 14]&lt;/ref&gt;  Etymologically, the word ''meteor'' describes any phenomenon in the heavens, and derives from the Greek ''[[Wikt:μετέωρος|μετέωρον]]'' (''meteōron''), signifying anything in the sky or above the earth; this is the shared origin of English words such as [[meteoroid]] and [[meteorology]].

These astrological meteors were typically held to be omens that presaged major world events.  In ''[[De nova stella]]'', [[Tycho Brahe]], one of many astrologers who observed the [[SN 1572|supernova of 1572]], stated his belief that the appearance of the supernova heralded the decline of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and stated that the years 1592-1632 would be impacted by the astrological influence of the supernova.  The years corresponded almost precisely with the lifespan of [[Gustavus Adolphus]] (1594 - 1632), the [[king of Sweden]] who championed the cause of [[Protestantism]] during the [[Thirty Years War]].  This apparently successful prediction won Brahe international fame as an astrologer.&lt;ref&gt;David Plant, ''[http://www.skyscript.co.uk/brahe.html Tycho Brahe: A King among Astronomers]'' (skyscript.co.uk, first published in ''The Traditional Astrologer Magazine'', Issue 8, Spring 1995), accessed July 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
According to [[Nicholas DeVore]], while the fixed stars no longer are consulted much in [[natal astrology]], they remain important in aspects of astrological [[divination]] such as [[judicial astrology]].  Those astrologers who include them in natal charts do not give a major star any significance unless it appears as part of a close [[conjunction (astrology)|conjunction]] with a birth planet, within 5° by [[celestial longitude]], and 1° by [[celestial latitude|latitude]].  They have no effect by means of [[aspect (astrology)|aspect]].  A [[first magnitude]] or brighter star on the [[Ascendant]] or [[Midheaven]] in the horoscope may indicate [[celebrity]].  The two stars [[Aldebaran]] and [[Antares]] are said to produce stress when they [[transit (astrology)|transit]] one of the angles of the horoscope.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas DeVore]]. ''Encyclopedia of Astrology'' (Philosophical Library, 1947), ''sub. tit'' "Stars", pp. 408- 409; "Astrology", pp 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some astrologers that consult the stars refer to their affects as ''paranatellonta'', or "paran" for short. Paranatellonta are stars that fall upon one of the four angles of the horoscope ([[ascendant (astrology)|rising]] or [[descendant (astrology)|setting]], at the [[midheaven]], or at the [[imum coeli]]) at the same time a significant planet is at one of those points.  Thus, for example, if [[Sirius]] was rising while [[Jupiter (astrology)|Jupiter]] was at the midheaven, Sirius would be considered a paran of Jupiter and could influence the way the astrologer interpreted Jupiter in that horoscope.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Houlding, [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/gl/paran.html "Paran"], in "Glossary of Traditional Astrological Terms", skyscript.co.uk, accessed July 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific fixed stars==

===Aldebaran===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Aldebaran]] --&gt;
[[Astrology|Astrologically]], Aldebaran is a fortunate star, portending riches and honor. This star, named "Tascheter" by the Persians, is one of the four "[[royal stars]]" of the [[Iran|Persians]] from around [[3000 BC]]. These stars were chosen in such way that they were approximately 6 hours apart in [[right ascension]]. Each of these stars was assigned to a season, Aldebaran was prominent in the March sky and as such, it was associated with the [[vernal equinox]].  Its current celestial longitude is 09 Ge. 47 as of 2006&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Houlding, "[http://www.skyscript.co.uk/20stars.html The 20 Brightest Stars]" at skyscript.co.uk; accessed July 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four royal stars with their modern and ancient Persian names were

* [[Aldebaran]] (Alpha Tauri) [[vernal equinox]] is the brightest star in the [[constellation]] [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]].
* [[Regulus]] (Alpha Leonis) [[summer solstice]] is the brightest star in the constellation [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]].
* [[Antares]] (Alpha Scorpii) [[autumnal equinox]] is the brightest star in the constellation [[Scorpius]].
* [[Fomalhaut]] (Alpha Piscis) [[winter solstice]] is the brightest star in the constellation [[Piscis Austrinus]].

To [[medieval]] astrologers, Aldebaran was one of fifteen [[Behenian fixed stars|Behenian stars]], associated with [[rubies]], [[milk thistle]]s and the [[kabbalistic]] sign [[File:Aldaboram (Agripa 1531).svg|25px]].

In Hindu astrology, Aldebaran corresponds to the [[Rohini Nakshatram|Rohini]] [[Nakshatra]].

In Western Sidereal Astrology, computation is based on defining Aldebaran as 15 degrees Taurus precisely.&lt;Cyril Fagan&gt;&lt;Garth Allen&gt;

===Algol===
In astrology, Algol is one of the most [[luck|unfortunate]] stars.&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard Hinckley | last=Allen | title=Star-Names and Their Meanings ([[Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning]] in the unchanged 1963 Dover reprint) | publisher=G.E.&amp;nbsp;Stechert (New York) | date=1899 |pages=332–33| isbn= 0-486-21079-0 | oclc=185804232}}, also online on Bill Thayer's site [[LacusCurtius|Lacus Curtius]]: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/home.html Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] referred to it as "the [[Gorgon]] of [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]" and associated it with death by decapitation: mirroring the myth of the hero [[Perseus]]’ victory over the snake-headed [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Frank E.

The 17th century English astrologer [[William Lilly]] regarded any planet to be afflicted when within five degrees of conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;William Lilly, ''Christian Astrology''; London, 1647; Ascella Publications reprint, 1999; p.115.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 1986 its celestial longitude was 25 Tau. 55'48.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Bezza, translated by Daria Dudziak, "[http://www.cieloeterra.it/eng/eng.articoli.algol/eng.algol.html Al-ghûl, the ogre]", originally in ''Schema'' 3, December 1986; accessed July 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gienah===
[[Gamma Corvi|Gienah]] (gamma Corvi) is supposed to have a similar effect to [[Solar system in astrology#Mars|Mars]] and [[Solar system in astrology#Saturn|Saturn]], tending to promote greed and craftiness. It was one of the [[medieval]] [[Behenian fixed stars|Behenian stars]], associated with [[onyx]], [[burdock]], and a crow-like [[kabbalistic]] symbol [[File:Agrippa1531 alaCorui.png]]. In this context it is sometimes referred to as Ala Corvi, "the wing of the crow or raven".

===Procyon===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Procyon]] --&gt;
[[Astrology|Astrologically]], [[Procyon]] is considered mostly unfortunate although it is sometimes wealth producing. It has strong potential as a cause of violence; it brings sudden success then disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Robson&lt;/ref&gt; It is of the nature of Mars (and also Mercury to a lesser extent),&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/ref&gt; and when Mars is found conjoined to this star, the native with this configuration will often be an offender of mischief and violence, that is, if these stars are found upon one of the 4 angles of the chart, during the day, with the Moon making a testimony to them while increasing in light.&lt;ref&gt;Maternus&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of fifteen Behenian stars, associated with [[agate]] and [[ranunculus|water crowfoot]]. According to [[Cornelius Agrippa]], its kabbalistic symbol is [[File:Agrippa1531 Canisminor.png]].

===Sirius===
In the [[astrology]] of the [[Middle Ages]], [[Sirius]] was a [[Behenian fixed star]], associated with [[beryl]] and [[juniper]]. Its kabbalistic symbol [[File:Sirius - Agrippa.png]] was listed by [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]].  Its celestial longitude was 14 Can. 05 as of 2006.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Houlding, "The 20 Brightest Stars", above.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vega===
[[Vega]] (or Wega) takes its name from a loose transliteration of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{transl|ar|wāqi‘}}'' meaning "falling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''The Cay''''' is a [[Young adult fiction|teen novel]] written by [[Theodore Taylor (author)|Theodore Taylor]]. It was published in 1969.

''The Cay'' took only three weeks to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Jocelyn Y. |title=Theodore Taylor, 85; wrote 'The Cay' and other novels for the young |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/28/local/me-taylor28 |accessdate=January 30, 2017 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor based the character of the boy in his book on a child who was aboard the ''Hato'', when it was torpedoed, who drifts out to sea on a lifeboat. The novel was published in 1969 and dedicated to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

==Plot==
When World War II breaks out, 11-year-old Phillip Enright and his mother board the S.S. ''Hato'' to [[Virginia]] because his mother feels it is unsafe to stay in [[Curaçao]] with the [[German submarines]] surrounding the area. The ship is torpedoed, and Phillip is stranded in the sea with an old black man named Timothy and a cat named Stew Cat. Drifting at sea, Phillip is blinded by the sun's glare on the water. They soon find an island in Devil's Mouth and build a hut while keeping track of the days by putting pebbles in a can. With few supplies, they live alone together for two months, fishing and collecting rain water. The cay is only 1 mile long and 1/2 a mile in width. Initially, the pair display significant difficulty in being able to tolerate and work with each other, often because of young white Phillip's racial prejudice against the elderly black Timothy. Phillip learns to overcome his disdain for Timothy and develops a strong bond of friendship by the end of the novel, as Timothy takes care of Phillip and teaches him to survive independently, to the point where Phillip doesn't need him anymore. Planes fly over the cay, but they do not see Timothy and Phillip, lengthening their time stranded there. After a hurricane hits the cay and Timothy dies from "being tired", Phillip, devastated, digs a small grave for him. He is left with only Stew Cat. Phillip is then rescued by a navy vessel and one year after he and Timothy find the island, he has many surgeries to get his sight back. In the end, Phillip decides he will become a sea explorer and travel to multiple islands and soon hopes to find the Cay he and Timothy had been stranded on, which he is certain he will be able to recognize by closing his eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Theodore|title=The Cay|date=1969|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-440-22912-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

'''Phillip Enright:''' 11-year-old protagonist and narrator, is marooned on a cay in "The Devil's Mouth" with Timothy. Skeptical of Timothy at first because he is black, he relies on him when he is blinded and comes to appreciate him and creates a strong bond of friendship and trust with Timothy.

'''Timothy:''' West Indian native of [[Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands|Charlotte Amalie]] in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]], is marooned with Phillip. He cares for Phillip and understands many survival tactics including fishing and shelter-building. Although at times superstitious, he is old, wise, and patient, stern, and helps Phillip learn to be self-sufficient.

'''Stew Cat:''' Feline companion of Phillip and Timothy on the cay, especially comforting for Phillip. Timothy at one point believes he may be an evil spirit called a Jumbi. Before the S.S. ''Hato'' was torpedoed, he was the cook's cat.

'''Phillip's Mother, Grace:''' Accompanies Phillip on the S.S. ''Hato'' headed for Virginia, is separated from him when it sinks. Notably racist against the black inhabitants of Curaçao.

'''Phillip's Father, Phillip Enright Sr.:''' Relocates the family to the [[Dutch West Indies]] for government-related work. He works in an oil refinery that increases the production of aviation gas.

'''Henrik van Boven:''' Phillip's Dutch-national friend in Curaçao; he does not understand Phillip's mother's disdain for blacks.

==Racism==

Phillip is in the beginning and throughout the early parts of the novel skeptical of blacks, which seems partially provoked by his mother, who is described as homesick for Virginia and unused to [[Curaçao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Theodore|title=The Cay|date=1969|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-440-22912-X|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip mentions that his mother did not like the blacks who worked on the bay, asking him and his friend Henrik not to go there and telling him that the blacks live differently than Phillip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Theodore|title=The Cay|date=1969|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-440-22912-X|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip doesn't understand why she feels this way, especially since Henrik finds it particularly unusual, but nevertheless, initially, it shows that he seems to have the same sentiments when dealing with Timothy.

Phillip finds that there are some similarities between himself and Timothy. On page 40, Timothy reveals he's from Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas, to which Phillip responds that means he's American, citing the American purchase of the Virgin Islands from Denmark as a result of the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies]]. Timothy only laughs and mentions that he never gave it much thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Theodore|title=The Cay|date=1969|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-440-22912-X|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip seems unsure what to make of Timothy and asks if his parents were African; he notices that Timothy looked "pure African" and says he looked very much like men he'd seen in "jungle pictures", but Timothy says he has only ever known the Caribbean islands.

When Phillip ends up blind, he comes to rely upon Timothy to provide for him and teach him. This alters the dynamic of their relationship greatly. Timothy proves to a surprised Phillip that he has a great knowledge of the Caribbean islands and survival tactics, able to make shelter, gather food and water, and survive. He teaches these to Phillip so that he won't be an invalid. In turn, their bond strengthens and Phillip grows to admire and befriend Timothy. He is devastated at Timothy's death, makes a grave for him, and sobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Theodore|title=The Cay|date=1969|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-440-22912-X|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returns to Curaçao, Phillip spends a lot of time with the workers of St. Anna Bay, many of whom knew Timothy and remember him fondly. Phillip notes that he feels close to those people; he no longer has any prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Theodore|title=The Cay|date=1969|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-440-22912-X|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Published to both wide acclaim and pointed criticism for its impact as a promoter of racial harmony, ''The Cay'' received [[Jane Addams Children's Book Award]] in 1970. In 1974, when NBC-TV adapted its story for a television drama, the Council on Interracial Books for Children organized a press conference to "urge people to watch the telecast and, if you feel as we do, that an insidiously racist message is contained in the story, please call your local stations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Council on Interracial Books for Children|title=The Cay: A Position Paper|journal=Top of the News|date=1975|volume=31|issue=3|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of that press conference, the current chair of the Addams Award Committee, who was not the chair at the time the award was given to ''The Cay'', publicly stated that she thought it was a mistake to have named ''The Cay'' an Addams Award winner for having a racist theme.&lt;ref name=Griffith&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffith|first1=S. C.|title=The Jane Addams Children’s Book Award: Honoring Children’s Literature for Peace and Social Justice since 1953|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, NJ|pages=18–19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3DIt3sNsSAC&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Taylor, who saw the work as "a subtle plea for better race relations and more understanding,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Miller |title=Theodore Taylor, 85, Children's Novelist |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/42476 |work=New York Sun |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; returned the Award "by choice, not in anger, but with troubling questions."&lt;ref name=Griffith/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=T |title=In the Mailbag ... to the Editor |journal=Top of the News |date=1975 |volume=31 |issue=3 |page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Taylor reported that the Award had been rescinded.&lt;ref name=Griffith/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roginski|first1=J.W.|title=Behind the Covers: Interviews of Authors and Illustrators of Children's Books|date=1985|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|location=Littleton, CO|page=212|chapter=Theodore Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though ''The Cay'' remains on the list of Addams Award winners, Taylor's claim is widely thought to be true and has become a part of reading and discussing the book as required reading in schools in dozens of U.S. states as well as internationally.&lt;ref name=Griffith/&gt;

==Adaptation and sequel==
* The book was adapted into a [[The Cay (film)|TV film]] in 1974 with [[Alfred Lutter]] as Phillip, [[James Earl Jones]] as Timothy, and [[Gretchen Corbett]] as Phillip's mother. Phillip's father was not in the movie.
* In 1993, Taylor published ''[[Timothy of the Cay]]'', a book which tells both of Phillip's life after and of Timothy's life before the ordeal.

The series was started sometime in 1881 after a letter had been sent to the Secretary of State for India signed by [[Charles Darwin]], Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and other "eminent men of science" forwarded by P.L.Sclater to R.H. Hobart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kinnear, N.B.|authorlink=Norman Boyd Kinnear| year=1951|title= The history of Indian mammalogy and ornithology. Part I. Mammals.|journal= J. Bombay Nat. Hist.

T. Blanford]] was appointed editor and began work on the volume on mammals.
[[Image:WTBlanford.jpg|thumb|[[William Thomas Blanford|W. T .Blanford (1832–1905)]]]]
In the volume on the mammals, Blanford notes:
{{cquote|The need for new and revised descriptive works had, for some years before 1881, been felt and discussed amongst naturalists in India, but the attention of the Government was, I believe, first called to the matter by a memorial dated Sept. 15th of that year, prepared by Mr. P. L. Sclater, the well-known Secretary of the Zoological Society, signed by Mr. Charles Darwin, Sir J. Hooker, Professor Huxley, Sir J. Lubbock, Prof. W. H. Flower, and by Mr. Sclater himself, and presented to the Secretary of State for India. This memorial recommended the preparation of a series of Handbooks of Indian Zoology and my appointment as Editor. It is scarcely necessary to add that to the recommendation of men so highly respected and so well known in the world of Science the publication of the present ''Fauna of British India'' is greatly due, and that Mr. Sclater is entitled to the thanks of all interested in the Zoology of India for the important part he took in the transaction. I can only express a hope that the present series as a whole may be worthy of the distinguished support to which, in so great a degree, it owes its origin.}}

The idea was to cover initially the vertebrates, taking seven volumes, and this was followed by a proposal to cover the invertebrates in about 15 to 20 volumes and projected to cost ₤11250 to ₤15000. Blanford suggested that restricting it to 14 volumes would make it possible to limit the cost to ₤10500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abhilekh-patal.in/jspui/handle/123456789/2727648 National Archive of India PR_000003044449 1890 - Proposal of Mr W.T.Blanford for the publication of a second series of the "Fauna of British India" No. 74. India Office, London 21st November 1889]&lt;/ref&gt;  After Blanford's death, [[Arthur Shipley|Arthur Everett Shipley]] became the editor. The first series was followed by a second edition of some of the volumes such as the mammals, birds, reptiles and butterflies.  In 1922-23, [[Nelson Annandale]] sought to move the process of preparation of the books and its publication to India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abhilekh-patal.in/jspui/handle/123456789/2738954 National Archives of India 1922 File:PR_000003005771 September 1922 Proposal to transfer the publication of the Fauna of British India Series to India. Nelson Annandale.]&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition is sometimes called the "new fauna". There were changes incorporated in this that included for instance the usage of trinomials for the birds. Following Shipley's death in 1927, Lieutenant Colonel [[John Stephenson (zoologist)|John Stephenson]], formerly of the Indian Medical Service was appointed editor in May 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary.

The 1953 volume on [[polychaetes]] by [[Pierre Fauvel]] was published by the Indian Press from Allahabad.

The '''University Würzburg's Experimental satellite 2''' ('''UWE-2''') is a [[CubeSat]] of a length of 10&amp;nbsp;cm and a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;kg.  Developed by the [[University of Würzburg]], its scientific objectives are;
* tests of methods and algorithms for attitude determination,
* optimisation of internet protocol parameters, in order to adapt to the specific space environment.

On 23.9.2009 UWE-2 was launched by an Indian [[PSLV]] rocket (PSLV-C14) together with [[Oceansat-2]] and three further CubeSats in a polar orbit at 730&amp;nbsp;km altitude. Successful operations could be initiated.

UWE-2 followed the earlier [[UWE-1]]. UWE-3 is also planned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11048">Various governmental agencies involved with [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|environmental protection]] and with [[occupational safety and health]] have promulgated regulations limiting the allowable [[concentration]]s of gaseous [[pollutant]]s in the ambient air or in emissions to the ambient air. Such regulations involve a number of different expressions of concentration.  Some express the concentrations as [[Parts per notation|ppmv]] and some express the concentrations as mg/m³, while others require adjusting or correcting the concentrations to reference conditions of moisture content, oxygen content or carbon dioxide content. This article presents a set of '''useful conversions and formulas for [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air dispersion modeling]]''' of atmospheric pollutants and for complying with the various regulations as to how to express the concentrations obtained by such modeling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.air-dispersion.com/formulas.html Air Dispersion Modeling Conversions and Formulas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Converting air pollutant concentrations==

The conversion equations depend on the temperature at which the conversion is wanted (usually about 20 to 25 [[degrees Celsius]]).  At an ambient air pressure of 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] (101.325 [[kilopascal|kPa]]), the general equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ppmv} = \mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{m}^3\cdot \frac{(0.08205\cdot T)}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

and for the reverse conversion:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{m}^3 = \mathrm{ppmv}\cdot \frac{M}{(0.08205\cdot T)}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|align=right| ppmv
|align=left|= air pollutant concentration, in [[parts per notation|parts per million]] by volume
|-
|align=right| mg/m³
|align=left|= milligrams of pollutant per cubic meter of air&lt;br&gt;
|-
|align=right| &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= atmospheric temperature in [[kelvin]]s = 273.15 + °C

|-
|align=right| &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; 
|align=left|= [[molecular weight]] of the air pollutant (dimensionless)
|}

Notes:
* Pollution regulations in the United States typically [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|reference]] their pollutant limits to an ambient temperature of 20 to 25&amp;nbsp;°C as noted above. In most other nations, the reference ambient temperature for pollutant limits may be 0&amp;nbsp;°C or other values.
* 1 percent by volume = 10,000 ppmv (i.e., parts per million by volume).
* atm = absolute atmospheric pressure in atmospheres
* mol = [[mole (unit)|gram mole]]

==Correcting concentrations for altitude==

Atmospheric pollutant concentrations expressed as mass per unit volume of atmospheric air (e.g., mg/m³, µg/m³, etc.) at sea level will decrease with increasing [[altitude]] because the atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude.

The change of [[atmospheric pressure]] with altitude can be obtained from this equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005| isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_a=0.9877^a&lt;/math&gt;

Given an atmospheric pollutant concentration at an atmospheric pressure of 1 atmosphere (i.e., at sea level altitude), the concentration at other altitudes can be obtained from this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;C_a = C\cdot 0.9877^a&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"

As an example, given a concentration of 260&amp;nbsp;mg/m³ at sea level, calculate the equivalent concentration at an altitude of 1,800 meters:

''C''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = 260 × 0.9877&lt;sup&gt; 18&lt;/sup&gt; = 208&amp;nbsp;mg/m³ at 1,800 meters altitude

==Standard conditions for gas volumes==

A [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal cubic meter]] (Nm³ ) is the metric expression of gas volume at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]] and it is usually (''but not always'') defined as being measured at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] of pressure.

A [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard cubic foot]] (scf) is the USA expression of gas volume at standard conditions and it is often (''but not always'') defined as being measured at 60&amp;nbsp;°F and 1 atmosphere of pressure. There are other definitions of standard gas conditions used in the USA besides 60&amp;nbsp;°F and 1 atmosphere.

That being understood:

'''1 Nm³ of any gas (measured at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 atmosphere of absolute pressure) equals 37.326 scf of that gas (measured at 60&amp;nbsp;°F and 1 atmosphere of absolute pressure).'''

'''1 kmol of any ideal gas equals 22.414 Nm³ of that gas at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 atmosphere of absolute pressure ... and 1 lbmol of any ideal gas equals 379.482 scf of that gas at 60&amp;nbsp;°F and 1 atmosphere of absolute pressure.'''

Notes:
* kmol = [[mole (unit)|kilomole or kilogram mole]]
* lbmol = [[mole (unit)|pound mole]]

==Windspeed conversion factors==

Meteorological data includes windspeeds which may be expressed as [[mile|statute miles]] per hour, [[knot (unit)|knots]], or meters per second. Here are the conversion factors for those various expressions of windspeed:

'''1&amp;nbsp;m/s = 2.237 statute mile/h = 1.944 knots'''&lt;br&gt;
'''1 knot = 1.151 statute mile/h = 0.514&amp;nbsp;m/s'''&lt;br&gt;
'''1 statute mile/h = 0.869 knots = 0.447&amp;nbsp;m/s'''

Note:
* 1 statute mile = 5,280 feet = 1,609 meters

==Correcting for reference conditions==

Many environmental protection agencies have issued regulations that limit the concentration of pollutants in gaseous [[Emission standards|emissions]] and define the reference conditions applicable to those concentration limits.  For example, such a regulation might limit the concentration of [[Nitrogen oxide|NOx]] to 55 ppmv in a dry combustion exhaust gas corrected to 3 volume percent [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].  As another example, a regulation might limit the concentration of [[Particulate|particulate matter]] to 0.1 [[Grain (measure)|grain]] per standard cubic foot (i.e., scf) of dry exhaust gas corrected to 12 volume percent [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

Environmental agencies in the USA often denote a [[standard cubic foot]] of dry gas as "dscf" or as "scfd".  Likewise, a [[standard cubic meter]] of dry gas is often denoted as "dscm" or "scmd" (again, by environmental agencies in the USA).

===Correcting to a dry basis===

If a gaseous emission sample is analyzed and found to contain water vapor and a pollutant concentration of say 40 ppmv, then 40 ppmv should be designated as the "wet basis" pollutant concentration.  The following equation can be used to correct the measured "wet basis" concentration to a "[[dry basis]]" concentration:&lt;ref&gt;40 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter I, Part 60, Appendix A-3, Test Method 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;dry\;basis\;concentration = (wet\;basis\;concentration)/(1-w)&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right|''&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;''
|align=left|= fraction of the emitted exhaust gas, by volume, which is water vapor
|}

Thus, a wet basis concentration of 40 ppmv in a gas having 10 volume percent water vapor would have a dry basis concentration = 40 ÷ ( 1 - 0.10 ) = 44.44 ppmv.

===Correcting to a reference oxygen content===

The following equation can be used to correct a measured pollutant concentration in an emitted gas (containing a measured O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content) to an equivalent pollutant concentration in an emitted gas containing a specified reference amount of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;40 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter I, Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_r = C_m\cdot\frac{(20.9-r)}{(20.9-m)}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right| ''&lt;math&gt;C_r&lt;/math&gt;''
|align=left|= corrected concentration in a dry gas having a specified reference volume % O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right| ''&lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt;''
|align=left|= measured concentration in a dry gas having a measured volume % O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Thus, a measured NOx concentration of 45 ppmv (dry basis) in a gas having 5 volume % O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is&lt;br&gt;
45 × ( 20.9 - 3 ) ÷ ( 20.9 - 5 ) = 50.7 ppmv (dry basis) of NOx when corrected to a gas having a specified reference O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of 3 volume %.

===Correcting to a reference carbon dioxide content===

The following equation can be used to correct a measured pollutant concentration in an emitted gas (containing a measured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content) to an equivalent pollutant concentration in an emitted gas containing a specified reference amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;40 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter I, Part 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_r = C_m\cdot\frac {r}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right| ''&lt;math&gt;C_r&lt;/math&gt;''
|align=left|= corrected concentration in a dry gas having a specified reference volume % CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right| ''&lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt;''
|align=left|= measured concentration in a dry gas having a measured volume % CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
|}
 
Thus, a measured particulates concentration of 0.1 grain per dscf in a gas that has 8 volume % CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is&lt;br&gt;
0.1 × ( 12 ÷ 8 ) = 0.15 grain per dscf when corrected to a gas having a specified reference CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of 12 volume %.

Notes:
* Although ppmv and grains per dscf have been used in the above examples, concentrations such as ppbv (i.e., parts per billion by volume), volume percent, grams per dscm and many others may also be used.
* 1 percent by volume = 10,000 ppmv (i.e., parts per million by volume).
* Care must be taken with the concentrations expressed as ppbv to differentiate between the British billion which is 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and the USA billion which is 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.
