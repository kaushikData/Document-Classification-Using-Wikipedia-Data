      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13709">[[File:JackThompsonAttorney.jpg|thumb|right|Jack Thompson in 2007]]
'''A Modest Video Game Proposal''' is the title of an open letter sent by activist/former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] to members of the press and to [[Entertainment Software Association]] president [[Doug Lowenstein]] on October 10, 2005. He proposed that, if someone could "create, manufacture, distribute, and sell a video game in 2006" that allows players to play the scenario he has written, in which the character kills video game developers, he will donate $10,000 to the charity of former [[Take-Two Interactive]] chairman [[Paul Eibeler]]'s choosing.&lt;ref name=ModestProposal&gt;Saunderson, Matt. "[http://gc.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=5883 Attorney Proposes Violent Game]", ''Advanced Media Network - GameCube''. October 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the letter alludes to [[Jonathan Swift]]'s 18th century satire essay ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''.

Thompson stated that he thought such a game would never be made because developers would be afraid to "train" people to kill them. He was unaware that [[Running With Scissors (company)|Running With Scissors]] had already released a commercial first person shooter, ''[[Postal 2]]'', in which the player could massacre the employees of Running With Scissors, including its CEO, Vince Desi, and actor [[Gary Coleman]]. Before that, some games had the game company buildings as [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]], sometimes destroyable by the player (for example, ''[[MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat|MechWarrior 2]]'' features the Activision headquarters in some levels), and ''[[Doom II]]'' even had the player essentially kill [[id Software]] co-founder [[John Romero]] in the final boss battle of the game.

==The "Modest Proposal"==
Jack Thompson wrote a letter that describes a game whose protagonist is Osaki Kim, the father of a high school boy beaten to death with a baseball bat by a 14-year-old gamer who played a game about beating people to death with a bat. The game intro shows the court session where the killer is sentenced to "only" life in prison.

Osaki Kim then swears vengeance, and gets weapons, "even baseball bats. Especially baseball bats." Kim goes to [[New York City|New York]] to kill Paula Eibel, the CEO of "Take This," the company that made the "murder simulator on which his son's killer trained", along with her husband and kids, then urinates on their severed brain stems (as in ''[[Postal²]]''). ("Take This" is a parody of the name "[[Take-Two Interactive]]," whose developers created the games [[Grand Theft Auto]], [[Bully (video game)|Bully]], and [[Manhunt (video game series)|Manhunt]], all of which are games which Jack Thompson lobbied against.) Kim then kills the lawyers of "Blank, Stare", the law firm that defended Take This, "with singer Jackson Browne's 1980's hit Lawyers in Love blaring." Kim then destroys high-tech video arcades called "GameWerks". Lastly, he goes to [[E³]] on its opening at May 10, 2006, destroying all video game industry execs in "one final, monstrously delicious rampage".

Along the way, Kim steals supplies from [[Best Buy]], [[Circuit City (1949 company)|Circuit City]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Wal-Mart]] stores, and roughs up store managers and clerks, yelling "'You should have checked kids' IDs!'"

==''Defamation of Character: A Jack Thompson Murder Simulator''==
A group of modders known as the Fighting Hellfish (the name is taken from [[Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish"|an episode]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'') had released exactly one week prior a mod for the game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', called ''Defamation of Character: A Jack Thompson Murder Simulator''. The mod features Jack Thompson himself acting out a remarkably similar scenario, at one point even assassinating Doug Lowenstein. Acting under [[hypnosis]], Thompson moonlights as Banman and takes to the streets in his "[[Bandwagon effect|Bannedwagon]]" to destroy the entire shipment of Rockstar's ''[[Bully (video game)|Bully]]'' before it reaches distribution. Jack later assassinates [[Janet Reno]] after thwarting her coup, which forces him to confront the realization that his time spent researching violent games has turned him into his own "[[The Manchurian Candidate|Manchurian Candidate]]". Although the team never asked him to donate the money, Thompson refused to when he discovered that the game existed. Initially he claimed that the game did not meet his criteria but later claimed that his proposal was satire and said that he would not donate the $10,000.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Thompson argued that the game had to be released in 2006, that Paul Eibeler had yet to pick a charity, and that the game had to be released by a company, not thrown together by "anyone in a garage". Despite his former claim that his proposal was satire, he claimed the offer was still valid, and that only the description of the scenario was satire, the offer to donate money was real.&lt;ref name=netjackInterview&gt;Healey, Rick. "[http://www.netjak.com/review.php/1091 Interview with Jack Thompson]", ''[[NetJak]]'', January 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==''I'm O.K – A Murder Simulator''==
{{Main|I'm O.K – A Murder Simulator}}
In response to the 'Modest Proposal', a team "Consisting of 3 alcoholics and a foreign exchange student" formed a company called Thompsonsoft and created ''[[I'm O.K – A Murder Simulator]]'' in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.slutbear.com/thompsonsoft/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209044816/http://www.slutbear.com/thompsonsoft/ |archive-date=2006-02-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is based on the description of the 'Modest Proposal', and features several weapons. The story follows a disgruntled father of a killing victim who takes his revenge upon the games industry, which he blames for 'training' the man who killed his son. The father begins a spree of murders in retaliation, attacking the offices of "Take This," who made the game, and killing the chairman "Paula Eibel" and her family. The father then begins a road trip across the states, back to Los Angeles, then assaulting the law firm "Blank, Stare" who represent "Take This" and various gaming arcades and games stores before arriving at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] and completing a "monstrously delicious rampage" on the participants. Thompson argued that the game industry would never make such a game, in which the targets are virtual representations of themselves, for fear of turning players into their own killers. Jack Thompson later claimed that the game didn't come close to his Proposal, although other than the fact that former Take-Two Interactive CEO Paul Eibeler hasn't officially picked a charity, he hasn't gone into detail as to what parts of his proposal are yet to be satisfied. He also announced that "the attorneys for these idiots will be contacted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/197980.html?thread=12683356#t12683356 gamepolitics: New Game Designed Around Jack Thompson's "Modest Proposal"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Penny Arcade''==
On October 17, 2005, [[Mike Krahulik]] and [[Jerry Holkins]] of ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'' donated the promised $10,000 to charity on Jack Thompson's behalf. Krahulik and Holkins donated the money, under Thompson's name, to the Entertainment Software Association Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theesa.com/foundation/index.asp ESA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119145322/http://www.theesa.com/foundation/index.asp |date=January 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the charitable arm of the [[Entertainment Software Association]]. Thompson e-mailed both ''Penny Arcade'' and [[Joystiq]], who ran a story about the donation, demanding that the articles be taken down "or else." The check was presented to the ESA Foundation at an ESAF fundraising dinner in [[San Francisco]]; in its memo line was written: "For Jack Thompson Because Jack Thompson Won't".&lt;ref name=PADonation&gt;Krahulik and Holkins, "[http://www.penny-arcade.com/2005/10/17#1129596431 Yack Thompson]", ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'', 2005-10-17&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation, Jack Thompson faxed a letter to Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske, requesting assistance in halting the activities of Krahulik and Holkins. In his letter, he described how personnel within ''Penny Arcade'' were harassing him: the sale of an "''I Hate Jack Thompson''" shirt and frequent postings on their website where they allegedly admitted to harassment.&lt;ref name=seattlepolice&gt;[[Dennis McCauley|McCaulley, Dennis]]. "[http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/110152.html Will Seattle's Finest Be Raiding Penny Arcade?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208023709/http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/110152.html |date=2006-02-08 }}", ''[[GamePolitics.com]]'', October 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[GameSpot]],&lt;ref name="attacksPA"&gt;Sinclair, Brendan; Feldman, Curt. "[http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/gta4/news.html?sid=6135979 Thompson attacks Penny Arcade; seeks arrests] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115182238/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/gta4/news.html?sid=6135979 |date=November 15, 2006 }}" [[GameSpot]] 2005-10-18&lt;/ref&gt; as of 9:55AM PDT October 18, 2005, the Seattle Police Department had not received Thompson's fax, which at that point had been sent to GameSpot, ''Penny Arcade'', and other sites. Thompson emailed GameSpot, claiming that he had fixed the URL for ''Penny Arcade'' (which was incorrect in the original fax) and faxed the letter, commenting, "They have it now." Thompson also told GameSpot that he was not a "pixelated piñata in a game." He ended by saying that the "moral midgets" at ''Penny Arcade'' had chosen "the wrong target" and "I've been at this longer than he has." These vague threats have been deemed "nothing to worry about" by ''Penny Arcade''. The Seattle Police Department confirmed to GameSpot on October 21 that they had received a complaint from Thompson.&lt;ref name="federal"&gt;Sinclair, Brendan. "[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6136318.html Thompson goes federal with Penny Arcade feud] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625020247/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6136318.html |date=June 25, 2006 }}". ''GameSpot'' 2005-10-21&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2005, Thompson claimed to have sent a letter to [[John McKay (attorney)|John McKay]], U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington, in an attempt to get the FBI involved. Thompson reiterated his claims of "[[extortion]]" and accuses ''Penny Arcade'' of using "their Internet site and various other means to encourage and solicit criminal harassment".&lt;ref name=pafbi&gt;[[Dennis McCauley|Dennis McCaulley]], "[http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/112527.html No End in Sight to Penny Arcade Saga; Thompson Turns to Feds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328075442/http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/112527.html |date=2006-03-28 }}", ''GamePolitics'', October 21. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ''Penny Arcade'' denies the charge of "extortion", noting that they paid the $10,000 to charity, and are asking nothing in return.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Thompson also contacted the office of [[Washington State Legislature]] Representative Mary Lou Dickerson, and her office confirms they asked John McKay to look into the matter. Thompson has not clarified how he is being "extorted," but accuses ''Penny Arcade's'' Mike Krahulik of soliciting Florida Bar complaints against him through Mike posting the Florida Bar's link on ''Penny Arcade's'' website.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The link, however, is in a post asking fans to stop sending letters to the Bar because the Bar is fully aware of the current situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6136318.html Thompson goes federal with Penny Arcade feud - Xbox News at GameSpot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625020247/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6136318.html |date=June 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2005, the Seattle PD acknowledged receipt of Thompson's complaint, although after the initial reading of the letter they noted that the complaint appeared to be a civil, rather than criminal matter. They passed the letter on to the chief of their criminal investigations bureau for review.&lt;ref name=policepass&gt;Brendan Sinclair, "[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6136737.html Seattle police pass on Penny Arcade flap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216183639/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6136737.html |date=February 16, 2006 }}", ''GameSpot''. October 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joystiq==

On April 4, 2006, Thompson commented on the online gaming blog [[Joystiq]], suggesting a game in which the editors and writers for the blog were murdered. Thompson claimed that being targeted would let the writers know what it felt like to be a police officer or a woman after the release of ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''.

Instead, Joystiq actively challenged its readers to develop such a game over the course of several weeks, running a [[Competition|contest]] with a prize of merchandise as incentive. Photos of each staff member were provided.&lt;ref name=killjoystiq&gt;Miller, Ross. "[http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/05/kill-joystiq-win-swag/ Kill Joystiq, win swag]". ''[[Joystiq]]''. 2006-04-05&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amarna letter EA 364''', titled: ''Justified War,''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 364, ''Justified War,'' p. 3623.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tall narrow [[clay tablet]] letter of correspondence. It measures about 4 in x 2.3 in and is in relatively pristine condition. Because of its narrowness, each line averages only c. 4–7 [[cuneiform]] characters in the [[Akkadian language]].

Letter EA 364 is one of the [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, mid 14th century BC, about 1350 BC and 25? years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city [[Akhetaten]], in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

Letter EA 364 is from [[Ayyab]] to the Pharaoh, and is a response to the King (pharaoh) referring to a letter from the Pharaoh's messenger [[Tahmassi]]; Ayyab, the governing-man (often—("who/which"-([[ša (cuneiform)|ša]]))-"[[LÚ (man Sumerogram)|man]], [[URU (city Sumerogram)|city]]")-[[Ashteroth Karnaim|Aštartu]], is in control of one of the [[city-state]]s in Canaan, and is stating his continued support of guarding his city, (and his region), after 3 regional cities were taken in warfare-hostilities.

== Letter EA 364, Moran translation ==
Moran's non-linear letter [[English language]] translation (translated from the [[French language]]):&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992, ''The Amarna Letters,'' letter EA 364, ''Justified War,'' p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

EA 364, Obverse:

:(Lines 1-9)--'''"To the king, my lord: Message of [[Ayyab]], your servant. I fall at the feet of my lord 7 times and 7 times. I am the servant of the king, my lord,''' '''''("and"-omitted)''''' '''the dirt-''' ''': (&amp;ndash;[[Glossenkeil (Amarna letters)|gl]]&amp;ndash;[[Image:Sumer ge23.jpg|100x24px]])''' '''(dirt)''' ''((i.e. dust &amp; dust))'' '''at his feet.'''

From the time I heard and verified this,&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; there has been waging of war against him.

== Selected cuneiform signs in EA 364 ==

=== Sign "tah" ===
Often personal names (PN) contain special cuneiform characters, and [[Tahmassi]]'s name, spelled "Atahmaya" is an example of such. Sign "tah" [[File:B301ellst.png|100x25px]] (based on the more common "qab"-"GABA"-[[File:B298ellst.png|100x25px]]) can be seen in line 13—''&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;[[a (cuneiform)|A]]-TaH-[[ma (cuneiform)|Ma]]-[[ia (cuneiform)|iYa]]''. (In the photo of EA 364 (obverse), the cuneiform signs become out-of-focus below lines 9 and 10.) The "tah" sign has only one use, as ''tah'', in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'', (12 times).&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, 197l. ''The Standard Babylonian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Sign List, pp. 155-165, no. 169, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the name ''Tahmassi's'' comes from the Egyptian god [[Ptah]] (a creator god), the origion of the spelling and pronunciation of "ptah" can be guessed. "Ptah-mine", ''Ptah (is) mine'', "Mine, My (God) is Ptah", with ''-iya'' the suffix for 'my' still used in the languages of present day.

=== Variants of EN, for "Lord" ===
The "[[en (cuneiform)|en]]" [[File:B164ellst.svg|100x25px]] cuneiform sign, is used frequently in the Canaanite [[city-state]] letters to the Pharaoh for "Lord", (as [[EN (lord Sumerogram)]]), for Akkadian language bēlu.&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, 197l. ''The Standard Babylonian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Glossary, pp. 119-145, '''bēlu''', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often part of the phrase "King-Lord-mine", ''LUGAL-EN-ia''; a variant often in the letters (because of the addendum of an [[ri (cuneiform)|RI]] sign) contains an equivalent for LUGAL, "ŠÀR", for (LUGAL=king=Šarru), "ŠÀR-RI, EN-ia". Also, singly "Lord-mine" is used in some letter texts, and often with ''alphabeltic'' spellings of "bēlu" instead of using "EN": in EA 364, (above)–line (end l.3) and 4 state: ''"...at feet 'Lord(EN)-mine' "''.

In letter EA 364, the common variety of many sub-varieties is used, [[File:B148ellst.png|100x25px]]. It shows distinctly in lines 364:1,4,7, and 11 the two verticals-right, with the angled wedges at their base. The lone vertical at center-left is equally tall (not on all Amarna letters), and strikingly visible, and without the angled wedge at the base. Some letters have an additional wedge at the base (making it the 3rd, 'vertical-with-wedge-base').

'''Amarna letter EA 365''', titled: ''Furnishing [[Corvée]] Workers,''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 252, ''Furnishing [[Corvée]] Workers,'' p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; is a squarish, mostly flat [[clay tablet]], but thick enough (pillow-shaped), to contain text that continues toward the right margin, the right side of the obverse side, and also to the right side of the reverse side of the tablet.

The text is continuous, such that a final line (line 31) is needed, and is written on a final available edge of the tablet – thus text is found upon 5 sections — ''Obverse, Bottom Edge, Reverse, Top Edge,'' and ''Side''.

Letter EA 365 is authored by [[Biridiya]] of [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] and is written to the Pharaoh of Egypt (in the 14th century BC, Egypt referred to as Mizri/Miṣri). The letter's subject is the harvesting of crops by [[corvée]] (forced) labor men/women.

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are mid 14th century BC, about [[1360 BC]] and 35? years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city [[Akhetaten]], in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

San Antonio,Texas,  4 March 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Morales, “Antonine Tibesar, O.F.M., 1909-1992” ''Estudios de Cultura Nahuatl''  http://www.historicas.unam.mx/publicaciones/revistas/nahuatl/pdf/ecn22/399.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], a scholar of the Catholic Church in Latin America, and director of the [[Academy of American Franciscan History]].  He edited four volumes of the writings [[Junípero Serra]], founder of the Franciscan missions in late eighteenth-century [[Alta California]], canonized in 2015.  Tibesar served as editor of the [[peer reviewed]] [[Academic journal|scholarly journal]], ''[[The Americas (journal)|The Americas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Tibesar, Antonine." [[New Catholic Encyclopedia]] . Encyclopedia.com. 20 May. 2018 http://www.encyclopedia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Tibesar was the son of an immigrant to the United States from Luxembourg, and became a Franciscan in 1927 at age 18. He was ordained as a priest seven years later.  At the direction of the Franciscan province, he initially earned a Master’s  in medieval European history at [[Catholic University of America]] in 1937, later returning there and earning a doctorate in Latin American history. His scholarly work first centered on the Franciscan presence in Peru. Doing archival work there, he became interested in the indigenous peoples of the Andes.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Riley and Vincent Peloso, "The Intellectual Odyssey of a Franciscan: The Early Career of Father Antonine Tibesar," The Americas, 44:3 (January 1988) 343–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

After earning his doctorate in 1950, he taught history at Catholic University (1948-1974), as well as serving as the director of the [[Academy of American Franciscan History]] , 1954–63 and 1970-82. He was editor of the scholarly journal ‘’[[The Americas]]’’, the second leading journal of Latin American history in the United States. The [[Library of Congress]] recorded an interview with Tibesar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/audio/?fa=partof:catalog%7Ccontributor:dorn,+georgette+m.&amp;c=150&amp;all=true&amp;st=list|title=Search results from Audio Recording, Library of Congress Online Catalog, Dorn, Georgette M.|first=dorn, georgette|last=m.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1970 and 1988, he edited [[The Americas (journal)|The Americas: A Quarterly Review of Inter-American Cultural History]] and was responsible for making it a leading journal of Latin American history in the United States. The [[Conference on Latin American History]], the professional organization of Latin American historians in the U.S., which is affiliated with the [[American Historical Association]], awards an annual prize named for Tibesar for the best article published in the journal in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clah.h-net.org/?page_id=152|title=CLAH   » The Tibesar Prize|website=clah.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boy Scout Lane''', sometimes written '''Boyscout Lane''', is an isolated road located in [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin]]. A number of ghost stories and urban legends have become associated with the road, including the fictional deaths of a troop of [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouts]]. The area has been the subject of several [[ghost hunting|paranormal investigations]], and has been a 'haunt' for youths hoping to experience a paranormal event. The land surrounding Boy Scout Lane is now privately owned and is off limits to the general public.&lt;ref name=conley1&gt;{{cite news |last=Conley |first=Mike |title=Do ghostly Boy Scouts haunt rural lane? |publisher=Marion (McDowell) News |date=February 23, 2007 |url=http://mcdowellnews.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=MMN/MGArticle/MMN_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1149193354782&amp;path=!news!localnews |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928065938/http://mcdowellnews.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=MMN%2FMGArticle%2FMMN_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1149193354782&amp;path=%21news%21localnews |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Boy Scout Lane is in the [[Linwood, Wisconsin|Town of Linwood]], [[Portage County, Wisconsin|Portage County]], [[Wisconsin]]. It is located west of the Wisconsin River Golf Club, on West River Drive (West), and is situated between Cemetery Road and Little Chicago Road. It is unpaved and about {{convert|2500|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref name=locate1&gt;{{cite web |work=Google Maps |title=Boy Scout Lane |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22Boy+Scout+Ln%22&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=14&amp;ll=44.476053,-89.598055&amp;spn=0.025539,0.05579&amp;om=1 |accessdate=October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road was named Boy Scout Lane because the land that it is located near land was once owned by the [[Boy Scouts of America]], who planned to use the land to build a Scout camp.&lt;ref name=shaine1&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaine |first=Alex |title=In search of a real-life ghost story |publisher=Stevens Point Journal |date=April 23, 2005 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/stevenspointjournal/access/1777447741.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+23%2C+2005&amp;author=Alexander+Shaine&amp;pub=Stevens+Point+Journal&amp;desc=In+search+of+a+real-life+ghost+story&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate=April 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the camp was never constructed and the land remains woodland, the name was still used.

==Urban legend==
According to a local [[urban legend]], the road is named for a troop of Boy Scouts who were killed while on a camping trip in the 1950s or 60s. In some variations the murderer is the troop's Scoutmaster. In others it is their bus driver.&lt;ref name=lewfis1&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Chad |last2=Fisk |first2=Terry |title=The Wisconsin Road Guide to Haunted Locations |publisher=Unexplained Research Publishing Company |date=2004 |isbn=0-9762099-1-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions of the legend, a small group of Scouts leave their camp during the night and accidentally drop their lantern, resulting in a forest fire that kills the entire troop.&lt;ref name=lewfis1/&gt;

Other variations of the story exist including one in which the Scouts are killed after their bus crashes or accidentally catches fire. There is also a version in which the Scouts vanish without explanation and are never found. In some versions of the legend, two Boy Scouts escaped the fate of the rest of the troop and tried to find help, only to become lost in the woods where they die of starvation and/or exposure. In most variations of the legend it is said that the dead Scouts haunt the forest where they died and can be heard hiking through the undergrowth, or their lights can be seen at night as they seek help or their fellow Scouts.&lt;ref name=lewfis1/&gt;

Stories circulated in "haunted travel guides"&lt;ref name=lewfis1/&gt; include visitors reporting a strong sense of foreboding or "being watched", the sound of footsteps or breaking branches coming from multiple directions, red or white lights sometimes described as resembling swinging lanterns or flashlight beams, ghostly buses or figures, and "childlike hand prints" on cars stopped in or driven through the area.

'''Branko Cvetkovic''' (born 1951), a Slovenian [[photographer]] known for his philosophically conceptualized approach to photography. Working mostly with [[Large format (photography)|large-format cameras]], his architecture photography is minimalistically structured. From symmetry he opens up the space perspective to [[deconstructivism]], and in art there is a transition to a non-perspective suprematist plane, thus coinciding with [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dejan Sluga, director and curator of Photon Gallery {{cite web|url=http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}, in his opinion of Cvetkovic`s artwork&lt;/ref&gt; Besides space, his main concern is the phenomenon of light itself, the two basic postulates in photography.

==Biography==

Branko Cvetkovic was born on April 15, 1951 in [[Novo Mesto]], Slovenia, former [[Yugoslavia]]. He graduated in political economics under the mentorship of one of the best known Yugoslavian economists, France Cerne, at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Ljubljana. After working for various research institutions he served as an expert for manpower   for the government of the Republic of  [[Seychelles]].  He was also appointed as an expert for the United Nations organization Habitat.

He started to become involved with photography in 1986 and 1987 in the Seychelles. This coincidental beginning and later obsession was triggered by his fascination with light – a reminiscence of a childhood awareness of the light on the houses of his birthplace – and an emerging sensitivity to fine art, dating from his student years.  Nevertheless, his first two independent, and still amateur, projects were the [[Creole House|Creole houses]] and a continuous conceptual recording of the light above the [[Silhouette Island|island Silhouette]]. After his return home he abandoned his work as an economist and went on to work as an artist, a profession in his belief of greater importance and of greater and lasting value. He started to work professionally in photography; upgrading his technical skills and perception of fine art. Since 1990 he has been a free-lance photographer working mainly in architecture, industry and art; in the early years he also dealt with creative and artistic management and design.

In the years 1992 – 98 the several works were awarded, where Cvetkovic played a role as creative, conceptual or art director, co-designer and photographer.&lt;ref name="Golden MM for the 1992 calendar for UBK Bank entitled The Rocks" &gt;(from the cycle "The rocks and the sea").

Branko Cvetkovic resides in Ljubljana.

==Artistic work==

Initially, his approaches had evolved intuitively, then there was a [[Cognition|cognition process]] of photography and art, involving analyses of [[conceptual art]] and minimalistic expression in [[Bauhaus]] modernism and avant-garde upgraded by [[Constructivism (art)|Russian constructivism]]. In architectural photography he radicalized certain conceptual and functionalist approaches which can be compared with or are similar to those of the Bechers’ Düsseldorf school. He  worked conceptually and was particularly devoted to defining spatial light and transmitting and upgrading the form or architecture of space. In spite of his highly objective aspirations in this period he could be considered a constructivist.

In his late period he established a philosophical idea of Non-Space as a totality of abstract space. In the fine art sense he transformed space into an abstract expressive image of the (suprematist) plane as the ultimate transformation of three-dimensional space into nil or zero dimension. Therefore, he discovered his artistic ambitions in the field of abstract expressionism.

==Bauhaus period==

In his early studies Cvetkovic found himself mainly occupied with the issue of the complexity of light and image, its disintegration into layers with various depths of field, in order to envisage a new image and to formulate or to frame it on the Bauhaus modernist plane.

In this period (1990-1995) he dealt with minimalistic and conceptual topics summed up in projects: Rocks and Water, Light within Seashells, Waves and Series of Seawater Abstractions.  His projects continued with almost abstract cycles in the Bauhaus constructivist manner: Lux  Plantarum (1997) and Light of Shadow – Drawing of Form (1998), both exhibited in Ljubljana.

This was the introduction leading to his most complex  opus of industrial photography, still defined  by the Bauhaus spirit and undertaken at the industrial premises of the Akrapovic firm in the years 1997 and 1998, continuing in 2002 and 2003: Tubes, Chinese Cosmos, Abstractions and Bauhaus . His final creation in this field was in 8x10 inches LF and was named Locomotives (2005).

==Architecture: from minimalist structuralism to deconstructivism==

In architectural photography Cvetkovic has made his  way from [[structuralism]] to [[deconstructivism]]. At his early stage of involvement in photography, Cvetkovic had been posing himself the  question of the construction  of  the constructivist frame  on the one hand and on the other  the problem of defining or constructing light within space.&lt;ref&gt;Cvetkovic develops his concept in his text for the catalogue "The Construction of Light – Sequential Constructions of the Space Planes: the Spaces of Spaces" publisher Mestna galerija, {{COBISS|ID=214121984}}{{cite web|url=http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, his architectural photography is minimalistic, rationalized and architecturally schematic. A reading of light is defined by the architectural shell itself. With this approach he autonomously developed modernist functionalist architectural photography and only in this way did he find himself side by side with the developing Düsseldorf school.

===Old industrial architecture – archeology of light===

His first exhibition The Old Power Station in Ljubljana in 1992, was the first in this series, as well as the continuation of his project of old industrial buildings, namely Rog and the old brick factory of Ljubljana, which were exhibited in 1997 under the title Past Spaces. In the old power station Cvetkovic did not only make a so-called archeological inventory of the building, he also introduced the archeology of spatial light. He had researched light, as one of the critics &lt;ref&gt;Catalogue for the Fine Arts Exhibitions "Past Spaces", European Cultural Month, Ljubljana 1997, {{COBISS|ID=1679470}}&lt;/ref&gt; put it. In Past Spaces (1997), he had already presented architecture by sequencing the framing and "new" construction of the perspective by overturning the areas or planes of a picture similar to Russian constructivism.

===Concept of symmetry and minimalism – Plecnik˙s Marketplace===

Radical in his concept, Cvetkovic was presented as an architectural photographer in the full complexity of his work in 1996, with his exhibition of [[Ljubljana Central Market|Plecnik`s Marketplace]]. In this exhibition he broke with the contemporary [[Postmodernism|post-modernist]] tradition of representing architecture in Slovenia by replacing it with a functionalist overview. The scheme and the structure of the photographic work were outlined by him during the period of the renovation of Plecnik’s buildings. He shaped the Plecnik’s architecture in doctrinaire typology by using the symmetrical minimalist concept, perspective-corrected images of the architectural structures, consistently outlined only by a diffused non-shadow light, which became the light of an object itself. This was the method the photographer strictly implemented during the period coinciding with the emerging Düsseldorf school. The whole exhibition took place at the Municipal Gallery of Ljubljana and was accompanied by the artist’s monograph.&lt;ref&gt;Artist monograph "The market in Ljubljana designed by the architect Joze Plecnik", Ljubljana 1996, Rokus, {{ISBN|961-209-033-5}}. Text on photography "Multifaceted photographs of Branko Cvetkovic" written by Aleksander Bassin. Other texts on architecture by Asja Krecic, Peter Krecic.&lt;/ref&gt; It paved the way for him to the most important cultural and professional Slovenian institutions, whilst he became distinguished with his interpretation of the architecture of their home buildings, their reconstructions and renovations. The collections of his photographs are represented as the core of the archives of the National University Library, Cankar Cultural Centre, Slovenian Philharmonic Hall, Slovenian National Opera and Ballet, Municipal Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana, the Institution for Public Health, House of Constitutional Law, etc.

===Plecnik˙s National University Library in Ljubljana===

Cvetkovic completed extensive work on Plecnik`s architecture of the [[National and University Library of Slovenia]] (NUK) in the years 1998–1999 and 2003. The originals were taken by large format 4x5 inch and 13x18 cm [[Sinar]] P2 and [[Hasselblad]] 6x6. The lead and the principle of the photography and composition are based on the Düsseldorf school doctrine. In some cases sequential photographing was also taken into account. Truly exceptional is the photograph of the main entrance façade; for the first time in the history of the NUK this is seen and established in one perspective-corrected picture, actually amalgamated from three vertically positioned originals in 13x18 cm format. Because of the narrow street and the extent of the façade, this had hitherto been an unattainable, a constant enigmatic frustration never to be overcome.

Cvetkovic has approached Plecnik not only in his creative aspiration, but also ethically in his unconditional aspiration to perfection. In each of the photographed spaces his interest was also in its symbolic meaning. For him, in his picturing the Plecnik`s architecture, the basic message was the fine art transmittance of architecture with the sequential construction of the planes with the typical reduction of the light and the maximal objectivistic and plastic construction of the space, thus positioning the Plecnik`s sequencing of the classical, almost renaissance architectural space.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"/&gt;

===Opera House in Ljubljana===

Almost the contrary has been achieved with Cvetkovic`s architectural photography in his introspective survey of the [[Slovenian National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] in Ljubljana as a paradigmatic amphitheatric space. This extensive work was accomplished in the years 2002, 2003, 2007, 2007-2011.

===deKons===

In 2004 Cvetkovic exhibited his new de-constructivist series entitled Deconstruction of Light – Sequential Constructions of the Space Planes: the Spaces of Spaces, shortly deKons.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander Bassin, director of the City Art Museum Ljubljana, Catalogue of the exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; The oeuvre started to emerge during the renovation of the Auersperg palace Turjaska palaca. The author departed from the Düsseldorf school presentation. He radicalized the classical upright perspective; he controlled the architectural image by framing it in the sense of Russian constructivism, thus opening up the way to abstraction. This transformation enabled Cvetkovic to be liberated from the classical principle.

Indirect recording of light within the shell of the architecture as an analytical tool necessarily makes it possible to create a new abstract quality – the quality of the light as a means of the sequential decomposition of spatial framings. The author gives the explanation himself: "Therefore we do not only achieve the effect of constructing the perspective by overturning planes in two-dimensional space (in constructivist sense) but deconstruction of perspective and disintegration of planes by the act of deconstruction of light. Inversely that means creation or construction of a new abstract deconstructed space." &lt;ref&gt;Branko Cvetkovic in his conceptual guideline in "The Construction of Light – Sequential Constructions of the Space Planes: the Spaces of Spaces", publisher Ljubljana City Museum (Mestni muzej Ljubljana) 2004 {{cite web|url=http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backstage===

Another constructivist project entitled Backstage was recorded in [[Cankar Hall|Cankar Cultural Centre]] (Cankarjev dom) in 2004 and 2005. Cvetkovic develops his idea of abstract space as a dynamic construction never defined, yet firmly built on its groundwork base, but varied in its contingency forms upon the physical optics of various projects. These are the spaces of Backstage, which  both serve and  model the creativity. The static picture of a construction-based form is varied to a dynamic deconstructed space, decomposed into planes; the planes that host the people as creative figures and momentary actors.

Beside the main opus, there are two special series in Backstage, denoting solely the Stage as a Podium and as a Hall. The first is designed to comply with the idea of Stage as [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]’s fine art image plane. Cvetkovic’s photographic plane is marked by unnumbered timeless coloured traces that physically mark and embody human action on the stage for ever. The other series denotes a hall as a deconstructed space of a [[Suprematism|suprematist Malevich square]] plane. Each is determined and sponsored by the unique colour of the square plane. Both series are initiated and denoted by a black square – seven minutes exposure in the totally dark space of the stage – as a prelude to an abstract image of indefinable expectation on the part of the spectator.

===En Face===

According to several art critics, Cvetkovic reached the heights in the programmed course with the En Face exhibition in the  [[National Gallery of Slovenia]] (Narodna galerija) in 2005, accompanied with the monograph – catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;Artist monograph – catalogue "En Face", Branko Cvetkovic, 2005, {{ISBN|961-236-952-6}}. Texts by Peter Gulic, Boris Gorupic&lt;/ref&gt; 
Large format photographs with substantial enlargements, some of them digitally composed into one unified frame enlargement, speak of the façade and its embodying the technical, cultural, social and historical artefact. The façade shows itself as a connotation and determiner of the place. Quoting the author, "the only one building of certain space is the unicum of that place and that place alone becomes the only one place of that certain building". From this intentionally prefixed [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] it may be established that in his work, Cvetkovic, who has been constantly loyal to his conceptual reasoning in the photographic sense of the matter, wider in the fields of fine art and theory, has approached the Düsseldorf school most closely.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"&gt;written by Ph.D. Peter Krecic for the author`s nomination for the National Artist Award – [http://www.krecic.si/predlog-za-presernovo-nagrado-za-leto-2014-fotograf-branko-cvetkovic.html/ Presernova nagrada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Dejan Sluga, curator, for the catalogue of the exhibition City Perspectives, Photon Gallery, Ankerbrotfabrik, Vienna, 2014, {{ISBN|978-961-92744-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To finalize the representation of Cvetkovic oeuvre attention should be drawn to his outstanding management of space and perspective correction and his ability to impart to the image   in his photography the archetypes, the timelessness and  the entireness of the structured  spaces as a whole or things as architectures by themselves.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"/&gt;

==The field of abstract expressionism==

===Non-Space / ZeroSpace===

In the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 Cvetkovic concluded his complex and extensive project entitled NON-SPACE / ZeroSPACE. The author goes through abstraction to the field of abstract expressionism, both conceptually and philosophically, both in the elaboration and execution of his work on 5x7 and 8x10 large format film originals.
His philosophical reductionist idea of non-space is presented as an antithesis of real space.&lt;ref&gt;The author`s philosophical and fine art discourse on space and its antithesis non-space - [http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ Photon galerija] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |date=May 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Real space has converged into anti-space, into a totality of absolute abstraction of space which in terms of fine art, after the exclusion of perspective, light and real time, denotes an abstract expressive plane as a final transformation of space. In this way the basic three fine art issues are once again introduced into modernist art discourse. These are: perspective, light and the concept of space.  The transformation of space into plane confirms and challenges the idea of a black and white square plane. Cvetkovic is radical in developing his thesis. He confronts his conception of the basic fine art principles with the most human abstract and universal experience; the human comprehension of death.&lt;ref&gt;"The recipe of work of art...There must be a clear preoccupation with death – intimations of mortality...Tragic art, romantic art, etc. deals with the knowledge of death." Mark Rothko, Address to Pratt Institute, 1958, published by Robert Rosenblum, The Abstraction of Landscape From Northern Romanticism to Abstract Expresionism, Fundacion Juan March, 2007. {{ISBN|978-84-7075-549-1}}. Cvetkovic develops his thesis in elaboration of NON-SPACE / ZeroSPACE in [http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ Photon galerija] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522153223/http://photon.si/en/grupa/branko-cvetkovic-en-en-en-en/ |date=May 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this conceptual context, with utmost consistency and vigorousness, the author elaborates his exceptional frames of vast seascapes, transforming these huge spaces into vast abstract minimalistic planes; the screens and the images are ones that have not yet been encountered in Slovenian art.&lt;ref name="The review on the exhibition En Face"/&gt; 
 
The main idea is the gradual elimination of perspective and sublime transition of space to plane – "screen". Series called Screens, with many derivations, colours and transformations, accentuate abstraction of space to an expressive two-dimensional plane. The last are those of the "Black and white plane" as the final synthesis of denomination to NON-SPACE│ZeroSPACE, concluded as a total abstraction with no dimension.

===White lights as heaven lights===

In spite of total reduction and final darkness, the definitive will towards total liberation, as the idea of huge space in open sky and light, emerges. It could be termed heaven`s light or simply the big magic light, which outlasts and illuminates everything in all its material transformations. This light is the symbol of human mental eternal space.

White lights; open ocean spaces with vast light ruptures and immense light rays, and even bigger light chasms that literally swallow and dematerialize everything by colouring  it into white dazzling lights, are the founding idea for the project that also opens up for the terminating idea of the Heaven Lights.

Much earlier than impressionists, and later abstract expressionists, [[William Turner (artist)|William Turner]] was the first  painter of romantic and symbolic heritage, who was mainly preoccupied with the idea of light. In his paintings: [[Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps]], 1812, Shade and Darkness – the Evening of the Deluge, 1843, Light and Colour – the Morning after the Deluge, 1843, he tried to introspect and consume the light as a spiritual category in its mysticism and abstraction of its highest spiritual elevation. In the first painting, the light and the sun rest under the firmament of clouds shaped like a cathedral vault. Respectively, in other above-mentioned paintings, the light is embodied in the circle that reflects the gaze into a dome. Turner`s approach gave to the phenomenon of light the power for elevation that absorbs the spectator.

In the author’s opinion, these are fantastic grounds for deviation into abstract, non-material, non-objective matter; confrontation of photography with the essential and most basic constitutional matter, Light. This is the reason why his project, based on introspection of sublime light, elevation from darkness into the light, and spiritual absorption, a voyage that is traced by light, could be handled and tracked by photography and its basic tool, Light.

Cvetkovic’s work is based on the movement of the large format 8x10 in. camera which, with its resolution power of 8x10 in. film and long exposures, can absorb the light in its abstract images.

===Reading of photography===

Photography is rigorously objectivistic. Symmetries are their basic orientation points. The notion of expressiveness is accentuated by perspective and the absence of it, respectively. The series of Screen and Plane coincide with abstract expressionism. In addition, the presentiment and sensation of huge minimalistic planes with expressive supernatural connotation have to possess monumental momentum. Their modem is an abstract pattern which we, unawares, inhibit in ourselves. White Lights is mainly based on symmetries and very strong reflective light on the ocean.

[[File:Gattara.jpg|thumb|Woman feeding cats]]
A '''cat lady''' is a cultural archetype or a [[stock character]], often depicted as a woman, a middle-aged or elderly [[spinster]], who owns many pet [[cat]]s. The term can be considered [[pejorative]],&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/10/14/crazy-cat-lady-pets-stereotype-forbes-woman-time-felines.html |title= Crazy Cat Ladies |author=Kiri Blakeley |date=15 Oct 2009 |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is sometimes embraced.&lt;ref name="timesunion.com"&gt;{{citation |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/mydogbandit/do-you-believe-in-the-crazy-cat-lady/2080/ |title= Do you believe in the Crazy Cat Lady? |author=Mark Ramirez |date=5 Aug 2009 |work=timesunion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage and association ==
Women who have cats have long been associated with the concept of [[spinster]]hood. In more recent decades, the concept of a cat lady has been associated with "romance-challenged (often career-oriented) women".&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt; Specifically, it has also been embraced by lesbian and queer women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pasulka |first1=Nicole |title=‘Cat Knows How to Ignore Men’: A Brief History of Lesbian Cat Ladies |url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/06/brief-history-of-lesbian-cat-ladies.html |website=The Cut |publisher=New York Media, LLC |accessdate=23 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cat lady may also be an [[Animal hoarding|animal hoarder]] who keeps large numbers of cats without having the ability to properly house or care for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Davis| first = Susan| author-link = | last2 = Flaherty (illus)| first2 = Jake| author2-link = | title = Prosecuting Animal Hoarders is like Herding Cats| journal = California Lawyer| volume = | issue = September| pages = 26, 28, 29, 67| date = | year = 2002| url = http://www.tufts.edu/vet/hoarding/pubs/herdingcats.pdf| accessdate = June 26, 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100529081942/http://www.tufts.edu/vet/hoarding/pubs/herdingcats.pdf| archive-date = 2010-05-29| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be ignorant about their situation, or generally unaware of their situation. People who are aware of it are not normally considered cat ladies.

Some writers, celebrities, and artists have challenged the  gender-based "Crazy Cat Lady" stereotype, and embraced the term to mean an animal lover or rescuer who cares for one or multiple cats, and who is psychologically healthy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/beth-ostrosky-stern-crazy-cat-lady-article-1.2361539 Beth Ostronsky Stern: I Am A Crazy Cat Lady, New York Daily News, September 15, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnn.com/family/pets/stories/its-time-to-smash-the-crazy-cat-lady-stereotype Moss, Laura, It's Time to Smash the Crazy Cat Lady Stereotype, Mother Nature Network, November 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/photos/meet-men-proud-crazy-cat-ladies-29245631/image-29246901 Williams, David, Meet The Men Proud to Be Crazy Cat Ladies, ABC News, Retrieved November 12, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary ==
The documentary ''Cat Ladies'' (2009) tells the stories of four women whose lives became dedicated to their cats. The film was directed by Christie Callan-Jones and produced by Chocolate Box Entertainment, originally for [[TVOntario]]. It was an official selection at the 2009 Hot Docs Festival, Silverdocs Festival, and San Francisco's DocFest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catladiesdoc.com/|title=Cat Ladies – the Documentary|author=Jeannette Loakman|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1447950|Cat Ladies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naftali Berrill, Ph.D., Director of the New York Center for Neuropsychology and Forensic Behavioral Science told [[AOL]] Health, "These may be people who have a very hard time expressing themselves to other people. They may find the human need for affection is met most easily through a relationship with a pet." This devotion can sometimes signal mental or emotional issues such as depression.&lt;ref name="huso"&gt;{{cite web|last=Huso |first=Deborah |authorlink= |title=Some Live Among Hundreds of Cats |publisher=AOL Health |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/mental-health/cat-lady |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119071209/http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/mental-health/cat-lady |archivedate=November 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Toxoplasma gondii'' ==
Recent research indicates a link between the parasite ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', which sexually reproduces exclusively in cats, and numerous psychiatric conditions, including [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD) and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="The Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/03/how-your-cat-is-making-you-crazy/308873/|title=How Your Cat Is Making You Crazy – Kathleen McAuliffe|date=2012-02-06|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=Joanne P.|last2=Kaushik|first2=Maya|last3=Bristow|first3=Greg C.|last4=McConkey|first4=Glenn A.|date=2013-01-01|title=Toxoplasma gondii infection, from predation to schizophrenia: can animal behaviour help us understand human behaviour?|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=216|issue=1|pages=99–112|doi=10.1242/jeb.074716|issn=0022-0949|pmc=3515034|pmid=23225872}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[compulsive hoarding]] of cats, a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), has long been associated with "crazy cat ladies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/when-more-isnt-enough/201106/animal-hoarding-is-there-such-thing-the-crazy-cat-lady|title=When More Isn't Enough|author= D.J. Moran and Jennifer L. Patterson|publisher= Psychology Today|date=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media has drawn on this stereotype to coin the term ''crazy cat lady syndrome'' to refer to the association between ''T. gondii'' and psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic" /&gt;

'''Charles Frambach Berlitz''' (November 23, 1913 – December 18, 2003) was an American [[linguistics|linguist]] and language teacher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2003/12/31/linguist-charles-berlitz-dies/e7a23743-733d-4983-bd89-5a9ced04b30f/|publisher=WashingtonPost|title=Linguist Charles Berlitz Dies|date=2003-12-31 | first=Adam | last=Bernstein | accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; known for his language-learning courses and his books on [[paranormal]] phenomena.

==Life==
Berlitz was born in [[New York City]]. He was the grandson of [[Maximilian Berlitz]], who founded the [[Berlitz International|Berlitz Language Schools]]. As a child, Charles was raised in a household in which (by his father's orders) every relative and servant spoke to Charles in a different language: he reached adolescence speaking eight languages fluently. In adulthood, he recalled having had the childhood delusion that every human being spoke a different language, wondering why he did not have his own language like everyone else in his household. His father spoke to him in German, his grandfather in Russian, and his nanny in Spanish.

He began working for the family language school, The Berlitz School of Languages, during college breaks. The publishing house, of which he was vice president, sold, among other things, tourist phrase books and pocket dictionaries, several of which he authored. He also played a key role in developing record and tape language courses. He left the company in the late 1960s, not long after he sold the company to publishing firm Crowell, Collier &amp; Macmillan. He graduated ''[[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]'' from [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;See section on Charles Berlitz in Encyclopedia of occultism &amp; parapsychology, [[Lewis Spence]], [[Nandor Fodor]], Gale Research Inc, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlitz was a writer on paranormal phenomena. He wrote a number of books on [[Atlantis]]. In his book ''The Mystery of Atlantis'', he claimed Atlantis was real, based on his interpretation of [[geophysics]], psychic studies, classical literature, tribal lore, and [[archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nEuEi1yi5BcC&amp;pg=PA585&amp;dq=Charles+Berlitz&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1lnhTfCHNoSG-wa5rfD3Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFwQuwUwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Charles%20Berlitz&amp;f=false New Scientist Mar 11, 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted to link the [[Bermuda Triangle]] to Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Palmer, Perilous planet earth: catastrophes and catastrophism through the ages, 2003, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have located Atlantis undersea in the area of the Bermuda Triangle. He was also an [[ancient astronaut]] proponent who believed that [[extraterrestrials]] had visited earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hatcher Childress]], Technology of the Gods: The Incredible Sciences of the Ancients, 1999 p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlitz spent 13 years on active duty in the [[U.S. Army]], mostly in [[Military intelligence|intelligence]]. In 1950, he married Valerie Seary, with whom he had two children, a daughter Lin, and son, Marc. He died in 2003 at the age of 90 at University Hospital in [[Tamarac, Florida]].

==Reception==

Berlitz's statements about the Bermuda Triangle and the [[Philadelphia Experiment]] were heavily criticized by researchers and scientists for their inaccuracy. He has also drawn criticism for ignoring possible natural explanations and promoting [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, Robert. (1998). ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step''. University Press of America. pp. 207-208. {{ISBN|0-7618-1067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brys, Maarten. ''Bermuda Triangle''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. (2002). ''[[The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]]''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 52-53. {{ISBN|1-57607-654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neher, Andrew. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. pp. 274-277. {{ISBN|0-486-26167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Ball|Ball Philip]]. (2015). ''Invisible: The Dangerous Allure of the Unseen''. University of Chicago Press. p. 253. {{ISBN|978-0-226-23889-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larry Kusche]] has accused Berlitz of fabricating evidence and inventing mysteries that have no basis in fact.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Regal|Regal, Brian]]. (2009). ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia''. Greenwood. p. 37. {{ISBN|978-0-313-35507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/bermuda.html "Bermuda (or "Devil's") Triangle"].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: S Chledowski Arms.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Stephen Chłędowski coat of arms:bestowed by [[Elizabeth II]] Queen of Canada]] --&gt;
This noble family traces its origins to the territorial County of Gniezno in the Voivodeship of Greater Poland. There in the administrative district of Gmina Witkowo is the village of [[Chłądowo]]. In 1692 Chłądowo (at the time called Chłędowo) was owned by the Chłędowski family. This branch of the family belongs to the [[Gryf]] Clan.  

Seweryn Chłędowski, a prominent member of the family purchased  the estates of [[Wietrzno]] in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] in 1810. From this branch Freiherr Adam von Chłędowski of the [[Bończa coat of arms|Bończa]] Clan married Ida Pfaff von Pfaffenhofen, the adopted daughter of Count Franz Simon Pfaff von Pfaffenhofen (1753–1840). From this marriage issued 2 sons Ludwig and Casimir, who received from Emperor [[Francis Joseph I]] the hereditary title of Baron and the right to use the name Chłędowski von Pfaffenhofen.

The '''Congress of [[Frontiers of the Roman Empire|Roman Frontier]] Studies''' or Limes Congress is one of the most important conferences on [[Archaeology]] in Europe. The conference takes place on a triennial basis, although there have been some exceptions. The first congress was held in [[Durham, England|Durham]]; the most recent one took place in [[Ingolstadt]], [[Germany]], in 2015.

== History of the Congress of Roman Frontier Studies ==
On the initiative of [[Eric Birley]], about 20 archaeologists and historians assembled at [[Durham University]] in 1949. Speakers included famous archaeologists like [[Sir Mortimer Wheeler]], [[Andreas Alföldi]] or [[Franz Oelmann]]. Plans to establish regular meetings of British and international academics were developed as early as the late 1920s, when Birley met [[Ernst Fabricius]] and his assistant [[Kurt Stade]] from the German [[Reichs-Limeskommission]]. [[World War II]], however, prevented a realisation a planned meeting in 1940. 
Since 1949, the congress has been hosted by 12 different countries including the non-European countries of [[Israel]] (1967) and [[Jordan]] (2000). 
In terms of size, the Limescongress has developed from about 20 participants and 11 papers in 1949 to about 300 participants presenting 200 papers in the year 2012, when the 22nd conference was held in the city of Ruse in Bulgaria. 
Great Britain hosted the Congress of Roman Frontier Studies six times. The 2015 congress was the fourth in Germany. There were plans to meet in [[Morocco]] in 2018. Due to security reasons, [[Serbia]] will host the congress in 2018. [[Nijmegen]] in the Netherlands will follow in 2021.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8901">'''Cyril Leo Heraclius, Prince Toumanoff''' ({{lang-ru|Кирилл Львович Туманов}}; 13 October 1913 – 4 February 1997) was a Russian-born American historian and [[genealogy|genealogist]] who mostly specialized in the history and genealogies of medieval [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Iran]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. His works have significantly influenced the [[Western world|Western]] scholarship of the medieval [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="Hewsen"&gt;[[Robert H. Hewsen]]. "In Memoriam: Cyril Toumanoff." ''Journal of the Society for Armenian Studies''. Vol. 8, 1995, 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Cyril Toumanoff was born in [[Saint Petersburg]] into a family of the military officer of the Russian army. His father came of the princely family of [[Tumanishvili]] from Georgia,&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), ''Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts'', p. 16. Peeters Bvba, {{ISBN|90-429-1318-5}}.&lt;blockquote&gt;For the present investigation no single scholar's body of work has had a greater impact than that of Cyril Toumanoff (1913 -1997). Born in St. Peterburg of an old Armeno-Georgian noble house (Tumanian, Tumanishvili), Toumanoff emigrated to the United States in 1928. He went on to earn his doctorate from Georgetown University in 1943 and immediately accepted a position there, holding it until his retirement in 1970&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; whose ancestors had emigrated from their original homeland in [[Cilician Armenia]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt; This family is on the list of the Georgian princes that was attached to the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]] concluded between the Georgian king [[Erekle II]] and the Russian empress [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] in 1783. On December 6, 1850, the Tumanishvili were officially enrolled on the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[list of Georgian princely families]] as [[knyaz]] Tumanov.&lt;ref&gt;Любимов С.В. Титулованные роды Российской империи: Опыт подробного перечисления всех титулованных российских дворянских фамилий, с указанием происхождения каждой фамилии, а также времени получения титула и утверждения в нем / Гос. публ. ист. б-ка России. – М.: ФАИР-ПРЕСС, 2004. с. 368&lt;/ref&gt; Toumanoff's mother, Elizabeth Zhdanova, was a descendant of a number of Russian noble families, with genealogical ties with the Western European nobility.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt;

==Career==
Toumanoff's parents fled the [[October Revolution]] in St. Petersburg in 1917. His father joined the [[White movement|White Russian forces]] during the [[Russian Civil War]], while his mother was put to death by the [[Bolsheviks]].&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt; Cyril Toumanoff was initially sheltered by his maternal grandparents in [[Astrakhan]]. In 1928, Toumanoff's father was able to escape to the [[United States]], bringing his son with him. Cyril Toumanoff attended the [[Lenox School for Boys|Lennox School]] which he graduated from in 1931 and went to [[Harvard]]. His educators [[John Insley Coddington|John Coddington]] and [[Robert Pierpont Blake|Robert P. Blake]] helped him secure funding for travel to [[Brussels]] to study [[Armenian studies|Armenology]] under [[Nicholas Adontz]] and then to [[Berlin]], where he studied [[Georgian language|Georgian]] under [[Mikheil Tsereteli|Michael Tsereteli]].&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt; During these years, Toumanoff converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. A breach with his Orthodox Christian father ensued and was only terminated when the two reconciled at the latter's deathbed in 1943.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt;

Toumanoff earned a [[doctorate]] from the [[Georgetown University]] in 1943 and soon accepted a position there which he held until his retirement as a [[professor emeritus]] of history in 1970. Thereafter he moved to [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt; A recognized authority on nobiliary and dynastic questions, Prince Toumanoff was also a Professed Knight of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], High Historical Consultant, Grand Magistry,&lt;ref&gt;McHugh, Rosita (1996), ''The Knights of Malta: 900 years of care'', p. xix. Irish Association of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes, and of Malta, {{ISBN|0-9525810-0-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Grand Prior of [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt; Having taken religious orders he became known as Fra Cyril.

Cyril Toumanoff died in 1997 in [[Rome]] at the age of 83.&lt;ref name="Hewsen"/&gt; He is buried at the chapel of the Knights of Malta at [[Campo Verano]], Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} А. А.

Dublin is a historical and contemporary centre for education, the arts, administration and industry.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Names of European cities in different languages: C–D#D|l1=Other names of Dublin}}

The name ''Dublin'' comes from the Irish word ''Dubhlinn'', early [[Classical Gaelic|Classical Irish]] {{lang|ghc|Dubhlind}}/{{lang|ghc|Duibhlind}}, from {{lang|ghc|dubh}} ({{IPA-all|d̪uβ|}}, {{IPA-all|d̪uw|}}, {{IPA-all|d̪uː|}}) meaning "black, dark", and {{lang|ghc|lind}} ({{IPA-all|lʲiɲ(d̪ʲ)|}}) "pool", referring to a dark tidal pool. This tidal pool was located where the [[River Poddle]] entered the [[River Liffey|Liffey]], on the site of the castle gardens at the rear of [[Dublin Castle]]. In Modern Irish the name is ''Duibhlinn'', and Irish rhymes from County Dublin show that in Dublin [[Irish language#Leinster|Leinster Irish]] it was pronounced ''Duílinn'' {{IPA-ga|ˈd̪ˠiːlʲiɲ|}}. The original pronunciation is preserved in the names for the city in other languages such as [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|Di'''f'''elin}}, [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|Dy'''f'''lin}}, modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] {{lang|is|Dy'''f'''linn}} and modern [[Manx language|Manx]] {{lang|gv|Di'''v'''lyn}} as well as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|Du'''lyn'''}}. Other localities in Ireland also bear the name ''Duibhlinn'', variously anglicized as Devlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/14364 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Duibhlinn/Devlin |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divlin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/13534 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Béal Duibhlinne/Ballydivlin |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Difflin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/en/16486 |title=Placenames Database of Ireland: Duibhlinn/Difflin |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, scribes using the [[Insular script|Gaelic script]] wrote ''bh'' with a dot over the ''b'', rendering Duḃlinn or Duiḃlinn. Those without knowledge of Irish omitted the dot, spelling the name as ''Dublin''. Variations on the name are also found in traditionally Gaelic-speaking areas of [[Scotland]] ([[Gàidhealtachd]], cognate with Irish [[Gaeltacht]]a), such as ''An Linne Dhubh'' ("the black pool"), which is part of [[Loch Linnhe]].

It is now thought that the Viking settlement was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as ''Duibhlinn'', from which ''Dyflin'' took its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Dublin, the making of a metropolis|last=Clarke|first=Howard|publisher=Irish Academic Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0716524595|location=|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 9th and 10th century, there were two settlements where the modern city stands. The Viking settlement of about 841, ''Dyflin'', and a Gaelic settlement, Áth Cliath ("ford of hurdles")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Palgrave Handbook of Literature and the City|last=Tambling|first=Jeremy|publisher=Palgrave McMillan|year=2017|isbn=978-1137549105|location=|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; further up river, at the present day [[Father Mathew Bridge]] (also known as Dublin Bridge), at the bottom of Church Street. ''{{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}}'', meaning "town of the hurdled [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]", is the common name for the city in modern Irish. ''{{lang|ga|Áth Cliath}}'' is a place name referring to a fording point of the River Liffey near Father Mathew Bridge. ''{{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}}'' was an early Christian monastery, believed to have been in the area of Aungier Street, currently occupied by [[Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church]]. There are other towns of the same name, such as ''Àth Cliath'' in [[East Ayrshire]], Scotland, which is Anglicised as [[Hurlford]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Dublin|Timeline of Dublin}}

The area of [[Dublin Bay]] has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times, but the writings of [[Ptolemy]] (the Greco-Roman astronomer and [[cartographer]]) in about AD 140 provide possibly the earliest reference to a settlement there. He called it ''[[Eblana|Eblana polis]]'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἔβλανα πόλις}}).&lt;ref name=Holder&gt;{{cite book |last=Holder |first=Alfred |date=1896 |title=Alt-celtischer sprachschatz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWg9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1393 |language=German |location=Leipzig |publisher=B. G. Teubner |at=col.1393 |accessdate=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dublin celebrated its 'official' millennium in 1988, meaning the Irish government recognised 988 as the year in which the city was settled and that this first settlement would later become the city of Dublin.
[[File:Dublin - Father Mathew Bridge - 110508 182542.jpg|thumb|[[Father Mathew Bridge]], also known as Dublin Bridge]]

It is now thought&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Howard (1995). Medieval Dublin, the making of a metropolis. Irish Academic Press. p. 44. {{ISBN|978-0716524595}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Viking settlement of about 841 was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as ''Duibhlinn'', from which ''Dyflin'' took its name. Beginning in the 9th and 10th century, there were two settlements which later became the modern Dublin. The subsequent [[Scandinavia]]n settlement centred on the [[River Poddle]], a tributary of the Liffey in an area now known as [[Wood Quay]]. The Dubhlinn was a pool on the lowest stretch of the Poddle, used to moor ships. This pool was finally fully infilled during the early 18th century, as the city grew. The Dubhlinn lay where the Castle Garden is now located, opposite the [[Chester Beatty Library]] within [[Dublin Castle]]. ''[[Táin Bó Cuailgne]]'' ("The Cattle Raid of Cooley") refers to ''Dublind rissa ratter Áth Cliath'', meaning "Dublin, which is called Ath Cliath".

===Middle Ages===
Dublin was established as a [[Viking]] settlement in the 10th century and, despite a number of attacks by the native Irish, it remained largely under Viking control until the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] was launched from Wales in 1169.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Norman | authorlink = Norman Davies | title = The Isles: a history | publisher=Macmillan | year = 1999 | location = London | page = 1222 | isbn = 978-0-333-76370-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was upon the death of [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]] in early 1166 that [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]], [[King of Connacht]], proceeded to Dublin and was inaugurated ''King of Ireland'' without opposition. Arguably, he was the primitive undebated full king of Ireland and also the only Gaelic one.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

According to some historians, part of the city's early economic growth is attributed to a trade in slaves.&lt;ref name="dickson10"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Dublin The Making of a Capital City|last=Dickson|first=David|publisher=Profile Books Ltd.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-674-74444-8|location=|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery in Ireland]] and Dublin reached its pinnacle in the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Slave Trade of Dublin, Ninth To Twelfth Centuries|last=Holm|first=Poul|publisher=PERITIA: Journal of the Medieval Journal of Ireland|year=1989|location=|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners from slave raids and kidnappings, which captured men, women and children, brought revenue to the Celtic Irish Sea raiders, as well as to the Vikings who had initiated the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Slave Trade of Dublin, Ninth To Twelfth Centuries|last=Holm|first=Poul|publisher=PERITIA: Journal of the Medieval Journal of Ireland|year=1989|location=|page=335|quote = ''the very idea of the taking of prisoners of war spread to the Irish [from the Vikings] in the tenth century''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims came from [[Wales]], [[England]], [[Normandy]] and beyond.&lt;ref name="dickson10"/&gt;

The King of Leinster, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], after his exile by Ruaidhrí, enlisted the help of [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]], the Earl of Pembroke, to conquer Dublin. Following Mac Murrough's death, Strongbow declared himself King of Leinster after gaining control of the city. In response to Strongbow's successful invasion, King [[Henry II of England]] affirmed his ultimate sovereignty by mounting a larger invasion in 1171 and pronounced himself Lord of Ireland.&lt;ref name="Dublin.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublin.info/history|title=A Brief History of Dublin, Ireland|publisher=Dublin.info|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the ''county of the City of Dublin'' was established along with certain liberties adjacent to the city proper. This continued down to 1840 when the [[Barony (Ireland)|barony]] of Dublin City was separated from the [[Dublin (barony)|barony of Dublin]]. Since 2001, both baronies have been redesignated as the ''City of Dublin''.

[[Dublin Castle]], which became the centre of Norman power in Ireland, was founded in 1204 as a major defensive work on the orders of King [[John of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Fitzhenry, Meiler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the appointment of the first [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]] in 1229, the city expanded and had a population of 8,000 by the end of the 13th century. Dublin prospered as a trade centre, despite an attempt by King [[Robert I of Scotland]] to capture the city in 1317.&lt;ref name="Dublin.info"/&gt; It remained a relatively small walled medieval town during the 14th century and was under constant threat from the surrounding native clans. In 1348, the [[Black Death]], a lethal plague which had ravaged Europe, took hold in Dublin and killed thousands over the following decade.&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R688at3KskQC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Story of Ireland]''".

Joseph Patrick Byrne (2004). p.58. {{ISBN|0-313-32492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dublin was incorporated into the [[English Crown]] as [[the Pale]], which was a narrow strip of English settlement along the eastern seaboard. The [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] in the 16th century spelt a new era for Dublin, with the city enjoying a renewed prominence as the centre of administrative rule in Ireland. Determined to make Dublin a Protestant city, Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] established [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in 1592 as a solely Protestant university and ordered that the Catholic [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] cathedrals be converted to Protestant.&lt;ref name="visitingdublin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visitingdublin.com/downloads/HistoryOfDublin.pdf|title=A Brief History of Dublin|publisher=visitingdublin|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city had a population of 21,000 in 1640 before a plague in 1649–51 wiped out almost half of the city's inhabitants. However, the city prospered again soon after as a result of the wool and linen trade with [[England]], reaching a population of over 50,000 in 1700.&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gI8MYY6ASdcC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Dublin: a cultural history]''".

[[File:HENRIETTA STREET - DUBLIN (402556531).jpg|thumb|[[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]] developed in the 1720s is the earliest [[Georgian Dublin|Georgian street]] in Dublin]]

As the city continued to prosper during the 18th century, [[Georgian Dublin]] became, for a short period, the second largest city of the [[British Empire]] and the fifth largest city in Europe, with the population exceeding 130,000. The vast majority of Dublin's most notable architecture dates from this period - the [[Four Courts]], [[the Custom House]], [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] and [[Grafton Street]] are some of the few remaining areas that were not affected by the wave of Georgian reconstruction and maintained their medieval character.&lt;ref name="visitingdublin"/&gt;

Dublin grew even more dramatically during the 18th century, with the construction of many new districts and buildings, such as [[Merrion Square]], [[Irish Houses of Parliament|Parliament House]] and the [[City Hall, Dublin|Royal Exchange]].&lt;ref name="visitingdublin"/&gt; The [[Wide Streets Commission]] was established in 1757 at the request of [[Dublin Corporation]] to govern architectural standards on the layout of streets, bridges and buildings. In 1759, the [[Guinness brewery]] was founded; and would eventually grow to become the largest brewery in the world and the largest employer in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=b-tFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12&amp;lpg=PT12&amp;dq=guinness+%22largest+employer%22#v=onepage&amp;q=guinness%20%22largest%20employer%22&amp;f=false | publisher =  Collins Press | title = Stones of Dublin | author = Lisa Marie Griffith | date = 2014 | page = | quote = ''[Guinness] was Dublin's largest brewery in 1810, Ireland's largest in 1833, and the largest in the world by 1914.

===Late modern and contemporary===
[[File:General Post Office Dublin 20060803.jpg|thumb|[[General Post Office (Dublin)|The GPO]] on [[O'Connell Street]] was at the centre of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]]]
Dublin suffered a period of political and economic decline during the 19th century following the [[Acts of Union 1800]], under which the seat of government was transferred to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]] in [[London]]. The city played no major role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], but remained the centre of administration and a transport hub for most of the island. Ireland had no significant sources of coal, the fuel of the time, and Dublin was not a centre of ship manufacturing, the other main driver of industrial development in Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt; [[Belfast]] developed faster than Dublin during this period on a mixture of international trade, factory-based linen cloth production and shipbuilding.&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lyons | first = F.S.L. | authorlink = F.S.L.

[[File:Life goes on... (6937669789).jpg|thumb|Damage in Dublin city centre following the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] with the ruins of the GPO to the left]]
The [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, the [[Irish War of Independence]], and the subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] resulted in a significant amount of physical destruction in central Dublin. The [[Government of the Irish Free State]] rebuilt the city centre and located the new parliament, the [[Oireachtas]], in [[Leinster House]]. Since the beginning of [[Normans|Norman]] rule in the 12th century, the city has functioned as the capital in varying geopolitical entities: [[Lordship of Ireland]] (1171–1541), [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1541–1800), as part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801–1922), and the [[Irish Republic]] (1919–1922). Following the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1922, it became the capital of the [[Irish Free State]] (1922–1937) and now is the capital of Ireland. One of the memorials to commemorate that time is the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]].

Dublin was also a victim of the [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[The Troubles|Troubles]], although during this 30 year conflict, violence mainly occurred within Northern Ireland. However, the [[Provisional IRA]] drew some support from within the Republic, including from Dublin. A Loyalist paramilitary group, the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]], bombed the city during this time - notably in an atrocity known as the [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]] in which 34 people died, mainly in central Dublin.

Since 1997, the landscape of Dublin has changed. The city was at the forefront of Ireland's economic expansion during the [[Celtic Tiger]] period, with private sector and state development of housing, transport and business. Following an economic decline during the Great Recession, Dublin has rebounded and as of 2017 has close to full employment&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://issuu.com/256media/docs/dublineconomicmonitor_oct2017?e=16581915/54602478|title=Dublin Economic Monitor - October 2017|work=issuu|access-date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a significant problem with housing supply.

==Government==

===Local===
[[File:Dublin City Council Civic Offices.JPG|thumb|Civic Offices of [[Dublin City Council]]]]
From 1842, the boundaries of the city were comprehended by the [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and the [[Barony of Dublin]]. In 1930, the boundaries were extended by the Local Government (Dublin) Act.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irish Statute Book]]. [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1930/en/act/pub/0027/sched1.html#sched1 Local Government (Dublin) Act]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1953, the boundaries were again extended by the Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1953/en/act/prv/0001/print.html |title=Irish statute book, Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act, 1953 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=28 March 1953 |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is presided over by the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Lord Mayor]], who is elected for a yearly term and resides in Dublin's [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]]. Council meetings occur at [[Dublin City Hall]], while most of its administrative activities are based in the Civic Offices on [[Wood Quay]]. The party or coalition of parties with the majority of seats assigns committee members, introduces policies, and proposes the Lord Mayor. The Council passes an annual budget for spending on areas such as housing, traffic management, refuse, drainage, and planning. The Dublin City Manager is responsible for implementing City Council decisions but also has considerable executive power.

===National===
[[File:Leinsterhouse.jpg|right|thumb|[[Leinster House]] on Kildare Street houses the [[Oireachtas]]]]
As the capital city, Dublin is the seat of the national parliament of Ireland, the [[Oireachtas]]. It is composed of the [[President of Ireland]], [[Seanad Éireann]] as the upper house, and [[Dáil Éireann]] as the lower house. The President resides in [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] in [[Phoenix Park]], while both houses of the Oireachtas meet in [[Leinster House]], a former ducal palace on [[Kildare Street]]. It has been the home of the Irish parliament since the creation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. The old [[Irish Houses of Parliament]] of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] are located in [[College Green]].

[[Government Buildings]] house the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], the Council Chamber, the Department of Finance and the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Office of the Attorney General]]. It consists of a main building (completed 1911) with two wings (completed 1921). It was designed by Thomas Manley Dean and Sir [[Aston Webb]] as the [[Royal College of Science (Ireland)|Royal College of Science]]. The [[First Dáil]] originally met in the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in 1919. The Irish Free State government took over the two wings of the building to serve as a temporary home for some ministries, while the central building became the College of Technology until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Taoiseach: Guide to Government Buildings (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Although both it and Leinster House were intended to be temporary locations, they became the permanent homes of parliament from then on.

For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the city is divided into five constituencies: [[Dublin Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Central]] (3 seats), [[Dublin Bay North (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Bay North]] (5 seats), [[Dublin North-West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North-West]] (3 seats), [[Dublin South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-Central]] (4 seats) and [[Dublin Bay South (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Bay South]] (4 seats). Nineteen TD's are elected in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constituency-commission.ie/cc/cc-report.html|title=Constituency Commission Report 2012|website=Constituency Commission|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
===Landscape===
[[File:Dublin SPOT 1023.jpg|thumb|Satellite image showing the [[River Liffey]] entering the [[Irish Sea]] as it divides Dublin into the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] and the [[Southside (Dublin)|Southside]]]]
Dublin is situated at the mouth of the [[River Liffey]] and encompasses a land area of approximately {{convert|115|km2}} in east-central Ireland. It is bordered by a low mountain range to the south and surrounded by flat farmland to the north and west.&lt;ref name="Facts about Dublin"/&gt; The Liffey divides the city in two, between the Northside and the Southside. The Liffey bends at [[Leixlip]] from a northeasterly route to a predominantly eastward direction, and this point also marks the transition to urban development from more agricultural land usage.&lt;ref name="erdb"&gt;{{cite web|title = Final Characterisation Report  |url= http://erbd.ie/upload/files/Characterisation%20Report.pdf  |publisher=Eastern River Basin District  |at=Sec. 7: Characterisation of the Liffey Catchment Area | format = PDF | accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two secondary rivers further divide the city &amp;nbsp;– the [[River Tolka]], running southeast into Dublin Bay, and the [[River Dodder]] running northeast to near the mouth of the Liffey, and these and the Liffey have multiple tributaries. A number of lesser rivers and streams also flow to the sea.

Two canals&amp;nbsp;– the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] on the southside and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal Canal]] on the northside&amp;nbsp;– ring the inner city on their way from the west and the [[River Shannon]].

===Cultural divide===
A north-south division once traditionally existed, with the River Liffey as the divider.&lt;ref name="northsouthmyth"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.irishtimes.com/news/time-to-move-beyond-the-northside-southside-myth-1.551483 | publisher= Irish Times | title = Time to move beyond the northside-southside myth | date = 14 November 2012 | accessdate = 17 June 2018 | quote = '''' }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northside was generally seen as [[working class]] to [[middle class]], while the Southside was seen as [[middle class]] to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle class]], although containing "pockets" of working class life.&lt;ref name="northsouthmyth"/&gt; There have also been some social divisions evident between the coastal suburbs in the east of the city, and the newer developments further to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/s/dublincity/index2.html |title=Northside vs Southside |publisher=Wn.com |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to much of the rest of northwestern Europe, Dublin experiences a [[maritime climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|''Cfb'']]) with cool summers, mild winters, and a lack of temperature extremes. The average maximum January temperature is {{convert|8.8|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the average maximum July temperature is {{convert|20.2|°C|0|abbr=on}}. On average, the sunniest months are May and June, while the wettest month is October with {{convert|76|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain, and the driest month is February with {{convert|46|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year.

Dublin's sheltered location on the east coast makes it the driest place in Ireland, receiving only about half the rainfall of the west coast. [[Ringsend]] in the south of the city records the lowest rainfall in the country, with an average annual precipitation of {{convert|683|mm|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=European Climate Assessment &amp; Dataset |title=Climatology details for station DUBLIN (RINGSEND), IRELAND and index RR: Precipitation sum |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&amp;periodid=1981-2010&amp;indexid=RR&amp;stationid=1958 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the average annual precipitation in the city centre being {{convert|714|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The main precipitation in winter is rain; however snow showers do occur between November and March. Hail is more common than snow. The city experiences long summer days and short winter days. Strong Atlantic winds are most common in autumn. These winds can affect Dublin, but due to its easterly location, it is least affected compared to other parts of the country. However, in winter, easterly winds render the city colder and more prone to snow showers.

In the 20th century, smog and air-pollution were an issue in the city, precipitating a ban on bituminous fuels across Dublin.&lt;ref name="coalbangov"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/topics/air-quality/smoky-coal-ban/Pages/default.aspx | publisher = Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment | title = Smoky coal ban | accessdate = 1 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coalbantimes"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/how-the-coal-ban-dealt-with-dublin-s-burning-issue-1.2367021 | publisher = Irish Times | title = How the coal ban dealt with Dublin's burning issue | date= 26 September 2015 |accessdate = 22 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was implemented in 1990 to address black smoke concentrations, that had been linked to cardiovascular and respiratory deaths in residents. Since the ban, non-trauma death rates, respiratory death rates and cardiovascular death rates have declined - by an estimated 350 deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clancy|first1=L.|last2=Goodman|first2=P.|last3=Sinclair|first3=H|last4=Dockery|first4=D.|title=Effect of air-pollution on death rates in Dublin Ireland: an intervention study|date=2002|url= http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(02)11281-5/fulltext|journal=The Lancet|volume=360|issue=9341|pages=1210–1214|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11281-5|pmid=12401247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coalbantimes"/&gt;

===Landmarks===
{{Further|List of public art in Dublin}}
Dublin has many landmarks and monuments dating back hundreds of years. One of the oldest is [[Dublin Castle]], which was first founded as a major defensive work on the orders of England's [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1204, shortly after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169, when it was commanded that a castle be built with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the administration of justice, and the protection of the King's treasure.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|last= McCarthy|first= Denis |author2=Benton, David |year= 2004|title= Dublin Castle: at the heart of Irish History|location= Dublin|publisher=Irish Government Stationery Office |pages= 12–18|isbn= 978-0-7557-1975-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely complete by 1230, the castle was of typical Norman courtyard design, with a central square without a [[keep]], bounded on all sides by tall defensive walls and protected at each corner by a circular tower. Sited to the south-east of Norman Dublin, the castle formed one corner of the outer perimeter of the city, using the [[River Poddle]] as a natural means of defence.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a {{convert|121.2|m|ft|adj=on}} conical spire made of stainless steel and is located on [[O'Connell Street]]. It replaces [[Nelson's Pillar]] and is intended to mark Dublin's place in the 21st century. The spire was designed by [[Ian Ritchie Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/2010/2003-the-dublin-spire-oconnell-street-dublin/ |title=The Dublin Spire |publisher=Archiseek |year=2003 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sought an "Elegant and dynamic simplicity bridging art and technology". The base of the monument is lit and the top is illuminated to provide a beacon in the night sky across the city. 

The [[Book of Kells]], located in the library of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], is one of the city's most visited sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/guinness-storehouse-tops-list-of-most-visited-attractions-1.1476060 | publisher = Irish Times | title = Guinness Storehouse tops list of most visited attractions | date= 26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Kells is an illustrated manuscript created by Irish monks circa 800 AD. The [[Ha'penny Bridge]], an iron footbridge over the River Liffey, is one of the most photographed sights in Dublin and is considered to be one of Dublin's most iconic landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveldir.org/articles/europe/ireland/dublin/some_famous_landmarks_of_dublin.html |title=Some Famous Landmarks of Dublin&amp;nbsp;– Dublin Hotels &amp; Travel Guide |publisher=Traveldir.org |date=8 March 1966 |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other landmarks and monuments include the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]], the [[Anna Livia (monument)|Anna Livia monument]], the [[Molly Malone|Molly Malone statue]], [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]], [[Saint Francis Xavier Church, Dublin|Saint Francis Xavier Church]] on [[Gardiner Street, Dublin|Upper Gardiner Street]] near [[Mountjoy Square, Dublin|Mountjoy Square]], [[The Custom House]] and [[Áras an Uachtaráin]]. The [[Poolbeg Generating Station|Poolbeg Towers]] are also landmark features of Dublin, and visible from various spots around the city.

===Parks===
[[File:Dublin Stephen's Green-44.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[St Stephen's Green]]]]
There are many green-spaces around the city, and Dublin City Council manages over {{convert|1500|ha|acre}} of parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-services-recreation-culture/dublin-city-parks|title=Dublin City Parks |publisher=[[Dublin City Council]] |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public parks include the [[Phoenix Park]], [[Herbert Park]], [[St Stephen's Green]], [[Saint Anne's Park]] and [[Bull Island]]. The Phoenix Park is about {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=in}} west of the city centre, north of the [[River Liffey]]. Its {{convert|16|km|0|adj=on}} perimeter wall encloses {{convert|707|ha|acre}}, making it one of the largest walled city parks in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;It is larger than all of London’s city parks put together, and more than twice the area of New York’s Central Park. {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes large areas of grassland and tree-lined avenues, and since the 17th century has been home to a herd of wild [[Fallow Deer|Fallow deer]]. The residence of the [[President of Ireland]] (Áras an Uachtaráin), which was built in 1751,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outline History of Áras an Uachtaráin|url=http://www.president.ie/en/explore-visit/the-house|website=Áras an Uachtaráin|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located in the park. The park is also home to [[Dublin Zoo]], [[Ashtown Castle]], and the official residence of the [[United States Ambassador to Ireland|United States Ambassador]]. Music concerts are also sometimes held in the park.

St Stephen's Green is adjacent to one of Dublin's main shopping streets, [[Grafton Street, Dublin|Grafton Street]], and to a shopping centre named for it, while on its surrounding streets are the offices of a number of public bodies. 

[[Saint Anne's Park]] is a public park and recreational facility, shared between [[Raheny]] and [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]], both suburbs on the Northside. The park, the second largest municipal park in Dublin, is part of a former {{convert|2|km²|sqmi acre|sigfig=1|adj=on}} estate assembled by members of the [[Guinness family]], beginning with [[Benjamin Lee Guinness]] in 1835 (the largest municipal park is nearby (North) [[Bull Island]], also shared between Clontarf and Raheny), featuring a 5 km beach.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Dublin}}

[[File:The Ulster Bank Group HQ, George's Quay Plaza - geograph.org.uk - 1743476.jpg|thumb|[[Ulster Bank]] on [[George's Quay Plaza]]]] The Dublin region is the economic centre of Ireland, and was at the forefront of the country's economic expansion during the [[Celtic Tiger]] period. In 2009, Dublin was listed as the fourth richest city in the world by [[purchasing power]] and 10th richest by personal income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/usb-purchasing-power.html |title=Richest cities in the world by purchasing power in 2009 |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/richest_cities.html |title=Richest cities in the world by personal earnings in 2009 |publisher=Citymayors.com |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Mercer's 2011 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey'', Dublin is the 13th most expensive city in the [[European Union]] (down from 10th in 2010) and the 58th most expensive place to live in the world (down from 42nd in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/dublin-falls-in-city-cost-rankings-1.879923|title=Dublin falls in city-cost rankings |work=Irish Times |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, approximately 874,400 people were employed in the Greater Dublin Area. Around 60% of people who are employed in Ireland's financial, ICT, and professional sectors are located in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dublinchamber.ie/business-agenda/about-dublin|title=About Dublin. Economic Activity, Tax &amp; Employment|last=|first=|date=|website=Dublin Chamber|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Dublin's traditional industries, such as food processing, textile manufacturing, brewing, and distilling have gradually declined, although [[Guinness]] has been brewed at the [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] since 1759. Economic improvements in the 1990s attracted a number of global pharmaceutical, information and communications technology companies to the city and [[Greater Dublin Area]]. Companies such as [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[eBay]], [[PayPal]], [[Yahoo!]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Accenture]] and [[Pfizer]] now have European headquarters and/or operational bases in the city, with several located in enterprise clusters like the [[The Digital Hub|Digital Hub]] and [[Silicon Docks]]. This presence of these companies has driven economic expansion in the city and led to Dublin sometimes being referred to as the "Tech Capital of Europe".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Financial services have also become important to the city since the establishment of Dublin's [[International Financial Services Centre]] in 1987. More than 500 operations are approved to trade under the IFSC programme. The centre is host to half of the world's top 50 banks and to half of the top 20 insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ifsc.ie/page.aspx?idpage=6|title=I.F.S.C |publisher=I.F.S.C.ie |date= 21 June 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many international firms have established major headquarters in the city, such as [[Citibank]]. The [[Irish Stock Exchange]] (ISEQ), [[Internet Neutral Exchange]] (INEX) and Irish Enterprise Exchange (IEX) are also located in Dublin. Dublin has been positioned as one of the main cities vying to host Financial Services companies hoping to retain access to the Eurozone after [[Brexit]]. The Celtic Tiger also led to a temporary boom in construction, with large redevelopment projects in the [[Dublin Docklands]] and [[Spencer Dock]]. Completed projects include the [[Convention Centre Dublin|Convention Centre]], the [[3Arena]], and the [[Bord Gáis Energy Theatre]].

In the second quarter of 2018, Dublin touched its lowest unemployment rate in a decade, when it fell down to 5.7% as reported by the Dublin Economic Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/business/monitor-dublin-unemployment-falls-to-lowest-level-in-10-years-amid-economic-resurgence-859553.html|title=Monitor: Dublin unemployment falls to lowest level in 10 years amid economic resurgence|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/256media/docs/dem_aug18?e=16581915/63526870|title=14th issue of the Dublin Economic Monitor|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Dublin}}

===Road===
[[File:DublinM50.png|thumb|The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]] surrounding Dublin]]
The road network in Ireland is primarily focused on Dublin. The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]], a semi-[[ring road]] which runs around the south, west and north of the city, connects important national primary routes to the rest of the country. In 2008, the [[West-Link]] toll bridge was replaced by the [[eFlow]] barrier-free tolling system, with a three-tiered charge system based on electronic tags and car pre-registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = E-Flow Website | publisher=eFlow | url = http://eflow.ie/| accessdate =29 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase of a proposed eastern bypass for the city is the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]], which officially opened in 2006 to mainly cater for heavy vehicles. The tunnel connects [[Dublin Port]] and the [[M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|M1 motorway]] close to Dublin Airport. The city is also surrounded by an inner and outer orbital route. The inner orbital route runs approximately around the heart of the Georgian city and the outer orbital route runs primarily along the natural circle formed by Dublin's two canals, the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal Canal]], as well as the North and South Circular Roads.

The 2016 [[TomTom]] Traffic Index ranked Dublin the 15th most congested city in the world and the 7th most congested in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelpie|first1=Colm|title=Revealed: Dublin ranked worse than London or Paris for road congestion|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-dublin-ranked-worse-than-london-or-paris-for-road-congestion-34563994.html|accessdate=20 December 2016|work=The Irish Independent|date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TomTom Traffic Index|url=https://www.tomtom.com/en_ie/trafficindex/list|website=TomTom|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bus====
Dublin is served by a network of nearly 200 bus routes which cover the city and suburbs. The majority of these are controlled by [[Dublin Bus]], but a number of smaller companies also operate. Fares are generally calculated on a stage system based on distance travelled. There are several different levels of fares, which apply on most services. A "Real Time Passenger Information" system was introduced at Dublin Bus bus stops in 2012. Electronically displayed signs relay information about the time of the next bus' arrival based on its GPS determined position. The [[National Transport Authority (Ireland)|National Transport Authority]] is responsible for integration of bus and rail services in Dublin and has been involved in introducing a pre-paid smart card, called a [[Leap card]], which can be used on all of Dublin's public transport services.

====Cycling====
The 2011 Census showed that 5.9 percent of commuters in Dublin cycled. A 2013 report by Dublin City Council on traffic flows crossing the canals in and out of the city found that just under 10% of all traffic was made up of cyclists, representing an increase of 14.1% over 2012 and an 87.2% increase over 2006 levels and is attributed to measures, such as, the Dublinbikes bike rental scheme, the provision of cycle lanes, public awareness campaigns to promote cycling and the introduction of the 30kph city centre speed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content//RoadsandTraffic/Traffic/Documents/Canal_Cordon_Counts_2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903221013/http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content//RoadsandTraffic/Traffic/Documents/Canal_Cordon_Counts_2013.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 September 2015 |title=Report on trends in mode share of vehicles and people crossing the Canal Cordon 2006 to 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Dublin City Council]] &amp; National Transport Authority |pages=4, 8, 16 |accessdate=29 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dublin City Council began installing cycle lanes and tracks throughout the city in the 1990s, and {{as of|2012|lc=y}} the city had over {{convert|200|km|miles}} of specific on- and off-road tracks for cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cycledublin.ie/category/cycling-maps|title=Cycling Maps|publisher=Dublincitycycling.ie |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the city was ranked 9th of major world cities on the ''Copenhagenize Index of Bicycle-Friendly Cities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copenhagenize.eu/index/index.html |title=Copenhagenize Consulting – ''Copenhagenize Index of Bicycle-Friendly Cities 2011'' |publisher=Copenhagenize.eu |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same index also showed a fall to 15th in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copenhagenize.eu/index/index.html |title=Copenhagenize Consulting – ''Copenhagenize Index of Bicycle-Friendly Cities 2011'' |publisher=Copenhagenize.eu |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dublin Bikes.jpg|thumb|[[Dublinbikes]] terminal in the [[Dublin Docklands|Docklands]]]]
[[Dublinbikes]] is a [[Bicycle sharing system|self-service bicycle rental scheme]] which has been in operation in Dublin since 2009. Sponsored by [[JCDecaux]] and [[Just Eat]], the scheme consists of hundreds of unisex bicycles stationed at 44 terminals throughout the city centre. Users must make a subscription for either an annual Long Term Hire Card or purchase a three-day ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinbikes.ie/How-does-it-work|title=Dublinbikes&amp;nbsp;– How does it work?|publisher=Dublinbikes|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, Dublinbikes had over 66,000 long-term subscribers making over 2 million journeys per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dublinbikes.ie/Magazine/Reports/Just-Eat-dublinbikes-latest-figures | publisher = Dublinbikes.ie | title = Dublinbikes - latest figures | date = 21 August 2018 | accessdate = 3 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dublinobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Dublin-Bikes-Strategic-Planning-Framework-Document-Full.pdf|title=Dublinbikes Strategic Planning Framework 2011–2016|publisher=Dublin City Council|accessdate=29 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114221413/http://dublinobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Dublin-Bikes-Strategic-Planning-Framework-Document-Full.pdf|archivedate=14 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail and tram===
[[File:LUAS trams at Tallacht terminus. - geograph.org.uk - 1387090.jpg|thumb|[[Luas]] trams at the [[Tallaght]] terminus]]
[[Dublin Heuston railway station|Heuston]] and [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Connolly]] stations are the two main railway stations in Dublin. Operated by [[Iarnród Éireann]], the [[Dublin Suburban Rail]] network consists of five railway lines serving the Greater Dublin Area and commuter towns such as [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] in [[County Louth]]. One of these lines is the electrified [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) line, which runs primarily along the coast of Dublin, comprising 31 stations, from [[Malahide]] and [[Howth]] southwards as far as [[Greystones]] in [[County Wicklow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublin.ie/transport/dart.htm|title=DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit)|accessdate=28 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721123858/http://www.dublin.ie/transport/dart.htm|archive-date=21 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Commuter (Irish Rail)|Commuter rail]] operates on the other four lines using Irish Rail [[diesel multiple unit]]s. In 2013, passengers for DART and Dublin Suburban lines were 16 million and 11.7 million, respectively (around 75% of all Irish Rail passengers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=TCA01|title=Passenger Journeys by Rail by Type of Journey and Year - StatBank - data and statistics|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dublin once had an extensive system of [[Dublin tramways|trams]] but this was largely phased out by 1949.  A new [[light rail]] system, often described as a tram system, the [[Luas]], was launched in 2004, and is run by [[Transdev|Transdev Ireland]] (under contract from [[Transport Infrastructure Ireland]]), carrying over 34 million passengers annually.&lt;ref name="Luas - Frequently Asked Questions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.luas.ie/faq.html|title=Luas - Frequently Asked Questions|website=luas.ie|access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network consists of two interconnecting tram lines; the [[Red Line (Luas)|Red Line]] links the [[Dublin Docklands|Docklands]] and city centre with the south-western suburbs of Tallaght and Saggart, while the [[Green Line (Luas)|Green Line]] connects northern inner city suburbs and the main city centre with suburbs to the south of the city including Sandyford and Brides Glen. Together these lines comprise a total 67 stations and {{convert|44.5|km|mi}} of track.&lt;ref name="Luas - Frequently Asked Questions"/&gt; Construction of a 6&amp;nbsp;km extension to the Green Line, bringing it into the north of the city, commenced in June 2013 and was opened for passenger travel on December 9, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://luas.ie/luas-cross-city-opening-2pm-sat-9th-dec/|title=Luas Cross City Opened|last=|first=|date=December 2017|website=Luas.ie|publisher=[[Transdev]]|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Rapid transit|metro]] service is proposed under the name of [[Dublin Metro|Metrolink]], and planned to run from Dublin's [[Northside, Dublin|northside]] to [[Sandyford]] via [[Dublin Airport]] and [[St. Stephen's Green]], with construction projected to start after 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/revealed-preferred-route-for-3bn-metrolink-from-city-centre-to-dublin-airport-unveiled-36732780.html|title=Revealed: Preferred route for €3bn MetroLink from city centre to Dublin Airport unveiled|last=Melia|first=Paul|date=2018-03-22|work=Irish Independent|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail and ferry===
[[Dublin Connolly]] is connected by bus to [[Dublin Port]] and ferries run by [[Irish Ferries]] and [[Stena Line]] to [[Holyhead railway station|Holyhead]] for connecting trains on the [[North Wales Coast Line]] to [[Chester railway station|Chester]], [[Crewe railway station|Crewe]] and [[Euston railway station|London Euston]]. [[Dublin Connolly]] to Dublin Port can be reached via [[Amiens Street, Dublin]] into [[Store Street]] or by Luas via [[Busáras]] where [[Dublin Bus]] operates services to the Ferry Terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Your-Journey1/Timetables/All-Timetables/53/|title=53 - Dublin Bus|website=dublinbus.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
====Dublin airport====
[[File:Dublinairport-terminal2.jpg|thumb|[[Dublin Airport]]]]
[[Dublin Airport]] (owned and operated by [[DAA (Irish company)|DAA]]) is located north of Dublin city, near [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]] in the administrative county of [[Fingal]]. The headquarters of Ireland's flag carrier [[Aer Lingus]] and regional airlines [[Stobart Air]] and [[CityJet]] are located there, and those of low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] nearby. The airport offers a short and medium haul network, domestic services to regional airports in Ireland, and long-haul services to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Hong Kong]]. Dublin Airport is the 11th busiest in the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.daa.ie/annual-report-2017/2017-at-a-glance/|title=2017 Year in Review|last=|first=|date=|website=Dublin Airport|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by far the busiest airport on the island of Ireland.

In 2014, Dublin Airport was the 18th busiest airport in Europe, serving over 21 million passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bodkin|first1=Peter|title=Take a look inside the 10 busiest airports in Europe|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/busiest-airports-europe-2375524-Oct2015/|website=TheJournal.ie|accessdate=1 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 this increased to 27.9 million passengers passing through the airport, establishing an all-time record supported by growth in both short- and long-haul networks.&lt;ref name="dub2016record"&gt;{{cite web|title=Record 2016 For Dublin Airport With Almost 28M Passengers|url=https://www.dublinairport.com/latest-news/detail/record-2016-for-dublin-airport-with-almost-28m-passengers|website=www.dublinairport.com|accessdate=1 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 and 2016, transatlantic traffic grew, with 158 summer flights a week to North America, making it the sixth largest European hub for that route over the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dublin Airport flying high after record year for transatlantic traffic - Independent.ie|url=http://www.independent.ie/life/travel/travel-news/dublin-airport-flying-high-after-record-year-for-transatlantic-traffic-30900426.html|website=Independent.ie|accessdate=1 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transatlantic traffic was also the fastest-growing segment of the market for the airport in 2016, in which a 16% increase from 2015 brought the yearly number of passengers traveling between Dublin and North America to 2.9 million.&lt;ref name="dub2016record"/&gt;

====Other air transport====
Dublin is also served by [[Weston Airport]] and other small facilities, by a range of helicopter operators, and the military and some State services use [[Casement Aerodrome]] nearby.

The Abbey was founded in 1904 by a group that included [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]] with the aim of promoting indigenous literary talent. It went on to provide a breakthrough for some of the city's most famous writers, such as [[J. M. Synge|Synge]], Yeats himself and George Bernard Shaw. The Gate was founded in 1928 to promote European and American Avant Garde works. The Grand Canal Theatre is a newer 2,111 capacity theatre which opened in 2010 in the [[Grand Canal Dock]] area.

'''Ephraim Avigdor Speiser''' (January 24, 1902 &amp;ndash; June 15, 1965) was a [[Jewish]] [[Poland|Polish]]-born American [[Assyriologist]]. He discovered the ancient site of [[Tepe Gawra]] in 1927 and supervised its excavation between 1931 and 1938.

==Pre-war career==
He was born in [[Skalat]], [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], (then in Austrian Poland, now Ukraine) and went to school in [[Lwow]]. In 1920, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, eventually becoming a US citizen in 1926.
He studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], from which he received his M.A. in 1923, before earning his Ph.D. from [[Dropsie College]] in Philadelphia in 1924.&lt;ref name=upenn&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/faids/upt/upt50/speiser_ea.html University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center]&lt;/ref&gt; 
From 1924 to 1926 he was Harrison Research Fellow in Semitics at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=cdli&gt;[http://cdliwiki.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/doku.php/speiser_ephraim_avigdor Speiser, Ephraim Avigdor]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, UCLA Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Speiser won a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to study remains of the ancient [[Mitanni]] and [[Hurrians]] in northern [[Mesopotamia]]. While there in 1927 he discovered the [[Tepe Gawra]] (or "Great Mound"), one of the world's earliest cradles of civilization. In 1928 he was appointed assistant professor of Semitics at the University of Pennsylvania, and full professor in 1931.
He was field director of the Joint Excavation of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research|ASOR]] and the University Museum, 1930–1932, 1936–1937, undertaking excavations in [[Tepe Gawra]] and Tell Billa.  He also translated the [[Hurrian]] legal texts found at [[Nuzi]].

During [[World War II]], Speiser left academia to become chief of the [[Office of Strategic Services]]' Near East Section of the Research and Analysis Branch in Washington. He established a long tradition of American students and scholars of Orientalistik entering and serving in the intelligence services.

==Post-war==
After the war he returned to the University of Pennsylvania, where he was Chairman of the Department of Oriental Studies from 1947 until his death in 1965. He was also appointed Ellis Professor of Hebrew and Semitic Languages and Literatures there in 1954.

He translated and wrote extensive commentary for the volume on [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Genesis]] in the [[Anchor Bible Series]] and was one of the editors of the [[Torah]] in the [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version]] of the [[Old Testament]].

A noted student of his, (future professor) [[Moshe Greenberg]], became an [[Israel Prize]] laureate in Bible studies.

==Life==
After earning a [[B.A.]] in [[history]] at [[Furman University]], in 1984, Dobbs-Allsopp attended [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], where he received an [[M.Div.]], in 1987. There, he was trained in [[Northwest Semitic languages|Semitic philology]] and [[biblical interpretation]] by the notable specialists [[J.J.M. Roberts]] and [[Patrick D. Miller]]. He then pursued [[doctoral studies]] in Hebrew Bible and Northwest Semitic Philology at [[The Johns Hopkins University]], which he completed in 1992. At [[Yale University]], Dobbs-Allsopp served as assistant professor of Semitics (1994–1999) and director of undergraduate studies (1995–97) before returning to [[Princeton Theological Seminary|Princeton]] as assistant (1999–2002), associate (2002–2014), and full (2015–present) professor of Old Testament.

'''Father of the House''' is a term that has been by tradition bestowed unofficially on certain members of some [[legislature]]s, most notably the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In some legislatures the term refers to the longest continuously-serving member, while in others it refers to the oldest member. Recently, the term Mother of the House or Mother of Parliament has also been used, although the usage varies between countries; it is simply the female alternative to Father of the House, being applied when the relevant member is a woman.

The ''Father of the House'' is a title that is bestowed on the [[Seniority|senior]] member of the House of Commons who has the longest continuous service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Father of the House: House of Commons Background Paper|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06399|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hciom3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/m03.pdf |title=The Father of the House |date=March 2009 |work=Factsheet M3 |publisher=House of Commons Information Office |accessdate=2009-10-05 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325142809/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/m03.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If two or more members have the same length of current uninterrupted service, then whoever was sworn in earliest, as listed in [[Hansard]], is named as Father of the House.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/02/labour-mp-dennis-skinner-at-83-interview | title=Labour’s Dennis Skinner at 83: ‘Father of the House?

The only formal duty of the Father of the House is to preside over the election of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. However, the relevant Standing Order does not refer to this member by the title of "Father of the House", referring instead to the longest-serving member of the House present who is not a [[Minister of the Crown]]. Until 1971, the [[Clerk of the House of Commons]] presided over the election of the speaker. As the clerk is never a member, and therefore is not permitted to speak, he would silently stand and point at the Member who was to speak. However, this procedure broke down at [[Speaker of the British House of Commons election, 1971|the election of a new Speaker in 1971]] and was changed upon the recommendation of a [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]].&lt;ref name=speakerelection&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m02.pdf |pages=4–5 |title=The Speaker |format=PDF |location=Westminster, United Kingdom |publisher=House of Commons Information Office |date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Father of the House of Commons is [[Kenneth Clarke]], Conservative MP for Rushcliffe, who began his continuous service at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]]. [[Dennis Skinner]], Labour MP for Bolsover, also began continuous service at the 1970 general election, but was sworn in after Clarke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/jun/30/members-sworn|title=Members Sworn|date=30 June 1970|work=Hansard|publisher=Hansard Digitisation Project|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/jul/01/members-sworn|title=Members Sworn|date=1 July 1970|work=Hansard|publisher=Hansard Digitisation Project|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss" /&gt;

The first recorded usage of the title dates back to 1816 an engraved portrait of [[Whitshed Keene]] by Charles
Picart, dated 1 February. [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was simultaneously Father of the House and Prime Minister from May 1907 until soon before his death during April 1908.&lt;ref name="hciom3" /&gt; On 13 June 2017 [[Harriet Harman]] was dubbed "Mother of the House" by Prime Minister [[Theresa May]], in recognition of her status as longest continuously serving woman MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-06-13/debates/EC97CC8B-CEAB-4D1D-8AEE-12D83E9E0253/ElectionOfSpeaker|title=Election of Speaker|date=13 June 2017|publisher=Commons | location=UK | work=Hansard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House of Lords Act 1999]] repealed the automatic right of [[hereditary peer]]s to be members of the House of Lords; Denham was one of those [[List of elected hereditary peers under the House of Lords Act 1999|elected to continue]] as a member under section 2 of the Act.

{{As of|2018}} the longest-serving [[life peer]] is [[Susan Cunliffe-Lister, Baroness Masham of Ilton|The Baroness Masham of Ilton]] ([[Crossbench]]), who is also the longest serving female member of the House.

==Australia==
{{Main|Father of the Australian Senate|Father of the Australian House of Representatives|Father of the Australian Parliament|Members of the Australian Parliament who have served for at least 30 years}}

In Australia, the current member of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with the longest period of continuous service, whether a Minister or not, is known as "Father of the House".  Similarly, the current member of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] with the longest period of continuous service is known as "Father of the Senate".  The longer serving of the two Fathers is called "[[Father of the Australian Parliament|Father of the Parliament]]".

As in Britain, these terms have no official status. However, unlike Britain:
* the term Father of the House/Senate applies where there is one member whose continuous service is unequivocally longer than any other, as determined by the date of election (House) or the date of the start of the term (Senate).  Where two or more members have equal length of continuous service, more than any other members, they are considered joint Fathers of the House/Senate.  Some state parliaments, however, use the British convention of giving precedence by order of swearing into office.
* the Father of the House and the Father of the Senate in Australia do not have any parliamentary role at all.  The election of the presiding officers is conducted by the [[Clerk of the Australian House of Representatives|Clerk of the House]] and the [[Clerk of the Australian Senate|Clerk of the Senate]] respectively.

Since 6 February 2015, Senator [[Ian Macdonald (Australian politician)|Ian Macdonald]], who was first appointed during 1990, has been the [[Father of the Australian Senate|Father of the Senate]].

[[Philip Ruddock]], who was first elected during 1973, was the [[Father of the Australian House of Representatives|Father of the House of Representatives]] and [[Father of the Australian Parliament|Father of the Parliament]] from 1 September 1998 until his retirement on 9 May 2016. He was succeeded by Senator Ian Macdonald as Father of the Parliament and [[Kevin Andrews (politician)|Kevin Andrews]] as Father of the House.

==Canada==
{{Main|Dean of the House (Canada)}}
The longest-serving member of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] who is not a cabinet minister is known as the Dean of the House, and presides over the election of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker]] at the beginning of each Parliament. The same term is used for the [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives|equivalent position]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]].

==Germany==
Starting with the Frankfurter Nationalversammlung ([[Frankfurt Parliament]]) of 1848, all German parliaments had a father of the House, usually called ''Alterspräsident'' (President by right of age). This tradition was continued into the [[Weimar Republic]] and, after being discontinued in [[Nazi Germany]], was resumed by the present Parliament ([[Bundestag]]), whose rules of procedure mandate that the father of the house presides over the Parliament ([[Bundestag]]) at the start of each legislative period.

In accordance with tradition, the Alterspräsident first ascertains himself that he is the oldest member of the Bundestag by stating his date of birth and asking if anyone is present who was born before this date. If no older member of the Bundestag is present (which is usually the case) he will formally declare that he indeed is the Alterspräsident and will start proceedings.

As acting President of the Bundestag ([[Bundestagspräsident]]) he delivers the first programmatic speech and supervises the election of the [[President of the Bundestag]]. He then yields his power to the newly elected President of the Bundestag, who will in turn supervise the elections of the [[Presidium of the Bundestag|Vice Presidents of the Bundestag]].

The rules of order of the Bundestag also state that the Alterspräsident shall act as President of the Bundestag at any given time during a legislative period, if the whole Presidium (i.e. the President and the Vice Presidents of the Bundestag) is altogether unable to perform its duties.

As the Alterspräsident's opening speech usually draws a certain amount of public attention, the position has recently attracted controversy, when the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (the succcesor of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]]) obtained the position by including aged independents ([[Stefan Heym]] in 1994, [[Fred Gebhardt]] in 1998) in their party lists. In 2017, the Bundestag changed its rules of procedure to have the member with the longest service in the Bundestag serve as father of the house, rather than the oldest member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/parlament/aufgaben/rechtsgrundlagen/go_btg/go01/245154|title=Deutscher Bundestag - I.

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Senior Unofficial Member}}
In Hong Kong, there is no such term as "Father of the House". Instead, the longest-serving member was termed the [[Senior Unofficial Member]] and was the highest-ranking unofficial member of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] until the title was abolished during 1995 and 1992 respectively.

After the [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong]], [[James To]] became the de facto longest serving member of the Legislative Council since 2016 after several members who had been served since the [[1st Legislative Council of Hong Kong|1st Legislative Council]] retired.

== Hungary ==
In Hungary, the term refers to the oldest member of the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]] (previously [[Diet of Hungary|House of Representatives]], the lower house). Before the open session, the senior chairperson and junior notaries review the mandates of all the elected MPs in addition to their own. He or she presides over the newly elected parliament until the appointment of the officials.

== Israel ==
In the beginning of each [[Knesset]], before the election of a permanent [[speaker (politics)|speaker]], there is a temporary speaker. In the past it was the oldest member of Knesset, now it is the longest-serving member. [[Michael Eitan]] is the most recent Knesset member to serve in this capacity, doing so from February 24 - March 30, 2010. In 2013 it was [[Benyamin Ben-Eliezer]] who had this position, and during 2015, it was [[Amir Peretz]].

==Ireland==
{{Main|Father of the Dáil}}
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the term '''Father of the Dáil''' is an unofficial title applied to the [[Records of members of the Oireachtas|longest-serving Teachta Dála]] (TD) in [[Dáil Éireann]]. The current Father is the former [[Taoiseach]] and [[Fine Gael]] party leader, [[Enda Kenny]], [[Teachta Dála|TD]], since the retirement of [[Séamus Pattison]] at the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 general election]]. On a number of occasions two or more people have shared the position of Father of the Dáil.

==Malaysia==
In Malaysia the term "Father of the House" is rarely used. [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]] who was elected during 1974, has been the longest serving MP in the [[Dewan Rakyat]]. He is also the current oldest serving MP aged {{age in years and months|1937|4|13}}.

==New Zealand==
{{Main|Father of the House (New Zealand)}}

In New Zealand, the term '''Father''' or '''Mother of the House''', as an unofficial title, designates the longest-continuously serving MP of the [[House of Representatives of New Zealand|House of Representatives]]. The Father of the House has no official role in Parliament. Former Cabinet Minister [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]] succeeded former Prime Minister [[Bill English]] as Father of the House when the latter resigned in March 2018, having served continuously since the [[New Zealand general election, 1990|1990 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Deputy Prime Minister [[Winston Peters]] has been an MP for longer than Smith, but his terms have not been consecutive. He has served since 1979, but was not a Member of Parliament from 1981 to 1984, nor from 2008 to 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand's first election of {{NZ election link year|1853}}, the {{NZ electorate link|Bay of Islands}} electorate became the first to declare the election of a successful candidate, electing [[Hugh Carleton]] unopposed. In the subsequent [[1st New Zealand Parliament|General Assembly of 1854]], Carleton liked to be known as the "Father of the House".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Norway==
Norway doesn't have such a tradition. In most cases the Stortingspresident or a member of the presidium from the previous term are asked to lead the proceedings until a new President is elected.

==Russia==
Traditionally when a new Russian parliament is formed the eldest deputy opens and manages the first session until a [[Chairman of the State Duma|chairman]] is elected. In the history of the post-Soviet Dumas these were:
* 1993 Georgy Lukava - [[LDPR|Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]]
* 1995 Grigory Galaziy - [[Our Home is Russia|Our Home – Russia]]
* 1999 [[Yegor Ligachev]] - [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]
* 2003 [[Valentin Varennikov]] - [[Rodina (political party)|Rodina]]
* 2007 [[Zhores Alferov]] - [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]
* 2011 [[Vladimir Dolgikh]] - [[United Russia]]
* 2011 Zhores Alferov - Communist Party of the Russian Federation
* 2016 Zhores Alferov - Communist Party of the Russian Federation

==Serbia==
In the [[National Assembly (Serbia)|National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia]], the oldest MP serves as the Acting Speaker presiding over the constitutive session, before the Speaker is elected.
* 2001 [[Zaharije Trnavčević]] - [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]]
* 2004 Velimir Simonović - [[Democratic Party of Serbia]]
* 2007 [[Borka Vučić]] - [[Socialist Party of Serbia]]
* 2008 [[Jovan Krkobabić]] - [[Party of United Pensioners of Serbia]]
* 2012 [[Zaharije Trnavčević]] - [[Rich Serbia]]
* 2014 Milan Korać - [[Party of United Pensioners of Serbia]]
* 2016 [[Dragoljub Mićunović]] - [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]]

==Singapore==
Until his death on 23 March 2015, former Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] was the longest serving Member of Parliament ([[Tanjong Pagar]]) and thus the Father of the House.&lt;ref name="pressrun.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressrun.net/weblog/2011/03/singapores-veteran-mps.html|title=Pressrun.net|website=www.pressrun.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2015, Emeritus Senior Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] is Father of the House, as the longest serving MP (from the district named [[Marine Parade]]).&lt;ref name="pressrun.net"/&gt;

==Sweden==
In Sweden the [[Riksdagsordningen]] law states that the member of the [[Sveriges riksdag|Riksdag]] who has held his elected seat for the longest shall be the ''Ålderspresident'', which translates to ''President by age''. The Ålderspresident acts as speaker of the Riksdag after each election, before the [[Speaker of the Riksdag]] has been elected. The Ålderspresident also acts as speaker in case of hindrance on behalf of the Speaker and all three Deputy Speakers.

Members of the Riksdag who has held the position of Ålderspresident:
* [[Tage Erlander]] (first elected 1932) 1971–1973
* [[Torsten Nilsson]] (first elected 1941) 1973–1976
* [[Henry Allard]] (first elected 1945) 1976–1979
* [[Gunnar Sträng]] (first elected 1946) 1979–1985
* [[Ingemund Bengtsson]] (first elected 1951) 1985–1988
* [[Stig Alemyr]] (first elected 1957) 1988–1994
* [[Ingvar Carlsson]] (first elected 1965) 1994–1996
* [[Börje Nilsson (politician)|Börje Nilsson]] (first elected 1965) 1996–1998

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4625">'''Government by Judiciary''' is a 1977 book by constitutional scholar and law professor [[Raoul Berger]] which argues that the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has interpreted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]] contrary to the original intent of the framers of this Amendment and that the U.S. Supreme Court has thus usurped the authority of the American people to govern themselves and decide their own destiny.&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Raoul Berger |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/berger-government-by-judiciary-the-transformation-of-the-fourteenth-amendment |title=Government by Judiciary: The Transformation of the Fourteenth Amendment - Online Library of Liberty |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In this book, Berger argues that the Fourteenth Amendment should be interpreted based on the original intent of its draftsmen and that the sole purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to constitutionalize the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]].&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt; (Berger rejects the use of statements by critics of the Fourteenth Amendment to advance a broad reading of the Fourteenth Amendment--arguing that these statements were made to make the Fourteenth Amendment look scary and to defeat this Amendment.&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt;) Specifically, the purpose of that Act was to tear down the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Southern U.S.]] and to give the [[freedmen]] basic rights such as [[freedom of contract]], the right to sue and be sued, to travel and work wherever they please, and to buy, sell, and own property.&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt; Berger argues that, in the view of its draftsmen, the 1866 Civil Rights Act did not require [[U.S. state]]s to allow [[African-Americans]] to serve on [[Jury|juries]], to vote, to [[Interracial marriage|intermarry with White people]], or to [[School integration in the United States|go to the same schools that White people went to]].&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt; Thus, Berger argues that numerous U.S. Supreme Court decisions based on the Fourteenth Amendment have been wrongly decided since they were decided contrary to the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt; These decisions include the 1880 case [[Strauder v. West Virginia]] (which stated that African-Americans cannot be prohibited from serving on juries), the 1954 case [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (which struck down school segregation), the 1960s [[one person, one vote]] cases such as [[Reynolds v. Sims]], and the 1967 case [[Loving v. Virginia]] (which struck down bans ointerracial marriage]]).&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt;

Berger also criticizes the idea of [[substantive due process]] as being contrary to the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment and argues that, contrary to the statements of [[John Bingham]] and [[Jacob Howard]] (whose views Berger argues were unorthodox in the [[39th Congress]]), the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|apply the U.S. Bill of Rights against the states]].&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt; Finally, Berger defends the holding in the notorious 1896 case [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] and argues that the reason that "Plessy has become a symbol of evil[] ... is because we impose 'upon the past a creature of our own imagining' instead of looking to 'contemporaries of the events we are studying.'"&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt; Berger argues that "Plessy merely reiterated what an array of courts had been holding for fifty years"--starting with the 1849 [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] case Roberts v. City of Boston (which upheld the constitutionality of segregated schools in [[Massachusetts]]).&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt;

On a separate note, Berger argues that the [[U.S. Congress]] and not the courts were meant to have the exclusive authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt; In Berger's view, the courts would only be allowed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment if the U.S. Congress was to delegate this authority to them.&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
After this book was published, Berger spent twenty years responding to his critics--writing "forty article-length rebuttals and one of book length."&lt;ref name="libertyfund1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2076">The '''Institute for the Study of American Cultures''' '''(ISAC)''' was an organization devoted to the study of [[pre-Columbian]] contact between the Old and New Worlds. Although as an organization it did not espouse any particular theory, it was strongly oriented in a general way toward a hyperdiffusionist view that pre-Columbian contact had been extensive. It was greatly influenced by the work of [[Barry Fell]].

ISAC was founded by [https://archives.columbusstate.edu/findingaids/mc32.php Dr. Joseph B. Mahan], a professional anthropologist whose career was primarily devoted to work in museums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=31125 Announcement of appointment of Dr. Mahan]&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in [[Columbus, Georgia]], ISAC's activities consisted of holding an annual conference and of publishing books advocating the hyperdiffusionist view.

ISAC continued holding annual conferences after the death of its founder and President Dr. Mahan in 1995.  The 30th Anniversary Conference was celebrated in 2003. Currently, ISAC's collection is housed at the [[Columbus State University]] Archives in [[Columbus, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archives.columbusstate.edu/findingaids/mc134.php|title=Institute for the Study of American Cultures (ISAC) Collection (MC 134)|website=archives.columbusstate.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations with similar perspectives whose memberships overlapped that of ISAC are the [[Midwest Epigraphic Society]] and the [[Epigraphic Society]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6627">'''John Richard Clark Hall''' (1855 – 6 August 1931) was a scholar of [[Old English]], notable for his work on ''[[Beowulf]]''. In 1894 he published a dictionary of Anglo-Saxon words,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990|p=1443}} which he followed up with complete verse and metrical translations of the poem.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} His 1901 translation was the tenth to be published in English; a metrical translation followed in 1914,{{sfn|Hall|1914}} and in 1940 was edited by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}}

==Career==
John Richard Clark Hall was born in 1855,{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} and achieved both a [[Master of Arts]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]].{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}}

Hall published two translations of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'',{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} in addition to multiple editions of ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary''.{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} His first edition of the dictionary was published in 1894, and attempted to ease access by ordering entries by the words as they were actually spelled in common editions of [[Old English]] texts.{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} As Hall himself acknowledged in the second edition that followed in 1916, however, this "was admittedly an unscientific [approach], and opened the door to a good many errors and inconsistencies".{{sfn|Hall|1916|p=v}} With the second edition he adopted the conventional method of using "normalised" entry words.{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}} A third edition followed in 1931, a reprinting with a supplement by Herbert Dean Meritt came in 1960, and this was itself reprinted in 1984.{{sfn|Hausmann|Reichmann|Weigand|Zgusta|1990}}

In 1910, after publication of the first edition of his dictionary, Hall published a literal translation of ''Beowulf''.{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} It was the tenth [[English language|English]] translation of the work; the eighth, in 1892, had also been translated by a John Hall, [[John Lesslie Hall]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} He followed this up four years later with another translation, this time in [[Metre (poetry)|metre]].{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} In 1940, after Hall's death, his prose translation was revised by [[Charles Leslie Wrenn]], and again in 1950;{{sfn|Osborn|2014}} this latter edition included a preface by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].{{sfn|Hall|1950}}

Hall died in 1931.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} He had been living in [[Eastbourne]] in [[East Sussex]].{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}} His obituary labeled him a "protestant reformer", noted that he had formerly been on the Local Government Board in [[Whitehall]], and that he had a net [[Personal property|personalty]] of £13,309 and a gross of £15,762.{{sfn|The Scotsman|1931}}

{{Nihongo|'''Keitarō Urashima'''|浦島 景太郎|Urashima Keitarō}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] from [[Ken Akamatsu]]'s manga and anime ''[[Love Hina]]''. He is voiced by [[Yūji Ueda]] (Japanese) and [[Derek Stephen Prince]] (English). His name is inspired by [[Keitarō Arima]] as well as the mythological character [[Urashima Tarō]] &lt;ref&gt;Love Hina ''manga'', Volume 14, Character notes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Keitarō Urashima is 19/20-year-old [[cram school]] student who is desperately trying to get into [[University of Tokyo]] (''Tōkyō daigaku'', often abbreviated to ''Tōdai'') because of a promise he had made fifteen years earlier to his first love. This promise, that if two people who love each other and go to Tokyo University together they will live happily ever after, is what keeps Keitarō focused and determined, even though he can not remember the name or face of the girl with whom he made the promise to.

After failing the entrance exams twice and becoming a second-year ''[[ronin|rōnin]]'' (a high school student who did not pass the college entrance exams), his parents kick him out of his house, forcing him to move into his grandmother Hinata's home in {{nihongo|Hinata City|日向市|Hinata-shi}}, a hot-springs village in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] overlooking [[Sagami Bay]]. Hinata's residence is a hotel called the Hinata House, located at 1 Hinata Street; what he does not know at this time is that the hotel had been converted into a girls-only dormitory. Despite an embarrassing and painful run with the residents which almost forces him to leave, he stays upon finding out that Hinata has given him the title and deed to the Hinata establishment. As the new landlord and manager, he must oversee and maintain the residence, a fact which upsets the girls. Even though the girls think of him as a pervert, over time he wins them over with his good-natured personality and constant perseverance even under dire pressure. Whereas in the anime he has a skill for drawing, particularly women, in the manga his main specialty is cooking chocolate dishes; he even boasted in the second volume that his skill can easily match that of any real chef's. One of his favorite hobbies is collecting photobooth pictures, which are, however, almost only of himself (except for two of him with [[Naru Narusegawa|Naru]]).

In the manga, after a trip with Seta to the [[United States|USA]], Keitarō becomes a skilled martial artist. He is able to match Motoko and on occasion defeats her in battle. Under Seta's wing, he becomes an impressive archaeologist, gaining Seta's uncanny ability to pull artifacts out of the ground practically anywhere. However, he also adopted Seta's bad driving habits and as well suffers from night blindness. His growth in character is picked up by the girls, who begin to develop even larger crushes on him. His developing relationship with Naru is one of the focal points in the story.

On the fourth attempt (he failed a third time as the story goes on), he finally gets accepted into Tokyo U, then proposes to Naru. Despite attempts from the other girls to capture his heart, Keitarō's feelings for Naru are unwavering. In Chapter 121, it is revealed that she is the girl he made the promise to 15 years ago.  He, Naru, and Mutsumi were all in that fateful sandbox and that Hinata says that he should hang onto "that girl beside him," signifying Naru. He becomes a renowned archaeologist and successor to Seta's studies.

After three years and a very long engagement the two finally get married. His luck, though, has not changed much as he is last seen being chased by Naru after accidentally tearing off her wedding dress while heading to their honeymoon though considering their expressions it is implied that this was done more as "for old times sake".

==Personality==
Keitarō is extremely kind-hearted and can always be counted on to help out when a friend is in trouble. He has a well-meaning personality, is constantly friendly, dedicated to his studies, and has a genuine concern for all of his friends.

He is luckless around women and is the subject of their violent attacks whenever he accidentally sees them naked or trips and touches them inappropriately. Despite such savage beatings, he is incredibly resilient (even a rocket does not do real harm). There is a joke in Volume 12 of the Manga that Keitarō is gifted with immortality, when he tells Naru that she probably would not survive the fall but he would.

After the few years time skip at the end of the manga it seems his behaviour become more like Seta's.

'''Khurja pottery''' is traditional Indian pottery work manufactured in [[Khurja]] of the [[Bulandshahr district|Bulandshahr]] district in [[Uttar Pradesh]] state, [[India]]. Khurja pottery has been protected under the [[Geographical indication]] (GI) of the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) agreement. It is listed at item 178 as "Khurja Pottery" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf |title=State Wise Registration Details Of G.I Applications |accessdate=4 February 2016 |publisher=Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201065403/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf |archivedate= 1 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Origin of Khurja’s pottery work has been said with at least two different stories. In one legend, Afghan King [[Timur|Taimur Lung]] accompanied [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] and [[Syrian]] potters during his campaign in the Khurja region over 500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/GI-certificate-to-preserve-uniqueness-of-Khurja-pottery/articleshow/47498632.cms | title=GI certificate to preserve uniqueness of Khurja pottery | publisher=The Times of India | date=1 June 2015 | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another legend, potters had been moved to the region during [[Mughal Empire]] while another version says there we no long historical events in accordance with pottery tradition in Khurja.

However, the author of "Pottery-making Cultures and Indian Civilization" mentioned that "Khurja in Bulandshaher is one of the oldest centers for glazed pottery in India". Further mentioned, "These potters often call themselves as Multani Kumhars suggesting that their origin was [[Multan]]”.&lt;ref name="PolicyResearch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/PDF/Outputs/R74134.pdf | title=Mechanisms to Improve Energy Efficiency in Small Industries | publisher=Policy Research International | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day pottery manufacture flourished in the 1940s, and the Uttar Pradesh government set up a pottery factory in 1942. Later, the factory was closed in 1946–47 due to lack of quality. In 1952, the factory was changed as Pottery Development Centre. From 1942 until now, some adoption, transformation, initiative were taken by various actors for the betterment of pottery manufacture that resulted an importance role of Khurja pottery in national level as well as export to foreign countries.&lt;ref name="PolicyResearch" /&gt;

== Production ==
There are about 15,000 people as official employees while about 25,000 unofficial employees who work in 500-odd units and nearly 400 factories. They produce several kinds of items such as crockery wares, art wares, electrical goods, sanitary wares, tiles, household items, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghumakkar.com/khurja-the-ceramics-city/ | title=ROAD TRIP TO KHURJA – THE CERAMICS CITY | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khurja pottery has market in India and foreign countries. There are nearly 23 export oriented units. Reports say that production has received around 2,500 million Indian Rupees worth of item in 1999–2000 including 148.2 million Indian Rupees worth of export.&lt;ref name="PolicyResearch" /&gt;

[[File:Virgin with Chancellor Rolin Luber.jpg|thumb|480px|''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'', [[Oil painting|Oil]] on panel, c. 1435. 66cm x 62cm. [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris]]
The '''''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], dating from around 1435.  It is kept in the [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris, and was commissioned by [[Nicolas Rolin]], aged 60,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 60&lt;/ref&gt; chancellor of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], whose [[votive portrait]] takes up the left side of the picture, for his parish church, ''Notre-Dame-du-Chastel'' in [[Autun]], where it remained until the church burnt down in 1793. After a period in [[Autun Cathedral]], it was moved to the Louvre in 1805.

==Description==
The scene depicts the [[Virgin Mary]] crowned by a hovering [[Angel]] while she presents the Infant [[Jesus]] to Rolin. It is set within a spacious [[loggia]] with a rich decoration of columns and bas-reliefs. In the background is a landscape with a city on a river, probably intended to be [[Autun]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Rolin's hometown. A wide range of well detailed palaces, churches, an island, a towered bridge, hills and fields is portrayed, subject to a uniform light. Perhaps some of the Chancellor's many landholdings around Autun are included in the vista.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 100–118&lt;/ref&gt;  A haze covers a mountain range in the far distance.  As in many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s, the steepness of the hills and mountains is shown as much greater than that found locally, for dramatic effect.

[[File:Jan van Eyck 072.jpg|left|thumb|Detail of the angel.]]
The small garden with many flowers identifiable (including lilies, irises, paeonies and roses), visible just outside the columns, symbolizes Mary's virtues.  Beyond, two male figures wearing [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperons]] are looking through the [[crenellation]]s of what looks to be a fortified balcony or bridge.  There has been speculation that they may represent van Eyck and an assistant, after the pattern of his [[Arnolfini Portrait]].  The figure on the right wears a similar red chaperon to the probable van Eyck self-portrait in the [[National Gallery, London]].  Near to them are two peacocks, symbols both of immortality and of pride, to which even a powerful man as Rolin might succumb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/dossiers/detail_oal.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;CURRENT_LLV_OAL%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;bmUID=1182710990695&amp;bmLocale=en Louvre page, section "The garden"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713015628/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/dossiers/detail_oal.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;CURRENT_LLV_OAL%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674055871&amp;bmUID=1182710990695&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The interior has complex light sources, typical of van Eyck, with light coming both from the central portico and the side windows. The chancellor, whose strong character is well rendered by the artist, is wearing a fur-lined, elegant garment; the Virgin, the same size as Rolin (rather a novelty in comparison to the Gothic painting tradition), is instead covered by a red mantle. The Infant Jesus holds a cross in his left hand. The perfectionist rendering of details and textures, such as the capitals, the checquered pavement, the goldwork of the angel's crown or the garments is characteristic of Jan van Eyck's work, of which this is one of the finest examples.

As in other van Eycks, the depiction of the space is not as straightforward as it first appears.  Comparison of the floor-tiles with other elements shows that the figures are only about six feet from the columned loggia screen, and that Rolin might have to squeeze himself through the opening to get out that way.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  Many van Eycks show an interior space that is actually very small, but the depiction is subtly managed to retain a sense of intimacy, but without feeling constricted.

==Alterations==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 074.jpg|thumb|right|The carvings above Rolin.]]

[[Infrared]] reflectograms have disclosed a number of changes from the [[underdrawing]].  Rolin had a large purse hanging from his belt; since he had grown very rich in public office he probably felt that would be inappropriate.  The infant Christ was originally pointing at the floor.  Old descriptions from Autun tell us that the painting originally had a wooden frame painted illusionistically with inscriptions seemingly carved, like van Eyck's two portraits in London (''[[Léal Souvenir]]'' and ''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'').

==Iconography==
[[File:Madonna of Chancellor Rolin (detail).jpg|thumb|left|520px|Detail showing the church over Rolin's hands, and the cathedral over Christ, the flowers in the garden and the squashed rabbits of Lust.]] 
The Virgin sits with the infant Christ "on her knee" (i.e. on her thighs), which make a platform for the infant.  This very traditional motif is known as the ''[[Seat of Wisdom|Throne of Wisdom]]'', and was often used by Jan van Eyck, who elaborated the meaning in complex allusions.  The Virgin's body was often compared to an altar, on which Christ was present as he was believed to be during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].  This painting may have originally hung to the left of Rolin's place at the front of his chapel in his parish church, between him and the altar.  To Rolin, or a viewer of the real and painted Rolins together, the Virgin is painted in the position of the altar in the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[illuminated manuscript]] in front of Rolin is open to a page with a large initial D, which probably indicates "Domine, labia mea aperies" ("Lord, open my lips"), the opening of [[Matins]]; this is therefore a [[Book of Hours]].  

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden St Luke Some Chick MFA Boston.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Rogier van der Weyden]], as [[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]], makes a drawing for his painting of the Virgin. The setting is clearly derived from the Rolin Madonna. ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'', Boston, c. 1440.]]

The architecture of the loggia, as in so many of van Eyck's paintings, is in a rich and delicate Romanesque style far from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic styles]] of his own day.  The setting probably represents at the same time an imaginary building in Autun, and the "Heavenly city of Jerusalem"; two personages from two worlds are shown, and their surrounding combines the world of each.

The painting might be connected with the appointment in 1436 of [[Jean Rolin (cardinal)|Rolin's son Jean]] as [[Bishop of Autun]]; there is a magnificent [[cathedral]] on the Virgin's side of the river.  Also, just above Rolin's hands there is a smaller church, perhaps intended to represent a new church dedicated to the Virgin, or his own parish church, ''Notre-Dame-du-Chastel'' which he greatly enriched.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

There appears to be a series of illustrations of the [[Seven deadly sins]] distributed among the details of the painting. The [[relief]]s just over Rolin's head show (from left) ''the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise'' ([[Pride]]), the ''Killing of Abel by Cain'' ([[Envy]]) and the ''Drunkenness of Noah'' ([[Gluttony]]).  Then the lion-heads on the capitals behind Rolin may stand for [[Anger]], and the tiny squashed rabbits between column and base in the loggia screen for [[Lust]] (which they were considered to exemplify in the Middle Ages).  All these details are on Rolin's side of the painting; no equivalents are visible on the other, divine, side.  However this leaves [[Avarice]] and [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]] unaccounted for, unless perhaps the human figures of Rolin himself (with his underdrawn purse), and the idlers out on the terrace (perhaps including, as stated above, van Eyck himself) represent the last two vices.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marjory Scott Wardrop''' (11 November 1869 – 7 December 1909) was an [[England|English]] scholar and translator of [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] literature. She was a sister of the [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat and scholar of Georgia, [[Oliver Wardrop|Sir Oliver Wardrop]].

Fluent in seven foreign languages, she also learned [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and traveled to Georgia (then part of [[Imperial Russia]]) in 1894-5 and 1896. She translated and published ''Georgian Folk Tales'' ([[London]], 1894), ''The Hermit'' by [[Ilia Chavchavadze]] (London, 1895), ''The Life of [[St. Nino]]'' ([[Oxford]], 1900), etc. She also made the first [[English language|English]] prosaic translation of ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]'', a medieval Georgian [[epic poem]] by [[Shota Rustaveli]] (published by Oliver Wardrop in London, 1912). After her death, Sir Oliver created the Marjory Wardrop Fund at [[Oxford University]] "for the encouragement of the [[Kartvelian studies|study of the language, literature, and history of Georgia]], in [[Transcaucasia]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1058276236258 Oliver &amp; Marjory Wardrop – Roots of Diplomatic Relationship.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624004426/http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket%2FXcelerate%2FShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1058276236258 |date=2007-06-24 }} ''British Embassy, Tbilisi''.

'''Meyazia 27 Square''' ({{Lang-am|ሜያአዚያ 27 ካሬ}}; commonly called "Arat Kilo") is an important and historic intersection and surrounding neighborhood in Addis Ababa, located where Adwa St, King George VI St, Queen Elizabeth II St, and Development Through Cooperation Ave come together. Its name denotes both the day when Addis Ababa [[March of the Iron Will|fell to Italy]] in 1936 and was [[East African Campaign (World War II)#The liberation of Addis Ababa|liberated]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Heart of Ethiopia|last=Forbes|first=Duncan|publisher=|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is under the aegis of the Addis Ababa Land Development and Urban Renewal Agency.

'''Multidisciplinary professional services networks''' are organizations formed by law, accounting and other professional services firms to offer clients new [[multidisciplinary approach]]es  solving increasingly complex issues.  They are a type of [[Professional services networks|professional services network]] which operates to provide services to their members. They operate in the same way as [[Accounting networks and associations|accounting firm networks and associations]] and [[law firm network]]s. They do not practice a profession such as law or accounting but provide services to members so they can serve clients needs.Aim is to provide members involved in doing business internationally with access to experienced, tried and tested, reliable, and responsive professional advisers who know their local jurisdiction intimately as well as the intricacies of cross border business.

There are 10 multidisciplinary networks. The largest are: [[Alliott Group]], MSI Global Alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msiglobal.org/|title=MSI|author=|date=|work=MSIGlobal.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morison International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morisoninternational.com/|title=Morison KSi - Morison International and KS International have merged to form Morison KSi|author=|date=|work=MorisonInternational.com|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geneva Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ggi.com/|title=Home|author=|date=3 December 2015|work=GGI.com|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Practice Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipg-online.org/NL/Home.aspx/|title=404|author=|date=|work=IPG-online.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WSG - World Services Group]] and Russell Bedford International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russellbedford.com/|title=Russell Bedford global accounting network - CPA firm association - Audit - Tax - Consulting|author=|date=|work=RussellBedford.com|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These networks have more than 100 member firms in as many as 90 countries in hundreds of offices. The members employ thousands of professionals.

== History ==
Multidisciplinary networks are not new but found in a number of professions.  They became important during the end of the 1990s when the accounting firms began to expand to the legal profession. The history is well documented.&lt;ref&gt;Mijares, A H, The SEC’s ban on Legal serves by Audit firms: Amendments to Rule 2.01 of Regulations S-X under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. 36 U.S. F. L. Rev 209–236 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[American Bar Association]] Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice refers to five multidisciplinary models.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Bar Association]] Commission on Multidisciplinary Practices, Final Report, Appendix C, Reporter’s notes, July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; They are the cooperative, [[command and control]], ancillary practice, network and multidisciplinary partnership models.

=== Big Six accounting firms – multidisciplinary practices ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}The [[multidisciplinary]] issues first arose in the 1940s but was dealt with by the [[American Bar Association]] prohibiting lawyers working for accounting firms to represent clients before the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;ABA Information Op. 269 (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of multidisciplinary practice began when the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big 4 accounting firms]]  reached their natural growth limits. Accounting, auditing and tax services could generate only a finite amount of revenue for the Big 6. The Big 4’s concept was simple: use the extensive list of clients to market non-traditional accounting services such as legal, recruitment, [[risk management]], technology consulting, etc. The objective was to bring these non-traditional services “in-house” using the time-tested network model. 

Having reached their natural limit on growth the Big 4 branched out to become multidisciplinary in legal, technology, and employment services. Since the essential infrastructure was in place, it was thought to be relatively simple to incorporate other services into the existing network. The expansion could easily be financed using revenue from the traditional services. As a network, it was natural to create independent entities in these other professions which themselves could be part of the network. The method and structures varied from firm to firm but the fundamental premise was the sharing of revenue between lawyers and accountants.

The accounting firms were initially very successful in creating these alternative businesses. Soon a number of Big 6 firms had multi-billion dollar technology consulting businesses. Other services were more difficult to bring in-house. Some, like legal services, demanded a different approach because of ethical considerations. The key factor among such different approaches is an internal control system within a firm.

=== Reaction of the legal profession===
The initial to expand to legal services focus was on the United States which represented the largest potential market for these services. In Europe and South America the bar rules were not as developed as in the United States, and therefore did not restrict the sharing of revenues. The basis for this expansion was the law firm network that  established under the umbrella of the Big Six.&lt;ref&gt;These networks had names like the E&amp;Y Legal Network, Andersen Legal Network and Landwell. Only Landwell remains with 6 member firms. [http://www.landwellglobal.com/gx/eng/aboutus/countries/au_gx_eng_count_index.html Countries in the Landwell network]&lt;/ref&gt;  The issues were sharing profits with accountants and other professionals and the possible conflicts of interest.

When the Big 6 began its expansion to the legal profession, it was met with fierce opposition from law firms and bar associations.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, “Accounting Firms Covert Forbidden Fruit: Piece of the U.S. Legal Market, Wall Street Journal,” p.B1 (May 31, 2000), Poe, “Multidisciplinary Practice,” Defense Counsel J. 245 (Apr. 2000), Cannon, “The Big Six Moves In” 50 Int’l Fin. L. Rev. 49 (October 1997), “Andersen’s Giant Step Towards World Law” Australian Fin. Rev. 33 (Jan. 1998), Rubenstein, (Accounting Firm Legal Practices Expand Rapidly. How the Big Six Firms Are Practicing Law in Europe: Europe First and then the World?” Corp. Legal Times 1 (Nov 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers saw that the accounting profession would subsume the legal profession with its vast resources.&lt;ref&gt;In 2011, the UK [[House of Lords]] completed an inquiry into the financial crisis, and called for an [[Office of Fair Trading]] investigation into the dominance of the Big Four. Adam Jones, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/358b366e-59fa-11e0-ba8d-00144feab49a.html Auditors criticized for role in financial crisis], ''Financial Times'', 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Commissions, panels and committees were established by legal and accounting firms to argue their positions. The American Bar Association established committees and taskforces to address the issue, but the problem spread outside of the United States, first to Europe but then to other countries where lawyers were not protected from this new foreign competition.&lt;ref&gt;McGarry, S. Multidisciplinary Practices and Partnerships, American Lawyer Media Publishing, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Government agencies were enlisted. For more than five (5) years the debate escalated.  

This movement ended abruptly with the fall of [[Arthur Andersen]] as a result of its association with [[Enron]]. [[Sarbanes Oxley]] followed, which effectively ended this trend of multisdisciplinary networks established by the Big 5.

=== Enron and Sarbanes–Oxley ===
There was, however, a fatal flaw in the multidisciplinary network concepts of the Big 6.  The raison d’etre of the Big 6 was to audit public companies. Each service which is provided to an audited client contained an inherent conflict of interest. This conflict was illustrated by the perfect storm created by [[Enron]]. The additional services that Arthur Anderson was offering created a conflict in their role as the auditor. Multidisciplinary networks by the accounting firms were DOA. The final nail in the coffin was [[Sarbanes Oxley]] which meant that the accounting firms had to divest their consulting practices.&lt;ref&gt;Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multidisciplinary networks today ==
The multidisciplinary network model was not dead but transformed to account for the issues. If the member firms were themselves independent, there was no prohibition on having a multidisciplinary network. This was recognized by the ABA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/commission_multidisciplinary_practice.html/|title=Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice  - The Center for Professional Responsibility|author=|date=|work=AmericanBar.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are at least eleven networks. The largest are in the legal and accounting professions.  A few of the legal and accounting networks include [[investment banking]]. The primary networks are focused on tax, employment, intellectual property, insurance and immigration.

[[File:The Painter and His Pug by William Hogarth.jpg|right|250px]]
'''''Painter and his Pug''''' is a 1745 [[self-portrait]] created by [[William Hogarth]]. He began the portrait a decade earlier. The portrait was originally created with the intention of Hogarth wearing formal attire, but was changed to the informal attire sometime during the painting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hogarth-the-painter-and-his-pug-n00112|title=The Painter and his Pug, William Hogarth|publisher=[[Tate Britain]]|date=August 2004|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also added his [[Pug]], [[Trump (dog)|Trump]].

In the portrait, Hogarth himself is in a painting as the [[pug]] is alongside him, making the dog "real" as opposed to the created person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seven Painters Who Changed the Course of Art History|first=Brian Thom McQuade|last=Ma|year=2012|page=120|isbn=9781477227411}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog is indifferent to the painting, to the books and to the painting palette (which shows Hogarth's [[Line of Beauty]]). So the painting seems to be a [[Vanitas]] still life. But, as an ironic disruption, the cloth behind the dog comes out of the painting.

The painting is part of the collections of the Tate Gallery.

In relation to [[psychology]], '''pair by association''' is the action of associating a stimulus with an arbitrary idea or object, eliciting a response, usually emotional. This is done by repeatedly pairing the stimulus with the arbitrary object.

For example, repeatedly pairing images of beautiful women in bathing suits elicits a sexual response in most men. Advertising agencies repeatedly pair products with attractive women in television commercials with the intention of eliciting an emotional or [[sexually aroused]] response in the consumer. This causes the consumer to be more likely to buy the product than when presented with a similar product without such an association.

==Hippocampus==
The [[Hippocampus|hippocampal area]], beyond its importance in [[episodic memory]] is in part responsible in the creation and storage of [[Association (psychology)|associations]] in the memory, especially for item associations.&lt;ref name="Madan et al" /&gt; Furthermore, as stated by Gilbert &amp; Kesner,&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Kesner" /&gt; the associations that are created are those that might be ''“critical”'' in paired-associative learning. Through studies on rats, it has been found that lesions to the hippocampus lead to object-place associative learning impairments.&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Kesner" /&gt; The findings of hippocampal damage that lead to [[Impaired|impairments]] in the association between object-place as Gilbert &amp; Kesner state have been seen in not only rodents but also non-human primates and humans {{harv|2004}}. It should be noted that previously learned associations made before the damage to the hippocampal area were not affected with impairment. Gilbert &amp; Kesner have suggested in their work that this ability to still recall previously stored associations may be due to modified synapses in an ''“auto associative network”''.&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Kesner" /&gt;

==Pair by Association Task==
Paired association learning can be defined as a system of learning in which items (such as words, letters, numbers, symbols etc.) are matched so that presentation of one member of the pair will [[Recall (memory)#Cued recall|cue the recall]] of the other member.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merriam-Webster's|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this [[learning]] which constitutes the basics in a paired-associate task. These tasks can be divided into the following: visual-visual, verbal-verbal, and visual-verbal. In visual-visual both members of the pair are in a visual form (e.g. the picture of a blue circle paired with that of a picture of a yellow triangle). The verbal-verbal is when the members of the pair are both verbally presented (e.g. listening to the word cat followed by the word hat spoken to a participant). The last form, visual-verbal is when one member of the pair is spoken out loud while the other member is presented in a visual form (e.g. listening to the word box and seeing a picture of a house). It should be noted that visual [[Learning#Associative learning|associative learning]] has a positive association with age. In school age children, their visual association ability grows in conjunction with their age; younger children made more errors while older children made less.&lt;ref name="Harel et al" /&gt;
 
The paired association task broken down to its basics is: a stimuli, response, and the consequence of the cue association. This is best seen in a study where Naya, Sakai, &amp; Miyashita&lt;ref name="Naya et al" /&gt; performed one version of the task on monkeys. In the study a primate was given a visual-visual paired-associate task where they were shown all the pairs in the set. Then after a long delay they displayed one picture of a pair to the primate. When the correct picture was paired by the monkey, showing that the pictures were cueing the response, they were given rewards in the form of food.&lt;ref name="Naya et al" /&gt; What this study shows is that it is possible for associations to occur for two previously unrelated items. The monkeys showed they had actually remembered what was shown to them. In visual associative learning, the efficiency of the participant/subject in making these connections actually will decrease as the “memory load” increases.&lt;ref name="Harel et al" /&gt; The more items/the higher the complexity that one has to keep in their memory leads to poorer performance on paired associative learning tasks.
 
Gluck, Mercado, and Myers&lt;ref name="Gluck et al" /&gt; explain how paired-association is possibly tied to [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]] rather than [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]]. In the study presented by Gluck et al.,&lt;ref name="Gluck et al" /&gt; there was a paired associates test where after studying word pairs the participants were presented with one word from the pair and required to recall the match there was a noticeable difference in accuracy between the young adult and older adults. At the start of the study each pair was shown for 15 seconds, in this the older adults had much worse performance; their recall abilities paled in comparison to the younger adults. This however did change when the time was doubled to that of 30 seconds; here the elderly were able to have a much improved performance level. It is an accepted understanding that in associative learning there is a negative regression, as one ages their performance levels decrease.&lt;ref name="Lee et al" /&gt; The regression remains even after addressing the possible interfering variables such as attention or spatial memory.

===Performance on Task=== 
When the paired association task is performed, there are ways in which the performance in the task can be either negatively or positively affected. Associations suffer when an item is shared between associations; double function pairs such as AB and BC will be harder to recall later than control pairs such as AB and CD.&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; As Caplan et al.,&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; state double function pairs create what is called association ambiguity, a sharing of a common member in the pair, which leads to interference. The brain has difficulty in processing the pairs to the point that in some cases one pair will be remembered at the expense of the other pair. An example is in the two word pairs CAR-HORN and CAR-DOG. In this word pair a participant would remember 1 pair primarily while forgetting the other pair. Memory for ambiguous pairs will often suffer compared to unambiguous pairs in both situations of e.g. AB and BC or AB and AC.&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; One matter that is not affected is a cue recall in either direction, forward (cue A, recall B) or backward (cue B, recall A); either direction will not affect the accuracy of the recall.&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; This also holds true for double function pairs.
 
Additionally, there is ongoing research into the effects [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]]/polystimulant use has on paired-associate task/learning. In a study by Gallagher et al.,&lt;ref name="Gallagher et al" /&gt; it was found that those who used ecstasy/polydrugs had in general more false positive responses, clicking yes (in agreement) when asked if a word pair had been previously presented even if the reality was false, compared to non-users. It was proposed that because creating the association between word pairs requires executive resources, which has been known to be hampered in ecstasy users. This is what has prevented the binding of word pairs.&lt;ref name="Gallagher et al" /&gt; However, as stated by the author, it is not possible to fully attribute these deficits in the task, but it bears noting that there are differences occurring.
 
An association can be improved with the aid of the production effect which is a finding where speaking a word out loud leads to enhancements in memory compared to reading a word silently.&lt;ref name="Putnam et al" /&gt; The production effect is not limited to speaking a word aloud; mouthing, writing, whispering, spelling, and typing all lead to an enhanced memory though the level will not be the same as reading aloud. In accordance with Putnam et al.,&lt;ref name="Putnam et al" /&gt; the enhancement in recall in the production effect is because reading aloud creates a more distinctive memory in the encoding process. Moreover, the production effect improved not only pair recognition but also paired-associate recall. These findings hint at a positive link between the production effect and the association between pairs in relation to paired-associate task/learning; using one of the elements in the production effect leads to improved encoding of associations.&lt;ref name="Putnam et al" /&gt;

==Verbal behavior==
[[Behaviorists]] will often use paired association tests to determine the strength of [[verbal behavior]], in particular, [[B.F Skinner]]'s concept of the verbal response class called intraverbals.&lt;ref name="Moran Verplanck" /&gt;

'''Parataxis''' (from Greek παράταξις "act of placing side by side", from παρα ''para'' "beside" + τάξις ''táxis'' "arrangement") is a [[literary technique]], in writing or speaking, that favors short, simple [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, with the use of [[Conjunction_(grammar)#Coordinating_conjunctions|coordinating]] rather than [[Conjunction_(grammar)#Subordinating_conjunctions|subordinating conjunction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Fish]], ''How to Write a Sentence'' p. 62 {{ISBN|978-0-06-184054-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Christoper. ''Structure and Function: A Guide to Three Major Structural-Functional Theories'', Part 2, Volume 64 of ''Studies in Language''. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2003, pp. 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt; It contrasts with [[syntaxis]] and [[hypotaxis]].

It is also used to describe a technique in poetry in which two images or fragments, usually starkly dissimilar images or fragments, are juxtaposed without a clear connection.  Readers are then left to make their own connections implied by the paratactic syntax. [[Ezra Pound]], in his adaptation of Chinese and Japanese poetry, made the stark juxtaposition of images an important part of English-language poetry.

==Origin of the term==
[[Edward Parmelee Morris]] wrote in 1901 that the term was introduced into linguistics by [[Friedrich Thiersch]] in his ''Greek Grammar'' (1831). The concept has expanded since then, and a number of definitions have emerged, often conflicting.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;Morris, Edward Parmelee. "Parataxis," chapter VI, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wo8NAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=parataxis "On Principles and Methods in Latin Syntax"], C. Scribner's Sons, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
Parataxis may be considered from three points of view:

*the psychological aspect,
*the linguistic means to express the paratactic relation,
*and the resulting sentence structure.

The underlying idea is that in a connected discourse, complete independence among the consecutive sentences is very rare. This observation is captured in the expression "[[train of thought]]".&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; Consider the following:

*The sun was shining brightly. We went for a walk.
*The sun was shining brightly; we went for a walk.
*The sun was shining brightly, and we went for a walk.
*The sun was shining brightly, so we went for a walk.

In the first example, the two sentences are independent expressions, while in the last example they are dependent. However, the connection of thought in the first examples is just as real as in the last ones, where it is explicitly expressed via the syntax of [[subordination (linguistics)|subordination]].

In [[spoken language]], this continuance from sentence to sentence is supported by [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and timing ([[rhythm]], [[pausa|pause]]). While details may differ among different languages and cultures, generally similar musicality and shortness of pauses indicate the continuation, while the change of tone and longer pause generally indicate the transition to
another connected group of ideas.

==Examples==
===Literature===
Perhaps the best known use of parataxis is Julius Caesar's famous [[laconic phrase]], "[[Veni, vidi, vici]]" or, "I came, I saw, I conquered". Another example is Mr. Jingle's speech in Chapter 2 of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Come along, then," said he of the green coat, lugging Mr. Pickwick after him by main force, and talking the whole way. "Here, No. 924, take your fare, and take yourself off&amp;mdash;respectable
gentleman&amp;mdash;know him well&amp;mdash;none of your nonsense&amp;mdash;this way, sir&amp;mdash;where's your friends?&amp;mdash;all a mistake, I see&amp;mdash;never mind&amp;mdash;accidents will happen&amp;mdash;best regulated families&amp;mdash;never say die&amp;mdash;down upon your luck&amp;mdash;Pull him UP&amp;mdash;Put that in his pipe&amp;mdash;like the flavour&amp;mdash;damned rascals." And with a lengthened string of similar broken sentences, delivered with extraordinary volubility, the stranger led the way to the traveller's waiting-room, whither he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and his disciples.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps a more extreme proponent of the form was [[Samuel Beckett]]. The opening to his monologue "Not I" is a classic example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Mouth:''' {{sic|hide=y|....}} out ... into this world ... this world ... tiny little thing ... before its time ... in a godfor– ... what? {{sic|hide=y|..}} girl? {{sic|hide=y|..}} yes ... tiny little girl ... into this ... out into this ... before her time ... godforsaken hole called ... called ... no matter ... parents unknown ... unheard of ... he having vanished ... thin air ... no sooner buttoned up his breeches ... she similarly ... eight months later ... almost to the tick ... so no love ... spared that ... no love such as normally vented on the ... speechless infant ... in the home ... no ... nor indeed for that matter any of any kind ... no love of any kind ... at any subsequent stage ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the use of ellipses here arguably prevents it from being seen as a classic example of parataxis, as a spoken text it operates in precisely that way. Other examples by Beckett would include large chunks of Lucky's famous speech in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''.

===Poetry===

Parataxis is occasionally found in spontaneous utterances. An example might be the last words of a serial killer named [[Aileen Wuornos]] who killed seven men in Florida between 1989 and 1990. She was executed on October 9, 2002 and her last words were: "Yes, I would just like to say I’m sailing with the rock, and I’ll be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus. June 6, like the movie. Big mother ship and all, I’ll be back, I’ll be back."&lt;ref&gt; The Clark County Prosecuting Attorney. Archived from the original on September 27, 2008. Retrieved September 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek===

In [[What Is Called Thinking?]], [[Martin Heidegger]] addresses the paratactic nature of Classical Greek texts. Through analyzing a fragment from [[Parmenides]] (typically translated "One should both say and think that Being is") Heidegger argues that modern syntactic translations of paratactic Greek texts often leave the meaning obscured. He suggests multiple translations of the fragment that may more closely resemble the paratactic Greek original. These include "needful : the saying also thinking too : being : to be," and "Useful is the letting lie before us, the taking-to-heart, too: beings in Being." Heidegger points to a modern linguistic bias that places paratactic language beneath syntactic language; paratactic language is often viewed as "child-like" or "primitive." He argues that a paratactic sentence a child might say, such as "dog, woof-woof, bad" is not inherently less meaningful than its syntactic equivalent, like "dogs bark and can be dangerous."

===Cultural theory===

The term ''parataxis'' has also been appropriated by some [[Cultural theory|cultural theorists]] to describe certain works of art or "cultural texts" in which a series of scenes or elements are presented side by side in no particular order or hierarchy. Examples might range from the [[collage]]s of the [[dada]]ists and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] to many contemporary [[music video]]s.  The traditional [[polyptych]] constitutes another example.

[[File:SMASH THE PROSTITUTION RACKET - NARA - 515431.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Federal government World War II era poster against prostitution]]
[[Prostitution]] is illegal in the vast majority of the [[United States]] as a result of state laws rather than federal laws. It is, however, legal in some rural counties within the state of [[Prostitution in Nevada|Nevada]]. Prostitution nevertheless occurs throughout the country.

The regulation of prostitution in the country is not among the [[enumerated powers]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. It is therefore exclusively the domain of the [[U.S. state|states]] to permit, prohibit, or otherwise regulate [[commercial sex]] under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], except insofar as Congress may regulate it as part of [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]] with laws like the [[Mann Act]]. In most states, prostitution is considered a [[misdemeanor]] in the category of [[public order crime]]–crime that disrupts the order of a community.  Prostitution was at one time considered a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] crime.

Currently, Nevada is the only U.S. jurisdiction to allow legal prostitution – in the form of regulated [[list of brothels in Nevada|brothel]]s – the terms of which are stipulated in the ''Nevada Revised Statutes''. Only eight counties currently contain active brothels. All forms of prostitution are illegal in [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] (which contains the [[Las Vegas–Paradise, NV MSA|Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area]]), [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]] (which contains [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]), [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Douglas County, Nevada|Douglas County]], and [[Lincoln County, Nevada|Lincoln County]]. The other counties theoretically allow brothel prostitution, but some of these counties currently have no active brothels. [[Street prostitution]], "pandering", and [[Pimping|living off of the proceeds of a prostitute]] remain illegal under Nevada law, as is the case elsewhere in the country.

According to the [[National Institute of Justice]], a study conducted in 2008 found that approximately 15-20 percent of men in the country{{where|date=November 2018}}&lt;!---which states? what distribution? what is the size of the data sample?---&gt; have engaged in commercial sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Percentage of Men (by Country) Who Paid for Sex at Least Once: The Johns Chart|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004119|date=June 1, 2011|website=ProCon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other countries, prostitution in the U.S. can be divided into three broad categories: street prostitution, brothel prostitution, and escort prostitution.

===18th century===
Some of the [[women in the American Revolution]] who followed the Continental Army served the soldiers and officers as sexual partners. Prostitutes were a worrisome presence to army leadership, particularly because of the possible spread of venereal diseases. 

===19th century===
In the 19th century, [[parlor]] house [[brothel]]s catered to upper class clientele, while [[bawdy]] houses catered to the lower class. At [[concert saloon]]s, men could eat, listen to music, watch a fight, or pay women for sex. Over 200 brothels existed in lower [[Manhattan]]. Prostitution was illegal under the vagrancy laws, but was not well-enforced by police and city officials, who were bribed by brothel owners and madams. Attempts to regulate prostitution were struck down on the grounds that regulation would be counter to the public good. Seventy-five percent of New York men had some type of [[sexually transmitted disease]].&lt;ref&gt;XY factor, Prostitution: Sex in the City ([[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gold rush]] profits of the 1840s to 1900 attracted gambling, crime, saloons, and prostitution to the mining towns of the [[American frontier|wild west]]. A brothel-keeper, [[Julia Bulette]], who was active in the mining town of [[Virginia City]], [[Nevada]], was murdered in 1867. Thirty years before, in 1836, the New York City courtesan [[Helen Jewett]] was murdered, by one of her customers gaining prostitution considerable attention. The [[Lorette Ordinance]] of 1857 prohibited prostitution on the first floor of buildings in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000117|title=Prostitution: Historical Timeline|publisher=ProCon.org|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, prostitution continued to grow rapidly in the U.S., becoming a $6.3 million business in 1858, more than the [[shipping]] and [[brewing industry|brewing industries]] combined.

Some army officers, however, encouraged the presence of prostitutes during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to keep troop morale high. In August 20, 1863, the U.S. military commander Brig. General [[Robert S. Granger]] legalized prostitution in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in order to curb venereal disease among [[Union Army|Union soldiers]]. The move was successful and venereal disease rates fell from forty percent to just four percent due to a stringent  program of health checks which required all prostitutes to register and be examined by a board certified physician every two weeks for which they were charged five dollars registration fee plus 50 cents each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-curious-case-of-nashvilles-frail-sisterhood-7766757/|title=The Curious Case of Nashville's Frail Sisterhood|last1=Serratore|first1=Angela|date=July 8, 2013|website=Smithsonian|language=en|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Child brothel worker - C Street NW Washington DC - April 1912.jpg|thumb|This area of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. was known from the mid-1800s to the 1920s as "Murder Bay," home to numerous brothels. The youth on the left was a "procurer".]]By the U.S. Civil War, [[Washington, D.C.|Washington's]] [[Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site|Pennsylvania Avenue]] had become a disreputable slum known as Murder Bay, home to an extensive criminal underclass and numerous brothels. So many prostitutes took up residence there to serve the needs of [[General officer|General]] [[Joseph Hooker]]'s [[Army of the Potomac]] that the area became known as "Hooker's Division." (It is from this period that the slang term "hooker" originates.) Two blocks between Pennsylvania and Missouri Avenues became home to such expensive [[brothel]]s that it was known as "Marble Alley."&lt;ref name="Lowry"&gt;Lowry, ''The Story the Soldiers Wouldn't Tell: Sex in the Civil War,'' 1994, p. 61-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, [[Anthony Comstock]] created the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], an institution dedicated to supervising the morality of the public. Comstock successfully influenced the [[United States Congress]] to pass the [[Comstock Law]], which made illegal the delivery or transport of "obscene, lewd, or lascivious" material and [[birth control]] information. In 1875, Congress passed the [[Page Act of 1875]] that made it illegal to transport women into the nation to be used as prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;George Anthony Peffer, "Forbidden Families: Emigration Experiences of Chinese Women Under the Page Law, 1875-1882," Journal of American Ethnic History 6.1 (Fall 1986): 28-46. p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, the [[Bird Cage Theatre]] opened in [[Tombstone, Arizona]]. It included a brothel in the basement and 14 cribs suspended from the ceiling, called cages. Local men such as [[Doc Holliday]], [[Bat Masterson]], [[Diamond Jim Brady]], and [[George Hearst]] frequented the establishment.

In the late 19th century, newspapers reported that 65,000 [[White Slavery (prostitution)|white slaves]] existed. Around 1890, the term "[[red-light district]]" was first recorded in the United States. From 1890 to 1982, the [[Dumas Brothel]] in Montana was America's longest-running house of prostitution.
[[File:BasinStreetUptheLine.JPG|thumb|[[Basin Street]] brothels in New Orleans, ca. 1908.]]
[[New Orleans]] city alderman Sidney Story wrote an ordinance in 1897 to regulate and limit prostitution to one small area of the city, "The District", where all prostitutes in New Orleans must live and work. The District, which was nicknamed [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]], became the best known area for prostitution in the nation. Storyville at its peak had some 1,500 prostitutes and 200 brothels.

In 1908, the [[Bureau of Investigation]] (BOI, from 1935, the [[FBI]])) was founded by the government to investigate "white slavery" by interviewing brothel employees to discover if they had been kidnapped. Out of 1,106 prostitutes interviewed in one city, six said they were victims of white slavery. The [[White-Slave Traffic Act]] (Mann Act) of 1910 prohibited so-called white slavery. It also banned the interstate transportation of women for "immoral purposes". Its primary stated intent was to address prostitution and perceived immorality. The [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] later included consensual debauchery, adultery, and polygamy under "immoral purposes". Prior to [[World War I]], there were few laws criminalizing prostitutes or the act of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/when-prostitution-wasnt-crime-fascinating-history-sex-work-america|title=When Prostitution Wasn't a Crime: The Fascinating History of Sex Work in America|author=Melissa Gira Grant|date=February 18, 2013

{{Anchor|American Plan|}}
During World War I, the U.S. government developed a public health program called the ''American Plan'' which authorized the military to arrest any woman within five miles of a military cantonment. If found infected, a woman could be sentenced to a hospital or a "farm colony" until cured. By the end of the war 15,520 prostitutes had been imprisoned, the majority never being medically hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth Rosen|author-link=Ruth Rosen|title=The Lost Sisterhood: Prostitution in America, 1900-1918|publisher=JHU Press|year=1983|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpTU7RwfaooC&amp;pg=PA35|isbn=9780801826658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, the [[Chamberlain-Kahn Act]] which implemented the American Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia|editor=Anne Cipriano Venzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nhEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|page=36|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135684464}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the government the power to quarantine any woman suspected of having venereal disease (in modern terms, [[Sexually transmitted infection]] or STI). A medical examination was required, and if it revealed to be VD, this discovery could constitute proof of prostitution. The purpose of this law was to prevent the spread of venereal diseases among U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cather Studies|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rZ0nDwAAQBAJ|editor1=Ann Moseley|editor2=John J.

On January 25, 1917, an anti-prostitution drive in [[San Francisco]] attracted huge crowds to public meetings. At one meeting attended by 7,000 people, 20,000 were kept out for lack of room. In a conference with Reverend Paul Smith, an outspoken foe of prostitution, 300 prostitutes made a plea for toleration, explaining they had been forced into the practice by poverty. When Smith asked if they would take other work at $8 to $10 a week, the ladies laughed derisively, which lost them public sympathy. The police closed about 200 houses of prostitution shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hbtbc12.htm San Francisco History - The Barbary Coast, Chapter 12.

The National Venereal Disease Control Act, which became effective July 1, 1938, authorized the appropriation of federal funds to assist the states in combating venereal diseases. Appropriations under this act were doubled after the United States entered the war. The May Act,3 which became effective with its signature by the President, July 11, 1941, armed the federal government with authority to suppress commercialized vice in the neighborhood of military camps and naval establishments in the United States.

The May Act, which became law in June 1941, intended to prevent prostitution on restricted zones around military bases. It was invoked chiefly during wartime. See [[World War II U.S. Military Sex Education]].

''[[Mortensen vs. United States]]'', in 1944, ruled that prostitutes could travel across state lines, if the purpose of travel was not for prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortensen v.

Conditions for sex trade workers changed considerably in the 1960s. The [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] was first approved in 1960 for contraceptive use in the United States. "The Pill" helped prostitutes prevent pregnancy.

In 1967, New York City eliminated license requirements for [[massage parlor]]s. Many massage parlors became brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=4 Groups Are Key Landlords For Midtown Sex Industry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/10/archives/4-groups-are-key-landlords-for-midtown-sex-industry-rent-double-the.html|journal=The New York Times|accessdate=April 17, 2018|date=July 10, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Nevada began regulation of houses of prostitution. In 1971, the [[Mustang Ranch]] became Nevada's first licensed brothel, eventually leading to the legalization of brothel prostitution in 10 of 17 counties within the state. In time, Mustang Ranch became Nevada's largest brothel, with more revenue than all other legal Nevada brothels combined. By [[World War II]], prostitutes had increasingly gone underground as [[call girl]]s.
 
In 1971, the New York madame [[Xaviera Hollander]] wrote ''The Happy Hooker: My Own Story'', a book that was notable for its frankness at the time, and considered a landmark of positive writing about sex. An early forerunner (1920s-1930s) of Xaviera Hollander's, both as a madam and author, was [[Polly Adler]], whose bestselling book, ''A House Is Not a Home'', was eventually adapted as a film also entitled ''[[A House Is Not a Home (film)|A House is Not a Home]]''. [[Carol Leigh]], a prostitute's rights activist known as the "Scarlot Harlot," coined the term "Sex worker" in 1978. That same year, the Broadway musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' opened. It was based on the real-life [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Texas Chicken Ranch]] brothel. The play was the basis for the [[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|1982 film]] starring [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Burt Reynolds]].

[[COYOTE]], formed in 1973, was the first prostitutes' rights group in the country. Other prostitutes' rights groups later formed, such as FLOP, HIRE, and PUMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bingham|first1=Nicole|title=NEVADA SEX TRADE: A GAMBLE FOR THE WORKERS|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1137&amp;context=yjlf|publisher=Yale Journal of Law &amp; Feminism|accessdate=April 17, 2018|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heidifleiss.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Heidi Fleiss]] became one of America's best known madams in the late 1990s.]]
In 1997, "Hollywood Madam" [[Heidi Fleiss]] was convicted in connection with her prostitution ring with charges including pandering and tax evasion. Her ring had numerous wealthy clients. Her original three-year sentence prompted widespread outrage at her harsh punishment, while her customers had not been punished. Earlier, in the 1980s, a member of Philadelphia's [[social elite]], [[Sydney Biddle Barrows]] was revealed as a madam in New York City. She became known as the Mayflower Madam.

In 1990, U.S. Representative [[Barney Frank]] (D-MA) admitted to paying for sex in 1989.

==Types of prostitution==

===Red light districts===
Although informal, [[red light districts]] can be found in some areas of the country, such as [[The Block, Baltimore|The Block]] in [[Baltimore]]. Since prostitution is illegal, there are no formal brothels, but massage parlors offering prostitution may be found along with street prostitution.  Typically, these areas will also have other adult-oriented businesses, often due to zoning, such as [[strip clubs]], [[sex shops]], [[adult movie theater]]s, [[adult video arcade]]s, [[peep shows]], [[sex shows]], and [[sex clubs]].

===Street prostitution===
[[Street prostitution]] is illegal throughout the United States. Street prostitution tends to be clustered in certain areas known for solicitation. For instance, statistics on official arrests from the Chicago Police Department from August 19, 2005 to May 1, 2007, suggest that prostitution activity is highly concentrated: nearly half of all prostitution arrests occur in a tiny one-third of one percent of all blocks in the entire city of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chicago Booth |url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/apr09/4.aspx |title=Capital Ideas: Selected Papers on Chicago Price Theory - April 2009 - Trading Tricks |publisher=Chicagobooth.edu |accessdate=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of violence against women engaged in street prostitution found that 68% reported having been raped and 82% reported having been physically assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farley|first1=Melissa|last2=Kelly|first2=Vanessa|title=Prostitution|journal=Women &amp; Criminal Justice|volume=11|issue=4|year=2008|pages=29–64|issn=0897-4454|doi=10.1300/J012v11n04_04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of street prostitution is that which occurs at [[truck stops]] along Interstate highways in rural areas.  Called "lot lizards", these prostitutes solicit at truck stop parking lots and may use CB radios to communicate.

In todays society there is a hierarchy amongst prostitutes and an even greater distinction between indoor workers and outdoor workers. The indoor prostitutes occupy the top tier to include independent call girls, and workers in brothels and massage parlors. The outdoor street walkers occupy the lowest level and are more likely to experience abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzer, R. (2005). New directions in research on prostitution. Crime, Law and Social Change,43(4-5), 211-235.doi:http://dx.doi.org.csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/10.1007/s10611-005-1735-6&lt;/ref&gt;
Two hundred and forty prostitutes, one hundred and fifteen outdoor and one hundred twenty-five indoor, were interviewed for a study about victimization. Weitzer, R (2005) noted that indoor workers (iw) experienced less harm compared to outdoor workers (ow): 
•	Robbed- (ow) 37% - (iw) 10%
•	Beaten- (ow) 27% - (iw) 1%
•	Slapped, punched, kicked- (ow) 47% - 14%
•	Raped- (ow) 22% - (iw) 2%
•	Kidnapped- (ow) 20% - (iw) 2%
The outdoor prostitutes or streetwalkers are the most recognized sex worker’s, but they make up a very small number of workers. Cunningham &amp; Kendall (2011) report that only 20% of prostitutes work on the streets. The indoor workers have more freedom to choose their clients and set boundaries that contribute to their safety. The above numbers contribute to the arguments against prostitution, which clearly affect one type of sex worker. &lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, &amp; Kendall. (2011). Prostitution 2.0: The changing face of sex work. Journal of Urban Economics, 69(3), 273-287. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2010.12.001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escort or out-call prostitution===
In spite of its illegality, escort prostitution exists throughout the United States from both independent prostitutes and those employed through [[escort agency|escort agencies]]. Both freelancers and agencies may advertise under the term "[[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]]" in the back of [[alternative newspaper]]s, although some of these bodywork professionals are straightforward massage professionals.

The amount of money made by an escort differs depending on race, appearance, age, experience (e.g., pornography and magazine work), gender, services rendered, and location. Generally, [[male prostitute|male escorts]] command less on an hourly basis than women; white women quote higher rates than non-white women; and youth is at a premium. In the gay community, one escort agency in [[Washington, D.C.]], charges $150 an hour for male escorts and $250 an hour for transgender escorts. That agency takes $50 an hour from the escort. In larger metropolitan areas such as [[New York City]], extremely attractive [[Caucasian race|white American]] female escorts can charge $1,000–$2,000 per hour, with the agency taking 40%-50%.&lt;ref name="14 October 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Celizic|first1=Mike|title=Former call girl opens up about the industry|url=https://www.today.com/news/former-call-girl-opens-about-industry-2D80555180|website=TODAY.com|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, an agency will charge its escorts either a flat fee for each client connection or a percentage of the prearranged rate. In San Francisco, it is usual for typical heterosexual-market agencies to negotiate for as little as $100 up to a full 50% of a woman's reported earnings (not counting any gratuity received). Most transactions occur in cash, and optional tipping of escorts by clients in most major U.S. cities is customary but not compulsory. [[Credit card]] processing offered by larger scale agencies is often available for a service charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philadelphia female escorts service in New Jersey|url=https://www.executivechoiceescorts.com/expense.html|website=Escorts Philadelphia|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Escorts and escort agencies have historically advertised through [[classified ads]], [[yellow pages]] advertising, or [[word-of-mouth]], but in more recent years, much of the advertising and soliciting of indoor prostitution has shifted to [[internet]] sites. Sites may represent individual escorts, agencies, or may run ads for many escorts. There are also a number of sites in which customers can discuss and post reviews of the sexual services offered by prostitutes and other [[sex workers]]. Many sites allow potential buyers to search for sex workers by physical characteristics and types of services offered.

Internet advertising of sexual services is offered not only by specialty sites, but in many cases by more mainstream advertising sites. [[Craigslist]] for many years [[Craigslist#Adult services controversies and closure|featured an "adult services" section]] of this kind. After several years of pressure from [[law enforcement]] and anti-prostitution groups, Craigslist closed this section in September 2010, first for its U.S. pages, then some months later internationally. In January 2017, the "Adult" section of [[Backpage]] was closed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-backpage-shutdown-20170109-story.html|title=Backpage shuts down adult section, citing government pressure and unlawful censorship campaign|last=Hamilton|first=Matt|website=latimes.com|access-date=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brothel prostitution===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}
With the exception of some rural counties of [[Nevada]], brothels are illegal in the United States. However, many [[massage parlor]]s, saunas, spas, and similar otherwise-legal establishments serve as fronts for prostitution, especially in larger cities.  Often, parlors are staffed by Asian immigrants and advertise in alternative newspapers and on sites like Craigslist and Backpage.  They tend to have much longer working hours than parlors which are not actually brothels.  They tend to be located in cities or along major highways.

===Child prostitution===
The [[prostitution of children]] in the United States is a serious concern&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|title=Human Trafficking: Modern Day Slavery|date=April 17, 2013|publisher=[[Connecticut Public Radio]]|author=John Dankosky|url=http://www.yourpublicmedia.org/content/wnpr/human-trafficking-modern-day-slavery|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[ABC News]]|title=Domestic Sex Trafficking in the U.S.|author=Eric M.

[[Nevada]] is the only [[Political divisions of the United States|U.S. jurisdiction]] to [[Prostitution in Nevada|allow some legal prostitution]]. Currently eight counties in Nevada have active brothels (these are all rural counties); as of February 2018, there are 21 brothels in Nevada.&lt;ref name="Nevada Brothel List"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nevadabrothellist.wixsite.com/list|title=Nevada Brothel List|access-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution outside the licensed brothels is illegal throughout Nevada. Prostitution is illegal in the major metropolitan areas of Las Vegas, Reno, and Carson City, where most of the population lives; more than 90% of Nevada citizens live in a county where prostitution is illegal.

Prostitution in [[Rhode Island]] [[Prostitution in Rhode Island|was outlawed in 2009]]. On November 3, governor [[Donald Carcieri]] signed into law a bill which makes the buying and selling of sexual services a crime.&lt;ref name="Arditi, Lynn"/&gt;
Prostitution was legal in Rhode Island between 1980 and 2009 because there was no specific statute to define the act and outlaw it, although associated activities such as street solicitation, running a brothel and pimping were illegal.

[[Louisiana]] is the only state where convicted prostitutes are required to register as sex offenders. The State's crime against nature by solicitation law is used when a person is accused of engaging in oral or anal sex in exchange for money.  Only prostitutes prosecuted under this law are required to be registered.  This has led to a lawsuit filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights.&lt;ref&gt;

==John schools==

[[John school]]s are programs whose mission is the rehabilitation of purchasers of [[prostitution]]. In the first 12 years of the ongoing program, now denominated the "First Offender Prostitution Program", the recidivism rate of offenders was reduced from 8% to less than 5%. Since 1995, similar programs have been implemented in more than 40 communities in the US, including Washington, DC; West Palm Beach, Florida; Buffalo and Brooklyn, New York; and Los Angeles, California. An audit in 2009 of the first john school in San Francisco, California by the budget analysts of the City faulted the program with poorly defined objectives and absence of a method to determine its efficacy. Despite being touted as a national model for which taxpayers pay nothing, the audit stated that the program did not fully cover its expenses in each of the preceding 5 years, which resulted in a deficit of $270,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/19/BAT519OMJL.DTL|title=Audit faults S.F.

'''Raymond Arnold Winbush''' aka '''Tikari Bioko''' (born March 31, 1948) is an American-African scholar and activist known for his systems-thinking approaches to understanding the impact of racism/white supremacy on the global African community.  His writings, consultations, and research have been instrumental in understanding developmental stages in Black males, public policy and its connection to compensatory justice, relationships between Black males and females, infusion of African studies into school curricula, and the impact of hip hop culture on the contemporary American landscape.  He is currently Research Professor and Director of the Institute for Urban Research at [[Morgan State University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nashvillescene.com/pitw/archives/2011/03/21/oh-the-irony-arianna-huffington-ray-winbush-speak-tonight-in-nashville Oh, the Irony: Arianna Huffington, Ray Winbush Speak Tonight in Nashville]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

'''Early life'''

Winbush is one of five children and the middle of three sons born to Harold Winbush, a [[Clevlend,Ohio]] steel worker, and Dorothy Winbush, a housewife.  A depressed economy, low wages, and racial discrimination produced financial hardships for the family and in 1948 (the year of Winbush's birth), the family left Pittsburgh and moved to the east side of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] to begin anew.  At the request of his elementary school art teacher, Winbush was tested and scored high on the [[Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test]].  Life changed for Winbush when he was bussed from his poor, Hough Avenue neighborhood to an accelerated school in a middle-class and predominantly Jewish neighborhood seven miles from his family's home.  At twelve years old, Winbush realized differences between his educational experiences and those of his brothers.  Much of Winbush's early childhood narrative is detailed in his first book, ''The Warrior Method''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Warrior_Method.html?id=iOEVyuy_jz4C&amp;redir_esc=y The Warrior Method:  A Program for Rearing Healthy Black Boys]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education'''

After graduating from Cleveland's [[John Adams High School (Ohio)|John Adams High School]] in 1966, Winbush entered Oakwood College (now [[Oakwood University]]) in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] where he won consecutive [[Ford Foundation]] Intensive Summer Studies Program scholarships to [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]] universities in 1968 and 1969 respectively.  In 1970, Winbush graduated with honors and received his BA in psychology from Oakwood and later served the college as professor and chair of Behavioral Sciences from 1973 until 1977.  Winbush earned his MA (1973) and PhD (1976) in clinical psychology from the [[University of Chicago]].  His thesis, "A Quantitative Exploration into Proxemic Behavior," was a study of the cross-cultural differences of spacing behavior in public. His dissertation, "A Quantitative Exploration into the Theoretical Formulations of [[Erik H. Erikson]] Concerning Black Identity," examined Erikson's fifth "Age of Man" and empirically refuted Erikson's ideas concerning identity development in young Blacks.

'''Career'''

After serving as chair and Assistant Professor of Behavioral Sciences at [[Oakwood University]] and as Associate Professor of psychology at [[Alabama A&amp;M University]] from 1973 to 1980, Winbush was named Assistant Provost and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Psychology at [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1980.  From June 1986 until July 1989, he served as the first Director of the Joseph Johnson Black Cultural Center at Vanderbilt and was instrumental in examining enrollment and retention of African-American and other students of color at the university.  Between 1975 and 2001, Winbush's research established numerous projects to raise awareness of America's race relations and their impact upon the lives of Black people.  He received grants to further his work from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Cleveland Foundation]], [[Job Training Partnership Act of 1982]], West African Research Association, [[Pitney Bowes, Inc.]], the [[Ford Motor Company]], and the [[Kellogg Foundation]].  From 1995 until 2002, Winbush was the [[Benjamin Hooks]] Professor of Social Sciences and director of the Race Relations Institute at [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, TN]].  Since 2002, he has been Research Professor and Director of the Institute for Urban Research at [[Morgan State University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and in that same year aided in establishing the [[Global Afrikan Congress]], the largest pan-African organization in the world.

Winbush's consultations, research, and speaking engagements have gained him worldwide visibility.  In addition to his diversity workshops, discussions on reparations, and keynote addresses on race relations for [[Princeton University]], [[Yale University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Washington College of Law]] at [[American University]], the [[Boeing Corporation]], [[Columbia University Law School]], [[New York University]] and others, Winbush has lectured on racism in a global context at [[Murdoch University]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]],  [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]], and at the [[University of London]] School of Education. By 2000, he had helped organize the first international conference of the [[National Council for Black Studies]] in [[Ghana]].

Winbush appeared as race relations expert on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 2005.[http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/a-crash-cast-moment_1] His books, ''The Warrior Method: A Program for Rearing Healthy Black Boys''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1812904 The Warrior Method: A Program for Rearing Healthy Black Boys.] ''[[National Public Radio]].'' April 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[http://rwinbush.webs.com/reparations.htm Should America Pay? Slavery and The Raging Debate on Reparations]'' were published in 2001 and 2003 respectively. His latest book, '' Belinda's Petition: A Concise History of Reparations For The Transatlantic Slave Trade'' (XLibris, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;Mike Barber, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-barber/belindas-petition-a-perfe_b_453005.html "Belinda's Petition a Perfect Primer on the Subject of Reparations"], Huff Post,  04/09/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a "prequel" to ''Should America Pay?: Slavery and the Raging Debate on Reparations'', and provides an overview of how reparations for the TransAtlantic Slave Trade has been a consistent theme among African people for the past 500 years.

'''Robert Allan Caro''' (born October 30, 1935) is an American journalist and author known for his biographies of [[Politics of the United States|United States]] political figures [[Robert Moses]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

After working for many years as a reporter, Caro wrote ''[[The Power Broker]]'' (1974), a biography of New York urban planner Robert Moses,&lt;ref name="Boeing2017Moses"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317570292_We_Live_in_a_Motorized_Civilization_Robert_Moses_Replies_to_Robert_Caro|author=Boeing, G.|title=We Live in a Motorized Civilization: Robert Moses Replies to Robert Caro|journal=SSRN|date=2017|pages=1–13|accessdate=2017-08-13|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2934079}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was chosen by the [[Modern Library]] as one of the hundred greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-nonfiction/ 100 Best Nonfiction] &amp;mdash;Modern Library&lt;/ref&gt; He has since written four of a planned five volumes of ''[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson]]'' (1982, 1990, 2002, 2012), a biography of the former president.

For his biographies, he has won two [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography|Pulitzer Prizes in Biography]], two [[National Book Award]]s (including one for Lifetime Achievement), the [[Francis Parkman Prize]] (awarded by the [[Society of American Historians]] to the book that "best exemplifies the union of the historian and the artist"), three [[National Book Critics Circle Award]]s, the H.L. Mencken Award, the Carr P. Collins Award from the Texas Institute of Letters, the [[D.B. Hardeman Prize]], and a [[American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medals#Biography|Gold Medal in Biography from the American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. In 2010 President Barack Obama awarded Caro the National Humanities Medal.

Due to Caro's reputation for exhaustive research and detail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Caro's Big Dig|author=Charles McGrath|date=April 12, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/magazine/robert-caros-big-dig.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is sometimes invoked by reviewers of other writers who are called "Caro-esque" for their own extensive research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/139094/theres-no-check-trump-except-reality-qa-wayne-barrett|author=Alex Shephard, Theodore Ross|title="There's No Check on Trump Except Reality": A Q&amp;A with Wayne Barrett|date=December 1, 2016|publisher=New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=But Enough About You: Essays|author=Christopher Buckley|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2014|page=300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wg5DCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=Caro-esque&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IA1G0GJXIg&amp;sig=LE7ULLgplx9xNuNjIXyLLHIhhEg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif04XBmaLRAhVkxoMKHUszCIMQ6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Caro-esque&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Caro was born in New York City, the son of Cele (née Mendelow) and Benjamin Caro.&lt;ref name=WhoWhoPulitzer&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63nvmt4HqTEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Robert+Caro+1935&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=2013-04-12 |chapter=1975 Robert Caro |title=Who's who of Pulitzer Prize winners |editor1-first=Elizabeth A. |editor1-last=Brennan &lt;!-- |editor1-link=Elizabeth A.

His father, a businessman, spoke [[Yiddish]] as well as English, but he didn't speak either very often. He was 'very silent,' Caro said, and became more so after Caro's mother died, after a long illness, when he [Caro] was 12. It was his mother's deathbed wish that he should go to the [[Horace Mann School]], an exclusive private school in the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] section of [[The Bronx]]. As a student there, Caro translated an edition of his school newspaper into Russian and mailed 10,000 copies to students in the USSR. He graduated in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://record.horacemann.org/article.php?id=345 The HM Record Online (Russian copy)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927042314/http://record.horacemann.org/article.php?id=345 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to [[Princeton University]], where he majored in English. He became [[managing editor]] of ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'', second to [[R.W. Apple, Jr.]], later a prominent editor at ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT01&gt;[[Charles McGrath|McGrath, Charles]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/magazine/robert-caros-big-dig.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1&amp;hpw "Robert Caro’s Big Dig"], ''The New York Times'', April 12, 2012 (April 15 ''Magazine''); web p. 3 (bio), web p. 6 (sources), &amp; various. Retrieved 2012-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

His writings, both in class and out, had been lengthy since his years at Horace Mann. A short story he wrote for ''[[Princeton Tiger Magazine|The Princeton Tiger]]'', the school's humor magazine, took up almost an entire issue. His [[senior thesis]] on [[existentialism]] in [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] was so long, Caro claims, that the university's English department subsequently established a maximum length for senior theses by its students. He graduated ''cum laude'' in 1957.&lt;ref name="marquiswhoswho1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;

According to a 2012 ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' profile, "Caro said he now thinks that Princeton, which he chose because of its parties, was one of his mistakes, and that he should have gone to [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. Princeton in the mid-1950s was hardly known for being hospitable towards the Jewish community, and though Caro says he did not personally suffer from [[anti-Semitism]], he saw plenty of students who did." He had a sports column in the ''Princetonian'' and also wrote for the ''[[Princeton Tiger]]'' humor magazine.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;

Caro began his professional career as a reporter with the ''New Brunswick Daily Home News'' (now merged into the ''[[Home News Tribune]]'') in New Jersey. He took a brief leave to work for the [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as a publicist. He left politics after an incident where he was accompanying the party chair to polling places on election day. A police officer reported to the party chair that some African-Americans Caro saw being loaded into a [[police van]], under arrest, were [[Election monitoring|poll watchers]] who "had been giving them some trouble." Caro left politics right there. "I still think about it," he recalled in the 2012 ''Times Magazine'' profile. "It wasn't the roughness of the police that made such an impression. It was the—meekness isn't the right word—the acceptance of those people of what was happening."&lt;ref name=NYT01 /&gt;

After briefly enrolling in the English doctoral program at [[Rutgers University]] (where he served as a teaching assistant), he went on to six years as an [[investigative reporter]] with the [[Long Island]] newspaper ''[[Newsday]]''. One of the articles he wrote was a long series about why [[Long Island Sound link#1957 plan|a proposed bridge across]] [[Long Island Sound]] from [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]] to [[Oyster Bay, New York|Oyster Bay]], championed by [[Robert Moses]], would have been inadvisable, requiring piers so large it would disrupt tidal flows in the sound, among other problems. Caro believed that his work had influenced even the state's powerful governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] to reconsider the idea, until he saw the state's [[New York State Assembly|Assembly]] vote overwhelmingly to pass a preliminary measure for the bridge.&lt;ref name=NYT01 /&gt;

"That was one of the transformational moments of my life," Caro said years later. It led him to think about Moses for the first time. "I got in the car and drove home to Long Island, and I kept thinking to myself: 'Everything you've been doing is baloney. You've been writing under the belief that power in a democracy comes from the ballot box. But here's a guy who has never been elected to anything, who has enough power to turn the entire state around, and you don't have the slightest idea how he got it.'"&lt;ref name=NYT01 /&gt;

Caro gave a speech to introduce Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]].

==Work==

===''The Power Broker''===

{{main|The Power Broker}}
Caro spent the academic year of 1965–1966 as a [[Nieman Fellow]] at [[Harvard University]]. During a class on [[urban planning]] and [[land use]], the experience of watching Moses returned to him.

{{quote|They were talking one day about highways and where they got built...and here were these mathematical formulas about traffic density and population density and so on, and all of a sudden I said to myself: "This is completely wrong. This isn't why highways get built. Highways get built because Robert Moses wants them built there. If you don't find out and explain to people where Robert Moses gets his power, then everything else you do is going to be dishonest.&lt;ref name=NYT01 /&gt;}}

To do so, Caro began work on a biography of Moses, ''[[The Power Broker|The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York]]'', also a study of Caro's favorite theme: the acquisition and use of power. He expected it would take nine months to complete, but instead it took him until 1974.&lt;ref name=NYT01 /&gt; The work was based on extensive research and 522 interviews, including seven interviews with Moses himself, several with Michael Madigan (who worked for Moses for 35 years); and numerous interviews with Sidney Shapiro (Moses's general manager for forty years); as well as interviews with men who worked for and knew Moses's mentor, New York Governor [[Al Smith]]. During the 1967-1968 academic year, Caro worked on the book as a [[Carnegie Fellowship|Carnegie Fellow]] at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]].

His wife, Ina, functioned as his research assistant. Her master's thesis on the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] stemmed from this work. At one point she sold the family home and took a teaching job so Robert would be financially able to finish the book.&lt;ref name=NYT01 /&gt;

''The Power Broker'' is widely viewed&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20121221005405/http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/news/666&lt;/ref&gt; as a seminal work because it combined painstaking historical research with a smoothly flowing narrative writing style. The success of this approach was evident in his chapter on the construction of the [[Cross-Bronx Expressway]], where Caro reported the controversy from all perspectives, including that of neighborhood residents. The result was a work of powerful literary as well as academic interest. Upon its publication, Moses denounced the biography in a 23-page statement.&lt;ref name="Boeing2017Moses" /&gt;

===''The Years of Lyndon Johnson''===
{{main|The Years of Lyndon Johnson}}
Following ''The Power Broker'', Caro turned his attention to [[U.S. President|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Caro retraced Johnson's life by temporarily moving to rural Texas and Washington, D.C., in order to better understand Johnson's upbringing and to interview anyone who had known Johnson. The work, entitled ''[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson]]'', was originally intended as a trilogy, but is projected to encompass five volumes:

# ''[[The Path to Power (1982)|The Path to Power]]'' (1982) covers Johnson's life up to his failed 1941 campaign for the [[United States Senate]].
# ''[[Means of Ascent]]'' (1990) commences in the aftermath of that defeat and continues through his election to that office in 1948.
# ''[[Master of the Senate]]'' (2002) chronicles Johnson's rapid ascent and rule as [[Majority Leader of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]].
# ''[[The Passage of Power]]'' (2012) details the [[1960 U.S. presidential election|1960 election]], LBJ's life as vice president, the [[JFK assassination]] and his first days as president.
# In November 2011, Caro announced that the full project had expanded to five volumes with the fifth requiring another two to three years to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/AP5b3c3fcacee848a9a8f9891bcc7ec0e1.html|title=APNewsBreak: Caro's fourth LBJ book coming in May|date=November 1, 2011|publisher=online.wsj.com|accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media-center.knopfdoubleday.com/2011/11/01/robert-a-caros-the-passage-of-power-to-be-published-in-may|title=Robert A.

As of May 2017, Caro has completed 400 typed manuscript pages (roughly corresponding to the "passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]] and more than a dozen separate education bills" in 1965) and most of the research for the book. He intends to embark on a major research trip to Vietnam in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/books/robert-caro-nearing-the-end-of-his-epic-lbj-bio-eyes-a-trip-to-vietnam.html|title=Robert Caro, Nearing the End of His Epic L.B.J. Bio, Eyes a Trip to Vietnam|author=Williams, John|work=The New York Times|date=June 2, 2017|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' in January 2018, Caro indicated he did not know when the book would be finished, mentioning anywhere from two to ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/01/16/studies-in-power-an-interview-with-robert-caro/|title='Studies in Power': An Interview with Robert Caro|work=The New York Review of Books|date=January 16, 2018|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caro's books portray Johnson as a complex and contradictory character: at the same time a scheming opportunist and visionary progressive. Caro argues, for example, that Johnson's victory in the 1948 runoff for the Democratic nomination for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] was only achieved through extensive fraud and [[ballot box stuffing]], though this is set in the practices of the time and in the context of Johnson's previous defeat in his 1941 race for the Senate, the victim of exactly similar chicanery. Caro also highlighted some of Johnson's campaign contributions, such as those from the Texas construction firm [[Kellogg, Brown and Root|Brown and Root]]; in 1962 the company was acquired by another Texas firm, [[Halliburton]], which became a major contractor in the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, Caro argued that Johnson was awarded the [[Silver Star]] in [[World War II]] for political as well as military reasons, and that he later lied to journalists and the public about the circumstances for which it was awarded. Caro's portrayal of Johnson also notes his struggles on behalf of [[Political progressivism|progressive]] causes such as the [[Voting Rights Act]], and his consummate skill in getting this enacted in spite of intense opposition from [[Southern Democrats]].

Among sources close to the late president, Johnson's widow [[Lady Bird Johnson]] "spoke to [Caro] several times and then abruptly stopped without giving a reason, and [[Bill Moyers]], Johnson's press secretary, has never consented to be interviewed, but most of Johnson's closest friends, including [[John Connally]] and [[George Christian (journalist)|George Christian]], Johnson's last press secretary, who spoke to Caro practically on his deathbed, have gone on the record".&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;

===Publisher-editor===
Caro's books have been published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], first under editor in chief [[Robert Gottlieb]] and then by [[Sonny Mehta]], "who took over the Johnson project – enthusiastically – after Gottlieb's departure in 1987." Gottlieb, five years Caro's senior, suggested the Johnson project to Caro in 1974 in preference to the planned follow-up to the Moses volume, a biography of [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] that was then abandoned. The ex-President had recently died and Caro had already decided, before meeting with Gottlieb on the subject, to undertake the Texan's biography; he "wanted to write about power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/robert-caro-0512 |title=The Big Book |date=May 2012 |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |author=Chris Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottlieb has continued as editor of Caro's books since leaving Knopf and excerpted Volume 2 of the Johnson biography at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' when he was editor in chief there.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;

==Awards==
For his biographies of Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson, Robert A. Caro has twice won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography]], three times won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for the Best Nonfiction Book of the Year, and has won virtually every other major literary honor, including two [[National Book Award]]s (one for Lifetime Achievement), the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medals#Biography|Gold Medal in Biography from the American Academy of Art and Letters]], and the [[Francis Parkman Prize]].

In October 2007, Caro was named a "Holtzbrinck Distinguished Visitor" at the [[American Academy in Berlin]], Germany but then was unable to attend.

In 2010, he received the [[National Humanities Medal]] from President Obama, the highest award in the humanities given in the United States. Delivering remarks at the end of the ceremony, the President said, "I think about Robert Caro and reading ''The Power Broker'' back when I was 22 years old and just being mesmerized, and I'm sure it helped to shape how I think about politics."&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, February 26, 2010 and Suntimes.com 3/4/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Robert Caro was the recipient of the 2011 BIO Award given each year by members of [[Biographers International]] "to a colleague who had made a major contribution in the advancement of the art and craft of real life depiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biographersclub.co.uk/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=167:the-biographers-craft-january-2011&amp;Itemid=141 |title=Robert Caro Wins 2011 BIO Award |date=February 11, 2011 |work=The Biographers' Club |accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caro has described his wife, [[Ina Caro]], as "the whole team" on all five of his books. She sold their house and took a job teaching school to fund work on ''The Power Broker'' and is the only person other than himself who conducted research for his books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/magazine/robert-caros-big-dig.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=tha210_20120415&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Robert Caro's Big Dig |date=April 12, 2012 |publisher=The New York Times |author=Charles McGrath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Doyle Bullard''' (born December 21, 1946 in Elba, Alabama) is former Dean of the [[Barbara Jordan - Mickey Leland School Of Public Affairs]] (October 2011 - August 2016) and currently Distinguished Professor at [[Texas Southern University]]. Previously Ware Professor of Sociology and Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at [[Clark Atlanta University]], Bullard is known as the 'father of [[environmental justice]]'.&lt;ref name="grist.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dicum |first=Gregory |url=http://grist.org/article/dicum/ |title=Dicum, Gregory. 2006. "Meet Robert Bullard, the father of environmental justice," '&amp;#39;Grist'&amp;#39;, March 15 |publisher=Grist.org |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a leading campaigner against [[environmental racism]], as well as the foremost scholar of the problem, and of the Environmental Justice Movement which sprung up in the United States in the 1980s.

== Early life and education ==

Born in Elba, Alabama, Robert Bullard is the son of Nehemiah and Myrtle Brundidge Bullard; he was "the fourth of five children."&lt;ref&gt;[http://meldi.snre.umich.edu/node/12400 "Robert D. Bullard", Multicultural Environmental Leadership Development Institute (MELDI), University of Michigan, n.d.] Accessed: December 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Elba's Mulberry Heights High School, as class salutorian, in 1964.&lt;ref name=hm /&gt;

Continuing his education, Bullard received a bachelor's degree in Government at [[Alabama A&amp;M University]], in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], in 1968. Upon graduating from college, he served two years in the United States Marine Corps, at an "air control station in North Carolina".&lt;ref name=hm /&gt;

His M.A. in Sociology was earned at [[Atlanta University]], in 1972. Bullard obtained his Ph.D. in Sociology at [[Iowa State University]], in 1976, under the supervision of urban sociologist Robert ("Bob") O. Richards.&lt;ref name=hm&gt;[http://www.idvl.org/sciencemakers/Bio34.html "Robert Bullard," The History Makers, April 12, 2011 (video).] Accessed: June 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[http://tsu.edu/academics/colleges__schools/publicaffairs/drbullard/pdf/cv.pdf Robert D. Bullard, Curriculum Vitae.] Accessed: May 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental justice work ==

===Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management, Inc.===

In 1979 Bullard's wife, attorney Linda McKeever Bullard, represented Margaret Bean and other Houston residents in their struggle against a plan that would locate a municipal landfill next to their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/13187/Bean-v-Southwestern-Waste-Management-Corp.html |title=Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management Corp. - Significance, Waste Management In Houston, Laches And State Action, Impact, Further Readings - JRank Articles |publisher=Law.jrank.org |date=1979-12-21 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit, Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management, Inc., was the first of its kind in the United States that charged environmental discrimination in waste facility siting under the [[civil rights]] laws. Houston's [[Middle class|middle-class]], suburban Northwood Manor neighborhood was an unlikely location for a [[Landfill|garbage dump]] except that it was over 82 percent black. Bullard, having received his doctoral degree only a couple of years before, was drawn into the case as an [[expert witness]]. In this role Bullard conducted a study which documented the location of municipal waste disposal facilities in Houston. Entitled 'Solid Waste Sites and the Black Houston Community', the study was the first comprehensive account of ecoracism in the United States. Bullard and his researchers found that African American neighbourhoods in Houston were often chosen for [[toxic waste]] sites. All five city-owned garbage dumps, six of the eight city-owned garbage incinerators, and three of the four privately owned landfills were sited in black neighbourhoods, although blacks made up only 25 percent of the city's population.&lt;ref name="ejrc.cau.edu"&gt;[http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/RDBwriteup.html Johnson, Glenn S. (n.d.) "Robert Bullard", Environmental Justice Resource Center, Clark Atlanta University] Accessed: December 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery prompted Bullard to begin a long academic and activist campaign against environmental racism. "Without a doubt", Bullard has said of his experience, "it was a form of apartheid where whites were making decisions and [[black people]] and brown people and [[Colored|people of color]], including Native Americans on reservations, had no seat at the table."&lt;ref name="grist.org"/&gt;

===Early work===

Over the 1980s Bullard widened his study of environmental racism to the whole [[Southern United States|American South]], focusing on communities in Houston, in [[Dallas, Texas]], Alsen, Louisiana, [[Institute, West Virginia]], and [[Emelle, Alabama]]. Again he found a clear overrepresentaion of environmental hazards in black areas as compared to white areas, causing increased health risks to black citizens. In 1990 Bullard published his first book, ''Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class and Environmental Quality''. In the book, Bullard wrote that the Environmental Justice Movement, a [[Grassroots democracy|grassroots movement]] by people of colour then spreading across America to protest environmental racism, signified a new convergence of the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[environmental movement]] of the 1960s.

===Advocacy===

In 1990 Bullard (then at the University of California-Riverside) became one leader of a group of prominent academics, later known as the Michigan Group, including [[Bunyan Bryant]] of [[University of Michigan|the University of Michigan]] and Charles Lee of the [[United Church of Christ]]. The group wrote letters to [[Louis Wade Sullivan|Louis Sullivan]], the Secretary of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], and to [[William Reilly]], the head of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], asking for meetings with the officials to discuss governmental policy on environmental discrimination. Sullivan never responded, but Reilly met the [[Interest group|advocacy group]] several times, resulting in the creation of the EPA's Work Group on Environmental Equity. This group later became the Office of Environmental Equity, and then the Office of Environmental Justice under EPA Administrator [[Carol M. Browner|Carol Browner]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Cole &amp; Foster, ''From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement'', (New York University Press, New York &amp; London), 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullard also played a key role in the organising of the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991. Starting out with a list of only 30 people of color groups working on environmental issues, Bullard expanded the list to over 300 groups by calling the leaders he knew personally and gathering information on other groups they had come across. It was these groups that attended the Leadership Summit in October 1991, at which a list of seventeen 'Principles of Environmental Justice' was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weact.org/AboutUs/PrinciplesofEnvironmentalJustice/tabid/226/Default.aspx |title=Principles of Environmental Justice |publisher=WEACT.org |date=1991-10-27 |accessdate=2012-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219203204/http://www.weact.org/AboutUs/PrinciplesofEnvironmentalJustice/tabid/226/Default.aspx |archivedate=2012-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullard's expanded list eventually included groups from outside the United States, including [[Puerto Rico]], Canada and Mexico, and has been published as the "People of Color Environmental Group Directory" by the [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]].&lt;ref name="ejrc.cau.edu"/&gt;
[[File:Dr.RobertBullard.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Bullard, PhD]]

In 1994 [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] signed the Environmental Justice [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12898 after advice and research by a National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC), which included Professor Bullard, who chaired the Health and Research Subcommittee.

Bullard continued to act on behalf of struggling African American groups across the U.S. It was his expert testimony that won the case of Citizens Against Nuclear Trash (CANT) v. Louisiana Energy Services (LES) for the environmental justice group, directly causing the federal government's decision to deny the LES's permit for a [[Enriched uranium|uranium enrichment]] plant in Forest Grove and Center Springs, Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;'In The Matter Of Louisiana Energy Services, L.P.', Decision of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, May 1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 when asked what keeps him going in his quest for environmental justice, Bullard answered, "People who fight... People who do not let the garbage trucks and the landfills and the petrochemical plants roll over them. That has kept me in this movement for the last 25 years. And in the last 10 years, we've been winning: lawsuits are being won, reparations are being paid, apologies are being made. These companies have been put on notice that they can't do this anymore, anywhere."&lt;ref name="grist.org"/&gt;

[[File:Racetrack Playa in Death Valley National Park.jpg|thumb|A sailing stone in [[Racetrack Playa]]]]

'''Sailing stones''', also known as '''sliding rocks''', '''walking rocks''', '''rolling stones''', and '''moving rocks''', are a [[geological phenomenon]] where rocks move and inscribe long tracks along a smooth valley floor without human or animal intervention. The movement of the rocks results when large [[ice sheet]]s a few millimeters thick floating in an ephemeral winter pond start to break up during sunny days. Frozen during cold winter nights, these thin floating ice panels are driven by wind and [[ice shove|shove]] rocks at speeds up to 5 meters per minute.

Trails of sliding rocks have been observed and studied in various locations, including Little Bonnie Claire Playa in Nevada,&lt;ref name=Clements&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clements |first=Thomas D. |title=Wind-blown rocks and trails on Little Bonnie Claire Playa, Nye County, Nevada |journal=Journal of Sedimentary Research |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=182–86 |publisher=SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology |date=1 September 1952 |url=http://jsedres.geoscienceworld.org/content/28/3/333.abstract |issn=1527-1404 |doi= 10.1306/D42694F4-2B26-11D7-8648000102C1865D |access-date=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most famously at [[Racetrack Playa]], [[Death Valley National Park]], California, where the number and length of tracks are notable.

==Description==
[[File:Death 8 bg 082303.jpg|thumb|Tracks are sometimes not linear.]]

The Racetrack's stones speckle the playa floor, predominantly in the southern portion. Historical accounts identify some stones around {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} from shore, yet most of the stones are found relatively close to their respective originating outcrops. Three lithologic types are identified: (1) [[syenite]], found most abundant on the west side of the playa; (2) [[dolomite]], subrounded blue-gray stones with white bands; and (3) black dolomite, the most common type, found almost always in angular joint blocks or slivers.&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;Stanley, G. M., Origin of Playa Stone Tracks, Racetrack Playa, Inyo County California, Geological Society of America Bulletin, 66, 1329–1350, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; This dolomite composes nearly all stones found in the southern half of the playa, and originates at a steep promontory, {{convert|850|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} high, paralleling the east shore at the south end of the playa. Intrusive [[igneous rock]] originates from adjacent slopes (most of those being tan-colored [[feldspar]]-rich syenite). Tracks are often up to {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, about {{convert|3|to|12|in|cm|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide, and typically much less than {{convert|2.5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep. Most moving stones range from about {{convert|6|to|18|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter.

Stones with rough bottoms leave straight [[wikt:striated|striated]] tracks, while those with smooth bottoms tend to wander. Stones sometimes turn over, exposing another edge to the ground and leaving a different track in the stone's wake.

Trails differ in both direction and length. Rocks that start next to each other may travel parallel for a time, before one abruptly changes direction to the left, right, or even back to the direction from which it came. Trail length also varies – two similarly sized and shaped rocks may travel uniformly, then one could move ahead or stop in its track.

A balance of very specific conditions is thought to be needed for stones to move:
*A flooded surface
*A thin layer of clay
*Wind
*Ice floes
*Warming temperatures causing ice breakup

==Research history==
[[File:Racetrack-Playa-Death-Valley-2.jpg|thumb|left|Two rocks in [[Racetrack Playa]]]]
At Racetrack Playa, these tracks have been studied since the early 1900s, yet the origins of stone movement were not confirmed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=These Rocks Move By Themselves|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sailing-stones-in-death-valley-california-2012-12|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained the subject of research for which several hypotheses&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4021|number=21|title=Living Stones of Death Valley|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; existed. However, as of August 2014, timelapse video footage of rocks moving has been published, showing the rocks moving at high wind speeds within the flow of thin, melting sheets of ice. The scientists have thus identified the cause of the moving stones to be [[ice shove]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/news/wandering-stones-of-death-valley-explained-1.15773 'Wandering stones' of Death Valley explained [Video]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-28989520 |title=United States: 'Sailing rocks' mystery finally solved |accessdate=30 August 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early investigation===
The first documented account of the sliding rock phenomenon dates to 1915, when a prospector named Joseph Crook from Fallon, Nevada, visited the Racetrack Playa site.&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt; In the following years, the Racetrack sparked interest from geologists Jim McAllister and Allen Agnew, who mapped the bedrock of the area in 1948 and published the earliest report about the sliding rocks in a Geologic Society of America Bulletin. Their publication gave a brief description of the playa furrows and scrapers, stating that no exact measurements had been taken and suggesting that furrows were the remnants of scrapers propelled by strong gusts of wind – such as the variable winds that produce dust-devils – over a muddy playa floor.&lt;ref name=Stanley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Louis G., "Trails and Rocks Observed on a Playa in Death Valley National Monument, California", ''Journal of Sedimentary Petrology'', 22.3, 173–81, 1952;&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy over the origin of the furrows prompted the search for the occurrence of similar phenomena at other locations. Such a location was found at Little Bonnie Claire Playa in Nye County, Nevada, and the phenomenon was studied there, as well.&lt;ref name=Clements/&gt;&lt;ref name=lorenz/&gt;

Naturalists from the [[National Park Service]] later wrote more detailed descriptions and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured a set of photographs from the Racetrack. In 1952, a National Park Service Ranger named Louis G. Kirk recorded detailed observations of furrow length, width, and general course. He sought simply to investigate and record evidence of the moving rock phenomenon, not to hypothesize or create an extensive scientific report. Speculation about how the stones move started at this time. Various and sometimes idiosyncratic possible explanations have been put forward over the years that have ranged from the supernatural to the very complex. Most hypotheses favored by interested geologists posit that strong winds when the mud is wet are at least in part responsible. Some stones weigh as much as a human, which some researchers, such as geologist George M. Stanley, who published a paper on the topic in 1955, feel is too heavy for the area's winds to move. After extensive track mapping and research on rotation of the tracks in relation to ice floe rotation, Stanley maintained that ice sheets around the stones either help to catch the wind or that ice floes initiate rock movement.

===Progress in the 1970s===
Bob Sharp and Dwight Carey started a Racetrack stone movement monitoring program in May 1972. Eventually, 30 stones with fresh tracks were labeled and stakes were used to mark their locations. Each stone was given a name and changes in the stones' positions were recorded over a seven-year period. Sharp and Carey also tested the ice floe hypothesis by corralling selected stones. A corral {{convert|5.5|ft|m|sigfig=2|order=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter was made around a {{convert|3|in|cm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} wide, {{convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} track-making stone with seven [[rebar]] segments placed {{convert|25|to|30|in|cm|abbr=on}} apart. If a sheet of ice around the stones either increased wind-catching surface area or helped move the stones by dragging them along in ice floes, then the rebar should at least slow down and deflect the movement. Neither appeared to occur; the stone barely missed a rebar as it moved {{convert|28|ft|m|abbr=on}} to the northwest out of the corral in the first winter. Two heavier stones were placed in the corral at the same time; one moved five years later in the same direction as the first, but its companion did not move during the study period. This indicated that if ice played a part in stone movement, then ice collars around stones must be small.

[[File:Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[panorama]] of the [[Milky Way]] with the tracks of sailing stones below: Notice the stone on the right side.]]

Ten of the initial 30 stones moved in the first winter with Mary Ann (stone A) covering the longest distance at {{convert|212|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Two of the next six monitored winters also had multiple stones move. No stones were confirmed to have moved in the summer, and in some winters, none or only a few stones moved. In the end, all but two of the monitored stones moved during the seven-year study. At {{convert|2.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, Nancy (stone H) was the smallest monitored stone. It also moved the longest cumulative distance, {{convert|860|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and the greatest single winter movement, {{convert|659|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The largest stone to move was {{convert|80|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.

Karen (stone J) is a {{convert|29|by|19|by|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} block of dolomite and weighs an estimated {{convert|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. Karen did not move during the monitoring period. The stone may have created its {{convert|570|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, straight and old track from momentum gained from its initial fall onto the wet playa. However, Karen disappeared sometime before May 1994, possibly during the unusually wet winter of 1992 to 1993. Removal by artificial means is considered unlikely due to the lack of associated damage to the playa that a truck and winch would have caused. A possible sighting of Karen was made in 1994, {{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=on}} from the playa. Karen was rediscovered by San Jose geologist Paula Messina in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/11/death-valley/cahill-text/3|title=Death Valley |first=|last=Cahill|publisher=National Geographic Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued research in the 1990s===
Professor John Reid led six research students from [[Hampshire College]] and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] in a follow-up study in 1995. They found highly congruent trails from stones that moved in the late 1980s and during the winter of 1992–93. At least some stones were proved beyond a reasonable doubt to have been moved in ice floes that may be up to {{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=on}} wide. Physical evidence included swaths of lineated areas that could only have been created by moving thin sheets of ice. Consequently, both wind alone and wind in conjunction with ice floes are thought to be motive forces.

[[File:Racetrack Playa (Pirate Scott).jpg|thumb|Another sailing stone in [[Racetrack Playa]]]]

Physicists Bacon ''et al.'' studying the phenomenon in 1996, informed by studies in Owens Dry Lake Playa, discovered that winds blowing on playa surfaces can be compressed and intensified because of a playa's smooth, flat surfaces. They also found that [[boundary layer]]s (the region just above ground where winds are slower due to ground drag) on these surfaces can be as low as {{convert|2|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}. As a result, stones just a few centimeters high feel the full force of ambient winds and their gusts, which can reach {{convert|90|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in winter storms. Such gusts are thought to be the initiating force, while momentum and sustained winds keep the stones moving, possibly as fast as a moderate run.

Wind and ice both are the favored hypothesis for these sliding rocks. Noted in "Surface Processes and Landforms", Don J. Easterbrook mentions that because of the lack of parallel paths between some rock paths, this could be caused by degenerating ice floes resulting in alternate routes. Though the ice breaks up into smaller blocks, it is still necessary for the rocks to slide.

===21st-century developments===
Further understanding of the geologic processes at work in Racetrack Playa goes hand in hand with technological development. In 2009, development of inexpensive time-lapse digital cameras allowed the capturing of transient meteorological phenomena including dust devils and playa flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz |first=Ralph D. |others=Brian Jackson and Jason W. Barnes |title=Inexpensive Time-Lapse Digital Cameras for Studying Transient Meteorological Phenomena: Dust Devils and Playa Flooding |work=Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology |volume=27 |pages=246–56 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cameras were aimed at capturing various stages of the previously mentioned phenomena, though discussion of the sliding stones ensued. The developers of photographic technology describe the difficulty of capturing the Racetrack's stealthy rocks, as movements only occur about once every three years, and they believed, lasted about 10 seconds. Their next identified advancement was wind-triggered imagery, vastly reducing the ten million seconds of nontransit time they had to sift through.

It was postulated that small rafts of ice form around the rocks and the rocks are buoyantly floated off the soft bed, thus reducing the reaction and friction forces at the bed. Since this effect depends on reducing friction, and not on increasing the wind drag, these ice cakes need not have a particularly large surface area if the ice is adequately thick, as the minimal friction allows the rocks to be moved by arbitrarily light winds.&lt;ref name=lorenz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lorenz|first1=Ralph|author2=Jackson, Brian K. |author3=Barnes, Jason W. |author4=Spitale, Joe |author5= Keller, John M. |title=Ice rafts not sails: Floating the rocks at Racetrack Playa|journal=American Journal of Physics |date=January 2011 |volume=79 |issue=1|pages=37–42 |doi=10.1119/1.3490645|url= http://barnesos.net/publications/papers/2011.01.AJP.Lorenz.Racetrack.Rafts.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2011|bibcode= 2011AmJPh..79...37L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schewe |first=Phillip |title=Ice offers possible explanation for Death Valley's mysterious 'self-moving' rocks|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-02-ice-explanation-death-valley-mysterious.html|publisher=PhysOrg.com|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinforcing the "ice raft" theory, a research study pointed out narrowing trails, occurrence of intermittent spring systems, and absence of rocks at the end of the trails. The study identified the [[Racetrack mountain area]] that drains water towards the Racetrack Playa, while ice covered the intermittent lake. This suggests that this water buoyantly lifts the icebergs with embedded rocks until friction with the playa bed is reduced sufficiently for wind forces to move them and cause the observed tracks. The study also provides mapping and analysis of the effect of artificial ditch preventing the visitors from driving on the playa and they claim that it may interfere with the sliding rock phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Kletetschka 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kletetschka|first=Gunther|author2=Hooke, Roger LeB. |author3=Ryan, Andrew |author4=Fercana, George |author5=McKinney, Emerald |author6= Schwebler, Kristopher P. |title=Sliding stones of Racetrack Playa, Death Valley, USA: The roles of rock thermal conductivity and fluctuating water levels|journal=Geomorphology|date=April 2013|volume=195|pages=110–17|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.04.032|bibcode= 2013Geomo.195..110K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LiveScience&gt;{{cite web|title=Mystery of Death Valley's 'Sailing Stones' Solved|url=http://www.livescience.com/37492-sailing-stones-death-valley-moving-rocks.html|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Explanation====

News articles reported the mystery solved when researchers observed rock movements using [[GPS]] and time-lapse photography. The research team witnessed and documented rock movement on December 20, 2013, that involved more than 60 rocks, with some rocks moving up to 224 m between December 2013 and January 2014 in multiple movement events. These observations contradicted earlier hypotheses of winds or thick ice floating rocks off the surface. Instead, rocks move when large ice sheets a few millimeters thick floating in an ephemeral winter pond start to break up during sunny days. These thin floating ice panels,&lt;ref name="Lorenz 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Ralph|author2=Norris, J.|author3=Jackson, B. |author4=Norris, R. |author5=Chadbourne, J. |author6= Ray, J. |title=Trail formation by ice-shoved "sailing stones" observed at Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park|journal=Earth Surface Dynamics Discussions|date=June 2014|volume=2|pages=110–17|doi=10.5194/esurfd-2-1005-2014|url=https://www.earth-surf-dynam-discuss.net/2/1005/2014/esurfd-2-1005-2014.pdf |publisher=Copernicus|bibcode=2014ESuDD...2.1005L}}&lt;/ref&gt; frozen during cold winter nights, are driven by light winds and [[ice shove|shove]] rocks at up to 5 m/min (0.3&amp;nbsp;km/h).

====Experiments====
[[File:PebbleLiftedByIce.jpg|Illustration of the lifting mechanism of the rocks at the Racetracks Playa|thumb |Aquarium experiment]]
Ralph Lorenz, a planetary scientist, investigated the phenomenon in 2006. To illustrate the "ice raft" theory, Lorenz developed an experiment using a kitchen-table model using a container to show how heavy rocks might glide across the surface of the lake bed. A bed of sand is added to the bottom of the Tupperware, a rock is placed on the sand, and water is added until only a small edge of the rock sticks out. After putting the container in the freezer until the water is frozen, then removing the container and letting the ice begin to melt, Lorenz could end up with a small raft of floating ice with a rock embedded in it. All he had to do was gently blow on the floating ice sheet to get the rock to drag across the sand.&lt;!-- Gunther Kletetschka with his NASA's academy students showed the process of lifting a small stone in a thin aquarium and captured the lifting process on camera --&gt;&lt;ref name="Kletetschka 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LiveScience"/&gt; While these experiments, and the buoyant lifting of rocks, are doubtless relevant on some occasions, the January 2014 trail-forming events did not appear to rely on buoyancy, but the rocks were simply bulldozed.&lt;ref name="Lorenz 2014"/&gt;

==Possible influence of climate change==
Because rock movement relies on a very rare set of circumstances, namely the usually-dry playa being flooded, and cold conditions to allow the water to freeze, drier winters and warmer winter nights would cause such circumstances to occur less often. A statistical study by Ralph Lorenz and Brian Jackson&lt;ref name="Lorenz&amp;Jackson 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Ralph|author2=Jackson, B. |title=Declining Rock Movement at Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park: An Indicator of Climate Change ?|journal=Geomorphology|volume=211|pages=116–120|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X14000038|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.12.034|year=2014|bibcode=2014Geomo.211..116L}}&lt;/ref&gt; examining published reports of rock movements suggested (with 4:1 odds) an apparent decline between the 1960s-1990s, and the 21st century.

==Theft of rocks==
On 30 May 2013, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that park officials were looking into the theft of several of the rocks from the Death Valley National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sahagun |first=Louis |title=Mysterious rocks stolen from Death Valley National Park |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-death-valley-theft-20130530,0,367891.story|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Ildefonsus''''' is a 1609 painting by [[El Greco]]. It and his ''[[Saint Peter (El Greco)|Saint Peter]]'' were both painted for the [[Iglesia de San Vicente, Toledo]]. It has also previously been misidentified as [[Pope Eugene I]] or [[saint Blaise]]. It is now in the [[Real Monasterio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial]].

[[Ildefonsus]] is shown in a chasuble, pallium and mitre, holding a bishop's staff and an open book. The full robes emphasise the model's anatomy, showing [[Michelangelo]]'s influence on El Greco.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2683">A '''script coordinator''' is a role in the production of a [[film]] or [[television program|television series]]. The script coordinator is responsible for producing each [[draft document|draft]] of the [[screenplay|script]] and annotating it for ease of use for the production team.

On a television series the script coordinator is responsible for liaising between the writing and [[Film_production#Production|production]] departments. The writers deliver the first [[draft document|draft]] of a [[screenplay|script]] to the script coordinator who prepares it for the production team and handles any clearance issues. Clearance refers to the need to check the [[screenplay|script]] for potential legal problems and ensure that all names are cleared by the legal department. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-script-coordinator-do.htm wisegeek.com, What Does a Script Coordinator Do?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The script coordinator must check the [[draft document|draft]] for proper formatting, spelling, punctuation and continuity before releasing the [[draft document|draft]]. Once a [[screenplay|script]] has been released, other members of the production team offer notes to the writers necessitating revisions to the [[screenplay|script]]. The process of how widely each [[draft document|draft]] is released (e.g. just to the writers, then to the writers and producers and then to the network) varies from show to show. &lt;ref&gt;[http://aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com/2012/07/5-questions-with-writers-assistant-and.html aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com, 5 Questions with a Writer's Assistant and Script Coordinator, Tuesday, July 17, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

With each round of revisions the script coordinator must ensure that the changes are clearly marked, re-issue the [[screenplay|script]] and again check the [[screenplay|script]] for errors. Many script coordinators are also responsible for foreign language translations and compiling a [[Bible (writing)|show bible]] that tracks plot points and character introductions as a reference tool. 

A script coordinator is a distinct role from [[script supervisor]]. A script supervisor is responsible for on-set annotation of the [[screenplay|script]] for editing purposes rather than [[pre-production]] coordination of the [[screenplay|script]] to facilitate production. A script coordinator is considered a junior role in the writing staff and becoming a full-time [[screenwriter]] is typically a common promotion from being a script coordinator.

'''Sentence processing''' takes place whenever a reader or listener processes a language utterance, either in isolation or in the [[context (language use)|context]] of a conversation or a text.

Many studies of the human language comprehension process have focused on reading of single utterances (sentences) without context. Extensive research has shown, however, that language comprehension is affected also by context preceding a given utterance, as well as many other factors.

==Ambiguity==
Sentence comprehension has to deal with ambiguity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Altmann|first=Gerry|title=Ambiguity in sentence processing|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=April 1998|volume=2|issue=4|pages=146–151|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(98)01153-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spoken and written utterances, for example [[Ambiguity|lexical]], [[Syntactic ambiguity|structural]], and [[semantic ambiguity|semantic ambiguities]].  Ambiguity is ubiquitous, but people usually resolve it so effortlessly that they do not even notice it. For example, the sentence ''[[Time flies like an arrow]]'' has (at least) the interpretations ''Time moves as quickly as an arrow'', ''A special kind of fly, called time fly, likes arrows'' and ''Measure the speed of flies like you would measure the speed of an arrow''. Usually, readers will be aware of only the first interpretation. Educated readers though, spontaneously think about the [[arrow of time]] but inhibit that interpretation because it deviates from the original phrase and the temporal lobe acts as a switch.
  
Instances of ambiguity can be classified as '''local''' or '''global''' ambiguities. A sentence is globally ambiguous if it has two distinct interpretations. Examples are sentences like ''Someone shot the servant of the actress who was on the balcony'' (was it the servant or the actress who was on the balcony?) or ''The cop chased the criminal with a fast car'' (did the cop or the criminal have a fast car?). Comprehenders may have a preferential interpretation for either of these cases, but syntactically and semantically, neither of the possible interpretations can be ruled out.

Local ambiguities persist only for a short amount of time as an utterance is heard or written and are resolved during the course of the utterance so the complete utterance has only one interpretation. Examples include sentences like ''The critic wrote the book was enlightening'', which is ambiguous when ''The critic wrote the book'' has been encountered, but ''was enlightening'' remains to be processed. Then, the sentence could end, stating that the critic is the author of the book, or it could go on to clarify that the critic wrote something about a book. The ambiguity ends at ''was enlightening'', which determines that the second alternative is correct.

When readers process a local ambiguity, they settle on one of the possible interpretations immediately without waiting to hear or read more words that might help decide which interpretation is correct (the behaviour is called ''incremental processing''). If readers are surprised by the turn the sentence really takes, processing is slowed and is visible for example in reading times. Locally-ambiguous sentences have, therefore, been used as test cases to investigate the influence of a number of different factors on human sentence processing. If a factor helps readers to avoid difficulty, it is clear that the factor plays a factor in sentence processing.

==Theories==

Experimental research has spawned a large number of hypotheses about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension. Issues like modularity versus interactive processing and serial versus parallel computation of analyses have been theoretical divides in the field.

=== Architectural issues ===

==== Modular vs. interactive ====
A modular view of sentence processing assumes that each factor involved in sentence processing is computed in its own module, which has limited means of communication with the other modules. For example, syntactic analysis creation takes place without input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information, which are processed separately. A common assumption of modular accounts is a ''feed-forward'' architecture in which the output of one processing step is passed on to the next step without feedback mechanisms that would allow the output of the first module to be corrected. Syntactic processing is usually taken to be the most basic analysis step, which feeds into semantic processing and the inclusion of other information. A separate mental module parses sentences and lexical access happens first. Then, one syntactic hypothesis is considered at a time. There is no initial influence of meaning, or semantic.  Sentence processing is supported by a temporo-frontal network. Within the network, temporal regions subserve aspects of identification and frontal regions the building of syntactic and semantic relations. Temporal analyses of brain activation within this network support syntax-first models because they reveal that building of syntactic structure precedes semantic processes and that these interact only during a later stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friederici|first1=Angela|title=Towards a neural basis of auditory sentence processing|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1 February 2002|volume=6|issue=2|pages=78–84|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01839-8|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661300018398|accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive accounts assume that all available information is processed at the same time and can immediately influence the computation of the final analysis. In the interactive model of sentence processing, there is no separate module for parsing.  Lexical access, syntactic structure assignment, and meaning assignment happen at the same time in parallel. Several syntactic hypotheses can be considered at a time.    The interactive model demonstrates an on-line interaction between the structural and lexical and phonetic levels of sentence processing. Each word, as it is heard in the context of normal discourse, is immediately entered into the processing system at all levels of description, and is simultaneously analyzed at all these levels in the light of whatever information is available at each level at that point in the processing of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahams|first1=V. C.|last2=Rose|first2=P. K.|title=Sentence perception as an interactive parallel process|date=18 July 1975|volume=189|pages=226–228|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Marslen-Wilson/publication/6106384_Sentence_perception_as_an_interactive_parallel_process/links/02e7e530c94879601e000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interactive models of language processing assume that information flows both bottom-up and top-down, so that the representations formed at each level may be influenced by higher as well as lower levels. A framework called the interactive activation framework that embeds this key assumption among others, including the assumption that influences from different sources are combined nonlinearly. The nonlinearity means that information that may be decisive under some circumstances may have little or no effect under other conditions. In the interactive activation framework, the knowledge that guides processing is stored in the connections between units on the same and adjacent levels. The processing units that they connect may receive input from a number of different sources, which allows the knowledge that guides processing to be completely local while, at the same time, allowing the results of processing at one level to influence processing at other levels, both above and below. A basic assumption of the framework is that processing interactions are always reciprocal; it is this bi-directional characteristic that makes the system interactive. Bi-directional excitatory interactions between levels allow mutual simultaneous constraint among adjacent levels, and bi-diectional inhibitory interactions within a level allow for competition among mutually incompatible interpretations of a portion of an input. The between-level excitatory interactions are captured in the models in two-way excitatory connections between mutually compatible processing units.&lt;ref&gt;(McClelland)&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactic ambiguities are in fact based at the lexical level. In addition, more recent studies with more sensitive eyetracking machines have shown early context effects. Frequency and contextual information will modulate the activation of alternatives even when they are resolved in favor of the simple interpretation. Structural simplicity is cofounded with frequency, which goes against the garden path theory&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Pearlmutter &amp; Seidenberg, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Serial vs. parallel ====
Serial accounts assume that humans construct only one of the possible interpretations at first and try another only if the first one turns out to be wrong. Parallel accounts assume the construction of multiple interpretations at the same time. To explain why comprehenders are usually only aware of one possible analysis of what they hear, models can assume that all analyses ranked, and the highest-ranking one is entertained.

=== Models ===
There are a number of influential models of human sentence processing that draw on different combinations of architectural choices.

==== Garden path model ====
The garden path model {{Harv|Frazier 1987}} is a serial modular parsing model. It proposes that a single parse is constructed by a syntactic module. Contextual and semantic factors influence processing at a later stage and can induce re-analysis of the syntactic parse. Re-analysis is costly and leads to an observable slowdown in reading. When the parser encounters an ambiguity, it is guided by two principles: late closure and minimal attachment. The model has been supported with research on the [[early left anterior negativity]], an [[event-related potential]] often elicited as a response to [[Phrase structure rules|phrase structure violations]].

'''Late closure''' causes new words or phrases to be attached to the current clause. For example, "John said he would leave yesterday" would be parsed as ''John said (he would leave yesterday)'', and not as ''John said (he would leave) yesterday'' (i.e., he spoke yesterday).

'''Minimal attachment''' is a strategy of parsimony: The parser builds the simplest syntactic structure possible (that is, the one with the fewest phrasal nodes).

==== Constraint-based model ====
[[Constraint-based grammar|Constraint-based]] theories of language comprehension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=M. C.|author2=Pearlmutter, M. |author3=Seidenberg, M. |title=The Lexical Nature of Ambiguity Resolution|journal=Psychological Review|year=1994|volume=101|pages=676–703|pmid=7984711|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.101.4.676}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize how people make use of the vast amount of probabilistic information available in the linguistic signal. Through [[statistical learning]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seidenberg |first=Mark S. |author2=J.L. McClelland  |year=1989 |title=A distributed developmental model of word recognition and naming.   |journal=Psychological Review |volume=96 |pages=523–568 |pmid=2798649|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.96.4.523 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the frequencies and distribution of events in linguistic environments can be picked upon, which inform language comprehension. As such, language users are said to arrive at a particular interpretation over another during the comprehension of an ambiguous sentence by rapidly integrating these probabilistic constraints.

==== Good enough theory ====
The good enough approach to language comprehension assumes that listeners do not always engage in full detailed 
processing of linguistic input. Rather, the system has a tendency to develop shallow and superficial representations 
when confronted with some difficulty. The theory takes an approach that somewhat combines both the garden path model and the constraint based model. The theory focuses on two main issues. The first is that representations formed from complex or difficult material are often shallow and incomplete. The second is that limited information sources are often consulted in cases where the comprehension system encounters difficulty. The theory can be put to test using various experiments in psycholinguistics that involve garden path misinterpretation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2009/papers/75/paper75.pdf "Good enough language processing: A satisficing approach] Fernanda Ferreira, Paul E. Engelhardt,  Manon W. Jones, Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Cog Sc Proceedings, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://grey.colorado.edu/pub/oreilly/teach/prosem_lang/FerreiraBaileyFerraro02.pdf "Good enough representations in language comprehensions] Ferreira, Bailey and Ferraro, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

===Behavioral tasks===
In behavioral studies, subjects are often presented with linguistic stimuli and asked to perform an action. For example, they may be asked to make a judgment about a word ([[lexical decision task|lexical decision]]), reproduce the stimulus, or name a visually presented word aloud. Speed (often reaction time: time taken to respond to the stimulus) and accuracy (proportion of correct responses) are commonly employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks.  Researchers infer that the nature of the underlying process(es) required by the task gives rise to differences; slower rates and lower accuracy on these tasks are taken as measures of increased difficulty.  An important component of any behavioral task is that it stays relatively true to 'normal' language comprehension—the ability to generalize the results of any task is restricted when the task has little in common with how people actually encounter language.

A common behavioral paradigm involves [[priming (psychology)|priming effects]], wherein participants are presented first with a prime and then with a target word.  The response time for the target word is affected by the relationship between the prime and the target.  For example, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. She asked participants to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a "yes" response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a "no" response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread-stem). Fischler found that related word pairs were responded to faster when compared to unrelated word pairs, which suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Semantic facilitation without association in a lexical decision task | author=Fischler I. | journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=5 |  issue=3 | pages=335–339 | year=1977 | doi=10.3758/bf03197580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye-movements===
[[Eye tracking]] has been used to study online language processing.  This method has been influential in informing knowledge of reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rayner K. | title=Eye movements in reading and information processing |journal=Psychological Bulletin | year=1978 | volume=85 |pages=618–660 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.85.3.618 | pmid=353867 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Tanenhaus et al. (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tanenhaus M. K. |author2=Spivey-Knowlton M. J. |author3=Eberhard K. M. |author4=Sedivy J. E. | year=1995 | title=Integration of visual and linguistic information in spoken language comprehension|journal=Science |volume=268 |pages=1632–1634 | doi=10.1126/science.7777863 | pmid=7777863 | issue=5217}}&lt;/ref&gt; established the visual world paradigm, which takes advantage of eye movements to study online spoken language processing.  This area of research capitalizes on the linking hypothesis that eye movements are closely linked to the current focus of attention.

===Neuroimaging and evoked potentials===
The rise of non-invasive techniques provides myriad opportunities for examining the brain bases of language comprehension.  Common examples include [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs) in [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) and [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS). These techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy), and each type of methodology presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for studying a particular problem in language comprehension.

===Computational modeling===
Computational modeling is another means by which to explore language comprehension.  Models, such as those instantiated in [[neural networks]], are particularly useful because they requires theorists to be explicit in their hypotheses and because they can be used to generate accurate predictions for theoretical models that are so complex that they render [[discursive psychology|discursive analysis]] unreliable. A classic example of computational modeling in language research is [[James McClelland (psychologist)|McClelland]] and [[Jeff Elman|Elman's]] [[Trace (psycholinguistics)|TRACE]] model of speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, J.L., &amp; Elman, J.L. (1986). The TRACE model of speech perception. Cognitive Psychology, 18, 1-86&lt;/ref&gt; A model of sentence processing can be found in Hale (2011)'s 'rational' Generalized Left Corner parser.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, J. T. (2011). What a rational parser would do. Cognitive Science, 35(3), 399-443.&lt;/ref&gt; This model derives garden path effects as well as local coherence phenomena.

'''Tel Megiddo''' ({{lang-he-n|מגידו}}; {{lang-ar|مجیدو}}, Tell al-[[Mutesellim]], "The Tell of the Governor") is an ancient city whose remains form a [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] (archaeological mound), situated in northern [[Israel]] near [[Megiddo (kibbutz)|Kibbutz Megiddo]], about 30 km south-east of [[Haifa]]. Megiddo is known for its historical, geographical, and theological importance, especially under its Greek name [[Armageddon]]. During the Bronze Age, Megiddo was an important Canaanite [[city-state]] and during the Iron Age, a royal city in the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. Megiddo drew much of its importance from its strategic location at the northern end of the [[Wadi Ara]] defile, which acts as a pass through the [[Carmel Ridge]], and from its position overlooking the rich [[Jezreel Valley]] from the west. Excavations have unearthed 26 layers of ruins, indicating a long period of settlement.

Some Christians believe that Armageddon will be the site of the final battle between [[Jesus Christ]] and the kings of the Earth who go to war against [[Israel]], as outlined in the [[Book of Revelation]].

The site is now protected as '''Megiddo [[National parks and nature reserves of Israel|National Park]]''' and is a [[World Heritage Site]].

==Etymology==
Megiddo is also known as {{lang-el|Μεγιδδώ/Μαγεδδών}}, Megiddó/Mageddón in the [[Septuagint]]; {{lang-la|Mageddo}}; [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]]: Magiddu, Magaddu; Magidda and Makida in the Amarna tablets; [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: Maketi, Makitu, and Makedo. The [[Book of Revelation]] mentions an apocalyptic battle at [[Armageddon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2016:16|title=Bible Gateway passage: Revelation 16:16 - New International Version|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Greek name of the site, derived from the Hebrew "Har Megiddo", meaning "Mount of Megiddo". "Armageddon" has become a byword for the end of the world.

==History==

[[File:The Assyrian City in Megiddo.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Assyria]]n phase, plan and ruins]]

Megiddo was a site of great importance in the ancient world. It guarded the western branch of a narrow pass on the most important trade route of the ancient [[Fertile Crescent]], linking Egypt with [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Asia Minor]] and known today as [[Via Maris]]. Because of its strategic location, Megiddo was the site of several historical battles. The site was inhabited from approximately 7000 BCE to 586 BCE though the first significant remains date to the [[Chalcolithic]] period (4500–3500 BCE).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Early Bronze Age===
Megiddo's Early Bronze Age I (3500–3100 BCE) temple has been described by its excavators as "the most monumental single edifice so far uncovered in the EB I [[Levant]] and ranks among the largest structures of its time in the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]]."&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Noah."

City wall? What kind of wall?|date=May 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The town experienced a decline in the Early Bronze Age IV period (2300–2000 BCE), but was somewhat revived around 2000 BCE.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Middle Bronze Age===
Following massive construction, the town reached its largest size in the Middle Bronze Age, at 10–12 hectares.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Late Bronze Age===
Though the city was subjugated by [[Thutmose III]] (r. 1479–1425 BCE), it still prospered, and a massive and incredibly elaborate palace was constructed in the Late Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.penn.museum/sites/Canaan/LateBronzeAge.html |website=University of Penn Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron Age===
The city was destroyed around 1150 BCE, and the area was resettled by what some scholars have identified as early [[Israelites]], before being replaced with an unwalled [[Philistine]] town.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} When the Israelites captured it,{{dubious|Based on what, the Hebrew Bible? NOT an acceptable historical source for the 10th c. BCE.|date=August 2016}} though, it became an important city, before being destroyed, possibly by [[Aramaean]] raiders, and rebuilt, this time as an administrative center for [[Tiglath-Pileser III]]'s occupation of [[Samaria]].{{dubious|Shfela is not Samaria, but Judah.|date=August 2016}} However, its importance soon dwindled, and it was finally abandoned around 586 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, Paul.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time it has remained uninhabited, preserving ruins pre-dating 586 BCE without settlements ever disturbing them. Instead, the town of al-[[Lajjun]] (not to be confused with the al-Lajjun archaeological site in [[Jordan]]) was built up near to the site, but without inhabiting or disturbing its remains.

===Modern Israel===

[[Megiddo (kibbutz)|Kibbutz Megiddo]] is nearby, less than {{convert|1|km}} to the south. Today, [[Megiddo Junction]] is on the [[highway 65 (Israel)|main road]] connecting the center of Israel with lower [[Galilee]] and the north. It lies at the northern entrance to [[Wadi Ara]], an important mountain pass connecting the Jezreel Valley with Israel's coastal plain.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Graham, ''Megiddo'', (Lutterworth press, 1986), pg 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, during [[Pope Paul VI]]'s visit to the [[Holy Land]], Megiddo was the site where he met with Israeli dignitaries, including Israeli President [[Zalman Shazar]] and Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://megiddo.tau.ac.il/history.html History of Megiddo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530163848/http://megiddo.tau.ac.il/history.html |date=2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battles==
Famous battles include:
* [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BCE)]]: fought between the armies of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Thutmose III]] and a large [[Canaan]]ite coalition led by the rulers of Megiddo and [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]].
* [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BCE)]]: fought between [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]] [[Necho II]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]], in which King [[Josiah]] fell.
* [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)]]: fought during [[World War I]] between Allied troops, led by General [[Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]], and the defending [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army.

==History of archaeological excavation==
Megiddo has been excavated three times and is currently being excavated yet again. The first excavations were carried out between 1903 and 1905 by [[Gottlieb Schumacher]] for the German Society for the Study of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Gottlieb; Watzinger, Carl (1908): ''[https://archive.org/details/tellelmutesellim01schuuoft  Tell el Mutesellim; Bericht über die 1903 bis 1905 mit Unterstützung SR. Majestät des deutschen Kaisers und der Deutschen Orientgesellschaft vom deutschen Verein zur Erforschung Palästinas Veranstalteten Ausgrabungen]'' Volume: 1&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques used were rudimentary by later standards and Schumacher's field notes and records were destroyed in [[World War I]] before being published. After the war, [[Carl Watzinger]] published the remaining available data from the dig.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, Gottlieb; Watzinger, Carl, 1877-1948, (1929): ''[https://archive.org/details/tellelmutesellim02schuuoft Tell el Mutesellim; Bericht über die 1903 bis 1905 mit Unterstützung SR. Majestät des deutschen Kaisers und der Deutschen Orientgesellschaft vom deutschen Verein zur Erforschung Palästinas Veranstalteten Ausgrabungen]'', vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, digging was resumed by the [[Oriental Institute of Chicago|Oriental Institute]] of the [[University of Chicago]], financed by [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], continuing until the outbreak of the Second World War. The work was led initially by [[Clarence Stanley Fisher|Clarence S. Fisher]], and later by [[P. L. O. Guy]], Robert Lamon, and Gordon Loud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oic4.pdf oi.uchigao.edu] Clarence S.

Final Report on the Stratum VI Excavations, Oriental Institute Publication 127, Oriental Institute of Chicago, 2004, {{ISBN|1-885923-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oriental Institute intended to completely excavate the whole tel, layer by layer, but money ran out before they could do so. Today excavators limit themselves to a square or a trench on the basis that they must leave something for future archaeologists with better techniques and methods. During these excavations it was discovered that there were around 8 levels of habitation, and many of the uncovered remains are preserved at the [[Rockefeller Museum]] in Jerusalem and the Oriental Institute of Chicago. The East Slope area of Megiddo was excavated to the bedrock
to serve as a spoil area. The full results of that excavation were not published until decades later.

[[Yigael Yadin]] conducted excavations in 1960, 1966, 1967, and 1971 for the [[Hebrew University]].&lt;ref&gt;Yigael Yadin, "New Light on Solomon's Megiddo," ''Biblical Archaeology'', vol. 23, pp. 62–68, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yigael Yadin, "Megiddo of the Kings of Israel," ''Biblical Archaeology'', vol. 33, pp. 66–96, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The formal results of those digs were published by Anabel Zarzecki-Peleg in Hebrew University's monograph 2016 ''Qedem'' 56.

Megiddo has most recently (since 1994) been the subject of biannual excavation campaigns conducted by the Megiddo Expedition of [[Tel Aviv University]], currently co-directed by [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[David Ussishkin]], with [[Eric H. Cline]] of [[The George Washington University]] serving as Associate Director (USA), together with a consortium of international universities.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Finkelstein, David Ussishkin and Baruch Halpern (eds.), ''Megiddo III: The 1992–1996 Seasons'', Tel Aviv University, 2000, {{ISBN|965-266-013-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel Finkelstein, David Ussishkin and Baruch Halpern (eds.), ''Megiddo IV: The 1998–2002 Seasons'', Tel Aviv University, 2006, {{ISBN|965-266-022-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable feature of the dig is close on-site co-operation between archaeologists and specialist scientists, with detailed chemical analysis being performed at the dig itself using a field [[infrared spectrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;Haim Watzman (2010), [http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101130/full/468614a.html Chemists help archaeologists to probe biblical history], ''Nature'', '''468''' 614–615. {{doi|10.1038/468614a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Jezreel Valley Regional Project, directed by Matthew J. Adams of [[Bucknell University]] in cooperation with the Megiddo Expedition, undertook excavations of the eastern extension of the Early Bronze Age town of Megiddo, at the site known as Tel Megiddo (East).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/ancient-israel/early-bronze-age-megiddos-great-temple-and-the-birth-of-urban-culture-in-the-levant/|title=Early Bronze Age: Megiddo's Great Temple and the Birth of Urban Culture in the Levant - Biblical Archaeology Society|date=9 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological features==
A path leads up through a Solomonic gateway overlooking the excavations of the Oriental Institute. A solid circular stone structure has been interpreted as an altar or a high place from the Canaanite period. Further on is a grain pit from the Israelite period for storing provisions in case of siege; the stables, originally thought to date from the time of Solomon but now dated a century and a half later to the time of [[Ahab]]; and a water system consisting of a square shaft {{convert|35|m|ft|0}} deep, the bottom of which opens into a tunnel bored through rock for {{convert|100|m|ft|-1}} to a pool of water.

===The Great Temple===
[[File:Tell Megiddo - 4.2006 -36.JPG|thumb|right|Circular [[altar]]-like shrine from the Early Bronze Age]]

Megiddo's 5,000 year old "Great Temple", dated to the Early Bronze Age I (3500–3100 BCE), has been described by its excavators as "the most monumental single edifice so far uncovered in the EB I Levant and ranks among the largest structures of its time in the Near East."&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Noah. "[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/ancient-israel/early-bronze-age-megiddos-great-temple-and-the-birth-of-urban-culture-in-the-levant/ Early Bronze Age: Megiddo's Great Temple and the Birth of Urban Culture in the Levant]" ''Bible History Daily'', Biblical Archaeology Society, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure includes an immense, 47.5 by 22 meters sanctuary. The temple is more than ten times larger than the typical temple of that era. The first wall was constructed in the Early [[Bronze Age]] II or III period. It was determined that the temple was the site of ritual animal sacrifice. Corridors were used as ''favissae'' (deposits of cultic artifacts) to store bones after ritual sacrifice. More than 80% of the animal remains were of young sheep and goats; the rest were cattle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/archaeology/.premium-1.618583 5,000-year Old Megiddo Temple Yields Evidence of Industrial Animal Sacrifice] Haaretz, October 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewelry===
{{main|Megiddo Treasure}}
In 2010, a collection of jewelry pieces was found in a ceramic jug &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalscientia.com/article/asia-middle-east/education-culture/unique-gold-earring-found-intriguing-collection-ancient Unique Gold Earring Found in Intriguing Collection of Ancient Jewelry at Tel Megiddo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/20463-gold-egyptian-earring-israel.html|title=Gold Egyptian Earring Found in Israel|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jewelry dates to around 1100 BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/megiddo-dig-unearths-cache-of-buried-canaanite-treasure.premium-1.431797|title=Megiddo Dig Unearths Cache of Buried Canaanite Treasure|first=Nir|last=Hasson|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes beads made of [[carnelian]] stone, a ring and earrings. The jug was subjected to molecular analysis to determine the contents. The collection was probably owned by a wealthy Canaanite family, likely belonging to the ruling elite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/154313585.html Trove of 3,000-year-old jewelry found in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Megiddo ivories===
The Megiddo ivories are thin carvings in [[ivory]] found at Tel Megiddo, the majority excavated by Gordon Loud. The ivories are on display at the Oriental Institute of Chicago and the [[Rockefeller Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]]. They were found in the stratum VIIA, or Late Bronze Age layer of the site. Carved from [[hippopotamus]] [[incisor]]s from the [[Nile]], they show Egyptian stylistic influence. An ivory pen case was found inscribed with the [[cartouche]] of [[Ramses III]].

===Megiddo stables===
[[File:Tell Megiddo Preservation 2009 037.JPG|thumb|Southern stables]]
[[File:JPF-TelMegiddo.JPG|thumb|Northern stables]]
At Megiddo two stable complexes were excavated from Stratum IVA, one in the north and one in the south. The southern complex contained five structures built around a lime paved courtyard. The buildings themselves were divided into three sections. Two long stone paved aisles were built adjacent to a main corridor paved with lime. The buildings were about twenty-one meters long by eleven meters wide. Separating the main corridor from outside aisles was a series of stone pillars. Holes were bored into many of these pillars so that horses could be tied to them. Also, the remains of stone mangers were found in the buildings. These mangers were placed between the pillars to feed the horses. It is suggested that each side could hold fifteen horses, giving each building an overall capacity of thirty horses. The buildings on the northern side of the city were similar in their construction. However, there was no central courtyard. The capacity of the northern buildings was about three hundred horses altogether. Both complexes could hold from 450–480 horses combined.

The buildings were found during excavations between 1927 and 1934. The head excavator originally interpreted the buildings as stables. Since then his conclusions have been challenged by [[James B. Pritchard|James Pritchard]], Dr Adrian Curtis of Manchester University [[Ze'ev Herzog]], and [[Yohanan Aharoni]], who suggest they were storehouses, marketplaces or barracks.&lt;ref&gt;Amihai Mazar, ''Archaeology of the Land of the Bible'' (New York: Doubleday, 1992), 476–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Megiddo church==
{{main|Megiddo church (Israel)}}
The Megiddo church is not on the tell of Megiddo, but nearby next to [[Megiddo Junction]] inside the precinct of the [[Israel Prison Service|Megiddo Prison]]. It was built within the ancient city of [[Legio]] and is believed to date to the 3rd century, which would make it one of the oldest churches in the world.

'''''The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld''''' is an American [[non-fiction]] book by [[Herbert Asbury]], first published in 1927 by Garden City Publishing Company.

==Description==
{{Further|List of identities in The Gangs of New York (book)}}
The book details the rise and fall of 19th century [[gang]]s in [[New York City]], prior to the domination of the [[Italian-American Mafia]] during [[Prohibition]] in the 1920s. Focusing on the saloon halls, gambling dens, and winding alleys of the [[Bowery]] and the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] district of [[Lower Manhattan]], the book evokes the destitution and violence of a turbulent era, when colorfully named criminals like "Dandy" [[Johnny Dolan]], [[William Poole]] (also known as Bill the Butcher), and [[Hell-Cat Maggie]] lurked in the shadows, and infamous gangs including the [[Plug Uglies]], [[Dead Rabbits]], and [[Bowery Boys]] ruled the streets.

{{for|the class of words|Profanity}}
'''Vulgarity''' is the quality of being common, coarse, or unrefined.  This judgement may refer to [[language]], [[visual art]], [[social class]]es, or [[social climber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bayley claims it can never be [[self-referential]] because, to be aware of vulgarity is to display a degree of [[sophistication]] which thereby elevates the subject above the [[:wikt:vulgar|vulgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/4/4/298 |title=Vulgarity |author=John Bayley |journal=The British Journal of Aesthetics |year=1964 |volume=4 |pages=298–304 |doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/4.4.298 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, "vulgar" simply described the common language or vernacular of a country.  From the mid-seventeenth century onward, it began to take on a pejorative aspect: "having a common and offensively mean character, coarsely commonplace; lacking in refinement or good taste; uncultured; ill bred".  In the Victorian age, vulgarity broadly described many sorts of activity, such as wearing ostentatious clothing, and other similarly subtle aspects of behavior.  In a [[George Eliot]] novel, one character could be vulgar for talking about money, a second because he criticizes the first for doing so, and a third for being fooled by the excessive refinement of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|pages=1–10|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In language, the effort to avoid vulgarity could leave characters at a loss for words.  In [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Beauchamp's Career]]'', an heiress does not wish to make the commonplace statement that she is "engaged", nor "betrothed", "affianced", or "plighted".  Though such words are not vulgarity in the vulgar sense, they nonetheless could stigmatize the user as a member of a socially inferior class. Even favored euphemisms such as ''[[toilet]]'' eventually become stigmatized like the words they replace, and currently favored words serve as a sort of "[[cultural capital]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|page=17|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Vulgarity, or vulgar speech or language, can refer to language which is offensive or [[Obscenity|obscene]], [[synonym]]ous with the 'general' meaning of [[profanity]].

The word most associated with the verbal form of vulgarity is "cursing." However, there are many subsections of vulgar words. In the book, "Cursing in America" by Timothy Jay, Jay makes a classification of the "dirty words" because it "allows people interested in language to define the different types of reference or meaning that dirty words employ. One can see that what is considered  taboo or obscene revolves around a few dimensions of human experience that there is a logic behind dirty word usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most commonly used vulgar terms in the English language is ''fuck''.&lt;ref&gt;Blomquist, Robert F. "The F-Word: A Jurisprudential Taxonomy of American Morals (In a Nutshell)." Santa Clara L. Rev. 40 (1999): 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cursing ===
Curse words, or cursing, have been recognized by religious organizations as being able to cause actual mental and physical harm. More recently such words have separated themselves from their religious meanings, and it is doubtful that those who use curse words imagine the words will bring actual mental or physical harm. Both parties are aware that the cursing is simply an expression, and the ones receiving the curse words or phrase are aware they are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Examples ====
Religious curses may include "Damn you", "God damn you", "To hell with you". Cursing also includes non-religious expressions, like "Fuck you" or "Eat shit and die".

=== Profanity ===
Profanity are words that are considered hateful or contemptuous, especially in regard to religion. 

For a word or phrase to be profane it must not be religious or function outside the duties of religious belief. To be profane means for the word or phrase to be ignorant or hateful towards the rules of religions. Examples of profanity are words or a phrase not meant to belittle Gods, their religions, but situated on the ignorance and indifference to such points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
