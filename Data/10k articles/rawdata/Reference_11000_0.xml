Hines|Hines]], Pontiac Land Group and [[Goldman Sachs]], located in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]] adjacent to The [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name=SkyP /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; The building had been in development since 2006, and construction began in late 2014.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; It was topped out in April 2018. {{As of|2018}}, 53W53 is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|seventh-tallest building in the city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amny.com/real-estate/tallest-buildings-in-nyc-1.9216740|title=12 tallest skyscrapers in New York City|work=am New York|access-date=October 17, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The building, designed by [[Jean Nouvel]], initially was proposed to stand 1,250 feet (381 m) tall (the same height as the [[Empire State Building]] below its mast).&lt;ref name="SkyP"/&gt; The mid-block building had run into considerable opposition focusing on fears that it would cast a shadow over [[Central Park]] during the winter and that its mid-block location would create traffic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lizkrueger.com/testimony/momaNovember08.html|title=New York State Senator Liz Krueger -Before the Department of City Planning Regarding the Environmental Impact Statement Draft Scope of Work&amp;nbsp;for the 53 West 53rd Street Project|work=lizkrueger.com|accessdate=28 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202100/http://www.lizkrueger.com/testimony/momaNovember08.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financing had been scarce&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/arts/design/21ouro.html It Was Fun Till the Money Ran Out - New York Times - December 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; until October 2013, when the [[Kwee brothers]]' Pontiac Land agreed to provide $200 million in equity, supported by an $860 million loan from a consortium of Asian banks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-29/nyc-museum-of-modern-art-condos-get-singapore-investor NYC Museum of Modern Art Condos Get Singapore Investor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building bought [[air rights]] from the [[University Club of New York]] and [[Saint Thomas Church (New York City)|St. Thomas Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?p=4447310|title=NEW YORK - 53W53 (Tower Verre) - 1,050 FT / 320 M -  73 FLOORS - Page 48 - SkyscraperPage Forum|work=skyscraperpage.com|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 2009, the [[New York City Department of City Planning|New York City Planning Commission]] said the building could be built if {{convert|200|ft|m}} were clipped off the top.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/arts/design/10building.html Off With Its Top!

The {{convert|1050|ft|m|adj=on}} version was approved by the City Council on October 28, 2009 in a 44-3 vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gothamist.com/2009/10/28/will_there_be_a_monster_stall_for_m.php Will There Be A Monster Stall For MoMA Tower? - gothamist.com - October 28, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417235005/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/28/will_there_be_a_monster_stall_for_m.php |date=April 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, the air rights were purchased from MOMA and the building became known as 53W53.&lt;ref name=53W53 /&gt;

==Usage==
The building will be mixed-use, with gallery space, condominiums, and a private restaurant. There will be 145 residences, from one to five bedroom options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.53w53.com/availability|title=Availability|publisher=53W53|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One bedroom residences will begin at $3 million and the top floor duplex penthouse is priced at over $80 million.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt;

==Amenities==
Residents will be given special privileges at MoMA, including unlimited free admission to the museum, exhibition previews, discounts in MoMA stores, and access to film screenings.&lt;ref name=curbedperk/&gt; The building will also include a private formal dining room, priority access to an in-building restaurant, a library with a fireplace, a children's playroom, a wine tasting room and a lounge with Central Park views available for events. Services available for a fee will include a pantry stocking service, a housekeeping service, and pet walking.&lt;ref name=curbedperk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2015/06/18/multimilliondollar_moma_condos_come_with_museum_perks.php|title=Multimillion-Dollar MoMA Condos Come With Museum Perks|last=Budin|first=Jeremiah|date=18 June 2015|publisher=Curbed|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.53w53.com/amenities 53 W. 53rd Amenities]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ancient Records of Egypt''''' is a five-volume work by [[James Henry Breasted]], published in 1906, in which the author has attempted to translate and publish ''all'' of the ancient written records of Egyptian history which had survived to the time of his work at the start of the twentieth century.  (Breasted notes that his work covers only ancient “historical documents”, and generally does not include ancient Egyptian literature, religious writings, or texts on science, mathematics, or medicine.)&lt;ref name="v1"/&gt;{{rp|xii}}

It was part of a proposed three-part set of translations of original texts by different authors, which at the time were difficult to find:

* History of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (five volumes)
* History of [[Assyria]] (two volumes)
* History of [[Mesopotamia]]

Only the first two collections — those from Egypt and Assyria — were published.

The '''''Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland''''' ({{lang-ga|Annála Ríoghachta Éireann}}) or the '''''Annals of the Four Masters''''' (''Annála na gCeithre Máistrí'') are [[chronicle]]s of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Irish history. The entries span from the [[Flood myth|Deluge]], dated as 2,242 [[Anno Mundi|years after creation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005A/text001.html The Age of the World, to this Year of the Deluge, 2242], in ''Corpus of Electronic Texts'' translation.&lt;/ref&gt; to AD 1616.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005F/text024.html The Age of Christ, one thousand six hundred sixteen], in ''Corpus of Electronic Texts'' translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication delay==
Due to the criticisms by Irish historian [[Tuileagna Ó Maol Chonaire]], the text was not published in the lifetime of any of the participants.

==Text==
The annals are mainly a compilation of earlier annals, although there is some original work. They were compiled between 1632 and 1636 at a [[Franciscan]] [[friary]] near the [[Drowes river]] in [[County Leitrim]], on the border with [[County Donegal]] and [[County Sligo]]. The patron of the project was [[Fearghal Ó Gadhra]], [[Member of Parliament|M.P.]], a [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] lord in [[Coolavin]], County Sligo.

The chief compiler of the annals was [[Brother (Catholic)|Brother]] [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]] from [[Ballyshannon]], who was assisted by, among others, [[Cú Choigcríche Ó Cléirigh]], [[Fearfeasa Ó Maol Chonaire]] and [[Peregrine Ó Duibhgeannain]]. Although only one of the authors, Mícheál Ó Cléirigh, was a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], they became known as 'The Four Friars' or in the original Irish, ''Na Ceithre Máistrí''. The Anglicized version of this was "The Four Masters", the name that has become associated with the annals themselves.

The annals are written in Irish. The several manuscript copies are held at [[Trinity College Dublin]], the [[Royal Irish Academy]], [[University College Dublin]] and the [[National Library of Ireland]].

==Translation==
The first substantial English translation (starting at AD 1171) was published by [[Owen Connellan]] in 1846. The Connellan translation included the annals from the eleventh to the seventeenth centuries.  The only version to have a four-colour frontispiece, it included a large folding map showing the location of families in Ireland. This edition, neglected for over 150 years, was republished in the early twenty-first century. The original Connellan translation was followed several years later by a full translation by the historian [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]]. The translation was funded by a government grant of £1,000 obtained by the notable mathematician [[Sir William Rowan Hamilton]] while he was president of the [[Royal Irish Academy]].

The Annals are one of the principal Irish-language sources for Irish history up to 1616. While many of the early chapters are essentially lists of names and dates, the later chapters, dealing with events of which the authors had first-hand accounts, are much more detailed.

==Importance==
{{POV-section|date=February 2014}}{{Section OR|date=February 2014}} 
The reliability and usefulness of the ''Annals'' as a historical source has sometimes been questioned on the grounds that they were limited to accounts of the births, deaths and activities of the [[Gaelic nobility of Ireland]] and often ignore wider social trends or events.

On the other hand, the ''Annals'', as one of the few prose sources in Irish from this period, also provide a valuable insight into events such as the [[Desmond Rebellions]] and the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] from a Gaelic Irish perspective.

The early part of this work is based upon the Lebor Gabala.  Today, most scholars regard the Lebor Gabála as primarily myth rather than history. It appears to be mostly based on medieval Christian pseudo-histories, but it also incorporates some of Ireland's native pagan mythology. Scholars believe the goal of its writers was to provide an epic history for Ireland that could compare to that of the Israelites or the Romans, and which reconciled native myth with the Christian view of history.] It is suggested, for example, that there are six 'takings' to match the "Six Ages of the World" Lebor Gabála Érenn is also considered a "highly influential Middle Irish prose-and-verse treatise [...] written in order to bridge the chasm between Christian world-chronology and the prehistory of Ireland".

An '''apostolic exhortation''' is a type of communication from the [[Pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It encourages a community of people to undertake a particular activity but does not define Church [[doctrine]]. It is considered lower in formal authority than a [[papal encyclical]], but higher than other [[ecclesiastical letters]], Apostolic Letters and other papal writings.

Apostolic exhortations are commonly issued in response to an assembly of the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|Synod of Bishops]], in which case they are known as '''post-synodal apostolic exhortations'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18219">An '''automatic grenade launcher''' or '''grenade machine gun''' is a [[grenade launcher]] firing [[List of rifle cartridges|rounds]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=2944&lt;/ref&gt; in quick succession from an [[Belt (firearm)|ammunition belt]] or large-capacity [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]].&lt;ref name=CasrAgl2009-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=CasrAglCaswBackground2009-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tucker2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blasko2013/&gt;

These weapons are often mounted on vehicles or helicopters, as when these weapons are moved by infantry the weapon, its tripod, and ammunition, are a heavy load, requiring a small team of men.&lt;ref name=CasrAgl2009-08/&gt;
The [[Mark 19 Automatic Grenade Launcher]], first fielded by the Americans in 1966, and still widely used today, weighs 62.5 kg, when attached to its tripod, and loaded with a box of ammunition.&lt;ref name=CasrAglCaswBackground2009-08/&gt;
The popular Mark 19 is capable of indirect fire to 2,200 metres, an indirect fire role traditionally reserved for mortars.  Even though the round carries less explosive than a 60mm mortar shell, this is thought to be counterbalanced by its much higher volume of fire.

The most popular caliber for automatic grenade launchers in the west has been 40mm.&lt;ref name=CasrAgl2009-08/&gt;&lt;ref name="CasrAglCaswBackground2009-08"/&gt;  The [[Soviet Union]] successfully fielded a 30mm grenade launcher, the [[AGS-17]] during [[Soviet occupation of Afghanistan|its war in Afghanistan]], in 2002, [[Russia]] introduced a successor weapon, the [[AGS-30]], and in 2017, [[AGS-40 Balkan]].&lt;ref name=Ags/&gt;  Traditional munitions for automatic grenade launchers include [[high explosive]], fragmentation, and [[shaped charge]] for attacking light armored vehicles. Less lethal rounds, like tear gas and sponge rounds, for crowd control, have also been made.  In the 21st century, AGLs have been made with integrated sight/range systems which can set a fused round to detonate precisely on, above, or behind a designated target.&lt;ref name=Ags/&gt;&lt;ref name=Usa2009/&gt;  

Different weapons use different methods of operation, with ''"[[blowback (firearms)|blowback]]"'' and ''"[[long recoil]]"'' being two popular choices.&lt;ref name=CasrAgl2009-08/&gt;  In all these weapons the energy released by firing a round loads the next round into the weapon's breech.  The popular Mark 19 is automatically reloaded through the blowback method, where expanding gases blow back the firing bolt.

In the long recoil method the bolt is fixed to the firing chamber, and the whole firing chamber is blown back.  These weapons are slightly less accurate, but weigh less than blowback weapons.&lt;ref name=CasrAglCaswLongRecoil2009-08/&gt;
[[General Dynamics]] manufactures a long recoil weapon, the [[Mark 47 Automatic Grenade Launcher]], as does the Spanish firm [[Santa Bárbara Sistemas|Santa Bárbara]].  The [[LAG-40]] manufactured by Santa Bárbara has a relatively low rate of fire -- 215 rounds per minute.

| quote       = The long recoil operating system’s obvious advantage is the compact gun body.  While this compensates for the weapon’s  internal complications, that moving barrel might also result in first-round aiming inaccuracies. The AGL designers are willing to overlook this in exchange for reduced weight (in comparison to a blowback design) and for the portability inherent in a smaller weapon (even if weight reduction is modest). In any case, great accuracy is not the forte of the AGLs.

The '''''British Pharmacopoeia''''' ('''BP''') is the national [[pharmacopoeia]] of the [[United Kingdom]].  It is an annually published collection of quality standards for UK [[drug|medicinal]] substances.  It is used by individuals and [[List of pharmaceutical companies|organisations]] involved in [[Pharmaceutical sciences|pharmaceutical research]], [[Drug development|development]], [[pharmaceutical manufacturing|manufacture]] and [[Phases of clinical research|testing]].

Pharmacopoeial standards are publicly available and legally enforceable standards of quality for medicinal products and their constituents.  The ''British Pharmacopoeia'' is an important statutory component in the control of medicines which complements and assists the licensing and inspection processes of the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) of the United Kingdom.  Together with the ''[[British National Formulary]]'' (BNF), the ''British Pharmacopoeia'' defines the UK's pharmaceutical standards.

Pharmacopoeial standards are compliance requirements; that is, they provide the means for an independent judgement as to the overall quality of an article, and apply throughout the shelf-life of a product.  Inclusion of a substance in a pharmacopoeia does not indicate that it is either safe or effective for the treatment of any disease.

==Legal basis==
The ''British Pharmacopoeia'' is published on behalf of the [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Ministers of the United Kingdom]]; on the recommendation of the [[Commission on Human Medicines]], in accordance with section 99(6) of the [[Medicines Act 1968]], and notified in draft to the [[European Commission]] (EC) in accordance with [[Directive 98/34/EEC]].

The [[monograph]]s of the [[European Pharmacopoeia]] (as amended by Supplements published by the [[Council of Europe]]) are reproduced either in the ''British Pharmacopoeia'', or in the associated edition of the ''British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary)''.

In the pharmacopoeia, certain drugs and preparations are included regardless of the existence of actual or potential [[patent]] [[Exclusive right|rights]].  Where substances are protected by [[letters patent]], their inclusion in the pharmacopoeia neither conveys, nor implies, license to manufacture.

==History==
The regulation of medicinal products by officials in the United Kingdom dates back to the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] (1491–1547).  The [[Royal College of Physicians]] of London had the power to inspect [[Apothecary|apothecaries’]] products in the London area, and to destroy defective stock.  The first list of approved drugs, with information on how they should be prepared, was the ''London Pharmacopoeia'', published in 1618.  The first edition of what is now known as the ''British Pharmacopoeia'' was published in 1864, and was one of the first attempts to harmonise pharmaceutical standards, through the merger of the ''London'', ''Edinburgh'' and ''Dublin Pharmacopoeias''.  The [[New Latin]] name that had some currency at the time was ''Pharmacopoeia Britannica'' (Ph. Br.).

A commission was first appointed by the [[General Medical Council]] (GMC), when the body was made statutorily responsible under the [[Medical Act 1858]] for producing a British pharmacopoeia on a national basis.  In 1907, the ''British Pharmacopoeia'' was supplemented by the ''[[British Pharmaceutical Codex]]'', which gave information on drugs and other pharmaceutical substances not included in the ''BP'', and provided standards for these.

The [[Medicines Act 1968]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/67/contents|title=Medicines Act 1968|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; established the legal status of the British Pharmacopoeia Commission, and of the ''British Pharmacopoeia'', as the UK standard for medicinal products under section 4 of the Act.  The British Pharmacopoeia Commission continues the work of the earlier Commissions appointed by the GMC, and is responsible for preparing new editions of the ''British Pharmacopoeia'' and the ''British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary)'', and for keeping them up to date.  Under Section 100 of the Medicines Act, the British Pharmacopoeia Commission is also responsible for selecting and devising [[British Approved Name]]s (BANs )(see [[#British Approved Names]]).

Since its first publication back in 1864, the distribution of the ''British Pharmacopoeia'' has grown throughout the world.  It is now used in over 100 countries.  Australia and Canada are two of the countries that have adopted the ''BP'' as their national standard alongside the UK; in other countries, e.g. [[Republic of Korea|South Korea]], the ''BP'' is recognised as an acceptable reference standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/quality_assurance/resources/InternationalMeetingWorldPharmacopoeias_QAS13-512Rev1_25032013.pdf|title=Review of World Pharmacopoeias|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The current edition of the ''British Pharmacopoeia'' comprises six volumes, which contain nearly 3,000 monographs for drug substances, [[excipient]]s, and formulated preparation, together with supporting general notices, appendices (test methods, [[reagent]]s etc.), and reference spectra, used in the practice of [[medicine]], all comprehensively indexed and cross-referenced for easy reference.  Items used exclusively in [[veterinary medicine]] in the UK are included in the ''BP (Veterinary)''.

The ''British Pharmacopoeia'' is available as a printed volume and electronically in both on-line and [[CD-ROM]] versions; the electronic products use sophisticated search techniques to locate information quickly.  For example, [[pharmacist]]s referring to a monograph can immediately link to other related substances and appendices referenced in the content by using 130,000+ hypertext links within the text.

==Production==
The ''British Pharmacopoeia'' is prepared by the Pharmacopoeial Secretariat, working in collaboration with the British Pharmacopoeia Laboratory, the British Pharmacopoeia Commission (BPC), and its Expert Advisory Groups (EAG) and Advisory Panels.  The development of pharmacopoeial standards receives input from relevant industries, [[hospital]]s, academia, professional bodies and governmental sources, both within and outside the UK.

The British Pharmacopoeia Laboratory provides analytical and technical support to the ''British Pharmacopoeia''.  Its major functions are:
*Development of new pharmacopoeial monographs: the laboratory undertakes the development and validation of qualitative and quantitative test methods for new BP monograph specifications, and refines and revalidates test methods for existing British Pharmacopoeia monographs.
*British Pharmacopoeia Chemical Reference Substances (BPCRS): the laboratory is responsible for the procurement, establishment, maintenance and sale of BPCRS.  The catalogue currently contains nearly 500 BPCRS, which are needed as standards for monograph tests in both the ''British Pharmacopoeia'' and the ''British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary)''.
*A new website for the British Pharmacopoeia Commission opened in 2008.

The current edition of the ''British Pharmacopoeia'' is available from [[The Stationery Office|The Stationery Office Bookshop]].

==Guidance==
Detailed information and guidance on various aspects of current pharmacopoeial policy and practice is provided in supplementary chapters of the ''British Pharmacopoeia''.  This includes explanation of the basis of pharmacopoeial specifications, and information on the development of monographs including guidance to manufacturers.

==British Approved Names==
{{Main|British Approved Name}}
[[British Approved Name]]s (BANs) are devised or selected by the British Pharmacopoeia Commission (BPC), and published by the Health Ministers, on the recommendation of the Commission on Human Medicines, to provide a list of names of substances or articles referred to in Section 100 of the [[Medicines Act 1968]].  BANs are short, distinctive names, for substances; where the systematic chemical or other scientific names are too complex for convenient general use.

As a consequence of [[Directive 2001/83/EC]], as amended, the British Approved Names, since 2002, may be assumed to be the [[recommended International Non-proprietary Name]] (rINN), except where otherwise stated.  A [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) [http://www.WHO.int/medicines/services/inn/en/ INN] identifies a pharmaceutical substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient by a unique name that is globally recognised, and in which no party can claim any proprietary rights.  A non-proprietary name is also known as a [[generic drug|generic name]].

==Related publications==
There are equivalent pharmacopoeia in many other countries, such as U.S. (the ''[[United States Pharmacopoeia]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usp.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Japan (''[[Japanese Pharmacopoeia]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpdb.nihs.go.jp/jp14e/]&lt;/ref&gt; and China (''[[Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China]]''), and the [[World Health Organization]] maintains ''[[The International Pharmacopoeia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/phint/en/p/about/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[British National Formulary]]'' (BNF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnf.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and its related publications contains information on prescribing, indications, side effects and costs of all medication drugs available on the [[National Health Service]] (NHS).

'''Sir Byron Edmund Walker''', [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] (14 October 1848 – 27 March 1924) was a Canadian banker. He was the president of the [[Canadian Bank of Commerce]] from 1907 to 1924, and a generous patron of the arts, helping to found and nurture many of Canada's cultural and educational institutions, including the [[University of Toronto]], [[National Gallery of Canada]], the [[Champlain Society]], [[Appleby College]], [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] and [[Royal Ontario Museum]].&lt;ref name="Marshall.thesis"&gt;

Marshall, Barbara Ruth. [https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/34424/UBC_1971_A8%20M37.pdf?sequence=1 Sir Edmond Walker, Servant of Canada (thesis)], Department of History, [[University of British Columbia]], June 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] [[knight]]ed Walker for his contributions to business and the arts.

== Early years ==
Byron Edmund Walker was born on 14 October 1848 on the outskirts of [[Caledonia, Ontario|Caledonia]] in [[Haldimand County, Ontario#Historic townships|Seneca Township]], [[Haldimand|Haldimand County]], [[Canada West]].&lt;ref name="Marshall.thesis" /&gt;

His grandfather, Thomas Walker, had been a manufacturer of watchcases in [[London]], [[England]]. He arrived in [[Upper Canada]] (now [[Ontario]]) in 1834 with four of his children, some books and some pictures. The loss of his wife and four of his children contributed heavily to his decision to leave London for Canada. The third youngest child was Alfred Edmund Walker, Sir Edmund's father, a farmer who became a clerk. He was also an amateur naturalist, paleontologist and watercolour painter. Alfred Edmund married Fanny Murton of [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] in 1845. Fanny's parents also were immigrants from England, having arrived in 1832. Her father, William Murton, was college educated and her mother spoke Italian and French and played the harpsichord. She also ran a private junior school in Hamilton.

The Walkers had nine children of which Byron Edmund (or Edmund, as he preferred to be called) was the second oldest. The family moved from their farm near Caledonia, to Hamilton in 1852. There, at the age of four, Edmund began studies at his grandmother's school and then at the [[Hamilton Central School]] where he completed all six grades. He hoped to pursue a teaching career but poor health curtailed his enrollment in the [[Ryerson Normal School|Toronto Normal School]], the teacher's college founded by [[Egerton Ryerson]] in 1851. At the age of 12, Walker entered the service of his uncle, John Walter Murton, who had a currency exchange business in Hamilton.

== Banking career ==

While working at his uncle's ''[[bureau de change]]'', Walker became an expert in recognizing counterfeit bills being circulated during the [[American Civil War]]. After seven years at his uncle's firm, he spent a few months in [[Montreal]] but poor health forced him to return to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] in 1868 where he began work as a discount clerk in the newly opened [[Canadian Bank of Commerce]].

The Canadian Bank of Commerce was established by industrialist [[William McMaster]] in 1867. McMaster would serve as a guiding light to the young Edmund, who quickly rose through the ranks. In 1872, he was appointed chief accountant at the bank's head office in [[Toronto]]. In May 1873, Walker was sent to [[New York City]] as junior agent for the bank. Charged with responsibility for loans of gold against currency, he successfully maintained proper margins in spite of his clients' many sudden bankruptcies. The enterprising Walker was then sent to the bank's [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] branch in 1875. In 1878, he was appointed manager of the London, Ontario branch, a year later was made inspector of the bank, and in 1880 he returned to Hamilton as manager.

Walker married Mary Alexander in 1874 while living in New York. Together they had four sons and three daughters. She was the daughter of Alexander Alexander, a carpenter who emigrated from Scotland to Lockport, New York, in 1834. That year, he married Isabella Buchan and moved to Hamilton, Ontario, where he became a green grocer. Together they had five children.

From 1881 to 1886, Edmund was again in New York as the bank's joint agent, giving him the opportunity to increase his talents in foreign exchange and to conduct international banking on a much larger scale. There he could expand his cultural interests, visiting galleries and museums, and beginning, in earnest, his art collection. In 1886, at age 38, Walker was recalled to Toronto as general manager of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. By then there were 30 branches in Ontario and agencies in Toronto, Montreal and New York. The bank's assets at its inception were $2,997,081; 50 years later, these were $440,310,703 with branches across the country, largely attributable to Walker's strong leadership.

Walker is known for developing the first set of written regulations for dividing a bank into a complex array of departments and is widely credited for the Canadian government's 1881/82 revision of the ''[[Bank Act (Canada)|Canada Banking Act]]'' that gave Canada a centralized, panic-proof banking system. Walker was also professionally respected internationally. As vice-president of the [[American Bankers Association]] he was invited by a U.S. congressional committee to advise on the drafting of the [[Federal Reserve]] legislation. He held many key national and international positions; chairman of the bankers' section of the [[Toronto Board of Trade]] from 1891–92; vice-president of the [[Canadian Bankers Association]] (which he helped found in 1891) in 1893 and its president from 1894–95; chairman of the 1899 Royal Commission on the financial position of the province of Ontario; and chairman of the Section of Money and Credit for the 1904 [[Universal Exposition]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. He was a fellow of the [[Institute of Bankers of England]] and fellow of the [[Royal Economic Society|Royal Economic Society of England]].

In 1906, he was elected director of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. He served as president from 1907 until his death in 1924.&lt;ref name="Marshall.thesis" /&gt;

== Political ties ==

The [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] government of Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] appointed Walker to the [[National Battlefields Commission]] in 1908. The commission was charged with the recovery of non-Crown land for a "Battlefields Park" in [[Quebec City]] where the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] was fought between [[France|French]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] forces. The commission was also charged with supervision of the expenditures of the Tercentenary Celebration of [[Samuel de Champlain]] founding Quebec in 1608. Later, Walker was made chairman of the Canadian committee of the Peace Centenary, an event planned by the Canadian, American and British governments to commemorate 100 years of peace between Canada and the United States following the [[War of 1812|War of 1812-14]].

Although Walker tried to stay out of active politics all his life and never joined a political party, he decided to take a pivotal role in the political arena with a group of 18 prominent businessmen who opposed the [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|Reciprocity Agreement]] with the United States proposed by the Laurier government. Walker feared that the giant American trusts, once allowed into Canada, would paralyze the Canadian market. Furthermore, as an ardent patriot and staunch [[imperialist]], he feared it would weaken Canada's ties with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and lead to annexation by the United States. The anti-reciprocity forces led to the defeat of Laurier's government in 1911. Walker was among those who advised the new [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], Sir [[Robert Borden]], on preserving the financial stability of Canada during the [[First World War]].

== Interests in education ==

Walker credited his father for developing his broad interests and love for learning, and always regretted that poor health prevented him from getting a formal education. He believed that the basis of a civilized society was its educational system and that a nation's universities were its most treasured institutions. Throughout his life he took an active interest in educational institutions. One of the first and most lasting of his interests was the [[University of Toronto]]. In 1887, the denominational institutions of [[Victoria University at the University of Toronto|Victoria College]] ([[Methodist]]), [[Knox College, University of Toronto|Knox College]] ([[Presbyterian]]), [[Wycliffe College]] ([[Anglican]] theological school), and [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]] ([[Roman Catholic]]) had entered into a federation with the secular [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]], the only one funded by the government. After fire destroyed the eastern portion of University College in 1890, Walker was instrumental in persuading the [[Ontario]] government to make its first grant to the amalgamated [[University of Toronto]].

He was also responsible for leading the last denominational college - [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], affiliated with the [[Church of England]] - into the federation in 1904. Trinity awarded him a [[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.) that same year. In 1905, he was a member of the Royal Commission on the reorganization of the university, which was responsible for securing annual government grants thereafter. Over the course of his 32-year involvement with the university, Walker served as [[trustee]] (1892–1906), [[senator]] (1893–1901), member of the [[Board of Governors]] (1906–10), chairman (1910–23) and chancellor (1923–24).

The [[Toronto Conservatory of Music]] also joined the university through his efforts. He served as a member of its Board of Governors, and later as president (1917–24). His support for music also included the [[Mendelssohn Choir]], for which he was honorary president (1900–24).

With a lasting commitment to education and the importance of Canadian history in nurturing patriotism and a Canadian identity, he founded [[Champlain Society|the Champlain Society]] in 1905. Established as a [[non-profit organization]], its mandate was to publish important documents relating to [[Canadian history]], projects that commercial publishers would consider unprofitable. He believed that this Society was his finest achievement. He served as its president until his death.

As an author of articles on a variety of subjects - banking, [[Robert Browning]], [[Italian art|Italian]] and [[Japanese art]] - it is not surprising that Walker would be one of the founders of the [[Canadian Society of Authors]], established to promote Canadian literature and protect authors with [[copyright]] laws. Walker served as president from 1904-09.

In 1911, Walker established [[Appleby College|Appleby School]], a boys' private boarding school, for which he purchased the initial {{convert|32|acre|m2|adj=on}} property in [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]].  The first headmaster of the school was Walker's son-in-law John Guest.

== A love of art ==

Through his years in [[New York City]] and early trips to [[Europe]] - including to [[London]] in 1887 and [[Italy]] in 1892 - Walker developed skills as an art connoisseur and collector, often lecturing on the subject. His collection of art was housed in his Toronto residence - "Long Garth" at 99 St. George Street. The [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] brick structure had fine wood interiors, [[Art Nouveau]] ceiling decorations by Gustav Hahn, and allegorical murals by [[George Agnew Reid]]. "Long Garth" became a treasure trove of etchings, prints, embroideries and oriental carpets, bronzes, brass and ivory work, porcelain china, not to mention his fossil collection and his extensive library. Walker had a particular fascination with printmaking and it was said that his expert eye for detail in detecting counterfeit banknotes aided his connoisseurship. Walker also was a member of the Japan Society of America and the most notable part of his collection, 1,070 Japanese woodblock prints, were bequeathed to the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] on his death. Equally of note is the collection of over 400 works of graphic art, ranging from the 15th to the 9th centuries, which he assembled between 1880 and 1924, including works by [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Rembrandt]]. His children gave the collection to the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in 1926.

Beyond purchasing some pictures by Canadian artists, Walker's first real connection with the Canadian art world began when he was approached by a number of prominent Toronto artists to help them organize a guild. With these like-minded laymen and artists who shared his ideals he formed the Toronto Guild of Civic Art. Spearheaded by [[George Agnew Reid]], the guild pressed for civic improvements in the city. Walker served as its first president in 1897. As the Guild's representative on the committee to select the artist for the monument to Lieutenant Governor [[John Graves Simcoe]] at Queen's Park, Walker was largely responsible for the commission being awarded to sculptor [[Walter Seymour Allward]]. Later, Walker was responsible for Allward's commissions to design the [[South African War Memorial (Toronto)|South African War Memorial]] on University Avenue in Toronto, as well as the [[Bell Telephone Memorial]] in Brantford.&lt;ref name="Marshall.thesis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Expositor-2009.12..27"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Art Gallery of Ontario ==

Walker's relationship with [[George Agnew Reid]] led to the founding of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]. On 15 March 1900, Reid, then president of the [[Ontario Society of Artists]], brought a group of citizens together to consider the formation of an art gallery for [[Toronto]]. At that meeting, a Provisional Art Museum Board was set in place with Walker as chairman and Reid as secretary. Through effective lobbying and fundraising ($5,000 each from 10 benefactors), the Ontario Legislature later that year passed a bill incorporating the Art Museum of Toronto. Walker became president of its [[Board of Trustees]] and served until his death.

The initial challenge was to find a home for the new institution. It was Walker who convinced his friends, writer Dr. [[Goldwin Smith]] and his wife, the former Mrs. [[William Henry Boulton]], to leave their historic house, "[[The Grange (Toronto)|The Grange]]," to the new museum. Before the news became public, Walker bought surrounding land so that the museum would have space for future expansion. The Art Museum of Toronto (later renamed the Art Gallery of Toronto and then the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]) officially opened its first galleries in The Grange in April 1913. In 1926, two years after his death, when the gallery was expanding, the Canadian Bank of Commerce donated the funds to build the magnificent room that bears his name, the ''Walker Court''.

== The Royal Ontario Museum ==

The campaign for a world-class public museum for [[Toronto]] was led by Walker, philanthropist Sir [[Edmund Boyd Osler (1845)|Edmund Boyd Osler]], then director of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and president of [[The Dominion Bank]], and Dr. [[Charles Trick Currelly]], the first curator of the [[Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology]]. An [[archaeologist]], Currelly had been doing fieldwork in [[Egypt]], [[Crete]] and [[Asia Minor]] for the purpose of collecting artifacts as a core collection for the small museum he established at [[Victoria University at the University of Toronto|Victoria College]] in 1907. But he wanted a larger museum for the university and others soon became involved. Walker, Osler and others provided funds and solicited financial support from the government.

Together, Osler and Walker created an organizational structure for the museum, including how funding was to be shared between the university and the government. In 1912, the ''Royal Ontario Museum Act'' was passed. A [[Board of Trustees]] was created, with appointments shared equally by university and government. Walker was its first chairman.

The [[Royal Ontario Museum]] opened on 19 March 1914. Currelly became director in 1914 until his retirement in 1946 and Walker remained chairman of the Board of Trustees until his death. In the ensuing years he contributed financially, and assisted through generous lines of credit from the Canadian Bank of Commerce, notably for Currelly's substantial acquisitions of Chinese artifacts. Walker's fossil collection became the nucleus of the museum's paleontology collection, and resulted in a dinosaur, ''[[Parasaurolophus|Parasaurolophus walkeri]]'', being named after him in 1922. His interest and support of [[paleontology]] had led to an earlier association with the [[Royal Canadian Institute]], another scientific institution of which he was president from 1898-1900.

== The National Gallery of Canada ==

At the first official exhibition of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]] on 6 March 1880, [[Governor General of Canada|Canada's Governor General]], the [[Marquis of Lorne]], established the [[National Gallery of Canada]] at the Clarendon Hotel in [[Ottawa]]. An Advisory Arts Council was formed in 1907 and consisted of Sir [[George Drummond]], president of the [[Bank of Montreal]], as chairman; the senator from [[Montreal]], [[Arthur Boyer]], as secretary; and Sir Edmund Walker, then just newly appointed president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, as member. The council was charged with advising the government on architecture and decoration of public buildings and public monuments. It was responsible for selecting and purchasing artworks for the collection. Drummond favoured the acquisition of European works while Walker was adamant that Canadian art be included. On Drummond's death in 1909, Walker became chairman of the council. Walker's influence as a print collector was crucial in launching the gallery's Prints and Drawings Department, which opened in 1911.

Another responsibility of the council was to advise on the Victoria Memorial Museum (Ottawa's present [[Canadian Museum of Nature|Natural History Museum]]), which opened in 1913. The same year the ''National Gallery of Canada Act'' was passed with an independent Board of Trustees constituted; Walker was appointed chairman and served until his death. Its trustees were charged, among other duties, with the development, encouragement and cultivation of "correct artistic taste in the fine arts." By 1924, this collection had over 4,000 items.

== Canada's "war pictures" ==

Walker was key in the creation of what today is the collection of [[First World War]] "war pictures" now housed in the [[Canadian War Museum]] in Ottawa. In 1915, the Canadian financier and expatriate, [[William Maxwell Aitken]] (later Baron Beaverbrook), was appointed the Canadian force's official records officer in England. Beaverbrook established the [[Canadian War Memorials Fund]] to record for posterity the events of that war. As both a member of the fund's committee and chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery, Walker insisted that the commissioned artists include Canadians, as well as the British artists Beaverbook proposed. By 1918, a large number of Canadian artists, among them [[A.Y. Jackson]] and [[Frederick Varley]], were in Europe sketching munitions factories and various theatres of operations where Canadians were active. Other artists, [[C.W. Jefferys]] among them, recorded the war effort at home in Canada. In 1921, the Beaverbrook-funded war collection was deposited with the National Gallery.

Walker also served on both the Canadian and British Commissions on War Records and Trophies, formed in 1918. In the Canadian plan, a gallery for the war pictures and a hall of trophies was to be built on [[Sussex Drive]] in [[Ottawa]]. Efforts to complete the building in 1922 and 1923 were unsuccessful and the paintings and trophies were loaned out. In 1971, the paintings were transferred from the National Gallery to the Canadian War Museum and now are displayed.

== Innisfree ==

For weekend retreats, Walker began to purchase land in 1890 at De Grassi Point in [[Innisfil, Ontario|Innisfil Township]], [[Simcoe County]]. "Innisfree," as his wife named it, became the centre of Walker's family life. There, he built "Broadeaves" designed by leading Canadian architect [[Frank Darling (architect)|Frank Darling]]. Darling was the architect of the [[University of Toronto]] and designed many buildings associated with Walker such as Convocation Hall and [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and the Canadian Bank of Commerce (now [[Commerce Court North]]) on King Street West in Toronto. In 1913-14, Walker built "Innisfree Farm" to further his interest in livestock husbandry. Innisfree was left in trust to his descendants as a private land trust. Managed today with the assistance of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources]], Innisfree is designated an [[Area of Natural and Scientific Interest]] for its prairie grassland and remnants of an old growth forest ecosystem.

== Last years ==

Sir Byron Edmund Walker left his imprint on the financial, artistic, and intellectual development of Canada. A wizard of finance, skilled in the intricacies of exchange and international business, he molded a tiny bank into a national institution and was largely responsible for overhauling the Canadian banking system. Simultaneously he established a wide range of cultural icons - the National Gallery of Canada, the collection of "war pictures" forming the nucleus of the Canadian War Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Royal Ontario Museum, the [http://www.champlainsociety.ca Champlain Society], the federation of colleges that became the [[University of Toronto]] - and many more. An amateur [[paleontologist]], he was also an author of note. He was [[knight]]ed by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], was a Knight of Grace of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem]], and [[Japan]] appointed him Honorary Japanese [[Consul-General]]. Walker died at the age of 75, on 27 March 1924. After his death, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' wrote this description of Walker:
"Possibly no more versatile Canadian existed in his day and age; probably few others have done so much for Canada."

==Legacy==

An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate Sir Byron Edmund Walker, C.V.O., LL.D., D.C.L. 1848-1924's role in Ontario's heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques_STU/Plaque_Simcoe38.html Ontario Plaque] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014105643/http://ontarioplaques.com/Plaques_STU/Plaque_Simcoe38.html |date=14 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Casca''''' is a series of paperback novels, and since January 2014, ebooks as well, created and written by author [[Barry Sadler]] in 1979. The stories revolve around the life of Casca Rufio Longinus, the soldier in the Roman legions who drove the [[Holy Lance]] into the side of [[Jesus Christ]] on [[Golgotha]], and (in the novels) who is doomed by Jesus to wander the Earth aimlessly, always as a soldier, until the [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming]]. The character is loosely based on the [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]] legend of Christianity.

Sadler wrote some of the early novels in the series while the others were assigned to ghostwriters. Two subsequent novels (''Casca 23: The Liberator'' and ''Casca 24: The Defiant'') were written by Paul Dengelegi. The current author, [[Tony Roberts (author)|Tony Roberts]], has written all the novels since 2006, excluding ''Casca 29: Immortal Dragon'' and ''Casca 33: The Outlaw'', which were written by Michael B. Goodwin. In April 2013, "Casca 29: Immortal Dragon" was removed from the list of books on casca.net due to alleged plagiarism, and shortly afterwards his other novel in the series, ''Casca 33: The Outlaw'', was removed for the same reason.  There is another story, in the form of an unauthorized audiobook, ''Casca: The Outcast'', which was written by Paul Dengelegi in 2004.

==Series overview==
Casca was first introduced in ''Casca 1: The Eternal Mercenary''. Little is known about his early life, although vague clues are given in various books in the series. He spent most of his adult life serving the Roman empire in the Legions, and there are some scraps of information about his family. He grew up in the hill country of Etruria, now known as Tuscany, to the north of Rome. The village name was Falerno.&lt;ref&gt;''Casca 15: The Pirate''&lt;/ref&gt; When he was a child, he saw the 10th Legion march through his village en route to Gaul. His uncle, Tontine, enlisted into the army under Julius Caesar. His family died of plague and the young Casca burned the family home afterward. He enlisted into the 7th Legion at either Messilia&lt;ref&gt;''Casca 2: God of Death''&lt;/ref&gt; or Livorno.&lt;ref&gt;''Casca 1: The Eternal Mercenary&lt;/ref&gt; His first battle under the eagle of the 7th was on the German border against the Suevii when 15,000 tribesmen attacked them at dawn. Only 300 made it back into the forests of Germania. He joined the 10th Legion and was sent to Jerusalem where he was assigned to the execution detail for three prisoners, amongst whom was Jesus.

At Golgotha, Casca stabbed Jesus with his spear, in an attempt to relieve Jesus of his pain and suffering. Jesus condemned Casca by saying, "Soldier, you are content with what you are. Then that you shall remain until we meet again. As I go now to My Father, you must one day come to Me." As Jesus died, blood from his wound trickled down Casca's spear and onto his hand, and Casca unknowingly tasted it after wiping sweat from his mouth, causing his body to convulse in pain. Casca did not initially understand what was happening to him until he was condemned to work in labor mines over a 30-year period. There he slowly discovered that he does not age and cannot be killed or seriously wounded. He learned that he is immortal, although he can feel all pain inflicted on his person. While his wounds heal completely, his body accumulates countless scars over the centuries.

Casca possesses an affinity for spoken languages. He can master most languages that he encounters, including their dialects, colloquialisms, and sub-tongues. Casca is also superbly skilled in edged weapons. He was first trained as a [[Roman Legionnaire]] with the [[Gladius|Gladius Iberius]] sword. He later improved those skills as a [[Gladiator]] in the [[Circus Maximus]].

Casca is easily recognizable by the long facial scar that he possesses. It runs from the side of his eye to his mouth in a crescent shape, giving him a permanent sneer. Casca acquired the scar while trying to short-change a local prostitute in the Holy Land. Over the years many onlookers assume that Casca received the wound while in battle; Casca just chuckles and thinks, "If they only knew."

Casca knew some of the most famous people throughout history, including:
* [[Jesus Christ]] - book 1
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] - book 3
* [[Heinrich Himmler]] - book 4
* [[Adolf Hitler]] - book 4
* [[Shapur II]] - book 6
* [[Attila the Hun]] - book 7

===Dr. Julius Goldman===
He was a surgeon in [[United States Army]] with the rank of Major, stationed at the 8th Field Hospital in [[Nha Trang]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. He first met Casca when the latter was brought into the hospital with multiple gunshot wounds and a large mortar shell fragment lodged in his skull and into his brain, which should have been fatal. Dr. Goldman discovered Casca's unusual healing properties and became his biographer and chronicler after hearing his story. He is often visited by Casca for updates on his life and experiences throughout the ages. Dr. Goldman later leaves the Army and establishes his own practice.

As Dr Goldman ages and reaches his mid-70s, he introduces Casca to Danny Landries, the son of his former army comrade, Colonel Bob Landries. Danny first meets Casca in book 34 (''Devil's Horseman'') and gradually takes over from Goldman as his biographer.

===The Brotherhood of the Lamb===
The Brotherhood of the Lamb is a fanatical religious sect and sworn enemy of Casca. It is run by an elder, who oversees the sect's hierarchy, the Inner Circle. The circle is composed of an elder and twelve other specially chosen brothers who run the militant religious organization. They preach force and power over traditional virtues of piety and compassion.

The Brotherhood was founded by Izram, a man who called himself the Thirteenth Disciple, in the wake of Jesus's death at the hands of Casca's spear thrust. He purchased the spear from some of Casca's comrades to be used as a relic and symbol for the events on Golgotha. Known as [[Holy Lance|"The Spear of Longinus"]], the sect worships the spear which forms the central focus at prayer times.

On the most holy of days in the Brotherhood's calendar, the sect recreates the crucifixion, right down to killing one of their blessed brethren who has been selected to act the part of Jesus. Another, usually the Elder, plays the part of Casca, dressed in Roman uniform, who executes "Jesus" with their holiest relic, the Spear of Longinus.

Izram went into the wilderness for forty days before a revelation came to him: Jesus said to Casca, "Soldier, you are content with what you are, so shall you be until we meet again". Therefore, he reasoned that when Jesus returned at the Second Coming he would meet Casca. The Brotherhood keeps Casca in their sights until that day; though they may hate Casca for his actions on Golgotha, they must not prevent him from meeting their Lord. Casca Longinus is their path back to Christ and they will stop at nothing in keeping their most hated enemy in their sights for all time. On occasions they inflict severe pain on Casca as punishment for his actions. Once, the Elder Dacort severed Casca's hand for daring to touch the Spear at their monastery in Asia. In ''Casca 6: The Persian'', Rasheed, a minor acolyte, arranges to have Casca burned at the stake, thinking it just punishment for spearing Jesus. In ''Casca 9: The Sentinel'', Elder Gregory murders Casca's adopted son, Demos, and his woman, Ireina, for which Casca crucifies Gregory to death. Casca was also a prisoner of the Brotherhood, in ''Casca 18: The Cursed'' and ''Casca 4: Panzer Soldier''. In ''Casca 28: The Avenger'' he kills Elder Thassus as part of his mission of vengeance.

In the novel ''Casca 35: Sword of the Brotherhood'', the [[Holy Lance|spear of Longinus]] is stolen by the [[Sassanid Persians]] and Casca is blackmailed into retrieving it.

Known Elders of The Brotherhood of the Lamb:
* Dacort - book 3
* [[Heinrich Himmler]] - book 4
* Imhept - book 6
* Gregory -book 9
* [[Hassan-i Sabbah|Hassan al-Sabah]] - book 13
* Father Mulcahy - book 18
* Thassus - book 28
* Janus - book 28

==The Longini==
In Casca 28 we are introduced to the Longini, a family that is created to protect Casca through his long life.  Unbeknown to the Eternal Mercenary, this family slowly grows and seeks to thwart the efforts of the Brotherhood.  We encounter them next in Casca 40 where Isabella Longini helps Casca during WWII, and again in Casca 42.  Unlike the common habit where when a woman marries a man and loses her maiden name, in all cases of marriage the union results in the family name of Longini being retained, thus preserving their identity to one another.

The '''Cayman Islands National Museum''' is a [[museum]] in the [[Cayman Islands]].  It is housed in the former Old Courts Building on Harbor Drive in [[George Town, Grand Cayman]]. The museum is dedicated to the preservation, research and display of all aspects of Caymanian heritage.
[[File:Cayman Islands National Museum - George Town, Grand Cayman.jpg|left|280px|Cayman Islands National Museum]]
Opened in 1990, the museum's beginnings can be traced to the 1930s when local resident Ira Thompson began collecting Caymanian artifacts as a hobby; in 1979, the government purchased Thompson's collection and it now encompasses a major portion of the museum's collection.  The museum contains over 8,000 items and artifacts ranging from coins to a 14-foot catboat. The Natural History Exhibit features a 3-dimensional map depicting the underwater geological formations that surround the Cayman Islands.

The '''Central and Eastern European Online Library''' (CEEOL) is a repository of full text indexed documents in the fields of Humanities and Social Science publications from and about [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. The collections include native language sources from and about Central, East and Southeast Europe´s humanities and social sciences in the form of journal articles, eBooks and [[Grey Literature]].

The subject areas include [[anthropology]], [[culture]] and [[society]], [[economy]], [[gender studies]], [[history]], [[Judaic studies]], [[fine arts]], [[literature]], [[linguistics]], [[political| political sciences]] and [[social sciences]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[law]]

Updated daily, the CEEOL coverage grows by approximately 4,000 newly included journal articles every month. A significant number of the included journals are represented with a complete archival collection. The CEEOL eBook collection development started in 2016 offering an ever-growing number of eBooks, as well as backlists of the publishing houses. The CEEOL Grey Literature Collection project provides researchers with access to more than 3,000 Grey Literature items.

CEEOL may be considered as the virtual successor of Palais Jalta – Ost/West Europäisches Kulturzentrum eV (East/West European Cultural Centre “Palais Jalta”), a non-profit organisation, that  organized a significant number of symposia, political and cultural debates, and exhibitions between 1989-2003 with a focus on Central, East and Southeast European societies, their cultures and issues.&lt;ref&gt;Bea Klotz, The Central and Eastern European Online Library, in: The Serials Librarian, Volume 53, Issue 1 &amp; 2 August 2007, pages 191–201 (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1300/J123v53n01_15?redirect=1)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first release of CEEOL was developed in 1999 and was operated until the end of 2015 by Questa.Soft GmbH in Frankfurt am Main. A redeveloped, cloud-based CEEOL repository was launched on the 1st of January 2016 and is operated by the Central and Eastern European Online Library GmbH (CEEOL GmbH)  in [[Frankfurt am Main]].

[[File:De vulgari eloquentia.tif|thumb|''De vulgari eloquentia'', 1577]]
'''''De vulgari eloquentia''''' ({{IPA-la|de vulˈɡari eloˈkwentsi.a|church}}, {{IPA-la|deː wʊɫˈɡaːriː eːɫɔˈkᶣɛnti.aː|classical}}; {{IPA-it|de vulˈɡaːri eloˈkwɛntsja|lang}}; "On eloquence in the [[vernacular]]") is the title of a [[Latin]] essay by [[Dante Alighieri]]. Although meant to consist of four books, its writing was abandoned in the middle of the second book. It was probably composed shortly after Dante went into exile; internal evidence points to a date between 1302 and 1305.

In the first book, Dante discusses the relationship between Latin and [[vernacular]], and the search for an "illustrious" vernacular in the [[Italy|Italian]] area; the second book is an analysis of the structure of the ''canto'' or song (also spelled ''[[canzone|canzuni]]'' in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]), which is a [[literary genre]] developed in the Sicilian School of poetry.

Latin essays were very popular in the [[Middle Ages]], but Dante made some innovations in his work: firstly, the subject (writing in vernacular) was an uncommon topic in literary discussion at that time. Also significant was how Dante approached this theme; that is, he presented an argument for giving vernacular the same dignity and legitimacy Latin was typically given. Finally, Dante wrote this essay in order to analyse the origin and the [[philosophy]] of the vernacular, because, in his opinion, this language was not something static, but something that evolves and needed a historical contextualisation.

==Structure==
Dante interrupted his work at the fourteenth chapter of the second book, and though historians have tried to find a reason for this, it is still not known why Dante so abruptly aborted his essay. Indeed it is an unfinished project, and so information about its intended structure is limited. Though at some point, Dante mentions a fourth book in which he planned to deal with the [[comic genre]] and the "mediocre" style, nothing at all is known about the third book. It is thought, however, that the first book was meant to be a sort of preface to the following three books, and so shorter than the others.

==Content==
In the beginning, Dante tackles the historical evolution of [[language]], which he thinks was born unitary and, at a later stage, was separated into different idioms because of the presumptuousness demonstrated by humankind at the time of the building of the [[Tower of Babel]]. He compiles a map of the geographical position of the languages he knows, dividing the European territory into three parts: one to the east, with the [[Greek language]]s; one to the north, with the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] languages, which he believed included Magyar and Slavic languages; one to the south, separated into three Romance languages identified by their word for 'yes': [[Occitan language|oc language]], [[Langue d'oïl|oïl language]] and [[Italian language|sì language]]. He then discusses ''gramatica'', "[[grammar]]", which is a static language consisting of unchanging rules, needed to make up for the [[natural language]]s. In chapters ten to fifteen of the first book, Dante writes about his search for the [[illustrious vernacular]], among the fourteen varieties he claims to have found in the Italian region. In the second book, Dante deals with literary genres, specifying which are the ones that suit the vernacular.

==Models==
Dante takes inspiration from rhetorical essays in Latin, [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], and Italian, and from philosophical readings. The main classical rhetorical texts from which he drew information were the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' by [[Horace]], the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' by an anonymous author, and ''[[De Inventione]]'' by [[Cicero]]. About the philosophical works, it is important to know that Dante read not only first hand texts, but also summaries  that sometimes were not of the original work, but of an intermediary one.  The influence and importance of the contribution of the Sicilian language is emphasized by his assertion that "the first hundred and fifty years of Italian poetry was written in Sicilian". 

The major Occitan work that influenced Dante was probably ''Razos de trobar'' by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[troubadour]] [[Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun]] and the ''Vers e regles de trobar'', an amplification of Vidal's manual, by [[Jofre de Foixà]].{{sfn|Ewert|1940|page=357}}{{sfn|Weiss|1942|page=160 n1}} Both of these works were Occitan manuals of grammar for troubadour poetry. They implicitly and explicitly defended Occitan as the best vernacular for song and verse, prompting Dante to come to the defence of his beloved Tuscan tongue. The popularity of both singing and composing in Occitan by Italians prompted Dante to write: {{lang|it|A perpetuale infamia e depressione delli malvagi uomini d'Italia, che commendano lo volgare altrui, e lo loro proprio dispregiano, dico...}},{{sfn|Graham-Leigh|2005|pages=32 and n130}} meaning "To the perpetual shame and lowness of the wicked men of Italy, that praise somebody else's vernacular and despise their own, I say..." (''[[Convivio]]'', treatise I, XI).

Directly or indirectly, Dante came to read [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s works, the ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|De Consolatione Philosophiae]]'' by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boëthius]], [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]]'s works and some [[encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopedic dictionaries]] like the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' by [[Isidore of Seville]] and the ''[[Livre du Tresor]]'' by [[Brunetto Latini]]. He takes also inspiration from [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] philosophy, and references to texts by representatives of what is sometimes referred to as [[Radical Aristotelianism]] can be found in Dante's work.

The concept of '''encyclopedic knowledge''' was once attributed to exceptionally well-read or knowledgeable persons such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Hildegard of Bingen|Hildegard von Bingen]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Immanuel Kant]], or [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]. Tom Rockmore described Hegel, for example, as a [[polymath]] and "a modern Aristotle, perhaps the last person to know everything of value that was known during his lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rockmore|first=Tom|title=On Art, Religion, and the History of Philosophy: Introductory Lectures by G.W.F. Hegel|year=1997|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.|location=Introduction|isbn=0-87220-370-0|page=ix|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37282048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such persons are generally described as such based on their deep cognitive grasp of multiple and diverse fields of inquiry—an intellectually exceptional subset of [[philosopher]]s who might also be differentiated from the multi-talented, the [[genius]], or the "[[Renaissance man]]."

It is no longer considered realistic, or feasible, for any one person to be truthfully described as having encyclopedic knowledge. The concept has been subsumed into the discourses on the production of knowledge and artificial intelligence. Instead, we are now preoccupied with [[knowledge base]]s distributed as software or web services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stross|first=Randall|title=Encyclopedic Knowledge, Then vs. Now|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/business/03digi.html|accessdate=13 May 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of encyclopedic knowledge has made many appearances in popular culture and literature. In 1887, [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] introduced his fictional master sleuth, [[Sherlock Holmes]], who applied his keen deductive acumen and prodigious range of knowledge to solve his cases. ''[[Encyclopedia Brown]]'' is a series of books by [[Donald J. Sobol]] featuring the adventures of boy detective Leroy Brown, nicknamed "Encyclopedia" for his intelligence and range of knowledge that was first published in 1963. One of the most celebrated is the fictional ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' by the late [[Douglas Adams]] which began its evolution through numerous mediums as a British radio program in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Douglas|title=The hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy|year=1979|publisher=Harmony Books|location=New York|isbn=1400052920|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[NPR]] contributor A.J.

== Domain-specific ==
While deep encyclopedic knowledge across numerous fields of inquiry by a single person is no longer feasible, encyclopedic knowledge within a field of inquiry or topic has great historical precedent and is still often ascribed to individuals. For example, it has been said of [[Raphael Lemkin]] that "his knowledge of the logic behind the Nazi war machine was encyclopedic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winter|first=Jay|title=Prophet Without Honors|journal=The Chronicle Review|date=June 7, 2013|page=B14|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Raphael-Lemkin-a-Prophet/139515/|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, [[Alexander Graham Bell]], who set out to read the entire ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pauly|first=Philip J.|title=The World and All That is in It: The National Geographic Society, 1888-1918|journal=American Quarterly|year=1979|volume=31|issue= 4|page=523|jstor=2712270|doi=10.2307/2712270}}&lt;/ref&gt; served as the second president of the [[National Geographic Society]] and declared the Society should cover "the world and all that is in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic Image Collection|url=http://events.nationalgeographic.com/events/exhibits/2009/10/01/image-collection/|work=National Geographic Magazine|publisher=NationalGeographic.com|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this goal sounds all-encompassing, it is in fact a statement towards comprehensive [[geography|geographic]] knowledge, meaning the scope of the National Geographic Society's enterprise should attempt to be terrestrially unbounded.

In an era of specialization, be it [[Academic specialization|academic]] or [[Specialization (functional)|functional]] or [[Specialization of knowledge|epistemological]], obtaining ''domain-specific'' encyclopedic knowledge as an [[expert]] is typically celebrated and often rewarded by institutions in modern society. (This appreciation for having extensive niche knowledge, however, should not be confused with the historical experimentation and debate surrounding the ''division of labor'' [[Division of labor#Karl Marx|which has been argued to limit the knowledge of workers]] compelled to perform repetitive tasks for the sake of an overall increase in economic productivity.)

'''Evocation''' is the act of calling upon or summoning a [[spirit]], [[demon]], [[god]] or other [[supernatural]] agent, in the [[Western mystery tradition]]. Comparable practices exist in many [[religion]]s and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al traditions and may employ the use of mind-altering substances with and without uttered word formulas.

==In the Western mystery tradition==
[[File:A Magician by Edward Kelly.jpg|thumb|250px|[[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and [[Edward Kelley]] evoking a spirit]]
The [[Latin]] word ''[[evocatio]]'' was the "calling forth" or "summoning away" of a city's [[tutelary deity]]. The ritual was conducted in a military setting either as a threat during a [[siege]] or as a result of surrender, and aimed at diverting the god's favor from the opposing city to the Roman side, customarily with a promise of a better-endowed cult or a more lavish temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evocatio'' was thus a kind of ritual dodge to mitigate looting of sacred objects or images from shrines that would otherwise be sacrilegious or impious.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Purcell, "On the Sacking of Corinth and Carthage", in ''Ethics and Rhetoric: Classical Essays for Donald Russell on His Seventy (Oxford University Press, 1995), pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calling forth of spirits was a relatively common practice in [[Neoplatonism]], [[theurgy]] and other esoteric systems of antiquity. In contemporary [[Western mystery tradition|western esotericism]], the magic of the [[grimoire]]s is frequently seen as the classical example of this idea. Manuals such as the ''[[Key of Solomon|Greater Key of Solomon the King]]'', The ''[[Lemegeton|Lesser Key of Solomon]]'' (or ''Lemegeton''), the ''[[The Book of Abramelin|Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage]]'' and many others provided instructions that combined intense devotion to the divine with the summoning of a personal cadre of spiritual advisers and [[Familiar spirit|familiars]].

The grimoires provided a variety of methods of evocation. The spirits are, in many cases, commanded in the [[Names of God|name of God]] - most commonly using cabalistic and Hellenic 'barbarous names' added together to form long [[Litany|litanies]]. The magician used [[wand]]s, staves, [[incense]] and fire, [[Athame|dagger]]s and complex diagrams drawn on parchment or upon the ground. In [[Enochian magic]], spirits are evoked into a [[crystal ball]] or mirror, in which a human volunteer (a 'seer') is expected to be able to see the spirit and hear its voice, passing the words on to the evoker. Sometimes such a seer might be an actual [[Medium (spirituality)|medium]], speaking as the spirit, not just for it. In other cases the spirit might be 'housed' in a symbolic image, or conjured into a diagram from which it cannot escape without the magician's permission.

While many later, corrupt and commercialized grimoires include elements of '[[diabolism]]' and one (''[[The Grand Grimoire]]'') even offers a method for making a pact with the [[devil]], in general the art of evocation of spirits is said to be done entirely under the power of the divine. The magician is thought to gain authority among the spirits only by purity, worship and personal devotion and study.

In more recent usage, ''evocation'' refers to the calling out of lesser spirits (beneath the [[Deity|deific]] or [[archangel]]ic level), sometimes conceived of as arising from the self. This sort of evocation is contrasted with [[invocation]], in which spiritual powers are called into the self from a divine source.

Important contributors to the concept of evocation include [[Henry Cornelius Agrippa]], [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]], [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Franz Bardon]] and [[Kenneth Grant]]. The work of all of these authors can be seen as attempts to systematize and modernize the grimoiric procedure of evocation. Many modern authors, such as [[Peter J. Carroll|Peter Carroll]] and [[Konstantinos (occultist)|Konstantinos]], have attempted to describe evocation in a way independent enough from the grimoiric tradition to fit similar methods of interaction with alleged supernatural agents in other traditions.

'''Conjuration''' in traditional and most contemporary usage refers to a [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] act of invoking spirits or using incantations or charms to cast magical spells. In the context of [[legerdemain]], it may also refer to the performance of illusion or [[magic (illusion)|magic tricks]] for show. This article discusses mainly the original and primary usage, describing acts of a [[supernatural]] or [[paranormal]] nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conjure |title=Conjure &amp;#124; Define Conjure at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conjuration |title=Conjuration &amp;#124; Define Conjuration at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word conjuration (from Latin ''conjure'', ''conjurare'', to "swear together") can be interpreted in several different ways: as an [[invocation]] or evocation (the latter in the sense of binding by a vow); as an [[exorcism]]; and as an act of producing effects by [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] means.

The word is often used synonymously with terms such as "invocation" or "evocation" or "summoning", although many authors find it useful to maintain some distinction between these terms. The term "conjuring" is also used as a general term for casting spells in some magical traditions, such as [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]]. In that context, amulets and talismans are often kept in a "conjure bag" and "conjuring oils" may be used to anoint candles and other magical supplies and thus imbue them with specific magical powers.

Alternatively, the term "conjuration" may be used refer to an act of [[magic (illusion)|illusionism]] or legerdemain, as in the performance of magic tricks for entertainment.

One who performs conjurations is called a conjurer or conjuror.
The word (as ''conjuration'' or ''conjurison'') was formerly used in its Latin meaning of "conspiracy".&lt;ref&gt;Ex. gr. Chaucer, Wycliffe, Caxton; see [[OED]] s.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts and language==
The text of the charms to be recited to conjure the spirit varies considerably from simple sentences to complex paragraphs with plenty of magic words. The language usually is that of the conjurer's, but since the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Western mystery tradition|Western tradition]], [[Latin]] was the most common (although many texts have been translated into other languages).

==Objectives of conjuration==
The conjuration of the [[ghost]]s or [[soul]]s of the dead for the purpose of [[divination]] is called [[necromancy]].

When it is said that a person is calling upon or conjuring misfortune or disease, it is due to the ancient belief that personified diseases and misfortune as evil [[deity|deities]], spirits or [[demon]]s that could enter a human or bestial body; see [[demon possession]].

==Religious views==
A conjuration is traditionally linked to repelling negative spirits away, and protecting an individual, space or collective. However, it is also believed by some, particularly in [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], that magic and conjuration is an inherently evil practice. Conjurers summon demons or other evil spirits to cause harm to people or things, to obtain favors from them, or simply to enter their servitude. The belief in similarly-minded conjurers also exists in belief systems in which magic is not inherently evil, although in these cultures these "[[black magic]]ians" are not the rule and have opposition among more traditional magicians.

== Conjuration in Mid-West Asia ==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2018}}
Conjuration is a very common [[Mysticism|mystical]] practice in Mid-West Asia, most commonly found in [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the United Arab Emirates and [[Iraq]]. Many practice it to settle personal grudges or for healing, personal enhancement, or foretelling the future. There are also those who will sell their services as conjurers to others.

[[Islam]] strongly forbids the use of conjuration, because it is seen as an unholy procedure, and therefore to perform it is to give an insult to Allah. It is also considered to, in the end, harm people more than help them: those who regularly contact demons are believed to go mad through overdosing on power, or being possessed (since demons are thought to be short-tempered entities, and given the opportunity might overpower and enslave the one who summoned them).

==Contemporary references==
Within some [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] traditions today, such as [[contemporary witchcraft]], [[hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] and [[Hermeticism]] or [[ceremonial magic]], conjuration may refer specifically to an act of calling or invoking deities and other spirits; or it may refer more generally to the casting of magic spells by a variety of techniques.&lt;ref name="Conjure"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=[[Harry Houdini|Houdini, Harry]]|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Harry-Houdini-on-conjuring-1973131|title=Conjuring |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=13th |year=1926 |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used in the sense of invoking or evoking deities and other spirits, conjuration can be regarded as one aspect of [[magic and religion|religious magic]].

In the context of [[magic (illusion)|illusionist magic]] practiced today as entertainment only, "conjurer" or "conjuror" is still a common term used by practitioners. In times past, illusionist conjurors were suspected of using magic power to create their entertaining illusions and even suspected of casting spells. They were regarded as "magicians" by the general public, who were often not cognizant of the techniques and tricks used to create their illusions.

==In other beliefs==
Evocation is the [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] art of calling forth [[spirit]]s, [[angel]]s or [[demon]]s to bring spiritual inspiration, do the bidding of the magician or provide information. Methods of this exist in many cultures that feature a belief in spirits, such as the [[shamanism|shamanic traditions]]. [[Daoism]], [[Shintoism]], [[Spiritism]] and the African-American religions ([[Santería]], [[Umbanda]] etc.), have particular systems of evocation.

'''Gallup's List of People that Americans Most Widely Admired in the 20th Century''' is a poll published in December 1999 by [[The Gallup Organization]] to determine which people around the world Americans most admired for what they did in the 20th century.

While Gallup has constructed a yearly [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll]] list since 1948, it did not cover the entire century. Therefore, they combined the results from those lists with a new preliminary poll to determine the 18 most admired people.  They then ran a final poll to produce an ordered list of those 18.  This produced the following ranking:

#[[Mother Teresa]]
#[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]
#[[John F. Kennedy]]
#[[Albert Einstein]]
#[[Helen Keller]]
#[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]
#[[Billy Graham]]
#[[Pope John Paul II]]
#[[Eleanor Roosevelt]]
#[[Winston Churchill]]
#[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]
#[[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]]
#[[Mohandas Gandhi]]
#[[Nelson Mandela]]
#[[Ronald Reagan]]
#[[Henry Ford]]
#[[Bill Clinton]]
#[[Margaret Thatcher]]

Following the work of [[Pierre Larousse]] on the ''[[Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle|Grand dictionnaire Universel]]'', the '''''Grand Dictionnaire Encyclopédique Larousse''''', a ten-volume dictionary, was published between 1982 and 1985 by [[Éditions Larousse]]. It is an encyclopedia and a dictionary merged in a single alphabetical listing. Beneath the standard dictionary (meanings, usages) entry comes the encyclopedic section.

Articles are illustrated by photographs, maps, chronologies and diagrams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2041">'''Her''' or '''His Majesty's Australian Ship (HMAS)''' is a [[ship prefix]] used for commissioned units of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). This prefix is derived from [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS (Her/His Majesty's Ship)]], the prefix used by the [[Royal Navy]] of the [[United Kingdom]], and can be equally applied to warships and shore bases (as Australia follows the British tradition of referring to naval establishments as ships or [[stone frigate]]s).

On 10 July 1911, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] granted the title of Royal Australian Navy to the naval forces of Australia.&lt;ref name=Frame96&gt;{{cite book |last=Frame |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Frame (bishop) |title=No Pleasure Cruise: the story of the Royal Australian Navy |year=2004 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=Crows Nest, NSW |isbn=1-74114-233-4 |oclc=55980812 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the prefix and acronym were approved for use in identifying units commissioned into the RAN.&lt;ref name=Frame96/&gt; The prefix had been used prior to formal approval, with the [[torpedo-boat destroyer]] {{HMAS|Parramatta|D55|2}} commissioned with the HMAS prefix on 1 March 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cassells |first=Vic |title=The Destroyers: their battles and their badges |year=2000 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=East Roseville, NSW |isbn=0-7318-0893-2 |oclc=46829686 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prefix now refers to the [[Monarchy in Australia|King or Queen of Australia]], who is also the British monarch. The first word of the prefix changes depending on the gender of the reigning monarch of Australia.

'''Het Scheepje''' is the name of a former brewery in [[Haarlem]] on the [[Spaarne]]. It was owned for more than a century by the Dicx family, and it remained a brewery until the beginning of the 20th century. The historic contents of the old parlor were sold to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], where they are on show.

==History==
[[File:Gevelsteen godt bewaert het schip.jpg|thumb|Gable stones on the facade]]
[[File:Nautz - Spaarne-Houtmarkt-Stads Buiten Singel.jpg|thumb|right|On this 1827 map of Haarlem, the complex can be seen on the right between the Spaarne and the Buiten-Stads-Singel as one large block extending across the thin strip of land from waterway to waterway, situated just below the empty lot.]]
In 1565 Dirck Diricksz. (ca. 1537-1618), a ship's captain, bought a house with property on the Scheepmakersdijk.&lt;ref name=Biesboer&gt;''Een Haarlems interieur in Philadelphia'', by [[Pieter Biesboer]], Haerlem jaarboek 1986; p.97-104&lt;/ref&gt; At that time ships were built there (''Shipbuilder's dike''), but today this street is called the Houtmarkt. His son Dirck Diricksz. de Jonge (1571 1619) was also a captain, who married Cornelia Cornelisdr. Jonck (ca. 1570-1630) and had 4 children. In 1606 he bought a house next to his father's property, along with some other properties on the Scheepmakersdijk. He named his house "Scheepje", which means "little ship". Shortly after this he became a member of the brewer's guild, and in documents he is listed as owner of the brewery "Het Scheepje", which was part of the brewery "De Vogel Struijs", along with [[Johan Claesz Loo]]. Dirck Diricksz kept on purchasing properties until most of the brewery was his. In the facade of his former house a gable stone is a memorial to the old name with a picture of a sailing ship and the text "Godt bewaert het schip" (''God saves the ship'').&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; In 1616 Dirck Diricksz received permission to build a windmill for grinding malt for beer. In 1618 he was promoted to mayor of Haarlem by [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurits]]. His success did not last long however, and he died a year later, but his wife continued the beer business until her death in 1630. In June 1633 their daughter Agatha and her husband Nicolaes Olycan bought the inheritance rights of the remaining 3 children and took over the brewery and adjoining house.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt;

Nicolaes Olycan, son of the brewer [[Pieter Jacobsz Olycan]], was a member of the Haarlem brewing elite and until his death in 1639, he and his wife ran the brewery with great success. In 1631 the [[Haarlemmertrekvaart|Amsterdam-Haarlem trekvaart]] was dug, which made it easier to export beer to Amsterdam by boat. Because the rear of the brewery was on the canal leading to the trekvaart, the brewery was located very advantageously for this business. The couple gave employment to many "zakkedragers" (''carriers'') for loading and unloading boats at the front and rear of the property. Another gable stone attests to this with the symbol of the carrier's guild, a man with a sack on his back. There was also a disadvantage to this location however. In the night of 14–15 November 1775, a flood caused the water to rise and the entire area of the Scheepmakersdijk came under water, and the windows of Het Scheepje were so low to the ground that the water came in through the windows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2Q8AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA172 Bespiegeling over nêerlandsch waternood tusschen den 14en en 15en November 1775], Vaderlandsche letteroefeningen. Jaargang 1776, by Johan Hendrik Hering&lt;/ref&gt;

Like her mother before her, Agatha continued the business after the death of her husband and when she died in 1667 it was taken over by her two daughters Marie and Alida.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; They called themselves Dicx, and it was descendants of this family, Catharina and Cornelia Dicx, who sold the brewery at auction in 1818.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt;

==Rooms in Philadelphia==
Het Scheepje remained a brewery until 1916 when it was sold to the Stuyt brothers, who were cheese traders. They rebuilt the premises for cheese storage in 1918 and had the 17th century parlor room dismantled for sale to H. H. Lugard Jr., who wanted to use it for a museum in [[Deventer]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; Before dismantling it, [[Karel Sluyterman]] had his engineering students make detailed sketches and photographs of the room.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; In 1926 many of the rooms in Het Scheepje were again redesigned when the premises became a printing shop. Little remains today of the original layout of the 17th century house.

The Deventer museum plans never materialized and the room contents were put up for sale again in 1923, when the Historical Society of Haarlem tried to purchase it for the [[Frans Hals Museum]]. It was bought by J.D. De Vries of New York, who in turn sold it to [[Edward Bok]] to be installed in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Sluyterman was consulted and his drawings were used for the final installation in the museum.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt;

The '''''Dicionário Houaiss da Língua Portuguesa''''' (''Houaiss Dictionary of the Portuguese Language'') is a major reference [[dictionary]] for the [[Portuguese language]], edited by Brazilian writer [[Antônio Houaiss]].

The dictionary was composed by a team of two hundred [[lexicography|lexicographers]] from several countries. The project started in 1986 and was finished in 2000, one year after Houaiss's death.

The book claims to be the most complete Portuguese dictionary to date, with around 228,500 entries, 376,500 senses, 415,500 [[synonym]]s, 26,400 [[antonym]]s, and 57,000 historical words. It aims to cover all variants of the language, including [[African Portuguese|African]], [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian]], and [[European Portuguese]].

The '''Interaction Flow Modeling Language''' ('''IFML''') is a standardized modeling language in the field of software engineering. IFML includes a set of graphic notations to create visual models of user interactions and front-end behavior in software systems.

The Interaction Flow Modeling Language was developed in 2012 and 2013 under the lead of WebRatio and was inspired by the [[WebML]] notation, as well as by a few other experiences in the [[Web modeling]] field.

It was adopted as a standard by the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) in March 2013.&lt;ref name="IFML"&gt;{{cite web|title=IFML Specification document|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/IFML/|publisher=OMG - Object Management Group|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus==
IFML supports the platform independent description of graphical user interfaces for applications accessed or deployed on such systems as desktop computers, laptop computers, PDAs, mobile phones, and tablets. The focus of the description is on the structure and behavior of the application as perceived by the end user.

IFML describes user interactions and control behaviors of front-end of applications belonging to the following domains:
* HTML+HTTP based Web applications.
* Rich Internet Applications, as supported by the HTML 5 standard.
* Mobile applications.
* Client-server applications.
* Desktop applications.
* Embedded Human Machine Interfaces for control applications.
* Multichannel and context-aware applications.
IFML does not cater to the specification of bi-dimensional and tri-dimensional computer based graphics.

IFML does not apply to the modeling of presentation issues (layout/look and feel) of an application front-end or to the design of business logic and data components. Although these aspects are not the focus of the language, IFML allows designers to reference external models or modeling artifacts regarding these aspects from within IFML models.

==Content of the standard==

The IFML specification&lt;ref name="IFML"/&gt; consists of:
* The IFML [[metamodeling|metamodel]] ([[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]]).
* The IFML [[UML profile]].
* The IFML visual syntax (Defined through Diagram Definition and Diagram Interchange specification).
* The IFML [[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]] model exchange format.

==Main modeling concepts==
[[File:IFML-concepts.png|450px|thumbnail|Main IFML concepts and notations.]]
An IFML model consists of one or more ''view container''s (possibly nested).
For example, windows in traditional desktop applications or page templates in
Web applications. A view container can contain ''view component''s, which denote
the publication of static or dynamic content, or interface elements for data entry
(such as input forms). A view component can have input and output ''parameter''s.

A view container and a view component can be associated with ''event''s, that can represent users'
interactions or system-generated occurrences. For example, an event for selecting
one or more items from a list or for submitting inputs from a form. The effect
of an event is represented by an ''interaction flow'' connection. The interaction
flow expresses a change of state of the user interface. An event
can also trigger an ''action'', which is executed prior to updating
the state of the user interface; for example, a delete or update operation on
instances of a database. An input-output dependency between elements can be specified through
parameter bindings associated with navigation flows or through ''data flow''s, that only describe data transfer.

IFML also includes concepts for defining constraints, modularization, and [[context awareness]] (e.g., based on user profile, device, location) over modeling elements.
IFML concepts can be extended with standard extension mechanisms based on [[Stereotype (UML)|stereotyping]].

==Benefits==
The cost of front-end application development has increased with the emergence of an unprecedented range of devices, technological platforms, and communication channels, which are not accompanied by the advent of an adequate approach for creating a [[Platform independent model|Platform Independent Model]] (PIM) that can be used for designing user interactions independently of the implementation platform. This causes front-end development to be a costly and inefficient process, where manual coding is the predominant development approach, reuse of design artifacts is low, and portability of applications across platforms remains difficult.

IFML brings several benefits to the development of application front-ends:
* It supports the formal specification of the front-end from different perspectives: interface composition, user interaction, event management.
* It supports connection with the business logic, the data model, and the graphical presentation layer.
* It isolates the specification of the front-end from implementation-specific issues.
* It improves the development process, by fostering the separation of concerns between roles in the interaction design.
* It enables the communication of UI design to non-technical stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://citrusbits.com/user-stories-foundation-ui-design/ A Foundation For a perfect UI Design] by CitrusBits (March 20, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations and tools==
IFML is currently supported by WebRatio [http://www.webratio.com].
A set of blog posts describing the standardization process is available [http://www.modeldrivenstar.org/search?q=ifml&amp;max-results=20&amp;by-date=true here].

A new, [[opensource]] IFML editor based on Eclipse, [[Eclipse Modeling Framework|EMF]]/GMF and the Graphiti API is under development. The
tool will be released as an open-source Eclipse Project. The tool will include mappings from IFML abstract concepts to the platform-
specific concepts of Java Swing, Microsoft WPF, and HTML.
The modeling of the IFML diagrams for the UI part can be complemented with (executable) UML diagrams according to [[fUML]] specifications combined with Alf
scripts for the back-end business logic. A sneak preview of the tool features can be seen in this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTIMM643wVw video].

==History==
IFML was  inspired by the [[WebML]] notation, invented at [[Politecnico di Milano]] by Stefano Ceri and Piero Fraternali, with a team of people including Roberto Acerbis, Aldo Bongio, Marco Brambilla, Sara Comai, Stefano Butti and Maristella Matera.

'''Kandilli Earthquake Museum''', or more formally '''Museum of Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institut''' ({{lang-tr|Kandilli Rasathanesi ve Deprem Araştırma Enstitüsü Müzesi}}), is a museum devoted mainly to seismology and earthquake science in [[Turkey]]. It is situated within the campus of [[Kandilli Observatory]] in [[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli]] neighborhood of [[Üsküdar]] district in [[Istanbul]].

Owned by the [[Boğaziçi University]], the museum was opened on June 21, 2006 and is housed in a renovated building, which was constructed in 1934 as a laboratory for [[seismometer|seismography]]. In the museum, various scientific instruments are on exhibition that were used in astronomical and geoscientific works. There are also old books on display that are hand-written in Turkish, Arabic and Persian language about astronomy, astrology, mathematics and geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haber3.com/kandilli-deprem-muzesi-acildi-135780h.htm |newspaper=Haber 3 |title=Kandilli Deprem Müzesi açıldı |date=2006-06-21 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kiryat Luza''' ({{lang-he-n|קרית לוזה}}, {{lang-ar|قرية لوزة}}) is a [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] village on [[Mount Gerizim]] near [[Nablus]], [[West Bank]] under joint Israeli and Palestinian control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barbati|first1=Gabrielle|title=Israeli Election Preview: The Samaritans, Caught Between Two Votes|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/israeli-election-preview-samaritans-caught-between-two-votes-1028684|accessdate=14 October 2014|publisher=International Business Times|date=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the last wholly Samaritan village, half of their population living there.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Salome, ''Violence, veils, and bloodlines: reporting from war zones,'' McFarland, , 2010 p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; The village houses the museum of the Samaritans. Kiryat Luza is adjacent to the Israeli settlement of [[Har Bracha]]. Until the 1980s, most of the Samaritans resided in Nablus below Mount Gerizim. The Samaritans relocated to Kiryat Luza as a result of violence during the [[First Intifada]]. Consequently, all that remains of the Samaritan community in Nablus itself is an abandoned [[synagogue]]. The [[Israel Defense Forces]] maintains a presence in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/10/08/samaritans/index.html?iref=allsearch&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4495">The '''Letter of 59''' (also known as the ''Memorial'' or ''Memorandum of 59'') was an [[open letter]] signed by 66 (or 59 at first, hence the name) Polish [[intellectual]]s who protested against the changes of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland]] that were made by the communist party of Poland in 1975. Additional people signed the letter in January 1976.

The letter was closely related to the [[Helsinki Accords]]. On September 1, 1975 the Polish socialist government signed  "The Blue Book" of CSCE (the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]) committing to, among other things, respect for [[human rights]] and refraining from the threat or use of force. Meanwhile, the new changes to the Polish constitution proposed by the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] after the Helsinki Accords, included new ideological [[clause]]s pronouncing and reaffirming the "steering role of the Party in the nation," the "socialist character of the nation," a "permanent and unbreakable alliance with the Soviet Union," and most of all, that the "government obligation to respect the rights of the citizens" is ''conditional'' only, and "dependent on the citizens fulfilling their obligations towards the country."

The communist government criticized the letter of protest publicly, with [[Edward Gierek]] calling the signatories "furious anticommunists, politically blind".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Eventually, although the constitution was changed, the above fragments were redrafted to sound more neutral:
# the steering role of the Party "in the nation" was changed to "in the building of socialism"
# "alliance" with the USSR was replaced with "friendship"
# citizens' rights were not linked with their obligations

The government could not officially persecute the signatories for their letter, although various semi-official persecutions were implemented, for example, some authors had the government agencies refuse to print or distribute their books for several years thereafter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2293">The '''Lindos Chronicle''' (or '''Lindian Chronicle''') is an inscription from [[Lindos]], [[Rhodes]], dated to 99 BC. It records dedications made in the temple to Athena at Lindos prior to the destruction of the original temple in 392/1.&lt;ref name=Marincola&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marincola|first=John|title=Review of Higbie's ''The Lindian Chronicle and the Greek Creation of Their Past''|journal=Bryn Mawr Classical Review|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle is one of the longest surviving Hellenistic inscriptions.&lt;ref name=Marincola/&gt; It was excavated early in the 20th century by a Danish expedition, which found it used as paving block of the Byzantine church of Saint Stephen, near the theatre of Lindos. It contains decrees of Lindians, as well report on previous dedications of rulers and generals to [[Athena]] Lindia.

The chronicle is inscribed on a marble slab, approximately eight-by-three feet, which is now broken into two pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaya|first=Josephine|title=The Greek Temple as a Museum|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=109|issue=3|year=2005|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The catalogue of dedications contains about forty-five entries, though only thirty-seven are still legible. Additionally, the chronicle contains four miracle stories about Athena, of which only one is still totally legible, and two more are fragmentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaya|first=Josephine|title=The Greek Temple as a Museum|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=109|issue=3|year=2005|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronicle was first edited and published in 1912 by Christian Blinkenberg.  The first English translation to be published was by Carolyn Higbie in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gabrielsen|first=Vincent|title=Review: The Chronicle of Lindos|journal=The Classical Review|volume=55|issue=1|year=2005|pages=319&amp;ndash;320|doi=10.1093/clrevj/bni176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align:center;"| 1854
| style="text-align:center;"| 1854
| One of the earliest recorded examples of satirical literature at the College. The premier issue is the only remaining copy in Swem Archives. It debuted during the height of the [[antebellum era|antebellum]] period with the country torn over the issue of states rights and slavery. ''The Owl'' addresses many issues that would be considered controversial today, such as race and gender. Other issues addressed that are still present were professors, administration, and Williamsburg citizens. There is no evidence of funding found for ''The Owl''. A theory on this is that ''The Owl'' was merely a joke amongst a group of students and they used their own money to pay to have it printed. Also there is no evidence to prove that multiple copies were produced and distributed.

The '''McCulloch House Museum''' in [[Pictou, Nova Scotia]] is a site of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]]. It boasts interpretive materials designed to tell the story of [[Thomas McCulloch]] and his roles in education and politics in Pictou in the early 19th century. As well, the McCulloch House museum is host to a large collection of artifacts, many being Dr. McCulloch's personal belongings from his educating days. The museum is affiliated with the adjacent Genealogy Centre, formerly known as the Hector Exhibit Centre and Archives. Both are administered by the Pictou County Genealogy and Heritage Society.

The house is listed on the [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]], and is built of brick with sandstone accents. It was built by McCulloch circa 1806 as a {{frac|1|1|2}}-story cottage, situated on top of a knoll overlooking [[Pictou Harbour]]. In about 1890 a [[gambrel roof]] and [[dormer]] were added.&lt;ref name=chp&gt;{{cite web|title=McCulloch House|url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=1273&amp;pid=0|website=Canada's Historic Places|publisher=[[Canadian Register of Historic Places]]|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was closed in the late 1990s for structural repairs. It reopened in 2006 with new interpretation and exhibits.&lt;ref name=vmc1900&gt;{{cite web|title=McCulloch House,  Circa 1900|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?id=record_detail&amp;fl=0&amp;lg=English&amp;ex=00000253&amp;hs=0&amp;rd=42284|website=[[Virtual Museum of Canada]]|publisher=[[Canadian Museum of History]]|accessdate=6 October 2015|page=Text attachment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Miller's Anesthesia''''' is an authoritative textbook on [[anesthesiology]].

== History ==

First published in 1981 by [[Churchill Livingstone]], it was originally catered to an American audience due to technical differences in anesthesia procedures among European and American practitioners. The first edition was co-authored by many contributors at the [[University of California]]. The book soon became a huge success, and it was frequently cited by research groups and clinical departments across the United States.&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blazier|first1=Kenneth L.|last2=McPeek|first2=Bucknam|title=Book Review Anesthesia Third edition. Edited by Ronald D. Miller, with Roy F. Cucchiara, Edward D. Miller, Jr., J.G. Reves, Michael F. Roizen, and John J. Savarese. 2420 pp. in two volumes, illustrated. New York, Churchill Livingstone, 1990. $175.|journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]]|date=16 May 1991|volume=324|issue=20|pages=1442–1443|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199105163242019|doi=10.1056/NEJM199105163242019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition appeared in 1986, with total content filling more than 2400 pages spread over three separate volumes. Although it was criticized for lack of cross-referencing and noticeable differences in writing styles due to a higher number of contributors, ''Miller's Anesthesia'' soon became the "standard encyclopedic textbook of anesthesia".&lt;ref name="nejm"/&gt; In 1991, the third edition was released in two volumes with the involvement of more international contributors.&lt;ref name="nejm"/&gt; The sixth edition was noted for its illustrations of technical procedures such as [[ultrasound]]-guided [[Peripheral venous catheter|peripheral venous access]], caudal block in pediatric populations and anesthesia for [[robot-assisted surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnstone|first1=Robert|title=Anesthesia. 6th ed.|journal=[[Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia]]|date=December 2005|volume=101|issue=6|page=1895|url=http://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/Fulltext/2005/12000/Anesthesia__6th_ed_.88.aspx|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New video segments were created for the accompanying CD demonstrations of techniques such as [[tracheal intubation]] and [[needle cricothyrotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Egan|first1=Talmage|title=Miller's Anesthesia, 6th Edition.|url=http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=2026274|publisher=[[Anesthesiology (journal)|Anesthesiology]]|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the seventh edition was released with a downloadable video library for extra anesthesia procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalra|first1=Praveen|title=Millerʼs Anesthesia, Volumes 1 and 2, 7th Edition.|journal=[[Anesthesiology (journal)|Anesthesiology]]|date=January 2010|volume=112|issue=1|pages=260–261|doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181c5dc06|url=http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1932719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the eight edition was released with more than 3200 pages in two volumes and nine main sections. Major updates include ten new chapters covering robot-administered anesthesia, non-operating room anesthesia, non-[[opioid]] [[analgesic]]s, and anesthetic [[neurotoxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lalonde|first1=Geneviève|title=Miller’s Anesthesia, Eighth Edition|journal=Canadian Journal of Anesthesia|date=9 January 2015|volume=62|issue=5|pages=558–559|doi=10.1007/s12630-015-0311-5|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12630-015-0311-5/fulltext.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] has recommended ''Miller's Anesthesia'' as an essential textbook for preparations for a career in anesthesiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Prepare for a Career in Anesthesiology|url=http://www.asahq.org/resources/career-resources/anesthesia-as-a-career/how-to-prepare-for-a-career-in-anesthesiology|publisher=[[American Society of Anesthesiologists]]|quote=An easy way to determine if you have an interest in medicine and anesthesiology is to read more about it.

The '''Museum of Sydney''' is a historical collection and exhibit, built on the ruins of the house of New South Wales' first Governor, [[Arthur Phillip]], on the present-day corner of [[Phillip Street, Sydney|Phillip]] and [[Bridge Street, Sydney]]. 

==Description==
The [[First Government House, Sydney|original house]], which was Australia's first [[Government House, Sydney|Government House]], was built in 1788 and later abandoned.  The foundations were exposed by archaeologists in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hht.net.au/museums/mos Historic Houses Trust of NSW], retrieved 2009-10-07&lt;/ref&gt;  The new museum building on the site was designed by [[Denton Corker Marshall]] architects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com.au/awards_search?option=showaward&amp;entryno=19972013 AIA Architecture award], retrieved 2009-10-07&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was built as part of the [[Governor Phillip Tower]] development and is managed by the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]].

The Museum of Sydney explores colonial and contemporary [[Sydney]] through objects, pictures and new digital media techniques. Panoramic views of Sydney&amp;mdash;from 1788 until today&amp;mdash;stretch across walls and video screens. Sydney's [[Convictism in Australia|convict]] era is explored in a giant showcase of goods and chattels recovered from more than 25 archaeological digs.

==Origins of the name==
When it was commissioned, the project was called the ''First Government House Museum''.&lt;ref name=Poland&gt;Peter Poland (President, Woollahra History and Heritage Society Inc), "Intellectual Hijacking" (letter to the editor), The Sydney Morning Herald, 1 December 1993, p. 14."Geraldine O'Brien is right when she describes "The Museum of Sydney on the Site of First Government House" as a mouthful (Herald, November 20). The sad thing is that this title will be shortened to "The Museum of Sydney" which will both obscure the real significance of this very important and historic site and totally mislead those who visit the museum. The significance of the First Government House is that it was the powerhouse of the European settlement in this part of the Pacific. On this site decisions were made which not only affected the exploration of and expansion into Australia of the newcomers with all that that meant for both them and the Aborigines but also decisions which reached out to the world from Cape Town to Calcutta, Canton and California and all points in between. To call the museum which should be interpreting the far-reaching significance of this site "The Museum of Sydney" reflects an arrogance that assumes that Sydney is the only place that matters and an act of intellectual hijacking on the part of those who have been given responsibility of what was to be "The First Government House Museum"."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bain&gt;Adrian Bain, "Phillip needs filip" (letter to the editor), Daily Telegraph (Sydney), 21 December 2002, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser Range Granite NL, "Quarterly Exploration Reports December (Part A)", 27 January 1994, Australian Stock Exchange Company Announcements via factiva accessed 27 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While the museum building was being built in November 1993, the New South Wales Minister for the Arts announced that the museum would be known as the ''Museum of Sydney on the Site of First Government House'',&lt;ref name=SMH1993110&gt;Geraldine O'Brien, "History underfoot in new museum on significant site", The Sydney Morning Herald, 20 November 1993, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Local Government (General) Amendment (Rate Exemptions) Regulation 2009'' (NSW) and reg 123, ''Local Government (General) Regulation 2005'' (NSW).&lt;/ref&gt; described in the press at the time as a "mouthful"&lt;ref name=SMH1993110/&gt; and commonly contracted to The Museum of Sydney.&lt;ref name=Poland/&gt; The change of name attracted protests.&lt;ref name=Column8SMH19950127&gt;"Column 8", The Sydney Morning Herald, 27 January 1995, p. 1. "IT WAS, perhaps, the most genteel demonstration ever held in Sydney—the holding up of placards by the Friends of the First Government House Site at the opening of First Government House Place in Bridge Street yesterday. The Friends were the first to agitate in the early 1980s to stop the site being covered by an office block. An archaeological survey uncovered the footings of Governor Phillip's house, and after long negotiations, a museum has been built there, to open on March 11. Why are the Friends upset? They had expected their preferred name, First Government House Museum, would be chosen. Instead, the Heritage Houses Trust has called it The Museum of Sydney - so some 50 Friends had their quiet, polite, gentle and heartfelt say when the place was opened."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poland/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bain/&gt;

The '''Musée du Luxembourg''' is a [[museum]] at 19 [[rue de Vaugirard]] in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris]]. Established in 1750, it was initially an [[art museum]] located in the east wing of the [[Luxembourg Palace]] (the matching west wing housed Ruben's [[Marie de' Medici cycle]]) and in 1818 became the first museum of [[contemporary art]]. In 1884 the museum moved into its current building, the former [[orangery]] of the Palace. The museum was taken over by the French Ministry of Culture and the [[French Senate]] in 2000, when it began to be used for temporary exhibitions, and became part of the [[Réunion des Musées Nationaux]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museeduluxembourg.fr/le-musee "Un musée, une histoire"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029091531/http://museeduluxembourg.fr/le-musee |date=2014-10-29 }} at the Musée du Luxembourg website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ochterbeck 2009, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
From 1750 to 1780 it was the first public painting gallery in Paris, displaying the King's collection which included [[Titian]]'s ''[[The Madonna of the Rabbit]]'', [[Da Vinci]]'s ''Holy Family'' (either ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]'' or ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'') and nearly a hundred other [[Old Master]] works now forming the nucleus of the [[Louvre]]. In 1803, it reopened showing paintings by a range of artists from [[Nicolas Poussin]] to [[Jacques-Louis David]], and was devoted to living artists from 1818 to 1937. Much of the work first shown here has found its way into other [[List of museums in Paris|museums of Paris]] including the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Jeu de Paume]], the [[Musée de l'Orangerie|Orangerie]], and ultimately the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] and the [[Musée d'Orsay]].

*In 1861, [[James Tissot]] showed ''The Meeting of Faust and Marguerite'', which was purchased by the state for the Luxembourg Gallery.
*The illustrator [[André Gill]] (1840–1885) was named curator of the Musée du Luxembourg on May 15, 1871, in which capacity he reassembled the scattered collections of art and reestablished the museum of [[sculpture]].  He had scarcely begun his work when it was interrupted by the upheaval associated with the [[Paris Commune]].
*When [[Ernest Hemingway]] paid a call on [[Gertude Stein]] at the nearby [[Rue de Fleurus]], he stopped to see the work of the Impressionists which in 1921 were still in the Musée du Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;''[[A Moveable Feast]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''NRC'''s Best Dutch novels''' is a list of the most popular Dutch-language novels as of 2007.

This list is based on an internet survey on books, carried out by the Dutch newspaper [[NRC Handelsblad]] in the beginning of 2007. The Dutch public originally voted for their best-loved books from a "long-list". The long-list also contained Flemish authors like [[Louis Paul Boon]], [[Hugo Claus]] and [[Willem Elsschot]]. From this, a "short-list" of ten books was drawn up for further voting. In March 2007 the final voting as shown below was presented on the Dutch national television.

The list comprises 9 novels. The works by Nescio are three novellas which have been published together. The list no longer contains Flemish (Belgian) authors.

==The 10 books==
#[[Harry Mulisch]], ''[[The Discovery of Heaven]]''; (1992)
#[[Kader Abdolah]], ''[[The House of the Mosque]]''; (2005)
#[[Multatuli]], ''[[Max Havelaar]]''; (1860)
#[[J. Bernlef]], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Out of mind|nl|3=Hersenschimmen}}''; (1984)
#[[Willem Frederik Hermans]], ''[[The Darkroom of Damocles]]''; (1958)
#[[Willem Frederik Hermans]], ''[[Beyond Sleep]]''; (1966)
#[[J. J. Voskuil]], ''{{illm|Het bureau|de|Das Büro (Roman)|nl||no|}}''; (series; 1996 - 2000)

== Criticism of Google ==
Former CEO Jeffrey Katz accused [[Google]] of being a [[monopoly]] and killing small business competitors. Katz published an opinion piece clearly stating that users end up only seeing top search results that have been sponsored by companies. He claims that companies are able to pay Google for "that privilege". Google responded by stating that there is choice online and that "there has never been as much choice online as there is today" and noting that their advertisements are always marked clearly so users are able to see the sponsorship. Katz really stressed ending the bias of the search results and to provide consumers with neutral search results.&lt;ref&gt;Lardinois, Frederic.

'''''R v Smith''''' is an important case in [[South African criminal law]], especially on the defence of obedience to orders. The court adopted what has since been described as "a middle course" between, on the one hand, the view "that the subordinate has a duty of blind obedience to her superior’s order", and, on the other, the view "that the fact that the subordinate obeyed an order is not a ground of justification".&lt;ref&gt;Snyman ''Criminal Law'' 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The court described these as the “two extreme propositions of law”, and opted for a middle course by adopting and applying the following rule: A soldier is compelled to obey an order only if the order is manifestly lawful. If it is manifestly unlawful, he may not obey it; if he does, he acts unlawfully. This test has been applied in later South African decisions. According to CR Snyman,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The middle-course approach was obviously favoured by the compilers of the Constitution, because section 199(6) of the Constitution provides that no member of any security service may obey a manifestly illegal order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''R v Steyn''''' (1954), an important case in [[South Africa|South African]] [[Criminal procedure in South Africa|criminal procedure]], dealt with an application for leave to [[appeal]] against a judgment of the High Court of [[Southern Rhodesia]], dismissing an appeal from a decision by a [[magistrate]], in which he convicted the applicant of the crime of theft as defined by the Stock and Produce Theft Repression Act.

The court held that the basic rule was that the police docket and contents thereof were privileged and the defense is not entitled to access to it.

Therefore, when statements were procured from [[Witness|witnesses]] for the purpose that what they said would be given in evidence in a lawsuit that was contemplated, these statements were protected against disclosure until at least the conclusion of the proceedings, which would include any appeal or similar step after the decision in the court of first instance.

This protection against disclosure applied in both [[Civil procedure|civil]] and [[Criminal procedure|criminal]] trials.

There was, however, an ethical rule which obliged the [[prosecutor]] to disclose if a witness deviated from his original statement.

Where there was a serious discrepancy between the proof of a Crown witness and what he said on [[oath]] at the trial, the prosecutor must direct attention to that fact and, unless there was special and cogent reason to the contrary, make the statement available for [[cross-examination]].

This approach, which applied in South Africa before the advent of its new constitutional dispensation, has been described as "trial by ambush."

A '''refrigerator magnet''' or '''fridge magnet''' is an [[ornament (art)|ornament]], often whimsical, attached to a small [[magnet]], which is used to post items such as [[shopping list]]s, [[child art]] or reminders on a [[refrigerator]] door, or which simply serves as decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitehorn|first=Katharine|title=Cold comfort: in case of emergencies, please contact my fridge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/15/katharine-whitehorn-fridge-last-wishes?newsfeed=true|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 15, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Buren|first=Abby|title=Dear Abby|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cK0nAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_M8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6098,5695522&amp;dq=refrigerator-magnet&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal|date=October 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLaughlin|first=Patricia|title=Households getting stuck on refrigerator magnets|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m2peAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TmENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1484,6308603&amp;dq=refrigerator-magnet&amp;hl=en|accessdate=October 31, 2009|newspaper=Pennsylvania Observer Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refrigerator magnets come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and may have promotional messages placed on them. Refrigerator magnets are popular [[souvenir]] and [[Collecting|collectible]] objects.

==Manufacture==
[[File:Gursky 99 Cent Diptychon inspiration.jpg|thumb|retail display of magnets]]
The first fridge magnets were cylindrical or solid rectangular magnets. Later, a flexible magnet was developed, composed of a high-[[coercivity]] [[ferromagnetic]] compound (usually [[ferric oxide]]) mixed with a plastic binder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: Fridge magnet transformed|url=http://www.riken.jp/en/research/rikenresearch/highlights/6543/|publisher=Riken|language=en|date=March 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is extruded as a sheet and passes on a conveyor belt over a line of powerful cylindrical [[permanent magnet]]s. These magnets are arranged in a stack with alternating [[magnet|magnetic poles]] facing up (N, S, N, S,...) on a freely rotating shaft. This impresses the plastic sheet with the magnetic poles in an alternating line format. No electromagnetism is used to generate the magnets. The pole-pole distance is on the order of 5 mm, but varies with manufacturer. [[Ferrite (magnet)|Ferrite]] magnets are commonly used, too, with decorative elements attached to the magnets with adhesive. They were created in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HPbpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=ferrite+magnets+1920s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNw4fi8qbXAhVCbBoKHQaRCcwQuwUIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sound and Recording: Applications and Theory|first1=Francis|last1=Rumsey|first2=Tim|last2=McCormick|date=24 February 2014|publisher=CRC Press|accessdate=5 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic polarization==
[[File:Fridge Magnet Halbach.svg|thumb|right|[[Halbach array]] polarisation]]
[[File:Magnetic viewing film.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetic viewing film]] showing magnetic poles of a fridge magnet]]
Unlike most conventional magnets that have distinct north and south poles, flat refrigerator magnets are magnetized during manufacture with alternating north and south poles on the refrigerator side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e4eEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=refrigerator+magnet+alternating+north+and+south+poles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX0b2P9KbXAhXGXhoKHfHdBMwQuwUIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=After the Science Wars: Science and the Study of Science|first1=Keith|last1=Ashman|first2=Phillip|last2=Barringer|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=5 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be felt by taking two similar (or identical) refrigerator magnets and sliding them against each other with the "magnetic" sides facing each other: the magnets will alternately repel and attract as they are moved a few millimeters. One can note that magnetic field outside a uniformly magnetized thin sheet is actually zero, neglecting the edge effects (see, for instance, D. Budker and A. Sushkov, ''Physics in Your Feet", OUP, 2015''), so a uniformly magnetized magnet does not stick to a refrigerator. Most magnets have a special, slightly more sophisticated magnetization pattern called a [[Halbach array]].  This construction gives enhanced magnetic field on one side and almost zero magnetic field on the other.

Collecting magnets is a hobby, with some collectors specializing in magnets from their travels, or of a particular theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AP|title=Fatal attraction: Refrigerator magnets|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ejQdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jKUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6757,151092&amp;dq=refrigerator-magnet&amp;hl=en|newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News|date=December 1, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are sold at souvenir shops worldwide. There is no generally recognized term (e.g. [[numismatics]] for currency collecting) for magnet collecting. A Russian collector has proposed the term '''memomagnetics''' (Russian: ''мемомагнетика''), derived from the words ''memoriale'' (Latin) and ''magnetis'' (Greek)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmitnic.narod.ru/memomagneticaEng.html Web site of collector Dmitry Balashov] from Moscow, Russia&lt;/ref&gt; A collector of magnets would be called '''memomagnetist'''. These terms have been used by at least one Russian online community for magnet collectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.livejournal.com/magnitiki_ru/25164.html Community of magnet collectors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404072435/http://community.livejournal.com/magnitiki_ru/25164.html |date=2010-04-04 }} in [[LiveJournal]] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Collector's Lot magazine, in March 1999, Tony Lloyd of Cardiff, Wales, coined the term "thuramgist" for a "collector of fridge magnets".

===Large collections===
[[File:Fridge magnets board.jpg|thumb|Fridge Magnets on a board - Private Collection]]
At one time, the largest verified collection of refrigerator magnets belonged to Louise J. Greenfarb from [[Henderson, Nevada]] (suburb of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], United States). Her world record was included to the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' with 19,300 items as of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1997/Jul-08-Tue-1997/lifestyles/5604545.html Green Valley woman attracted to collecting refrigerator magnets], Las Vegas Review-Journal, 08.07.1997&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British "Book of alternative records", it grew to 29,000 as of February 2002, and later up to over 30,000 items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativerecords.co.uk/recorddetails.asp?recid=104&amp;page=cat Refrigerator magnets - Current world record], alternativerecords.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Over 7,000 magnets from Greenfarb's collection were exhibited at the [[Guinness World Records#Museums|Guinness Museum]] in Las Vegas, which has since closed.  According to her son, Bryan Greenfarb, as of November 2015 Louise still collects and has around 45,000 plus non-duplicate refrigerator magnets but the Guinness verification process, which can take over 6 plus months, is just too taxing to keep validating the exact number.

In January 1999, Tony Lloyd, a teacher in Cardiff, Wales, was interviewed by the Channel 4 Television programme ''Collector's Lot'' when it was ascertained that he had largest collection of fridge magnets in Europe at that time, over 2000.&lt;ref&gt;''Collectors' Lot'' UK Channel 4 Television - March 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2016 he had a collection of over 4500. He was again interviewed by the BBC and ITV during 2017. In February 2018, whilst on holiday in Sri Lanka, his 104th country, Tony's collection surpassed 5,000 magnets.

==Home crafts==
Refrigerator magnets are also popular as crafts projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB3731AB2564AE4&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | work=Chicago Sun-Times | first=Ginny | last=Holbert | title=GREAT GIFTS from LITTLE HANDS | date=December 9, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Skansens Bergbana''' is a [[funicular|funicular railway]] in the [[Skansen]] [[open-air museum]] and [[zoo]], located on the island of [[Djurgården]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

The Bergbana was built on the northwest side of the Skansen hill for the [[General Art and Industrial Exposition of Stockholm (1897)|Stockholm Exhibition]] of 1897, by [[Von Roll]]. The railway was single-track with a [[passing siding]] and had a rise of {{convert|30|m|0|sp=us}} over a total length of {{convert|107|m|0|sp=us}}, giving a [[Grade (slope)|grade]] varying from 25% to 34%. Service was provided by small 16 seat cars. The funicular was in daily operation until the 1940s, and in summer only operation until it completely closed in 1959. During the 1970s the railway was restored and slightly extended, reopening in 1973. Von Roll again supplied the equipment, including new and larger cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.funiculars.net/articles.php?art=skansen_se | title = Skansens Bergbana article | publisher = Funiculars.net | accessdate = June 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funicular has the following technical parameters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.funiculars.net/line.php?id=182 | title = Skansens Bergbana (II) database entry | publisher = Funiculars.net | accessdate = June 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lined sole.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[American sole]]s are a family of flatfish found in both freshwater and marine environments of the Americas]]

'''Sole''' is a [[fish]] belonging to several families. Generally speaking, they are  members of the family [[Soleidae]], but, outside Europe, the name ''sole'' is also applied to various other similar flatfish, especially other members of the sole suborder Soleoidei as well as members of the [[Pleuronectidae|flounder family]]. In European cookery, there are several species which may be considered ''true soles'', but the common or Dover sole ''[[Solea solea]]'', often simply called ''the sole'', is the most esteemed and most widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology of the word==
The word ''sole'' in English, سول پیس in Urdu, French and Italian comes from its resemblance to a sandal, [[Latin language|Latin]] ''solea''.&lt;ref&gt;Sole, in Skeat WM. A concise etymological dictionary of the English language.  Harper &amp; Brothers, 1896,  P. 449 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HKsVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA449 read online or download]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sogliola (IT) [http://www.etimo.it/?term=sogliola etymology from www.etimo.it]&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages, it is named for the tongue, e.g. {{lang-el|γλώσσα}}, {{lang-de|Seezunge}}, {{lang-nl|zeetong}} or ''{{lang|nl|tong}}'', {{lang-hu|nyelvhal}}, {{lang-es|lenguado}}, {{lang-ar|إلسان الثور}} Elsan Eth-thawr (for the common sole) ''{{lang|ar|literally meaning 'the tongue of ox' in Qosbawi accent}}''.

A partial list of common names for species referred to as sole include:

*In the ''sole'' suborder Soleoidei:
** The ''[[true sole]]s'', [[Soleidae]], including the [[common sole|common or Dover sole]], ''Solea solea''.  These are the only fishes called ''soles'' in Europe.&lt;!-- all have names of the form 'XXX sole' --&gt;
** The ''[[American sole]]s'', [[Achiridae]], sometimes classified among the Soleidae.&lt;!-- most have names of the form ''XXX sole'' --&gt;
** The ''[[tonguefish]]es'' or ''tongue soles'', [[Cynoglossidae]], whose common names usually include the word 'tongue'.&lt;!-- most have names of the form 'XXX tongue sole' --&gt;
* Several species of righteye flounder in the family [[Pleuronectidae]], including the [[lemon sole]], the [[Microstomus pacificus|Pacific Dover sole]], and the [[petrale sole]].

==Threats==
The true sole, ''Solea solea'', is sufficiently distributed that it is not considered a threatened  [[species]]; however, [[overfishing]] in Europe has produced severely diminished populations, with declining catches in many regions.  For example, the western [[English Channel]] and [[Irish Sea]] sole fisheries face potential collapse according to data in the UK [[Biodiversity Action Plan]].

Sole, along with the other major bottom-feeding fish in the [[North Sea]] such as [[cod]], [[monkfish]], and [[plaice]], is listed by the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]] as "outside safe biological limits." Moreover, they are growing less quickly now and are rarely older than six years, although they can reach forty. World stocks of large predatory fish and large ground fish such as sole and [[flounder]] were estimated in 2003 to be only about 10% of pre-industrial levels.&lt;ref&gt;Clover, Charles. 2004. ''The End of the Line: How overfishing is changing the world and what we eat''. Ebury Press, London. {{ISBN|0-09-189780-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Ransom A. and Worm, Boris. "Rapid worldwide depletion of predatory fish communities." ''Nature'' '''423''', 280-283 (15 May 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Rex. 2006. "Save the big fish: Targeting of larger fish makes populations prone to collapse." Published online [http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061016/full/061016-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Wildlife Fund]] in 2006, "of the nine sole stocks, seven are overfished with the status of the remaining two unknown."

In 2010, [[Greenpeace International]] has added the [[common sole]] to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in [[supermarkets]] around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bauer-Stalo.png|thumb|right|An illustration from [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]'s folktale ''Stalo and Kauras''.]]
In the folklore of the [[Sami people|Sami]], a '''Stallo''' (also '''Stallu''' or '''Stalo''') is a large human-like creature who likes to eat people and who therefore is usually in some form of hostilities with a human. Stallos are clumsy and stupid, and thus humans often gain the upper hand over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=237|title=Fragments of Lappish mythology|author1=Lars Levi Laestadius |author2=Juha Pentikäinen |author3=K.

Börje Vähämäki}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve]] contains the remains of ancient, large building foundations, considered by the Sami to be the remains of Stallone dwellings. There is also a huge stone placed on some small pebbles on top near Lake Giengeljaure named stalostenen, which literally means stone Stallo. Legend dictates that a Stallo would have placed a stone here to prove his strength.

==Background==
The Birnie's owned a motel in Taupo. As a result of repeated floodings at the motel, there was a substantial loss of income, which ultimately led to the motel later being sold at a mortgagee sale. 

The flooding was the result of works by the local council, which resulted in the culverts not being able to handle the water, causing the flooding at the motel.

==Held==
The Court awarded damages against the council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7749">'''The Brentford Trilogy''' is a series of nine novels by writer [[Robert Rankin]]. They humorously chronicle the lives of a couple of drunken middle-aged layabouts, [[Jim Pooley]] and John Omally, who confront the forces of darkness in the environs of West London, usually with the assistance of large quantities of beer from their favourite public house, The Flying Swan.

==Novels==

The novels in this series are as follows:

# ''[[The Antipope]]'' (1981) – Pooley and Omally take on the resurrected [[Pope Alexander VI]], the last Borgia pope.
# ''The Brentford Triangle'' (1982) – Pooley and Omally thwart an alien invasion of Earth when the natives of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] (the fifth planet in the solar system before it exploded and became the asteroid belt) come back to the system and seek a new home.
# ''East of Ealing'' (1984) – Pooley and Omally are forced to deal with a high-tech Satanic takeover of Earth by way of [[Barcode|barcoding]] the entire population, aided by a temporally-relocated version of [[Sherlock Holmes]].
# ''The Sprouts of Wrath'' (1988) – the unlikely decision to site the next [[Olympic Games]] in Brentford threatens to disrupt Pooley and Omally's way of life, as the evil Kaleton threatens to turn the stadium into a monster to destroy humanity.
# ''The Brentford Chainstore Massacre'' (1997) – as the [[millennium]] comes early for Brentford, Dr. Steven Malone finds a way to [[Human cloning|clone]] [[Jesus]] from the [[Turin Shroud]], as a police inspector called Fred (who sold his soul to the devil for ultimate power) attempts to blackmail Pooley into arranging a ceremony that will give his Master power over all the world.
#''[[Sex and Drugs and Sausage Rolls]]'' (2000) – Omally manages a rock group, the lead singer of whom has the power to heal the sick. This book also sees the return of Soap Distant and Small Dave. In this book, Pooley suffers a brutal, but not long-term death.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}
#''[[Knees Up Mother Earth]]'' (2004) – there's big trouble in little Brentford. Property developers are planning to destroy Griffin Park, the borough's beloved football ground, intending to dig up the creature buried underneath it – namely, the serpent that tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden; the source of original sin. As well as being the seventh book in The Brentford Trilogy, it is also the second book in [[The Witches of Chiswick]] Trilogy.
#''[[The Brightonomicon]]'' (2005) – [[Hugo Rune]] and his [[amnesia]]c assistant Rizla work to stop [[Count Otto Black]] from finding the Chronovision.  Unlike the other novels in the series, it is set in [[Brighton]] and Omally only makes an appearance in the final chapter. It is revealed that Rizla on this occasion  (Rune's many acolytes are always called Rizla), is actually Pooley.
#''[[Retromancer]]'' (2009) – the sequel to ''[[The Brightonomicon]]'' again pairs the young [[Jim Pooley]] with [[Hugo Rune]] in another series of adventures only set partially in [[Brentford]]. This book also forms a prequel to ''[[The Antipope]]''. Set in a dystopia, history has been changed: Germany won World War II, America is a nuclear wasteland, and Jim Pooley and Hugo Rune must set it right.
#''The Lord of the Ring Roads'' (2017) – the first of the last Brentford Trilogy.

Several of Rankin's other novels feature Pooley and Omally, but are not part of The Brentford Trilogy:
*''[[They Came And Ate Us (Armageddon II: The B-Movie)]]'' (1991) – Pooley and Omally make a brief appearance as one of a number of "trick endings". 
*''[[The Most Amazing Man Who Ever Lived]]'' (1995) – Pooley and Omally make a brief appearance, offering their help to Tuppe as he plans to free the book's lead character, Cornelius Murphy, from prison. Before they can put their plan into action Cornelius reveals he has already escaped without their help.
*''[[Nostradamus Ate My Hamster]]'' (1996) – a movie prop-house worker finds a way to put old stars back on the silver screen. Over the course of the book, he learns of the legends of Pooley and Omally and sets out in search of ''The Flying Swan'', culminating in a desperate race to stop the return of [[Adolf Hitler]].
*''[[Web Site Story]]'' (2002) – set in the year 2022, Pooley and Omally have long since passed into the myths and legends of Brentford lore. As people start vanishing into thin air in Brentford, the staff of the ''Brentford Mercury'' investigate.

Although the books theoretically form a series, actually there is little continuity between volumes. World-changing events that take place in one book are usually ignored in following volumes, and it is very rare for the events of a previous book to be referred to.
For example, the character of shopkeeper [[Norman Hartnell]] (not that one) is abandoned by his wife yet is inexplicably reunited with her in later books. Soap Distant also appears in later books as a Brentford resident despite being declared dead, becoming an albino and dwelling beneath the earth.

==Recurring characters==
*John Vincent Omally and Jim Pooley – an Irishman living in Brentford and his best friend. The 'heroes' of the series.
*Neville – the part-time barman (who is actually full-time since nobody knows where the real one is) who holds down the Flying Swan in Brentford.
*Norman Hartnell – Brentford shopkeeper and inventor of various bizarre gadgets, including a means of transporting the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] from Egypt to Brentford. Not to be confused with the other [[Norman Hartnell]].
*Old Pete and Chips – Old Pete (Age unconfirmed, although he seems to be over a hundred) always appears in the Flying Swan, and Chips is his scraggly dog.  He appears as a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] street urchin in ''[[The Witches of Chiswick]]'' but is known by the name 'Winston'.  In ''[[Knees Up Mother Earth]]'' he accomplained [[H.G Wells]] to the 20th century where his older self tells him to buy shares in the [[Ford Motor Company]].
*Professor Slocombe – aged, wise [[magician (fantasy)|magician]] who often supplies much of the exposition about the various enemies present in the series (He was apparently [[Merlin]] in the distant past). Is once described as bearing a resemblance to Peter Cushing. Has a butler named Gammon.

'''''The Young Ones''''' is a [[British sitcom]], broadcast in the United Kingdom from 1982 to 1984 in two six-part series. Shown on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], it featured [[Anarchy|anarchic]], offbeat humour which helped bring [[alternative comedy]] to British television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on [[MTV]], one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the [[BBC]]'s list of ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]s''. The show's title relates to the [[The Young Ones (song)|song of the same name]], written by [[Sid Tepper]] and [[Roy C. Bennett]], and sung by [[Cliff Richard]] and [[The Shadows]], which was a [[Lists of UK Singles Chart number ones|No. 1 UK hit single]].

''The Young Ones'' originated on [[London]]'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the show's cast had gained popularity at [[Comedy Store, London|The Comedy Store]].&lt;ref name="bbcyoungones"/&gt; [[Alexei Sayle]] was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive [[Master of ceremonies|compere]]. [[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]] and [[Rik Mayall]] worked as the double act [[20th Century Coyote]], which later became [[The Dangerous Brothers]]. [[Nigel Planer]] was also in a double act with [[Peter Richardson (actor)|Peter Richardson]] called "The Outer Limits".&lt;ref name="Duguid-20"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duguid|first=Mark|title=Boom Boom... Out Go the Lights (1980)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1119413/|work=BFI Screenonline.org|publisher=BFI Screenonline|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with [[French and Saunders]] and [[Arnold Brown (comedian)|Arnold Brown]], set up their own club called [[The Comic Strip]] in the [[Raymond Revuebar]] club in Soho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thecomicstrip/ |title=The Comic Strip Presents... |work=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of [[Jeremy Isaacs]] of [[Channel 4]]. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. [[Paul Jackson (producer)|Paul Jackson]] was installed as a producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476396/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Young Ones, The (1982-84)|website=www.screenonline.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson's project, ''[[The Comic Strip Presents...]]'', aired on Channel 4's opening night on 2 November 1982, with ''The Young Ones'' following a week later on BBC2.

The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend [[Lise Mayer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monahan|first1=Mark|title=Rik Mayall: his 10 best performances|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/comedy-news/10887340/Rik-Mayall-his-10-best-performances.html|accessdate=23 September 2017|work=Telegraph|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ben Elton]] (who had attended the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson.&lt;ref name="Duguid-20" /&gt; He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian. The show was voted number 31 in the BBC's [[Britain's Best Sitcom|Best Sitcom]] poll in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk:80/sitcom/top11to100.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102133855/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/top11to100.shtml|title=BBC - Britain's Best Sitcom - Top 11 to 100|date=2 January 2007|archive-date=2 January 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
The main characters were four [[Undergraduate education#English, Welsh, and Northern Irish system|undergraduate students]] who were [[Share house|sharing a house]]: aggressive [[Punk subculture|punk]] medical student, Vyvyan Basterd ([[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]]); conceited wannabe [[anarchist]] sociology student, Rick ([[Rik Mayall]]); oppressed [[Paranoia|paranoid]] [[hippie]] peace studies student, Neil Wheedon Watkins Pye ([[Nigel Planer]]); and the suave, charming would-be underground mob boss, Mike The-Cool-Person ([[Christopher Ryan]]). It also featured [[Alexei Sayle]], who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet's [[landlord]]—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "[[Bambi (The Young Ones)|Bambi]]" and the [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]-lookalike Police Chief in "[[Cash (The Young Ones)|Cash]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Evan|title=To understand Thatcherite Britain, all you need is The Young Ones|url=https://theconversation.com/to-understand-thatcherite-britain-all-you-need-is-the-young-ones-27839|publisher=The Conversation|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent [[slapstick]], [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequitur]] plot turns, and [[surrealism]]. These older styles were mixed with the [[working class|working]] and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[Motörhead]], and [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]].  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ham|first1=Robert|title=Ranking The Young Ones' Musical Performances|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/02/ranking-the-young-ones-musical-performances.html|publisher=Paste|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Stories were set in a squalid house where the four students lived during their time at the fictional Scumbag College.&lt;ref name="bbcyoungones"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Young Ones|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theyoungones/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be classified as a [[comedy of manners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macgregor|first1=Jody|title=The Young Ones|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-young-ones-mn0001798941|publisher=All Music|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Edmondson and Mayall had been using in [[20th Century Coyote]] for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing [[talking animal]]s or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaways]] with no relation to the main plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worst to Best. The Young Ones|url=http://www.anorakzone.com/youngonesrank1.html|publisher=Anorak Zone|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the series, the [[fourth wall]] was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and [[Breaking character|character]] to address the audience in his real-life [[Liverpool|Liverpudlian]] accent.

The show featured a wide variety of guest appearances by comedians, actors, and singers, including co-creator [[Ben Elton]], [[Dawn French]], [[Jennifer Saunders]], [[Hale and Pace]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Mark Arden]], [[Stephen Frost]], [[Jools Holland]], [[Mel Smith]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Chris Barrie]], [[Norman Lovett]], [[Lenny Henry]], [[David Rappaport]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Tony Robinson]], [[Andy De La Tour]], and [[Emma Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quirk|first1=Justin|title='Shut up you hippy!'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/oct/20/comedy.television|accessdate=23 September 2017|work=Guardian|date=20 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episodes in the second series sometimes included "[[Subliminal message|flash frames]]" (three frames, equivalent to one eighth of a second), but these were edited out of some repeats. These were included as a mockery of the public's fear of [[subliminal message]]s in television and music. Unlike original flash frames, which lasted only one frame, these were long enough to be noticeable without being identifiable. The images included the end caption of ''[[Carry On Cowboy]]'', a rusty dripping tap, a leaping frog, a dove in flight, a skier, and a hand making pottery.&lt;ref name="flashframe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cborn.nl/YoungOnes/Young%20Ones%20Flashframes.html|title= The Young Ones Flashframe Pictures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The episodes lasted 35 minutes, but are often edited to half-hour when repeated on the [[BBC]] or [[Satellite television|satellite channels]].

==International broadcast==

In the United States, ''The Young Ones'' started airing on MTV on 5 June 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTV 30th Birthday|url=http://www.mtvpress.com/shows/mtv_30th_birthday|work=MTV Press|accessdate=25 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925230928/http://mtvpress.com/shows/mtv_30th_birthday|archivedate=25 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show also ran on [[PBS]], [[USA Network]]'s [[Night Flight (TV series)|Night Flight]], [[Comedy Central]] in 1994, and BBC America in the early 2000s.

In New Zealand, the show premièred late at night on 30 August 1985, after [[TVNZ]] purchased the broadcast rights.

In the Netherlands, the show was aired in 1985 by public broadcaster [[VPRO]].

In [[Catalonia]], public broadcaster TV3 began airing the show in February 1986 on a Sunday evening slot. The show became very popular and got several re-runs in successive years. Indeed, in 2016, [[Nigel Planer]] appeared in a show involving foreign travellers visiting Catalonia. One of the characteristics of the Catalan dubbing is that Vyvyan speaks with a thick Catalan rural accent, totally opposed to his urban environment in the series.

==Music==
The series' theme song featured the cast singing Cliff Richard and [[The Shadows]]' UK No. 1 song "[[The Young Ones (song)|The Young Ones]]" (1961), the title song from the [[The Young Ones (1961 film)|film of the same name]]. Throughout the series there are many references to Richard, as Mayall's character is a fan.&lt;ref name=giuffre&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giuffre|first1=Liz|last2=Hayward|first2=Philip|title=Music in Comedy Television: Notes on Laughs|date=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317273578|page=63|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IUAlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=The+Young+Ones+TV+series+comedy+manners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xyNwX9L48O&amp;sig=F_PkbM2i7g6WWp5mVxZtvcwBI_E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixs5jkubvWAhXIBsAKHdrmAFYQ6AEIZDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Young%20Ones%20TV%20series%20comedy%20manners&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme over the end credits was written by [[Peter Brewis]], who also created the [[incidental music]] on many episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Young Ones (1982–1984) Full Cast &amp; Crew|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083505/fullcredits/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, after the second series, Planer (in character as Neil) reached No. 2 in the UK charts with a version of [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]]'s "[[Hole in My Shoe]]". The accompanying ''[[Neil's Heavy Concept Album]]'', a loose collection of songs and spoken comedy, included appearances by ''The Young Ones'' alumni [[Dawn French]] and [[Stephen Fry]].&lt;ref name="nightflight"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heuck|first1=Marc Edward|title="The Young Ones": The ’80s British sitcom helped define the MTV generation’s sense of humor|url=http://nightflight.com/the-young-ones-the-80s-british-sitcom-helped-define-the-mtv-generations-sense-of-humor/|publisher=Nightflight|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 the cast sang "[[Living Doll (song)|Living Doll]]" with Cliff Richard and [[Hank Marvin]] for [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. The song, a reworking of his 1959 hit, reached the top of the UK, Australian, and New Zealand Charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Sharon|title=80s Chart-Toppers: Every Chart-Topper Tells a Story|date=2012|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781780574110|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v_IyT35pJCgC&amp;pg=PT351&amp;lpg=PT351&amp;dq=The+Young+Ones+TV+series+Living+Doll+chart&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CowLejH6HS&amp;sig=4jKHBThPBrCRixLc0ldoa-lCuGo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivvo3BvLvWAhWhKMAKHc69BfMQ6AEIXzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Young%20Ones%20TV%20series%20Living%20Doll%20chart&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven of the twelve episodes had a musical guest performing in the house or street. By including the groups, the show qualified as variety rather than [[light entertainment]] by the BBC and was allocated a bigger budget than a sitcom. Groups that appeared included [[Dexys Midnight Runners]], [[Motörhead]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], and [[Madness (band)|Madness]], who appeared in two episodes. The one episode that featured no musical act still fulfilled the variety criteria by including a [[lion tamer]] whose presence also directly contributed to the plot.&lt;ref name=giuffre/&gt;

Some of these performances were omitted from DVD release for [[copyright]] reasons. Some musical acts were also edited out for similar reasons on some satellite reruns.

==Characters==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Young ones bambi.jpg|center|600px|thumb|Mike, Rick, Vyvyan and Neil representing Scumbag College on [[University Challenge]]]]

===Mike "The-Cool-Person"===
Portrayed by [[Christopher Ryan]]

Mike is the assumed leader of the group (within which Vyvyan is his enforcer) who frequently makes puns, which are either deliberately cheap or humorous.  These confusing, profound-sounding phrases baffle the others (for example, when asked by Rick if he stole his half an apple, Mike replies; "Well, if you're gonna sin you might as well be [[Original sin|original]].") Mike is supposedly the 'ladies' man' and often brags of his prowess with women, although he is shown to share his bed with an inflatable [[sex doll]] and practically admitted his [[virginity]] to the others in "[[Nasty (The Young Ones)|Nasty]]". He makes every attempt at wooing the opposite sex, being both forward and unsuccessful. During "[[Boring (The Young Ones)|Boring]]", however, he has an encounter with (and also instigated by) Vyvyan's mother, where (until [[Herpes|after a comment made by Rick]]), he makes progress, although her direct approach initially worries Mike.

Mike is a [[con artist]]: he always has some kind of plan to make quick money such as renting out Rick's bedroom as a [[roller disco]] and taking bids for the unexploded [[atomic bomb]] that fell into the house.  He also fancies himself to be a rising underground mob boss.  Mike attends Scumbag College only nominally as he has blackmailed his tutor and the Dean of the school for grants and successful grades.  This is shown in the title sequence of series 1 in which he is seen to pay a bribe in exchange for a qualification.  In "[[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones)|Summer Holiday]]" he muses, "I think I'll ask for one of those PhDs next year."  While it wasn't mentioned what he was studying at the college, when it once came up, in "[[Sick (The Young Ones)|Sick]]", by Mrs. Wheedon Watkins Pye when Neil was introducing him, he answers her, "''I'm in, what you'd call, a ''school of life'', Mrs. Pye''" (before groping her).

While Mike often does things at the expense of, or to the detriment of, his housemates, he rarely expresses the sort of open hostility that Rick and Vyvyan do, and seems to cause his housemates trouble only when it benefits him, rather than out of sadistic joy. While it is rare for him to be victim to violence, he has been on a few occasions; such as when he was flirting with a Christian, this resulted in her repeatedly kneeing Mike in the crotch. At the end of the "Living Doll" song with Cliff Richard, Vyvyan hit Mike and everyone else over the head with a hammer, knocking them out. Also when Mike was trying to nail plates to the dining table, he managed to nail his own legs to the table in the process. On another occasion, Mike accidentally knocked Neil out during a game of [[cricket]].

Mike has been shown to be helpful to the others on occasion; if any situation becomes problematic he does what he can to try and restore calm. He also tried to teach Vyvyan how to tell time in "[[Bambi (The Young Ones)|Bambi]]" and in the final episode "[[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones)|Summer Holiday]]", he comforts Vyvyan when he bursts into tears after crashing his car and when SPG dies.
He also appears to have more sense than the others, while he frequently says odd things and does little to stop his housemates causing chaos, he can be very rational if his own life is at risk or if he feels it's gone too far. Examples of this include trying to stop Vyvyan detonating the bomb, being concerned that Neil might suffocate when sick, forcing Vyvyan to stop using the dangerously modified vacuum cleaner and being the only one to have a (not very good) plan thought out when they rob the bank.
Perversely, when it is not of personal interest, he often pretends to misunderstand things that people say or make up nonsense for his own amusement or convenience.

Although generally aloof and laid back, Mike loses his cool when his authority is questioned, however small. For example, in "Summer Holiday" when Vyvyan tells everyone to shut up he was very indignant that this included him.
Mike is the shortest member of the four, and the best-dressed and groomed of all of them.  In the final episode, ''[[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones)|Summer Holiday]]'', Mike admits that he came from very poor beginnings out on the streets, and had sworn that he would never again go back to that life, thus his leap into a con artist's life in the first place.

Mike's surname is [[ambiguous]], ''The Bachelor Boys'' book refers to him as "The Cool Person" several times, but in different styles including quotes.

===Rick===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The World's Greatest Comedy Characters]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- Rick's surname was '''NEVER''' revealed during the course of the programme. It is not Prick or Britton as has been added. Thank you. --&gt;
Portrayed by [[Rik Mayall]]

Rick is a self-proclaimed [[anarchist]] who is studying sociology and/or [[Home economics|domestic sciences]] (depending on the episode). Rick writes bad poetry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rik Mayall, star of The Young Ones, dies aged 56|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27770266|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and styles himself "The People's Poet", believing himself to be the "spokesperson for a generation"; he is in fact a [[Hypocrisy|hypocritical]], [[tantrum]]-throwing, attention-seeking [[Diva]] and [[Cliff Richard]] fan, or, as Vyvyan describes him, "The classic example of an only child!" Rick constantly tries to impress the others using [[wit]] and humour, despite not having any discernible [[Aptitude|talent]]. The only time he comes close to succeeding is when it seems like he has wooed a girl; this turns out to be a lie, however, and he is exposed and punished (beset by Vyvyan) almost immediately. He insults Neil at every opportunity, using Neil as a target and an outlet, picks fights and bickers with Vyvyan and attempts to impress Mike. He is portrayed as being so self-absorbed that he believes he is the "most popular member of the flat" despite being disliked by virtually everyone he knows; even though his housemates hate him, he claims that they all "really are terrific friends". This is further emphasised in the episode "Bambi" when Neil reads graffiti aloud from Rick's History [[GCE Ordinary Level|'O' Level]] text book; "Prick is a wonker- signed, The Rest of the Class" which Rick dismisses as banter until Neil further reads "I agree with the rest of the class – signed, Teacher."

He [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|can't say the "R" sound]] correctly and instead enunciates a mixture of a "W" and a "R" sound. In the episode "[[Bomb (The Young Ones episode)|Bomb]]", he dictates his name to a woman who looks up in confusion and repeats it back as "Wick?". Vyvyan, for his own amusement, describes Rick's name as being spelled "with a silent P", as he wrote it on Rick's name card ("PRick") during the [[University Challenge]] against Footlights College in the episode "[[Bambi (The Young Ones episode)|Bambi]]".

Rick's political beliefs vary, depending on how they benefit his particular situation, but can usually be categorised as [[Political radicalism|radical]]. While Rick sees himself as both a [[revolutionary]] and follower of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]], in reality he has little understanding of the political ideals he purports to follow, and aspirations that far exceeds his reach. During "Cash" he is shown with a copy of Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]'', seemingly having fallen asleep while trying to read it.

He greatly dislikes [[Margaret Thatcher]], as is noted by his threatening to blow up England with an [[Atom bomb|atomic bomb]] in the episode "Bomb" if she "doesn't do something to help the kids, by this afternoon", and from negative references to Thatcher and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] mentioned in ''The Young Ones'' book ''Bachelor Boys''. However, Rick sometimes displays a markedly conservative mindset, contrary to the image he has adopted, as again in "Bomb" while talking to an old man at the [[Department of Health and Social Security|DHSS]] office (which he has mistaken for a post office), and in ''Summer Holiday'' comments "That's one thing I'll say for Thatcher, she definitely has put this country back on its feet".

Rick is [[vegetarian]], [[agnostic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Interesting |series=The Young Ones |episodelink=Interesting (The Young Ones) |seriesno=1 |number=5 |minutes=7:58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and wishes all men to love each other like brothers, except for Neil, whom he hates.
This hatred is ironic as in theory he and Neil share many values, such as a longing for a peaceful world and a hatred for meat and alcohol. However unlike Neil, Rick has been known to both drink (see time sbd interesting{{clarify| date= April 2018}}) and is occasionally physically violent, therefore his hatred of Neil merely shows his hypocrisy.
Despite this he claims to care for the people but nearly everything he does is hypocritical and self-serving.

Rick exaggerates or lies about his [[political activism]] and [[middle class|class]] background, which is exposed in the final episode, "[[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones)|Summer Holiday]]", when it is suggested he comes from a well-off family with Conservative beliefs. He is a closet-[[transvestite]], as during "[[Nasty (The Young Ones)|Nasty]]" Neil finds a dress in Rick's wardrobe with his name stitched in it. In the episode "[[Cash (The Young Ones)|Cash]]", Rick admits to Mike that he is unable to tell the time, a trait that he shares with Vyvyan.

In an interview for the BBC series ''[[Comedy Connections]]'', Ben Elton described Rick's character as the "try-hard wanna-be [[Political left|Leftie]]" typically found on university campuses.

===Vyvyan Basterd===
[[File:Adrian Edmondson.jpg|thumb|[[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]] ]]
Portrayed by [[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]]

Vyvyan, often referred to as "Vyv", is a [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]], [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]], [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]]ic, [[misanthropic]]  [[Punk (subculture)|punk]] medical student. He has spiked red hair and four metal stars seemingly embedded into his forehead. He wears a denim waistcoat over a black T-shirt, a black studded belt across his denim jeans and [[bovver boot]]s.&lt;ref name="brandstrategy mortimer 2001"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-80848008.html | title=Too bootilicious for your feet: call them what you like -- Dr Martens, Doc Martens, DMs, Docs -- but very few shoes have a youth following like Doc Martens | work=Brand Strategy | date=December 1, 2001 | accessdate=March 4, 2013 | author=Mortimer, Ruth}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Interesting (The Young Ones)|Interesting]]", he drinks a pint of blue liquid which makes his hair fall out and the number [[Number of the Beast|666]] is visible on the side of his head. He is extremely violent and regularly attacks Neil and Rick with pieces of wood, cricket bats, other large objects or simply his fists. For some reason he looks up to Mike, whom he never attacks and often addresses as "Michael". He despises Rick more than he does Neil; for example when Rick, Mike and Neil meet his mother at a bar in the episode "[[Boring (The Young Ones)|Boring]]", he calls both Neil and Mike his friends, but refers to Rick as "a complete bastard." This antagonistic relationship between Rick and Vyvyan makes them virtually inseparable, as the two spend by far more time together than with the other housemates, albeit this time is spent fighting.

Vyvyan owns a talking [[Glaswegian]] [[hamster]] named [[Special Patrol Group]] ("SPG" for short) of whom he is very fond, although SPG is also frequently subjected to Vyvyan's extreme violence. This is usually provoked, such as when SPG bit Vyvyan and made him destroy his cardboard [[submarine]] in "[[Flood (The Young Ones)|Flood]]" or plugging in the TV after Vyvyan swallowed it in "[[Bomb (The Young Ones)|Bomb]]". Vyvyan's mother is a barmaid and former shoplifter, who named him a girls name "Vyvyan", gave him his first gift (a box of matches) at 8-weeks-old, and before the events of "Boring" had not seen Vyvyan in ten years and still has no idea who his father is. Neil revealed that Vyvyan has more friends than the other housemates but "... apparently he doesn't like any of them."

Vyvyan occasionally displays feats of superhuman strength and resilience, such as surviving a pickaxe through his head, moving entire walls with his bare hands, lifting Neil above his head in a fight with Rick, biting through a brick (making the comment that some of the house's bricks explode), using dynamite to try and cure his hangover, and even being decapitated and re-attaching his own head. He eats just about anything from televisions and dead rats to [[caviar]] and cornflakes with ketchup.

Regardless of his violent and mostly simple-minded nature, Vyvyan seems to be the smartest of the group (though Neil does better in exams than him), and he has on a couple of occasions demonstrated his talent as a medical student. In the episode "[[Flood (The Young Ones)|Flood]]", he develops a [[potion]] to [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|transform a person into an "axe-wielding homicidal maniac"]], claiming that "it's basically a cure... for ''not'' being an axe-wielding homicidal maniac... the potential market's enormous!".  On occasion, he has made several eloquent statements regarding subjects ranging from Rick's manifest personality problems to the inherent dullness of ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'', and the end of "Oil" implies he manipulated the rest of the household, possibly for amusement. Vyvyan also appears to have good knowledge of [[electrical wiring|electrics]] and technology; on one occasion he wired the doorbell to a bomb "to pep it up a bit" so the housemates would be able to hear it, and he also added a small car engine to the [[vacuum cleaner]] as previously it "looked a bit on the tentative side" which then proceeds to suck up the carpet, the floorboards and a friend of Neil's. The vacuum also prompted one of the few clashes between Vyvyan and Mike; when Mike admonished Vyvyan and told him not to use it any more, Vyvyan replied by calling him a "poof". In the episode "Nasty", the boys trap a [[vampire]] in their bathroom, and when he denies being a vampire, Vyvyan successfully tricks him into admitting that he is. In "[[Bambi (The Young Ones)|Bambi]]" Vyvyan displays impressive mathematical talent as he worked out instantly that he has worn his three pairs of [[underpants|knickers]] 269 times each since their last wash. However, like Rick, he cannot tell the time from a watch.

Although Vyvyan is constantly unruly, he does possess a compassionate side; primarily in the episode "[[Cash (The Young Ones)|Cash]]", when he thought he was pregnant he was considering names to call his baby and he also patted his "bump" saying "that's my boy!" when it hit Rick in the face and knocked him into the fireplace. Also when Vyvyan began having "contractions" he appealed to the other housemates for help, this led to Neil getting a job in the police force (it was later revealed that he just had a really bad case of built-up [[Flatulence|gas]]). On another occasion, in the last episode "[[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones)|Summer Holiday]]" Vyvyan dissolved into tears because he crashed his car and also because it caused SPG's death while he was asleep on the car's radiator.

Vyvyan is the only member of the group who owns a car, a yellow [[Ford Anglia]] with red flames painted along the sides and has "Vyv" written across the back window. Neil is forbidden from touching his car, as when he suggested using it to listen to a tape, Vyvyan cheerfully reminded him that he would be killed if he even touched the car.
He also appears to have exceptional knowledge of driving and road awareness, as he demonstrated when he tricked the vampire in "Nasty" to admitting he was really a vampire rather than a driving instructor as he had initially said. Vyvyan is not the only house member who can drive, however, during the last episode Rick is briefly seen driving the stolen [[AEC Routemaster]] [[double-decker bus]].

===Neil  Pye===
[[File:Nigel Planer.jpg|thumb|[[Nigel Planer]]]]
Portrayed by [[Nigel Planer]].

Neil Pye, is a [[Melancholia|morose]], [[Pacifism|pacifist]], vegetarian [[hippie]] working toward a [[Peace Studies]] degree. He is frequently victimised by the other housemates and forced to do the housework, shopping, cleaning and cooking. He is never acknowledged for it unless it goes wrong. He normally provides tea to drink and [[cornflakes]] or [[lentils]] for his housemates to eat.

Neil is a [[Pessimism|pessimist]] and believes everyone and everything hates him, although he does have three hippie friends; one also named Neil, one named [[Warlock]] and a female hippie named [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Cash |episodelink=Cash (The Young Ones) |series=The Young Ones |series-no=2 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes him the second most sociable character behind Vyvyan and also the only character to have a female friend. He dislikes most forms of technology except for televisions and [[Videocassette recorder|video recorders]]. He appears to be a fan of cartoon series Scooby-Doo, missing an episode his major concern when the house is transported back to the Middle Ages in 'Time'. He avoids sleep, believing that it causes cancer, and in the episode "Boring" he is shown to merely be standing at his window waiting for dawn.  Neil frequently demonstrates a very literal interpretation of terms and phrases. For example, when Vyvyan says that his mother used to be a shoplifter, Neil responds "She doesn't look strong enough... to lift shops".

Neil wants the others to feel sorry for him, or just acknowledge his presence. He claims "the most interesting thing that ever happens to me is [[sneezing]]", the force of which is sufficient to blow a door off its hinges.

In the pilot episode "[[Demolition (The Young Ones)|Demolition]]", Neil is shown to have [[Suicide|suicidal tendencies]], attempting to kill himself at least three times. However, this was not carried through for the rest of the series, with the exception of the episode "Boring", in which he attempts to kill himself in a desperate attempt at relieving boredom. On only two occasions has Neil shown any form of aggression; this was when Rick insulted Neil's flared trousers in the episode 'Nasty'.  He also seemed to enjoy hitting people with his [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheon]] when he became a police officer in "Cash" and did the same to his housemates when he thought they had committed a robbery.

In the episode "[[Sick (The Young Ones)|Sick]]" in the second series, Neil's parents are introduced as [[upper middle class]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tories]] who look down on Neil for starring in such a disreputable comedy series. His father wonders why his son cannot be in a nice comedy, such as the ones Neil's mother likes e.g. ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]''. This provokes an angry tirade from Vyvyan, on his hatred of that show, followed by a parody episode of ''The Good Life'' where Neil is killed by Rick and covered with [[manure|garden fertiliser]] only for several of him to emerge from the ground later on.

As established in ''[[Neil's Heavy Concept Album]]'', Neil comes from Twickenham (his name punning on [[Eel Pie Island]]). His middle names ("Wheedon Watkins") are revealed in ''Neil's Book of the Dead''.

He is a fan of [[Hawkwind]], [[Marillion]], and [[Steve Hillage]]. More information about his musical tastes was revealed when the character 'guest v-jayed' on the still young MTV network in ca. 1985, playing several videos (e.g. [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], "[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]"), including his own hit "Hole in My Shoe", a cover version of the [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] song which Nigel Planer, as his character "neil" [with a small 'n'], took to number 2 in the UK singles chart in July 1984.

===Balowski family===
[[File:Alexei Sayle Cambridge 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Alexei Sayle]]]]
Throughout the two series, [[Alexei Sayle]] routinely appeared as many different characters, interjecting his own material into the programme in ways that emulated his comedy routines. His main role was that of the flat's landlord Jerzei (Jeremy) Balowski, which was the only character he reprised, appearing in "[[Demolition (The Young Ones)|Demolition]]", "[[Flood (The Young Ones)|Flood]]" and "[[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones)|Summer Holiday]]". The rest of the time, he was billed as playing various male members of "The Balowski Family", including nephew "Alexei Yuri Gagarin Siege of Stalingrad Glorious Five Year Plan Sputnik Tractor Moscow Dynamo Back Four Balowski"&lt;ref group=note&gt;Referencing the astronaut [[Yuri Gagarin]], the [[Siege of Stalingrad]] during World War II, the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union]],  [[Sputnik]] the first artificial satellite, and the [[Dynamo Moscow|Moscow Dynamo]] sports team.&lt;/ref&gt; (a protest singer), son Reggie Balowski (an international arms dealer), brother Billy Balowski (a lunatic who believed he was a taxi driver), cousin Tommy Balowski (a drunk), escaped convict Brian Damage Balowski, and a [[medieval]] [[jester]] "Jester Balowski" (with [[Helen Lederer]] as his sidekick).

Jerzei was apparently Russian; however, several times during the series he would break character, or in one case the fourth wall and declare directly to the camera "I'm not really foreign, you know – I just do it to appear more sophisticated!"  Also during a discussion between the guys about his nationality Vyv comments "He certainly knows a lot about the [[Beat music|Mersey Sound]]."— implying he is in fact from [[Liverpool]], although he is so worried when Mike lies about a visit from [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Moscow Dynamo]] ice hockey squad that he allows the gang to renege on their monthly rent.

In the second series, Sayle's characters also included a train driver, a [[Benito Mussolini]] look-alike (by day the head of the local police force, by night an entrant in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]), "Harry the Bastard" (manager of the local [[Rumbelows]] electrical goods store, disguised as a South African vampire) and, very briefly in an aside sketch that deliberately bore no relevance to the plot, a man in a bowler hat asking if he was in a cheese shop (a reference to the Monty Python [[Cheese Shop sketch]]).

===In-house relations===
Mike is the natural "leader" of the house. Always trying to make himself appear more important and exciting than he really is, he does appear to have done some of the things he claims to have done (such as getting Bambi the "[[Babycham]]" Advert in "Bambi"). He experiences little hostility from the other members of the house. If there is any "fruitful" or amicable relationship in the house it is between Mike and Vyvyan. Vyvyan accepts Mike's role as the house leader whereas Mike needs Vyvyan's physique and willingness to act forcibly to enforce his own authority (as was literally shown in "[[Oil (The Young Ones)|Oil]]" when Vyvyan became 'Col. Vyvyan', the right-hand-man to Mike's 'El Presidente').

Neil is unpopular, although he is the only one who performs any kind of household chores and is therefore needed by the other three.

Rick is the most disliked although he thinks very highly of himself. He tells poor jokes and stories (but finds them hilarious himself), is a would-be anarchist (although deep-down he is quite conservative), and frequently acts like a child when he does not get his way. He generally vents his frustration (when trying to impress the others) on Neil, since Neil never sticks up for himself and is ignored by the others. The majority of his anger is generated in endless battles with Vyvyan, which he invariably loses.

[[Rik Mayall]] once opined that the characters in ''The Young Ones'' form the basis of a classic [[nuclear family]], comprising Neil as the mother figure, Mike as the father figure and Vyvyan and Rick as the children, Vyvyan the boy and Rick the girl.&lt;ref name="youngfaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/tv/british-comedy/young-ones/part2/|title=British Comedy: The Young Ones FAQ (2/2) v1.43|website=www.faqs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fifth housemate===
In the first six episodes of the series, a person whose hair covers their face appears in the background of some scenes, such as to the left when Neil gets hit by Vyvyan with a kettle in "[[Bomb (The Young Ones)|Bomb]]". In the episode Demolition he appears slumped against the back wall when Rick is watching TV.&lt;ref name="youngfaq" /&gt; These rumours of a mysterious fifth housemate have been the subject of fan speculation on the internet. In 2016 journalist Peter Farquhar sent members of the cast and crew email enquiries about this unnamed character. Writer [[Ben Elton]] replied saying "I have no idea what you are talking about I'm afraid..." but Geoff Posner, one of the directors of the series replied saying that he and Paul Jackson "thought it would be fun to have some ghostly figure in the background of some scenes that was never explained or talked about..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/ben-elton-knew-nothing-about-the-young-ones-creepy-fifth-housemate-2016-6|title=REVEALED: There really was a creepy fifth housemate lurking in cult British TV show The Young Ones|first=Peter|last=Farquhar|date=18 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an event at the Bristol Slapstick Festival 2018, [[Ade Edmondson]] was asked about the fifth housemate during an audience question session and named the person playing the 'fifth housemate' as his university friend Mark Dewison. Mark also played a speaking role as Neil's friend (also called 'Neil') during series one episode "[[Interesting (The Young Ones)|Interesting]]". He emerges from Vyvyan's full vacuum cleaner bag and ends up being shoved into the fridge by Rick.

In an exclusive documentary ''How the Young Ones Changed Comedy''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://gold.uktv.co.uk/shows/how-young-ones-changed-comedy/ | title=How The Young Ones Changed Comedy | publisher=Gold.UKTV, producer Sean Doherty | date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aired in 2018 on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], series co-writer [[Lise Mayer]] stated that the idea was there had been a party at the student house at some point in the past and there was a person who had just never left. This is why you see them just hanging around.

==Finale==
{{main|Summer Holiday (The Young Ones)}}
In the final episode, the four students steal a red [[AEC Routemaster]] after robbing a bank (Special Patrol Group dies during their escape), only to drive it through a billboard with a picture of Cliff Richard on it and then over a cliff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kamm|first1=Juergen|last2=Neumann|first2=Brigit|title=British TV Comedies: Cultural Concepts, Contexts and Controversies|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137552952|page=141|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kijxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=The+Young+Ones+TV+series+bus+billboard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DGG8o56WSv&amp;sig=f5e6by0gdlz4G1kbe5POYhKeplw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi53u3HvrvWAhXLLsAKHa-pChEQ6AEIcTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Young%20Ones%20TV%20series%20bus%20billboard&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the bus tumbles down until it comes to rest at the bottom, at which point they proclaim—in unison—"Phew! That was close!", after which the bus explodes. Although Vyvyan and some of the others have had (what should have been) fatal accidents before without suffering any real effects, this time it really signified the end of the series. Even so, it did not stop The Young Ones from occasionally appearing on TV afterwards for charity, such as in [[Comic Relief]] in 1986 with a video clip and live performance of ''Living Doll''.

==Setting==
Although the series was set in [[north London]], many external scenes were filmed in [[Bristol]], namely the suburb of [[Bishopston, Bristol|Bishopston]], where the student house is situated at the top of Codrington Road. Other locations include the Fascist Pig Bank, the Launderette and the Army Careers Office, all around the corner on Gloucester Road. The pub in which Vyvyan's mum works, the Kebab and Calculator in the series, was the Cock of the North (since renamed the Westbury Park Tavern) in Northumbria Drive, Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Young Ones walk in Bristol|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bristol/hi/people_and_places/newsid_7683000/7683587.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief scene in a pharmacy was filmed outside GK Chemists, now taken over by Lloyds Pharmacy, in St Johns Lane, Bedminster. The shop was renamed "OK Chemists" for the scene, in which Mike goes to buy cough medicine, but orders £180 worth of [[Durex]] condoms instead - "Force of habit".

All four characters attended the fictional Scumbag College. As Neil sometimes wore a [[University of London]] T-shirt, it seems likely that Scumbag is one of the University of London's constituent colleges, although they were never seen attending the institution and were rarely seen studying.

==After the series==
The end of the series was not the last appearance of ''The Young Ones''. For the British charity television appeal [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]], the four recorded a song and video for Cliff Richard's "[[Living Doll (song)|Living Doll]]", accompanied by Richard and [[The Shadows|Shadows]] guitarist [[Hank B. Marvin]]. Alexei Sayle was not involved, as he felt collaborating with Richard was against the [[alternative comedy|alternative]] ethos of the show, but had already achieved chart success in 1984 with "[['Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?]]".

In 1984, Planer released an album of music and skits in character as Neil, entitled ''[[Neil's Heavy Concept Album]]''. Musical direction was by [[Canterbury scene]] keyboardist [[Dave Stewart (keyboardist)|Dave Stewart]]. It featured Stewart's alums [[Barbara Gaskin]], [[Jakko Jakszyk]], [[Pip Pyle]], [[Gavin Harrison]], [[Jimmy Hastings]] and Rick Biddulph. "[[Hole in My Shoe]]", a single taken from the LP, reached number 2. [[Soulwax]] used "Hello Vegetables" to kick off their Radio Soulwax mix "Introversy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neil's Heavy Concept Album|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/neils-heavy-concept-album-mw0000847135|publisher=All Music|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, MTV aired edited versions of the episodes.

At the 1986 Comic Relief stage shows, The Young Ones performed "Living Doll" live (following a short skit which involved Rick doing a comic song about showing his underwear and bodily parts, before being ejected from the group by Mike, and Vyvyan supposedly having backstage sex with [[Kate Bush]] with Neil as his [[contraceptive]]). The skit climaxed with Neil claiming Cliff Richard could not perform with them as he was "doing time" (the [[Time (musical)|musical Time]] was premiering the following week) and [[John Craven]] had been booked as a replacement, only for Cliff to then appear. However he was only available to appear on the second night of the run, with [[Bob Geldof]] replacing him on the other two nights.&lt;ref name="Comic Relief 1986"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sotcaa.org/pressarchive/comicrelief.html|title=Comic Relief 1986 |publisher=Comic Relief |date= |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On one occasion, Edmondson, Mayall and Planer as their "Young Ones" characters did a parody of the song "My Generation" by [[The Who]].

Mayall, Planer, and Edmondson reunited in 1986 for the Elton-written ''[[Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap]]''. The series had many of the same characteristics as ''The Young Ones'' as did Mayall and Edmondson's next sitcom ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]''. Ryan, for his part, was regularly recruited to play roles on associated series (such as ''[[Happy Families (1985 TV series)|Happy Families]]'', ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]'' and ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''). Mayall, Edmondson and Planer have also appeared in episodes of ''[[Blackadder]]''.

Both series were repeated consecutively over twelve weeks in early 1985, but went unrepeated for four years, when the second series was shown on BBC2. In the mid-1990s all twelve episodes of ''The Young Ones'' were shown on BBC2 in a 30-minute revised format, missing scenes and dialogue. The series was also shown on digital channel [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UK Gold]] throughout the 1990s. A mix of both the edited and unedited versions was shown in the 2000s (decade) on [[Dave (TV channel)|UKTV G2]] and [[Paramount Comedy 1]].

DVD releases were initially very basic: Only the US "Every Stoopid Episode" edition featured excerpts from existing documentaries, and no extra footage was included. Musical references proved difficult to clear so "[[The Sounds of Silence]]" (one line) and "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]" were excised from the US editions. A new DVD release of all episodes ("Extra Stoopid Edition") was launched in November 2007, containing new documentaries and two commentary tracks. This edition restores the line from "[[The Sounds of Silence]]" and "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]". The music video "Living Doll" featuring Cliff Richard has not been included on any edition, and neither is the live performance done for comic relief in 1986.&lt;ref name="Comic Relief 1986"/&gt;

==American pilot episode==
A pilot episode was filmed of an American version of ''The Young Ones'', titled ''[[Oh, No! Not THEM!]]''. It featured Planer as Neil and [[Jackie Earle Haley]],&lt;ref name="Holly Powell Studios"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollypowellstudios.com/credits.html |title=Pilots &amp; Series |work=Hollypowellstudios.com |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a claymation opening credit sequence. The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network did not pick up the series. It was produced by [[David Mirkin]].&lt;ref name="Holly Powell Studios"/&gt;

[[Robert Llewellyn]] wrote in his book ''The Man in the Rubber Mask'' (1994):

{{quote|''The Young Ones'' was taken over the Atlantic in the mid eighties, and Nigel [Planer] was the only member of the British cast to go. He had experienced a fairly hideous time, worried sick that he was going to have to stay there for six years with a group of people he hated who managed to make ''The Young Ones'' into a sort of grubby ''[[Benny Hill Show]]''. He was hugely relieved when the pilot was a flop and he was released from his contract.}}

==Links to other shows==
In the episode "[[Bambi (The Young Ones)|Bambi]]", the housemates appeared on ''[[University Challenge]]'', where they played against Footlights College, [[Oxbridge]], a reference to the [[Footlights]] drama club at [[Cambridge University]]. The Footlights College team was played by show writer [[Ben Elton]] and three actors who were once members of the real Cambridge Footlights: [[Emma Thompson]], [[Hugh Laurie]] and [[Stephen Fry]], the last of whom had actually appeared on the quiz show while at Cambridge. The episode title is a reference to the show's presenter, [[Bamber Gascoigne]], impersonated by [[Griff Rhys Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bambi|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074qw4|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode "[[Sick (The Young Ones)|Sick]]", the quartet enter a scenario parodying ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'', after Neil's mother says the sitcom should be more like ''The Good Life'' and Vyvyan has an outburst against it, saying, "It's so bloody nice! [[Felicity Kendal|Felicity 'Treacle' Kendal]] and [[Richard Briers|Richard 'Sugar-Flavoured Snot' Briers]]! They're nothing but a couple of reactionary stereotypes, confirming the myth that everyone in Britain is a lovable middle-class eccentric. And I hate them!"&lt;ref name="Observer 3 March 2013"&gt;{{cite news | title= Grieve for The Good Life? Not this Young One |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/03/the-good-life-the-young-ones| last= Logan | first= Brian | date= 3 March 2013| work= [[The Observer]] |publisher= [[Guardian Media Group]]| accessdate= 30 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayall and Edmondson elaborated on some of the series' concepts later in their sitcoms ''[[Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap]]'' (written by Elton, with additional material by Mayall) and ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]'' (written by Mayall and Edmondson. Christopher Ryan also made appearances as the character "Dave Hedgehog").

Most of the regular cast (and several of the guests) also appeared in [[Channel 4]] and [[BBC Two|BBC2]]'s ''[[The Comic Strip Presents]]'' comedy shows. All four main actors went on to gain reputations as both dramatic and comic actors.

In 1990, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] puppet series ''[[Spitting Image]]'' made reference to ''The Young Ones'' when four members of the [[Margaret Thatcher]] cabinet reminisced about their younger days, with all four playing one ''Young Ones'' character each – [[Cecil Parkinson]] as Mike, [[Douglas Hurd]] as Vyvyan, [[Michael Heseltine]] as Rick and [[Geoffrey Howe]] as Neil.

There was also complete series 1 and complete series 2 VHS releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buy The Young Ones|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00glhzn/products|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928133210/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00glhzn/products|archivedate=28 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video game==
{{main|The Young Ones (video game)}}
''The Young Ones'' is a video game based on the British comedy television series of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Young Ones|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/the-young-ones/3030-33650/|publisher=Giant Bomb|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game takes place in the students' home. The player can choose to play as either Mike, Neil, Vyvyan or Rick to explore the house and enter different rooms. The other characters become computer-controlled players. All characters can move around the house, pick up and drop objects, as well as break and fix things. The characters often talk, giving the player clues as to what the character is intended to do.
The aim of the game is to try and move out of the house with all the character's belongings in the shortest time possible. This is not so easy, because these possessions are typically not in their preferred condition, or are hidden around the house, and players need various tools to get to them. The other characters will move around the house, behaving in-character, occasionally moving around or further damaging the possessions - making the task harder.

The game was published by Orpheus Software, based in Hatley St George in Bedfordshire. The Young Ones characters were licensed from the owners of the BBC TV series, Rik Mayall, Ben Elton and Lise Mayer.

Due to difficulty in licensing the original series music from the BBC, an alternative music sound track was commissioned to sound similar to the original theme. Over 10,000 copies of the game were sold, mainly through Boots stores, Woolworths, and independent computer stores. Due to obscure bugs in the software, it was impossible to solve the game, although few users realised this at the time. Orpheus ceased trading before the problems could be remedied.

[[File:Influentza.jpg|thumb|Influentza Zine Issues 1&amp;2 From [[Long Beach, CA]], USA]]
A '''zine''' ({{IPAc-en|z|iː|n}} {{respell|ZEEN}}; short for ''magazine'' or ''[[fanzine]]'') is a small-circulation [[self-published]] work of original or appropriated texts and images, usually reproduced via [[photocopier]]. Zines are either the product of a single person, or of a very small group and are popularly photocopied into physical prints for circulation. A [[fanzine]] ([[Blend word|blend]] of ''[[Fan (person)|fan]]'' and ''[[magazine]]'') is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by [[Fan (person)|enthusiasts]] of a particular cultural [[phenomenon]] (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest. The term was coined in an October 1940 [[science fiction fanzine]] by [[Russ Chauvenet]] and popularized within [[science fiction fandom]], entering the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 1949.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Popularly defined within a circulation of 1,000 or fewer copies, in practice many zines are produced in editions of fewer than 100. Among the various intentions for creation and publication are developing one's identity, sharing a niche-skill or art, or developing a story, as opposed to seeking [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. Zines have served as a significant medium of communication in various [[subcultures]], and frequently draw inspiration from a [[DIY ethic|"do-it-yourself" philosophy]] that disregard the traditional conventions of professional design and publishing houses proposing an alternative, confident and ''self-aware'' contribution.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fanzines The DIY Revolution|last=Triggs|first=Teal|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8118-7692-6|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handwrittenzines, or carbon zines are individually made, emphasizing personal connection between creator and reader,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; turning imagined communities into embodied ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/250366/pdf|title=Why Zines Matter: Materiality and the Creation of Embodied Community|last=Piepmeier|first=Alison|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written in a variety of formats from [[desktop-published]] text to [[comics]], collages and stories, zines cover broad topics including [[fanfiction]], politics, poetry, art &amp; design, ephemera, personal journals, social theory, [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] [[feminism]], single-topic obsession, or sexual content far outside the [[mainstream]] enough to be prohibitive of inclusion in more traditional media. (An example of the latter is [[Boyd McDonald (pornographer)|Boyd McDonald]]'s ''Straight to Hell'', which reached a circulation of 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Jones, ''True Homosexual Experiences: Boyd McDonald and "Straight to Hell"'', Los Angeles: We Heard You Like Books, 2016, {{ISBN|9780996421812}}, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although there are a few eras associated with zine-making, this "wave" narrative proposes a limited view of the vast range of topics, styles and environments zines occupied.

== History ==

=== Overview and origins ===
Dissidents and members of socially marginalized groups have published their own opinions in leaflet and pamphlet form for as long as such technology has been available. The concept of zines had an ancestor in the [[Amateur Press Association|amateur press]] movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, which would in its turn cross-pollinate with the [[subculture]] of [[science fiction fandom]] in the 1930s. The popular graphic-style associated with zines is influenced artistically and politically by the subcultures of [[Dada]], [[Fluxus]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Situationism]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Many trace zine's' lineage from as far back as [[Thomas Paine|Thomas Paine's]] exceptionally popular 1775 pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's]]'' literary magazine for psychiatric patients at a Pennsylvania hospital and ''[[The Dial]]'' (1840–44) by [[Margaret Fuller]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Girl Zines: Making Media, Doing Feminism|last=Piepmeier|first=Alison|publisher=NYU Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=215|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== 1930s–1960s and science fiction ==
[[File:Reign_of_the_Superman.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reign_of_the_Superman.jpg|thumb|"[[The Reign of the Superman]]," a short story from the 1933 zine ''Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization'', which led to the creation of the [[comic book]] hero [[Superman]].]]During and after the [[Great Depression]], editors of "pulp" science fiction magazines became increasingly frustrated with letters detailing the impossibilities of their science fiction stories. Over time they began to publish these overly-scrutinizing letters, complete with their return addresses. [[Hugo Gernsback]] published the first [[science fiction magazine]], ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in 1926, and allowed for a large letter column which printed reader's addresses. By 1927 readers, often young adults, would write to each other, bypassing the magazine.&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; This allowed these fans to begin writing to each other, now complete with a mailing list for their own [[science fiction fanzine]]s that allowed them to write not only about science fiction but about fandom itself and, in self-proclaimed [[perzine]]s, about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allthumbspress.net/zineinfo.html|title=zine info|website=www.allthumbspress.net|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science fiction fanzine]]s vary in content, from short stories to convention reports to fanfiction were one of the earliest incarnations of the zine and influenced subsequent publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingdb/zines/timeline/|title=Bingham Center Zine Collections {{!}}|website=library.duke.edu|accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Zinesters" like [[Lisa Ben]] and [[Jim Kepner]] honed their talents in the science fiction fandom before tackling gay rights, creating zines such as "Vice Versa" and "ONE" that drew networking and distribution ideas from their SF roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scpr.org/programs/offramp/2015/09/04/44365/how-gay-rights-got-its-start-in-science-fiction/?slide=1|title=LGBT found a voice in science fiction|date=4 September 2015|website=Southern California Public Radio|publisher=scpr.org|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of leading science fiction and fantasy authors rose through the ranks of fandom, creating "pro-zines" such as [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Isaac Asimov]]. The first science fiction fanzine, ''[[The Comet]]'', was published in 1930 by the Science Correspondence Club in [[Chicago]] and edited by [[Raymond A. Palmer]] and [[Walter Dennis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of Science Fiction Fandom: A Reconstruction|last=Moskowitz, Sanders|first=Sam, Joe|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Westport, CT|pages=17–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of [[Superman]] (a bald-headed villain) appeared in the third issue of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s 1933 fanzine ''Science Fiction''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Star Trek ===

The first media fanzine was a ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan publication called ''Spockanalia'', published in September 1967&lt;ref name="verba2003"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf|title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan &amp; Zine History, 1967-1987|author=Verba, Joan Marie|publisher=FTL Publications|year=2003|isbn=0-9653575-4-6|location=Minnetonka MN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/nyregion/21winston.html?pagewanted=print|title=Joan Winston, ‘Trek' Superfan, Dies at 77|last=Grimes|first=William|date=September 21, 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by members of the [[Lunacon|Lunarians]].&lt;ref name="cbs2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCvIZpCSRA0C&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;ots=5-EkbayXwL&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Science Fiction Culture|author=Bacon-Smith, Camille|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest examples of academic fandom were written on ''[[Star Trek]]'' zines, specifically K/S ([[Captain Kirk|Kirk]]/[[Spock]]) [[Slash fiction|slash]] zines, which displayed a gay relationship between the two. Author [[Joanna Russ]] wrote in her 1985 analysis of K/S zines that slash fandom at the time consisted of around 500 core fans and was 100% female.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gn9ul3LHiv4C|title=Cultural Studies|last=Grossberg|first=Lawrence|last2=Nelson|first2=Cary|last3=Treichler|first3=Paula|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135201265|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russ observed that while SF fans looked down on Star Trek fans, Star Trek fans looked down on K/S writers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kirk/Spock zines contained [[Fan fiction|fanfiction]], artwork, and poetry created by fans. Zines were then sent to fans on a mailing list or sold at conventions. Many had high production values and some were sold at convention auctions for hundreds of dollars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"K/S not only speaks to my condition. It is written in Female. I don't mean that literally, of course. What I mean is that I can read it without translating it from the consensual, public world, which is sexist, and unconcerned with women per se, and managing to make it make sense to me and my condition."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;"Concerning K/S." Joanna Russ Papers, Series II: Literary Works: Box 13, Folder #, Page 25. University of Oregon Special Collections.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Janus and Aurora ===

''[[Janus (science fiction magazine)|Janus]]'', later called ''Aurora'', was a science fiction feminist zine created by Janice Bogstad and [[Jeanne Gomoll]] in 1975. It contained short stories, essays, and film reviews. Among its contributors were authors such as [[Octavia E. Butler|Octavia Butler]], [[Joanna Russ]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], and [[Suzette Haden Elgin|Suzette Hayden Elgin]]. ''Janus/Aurora'' was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for "Best Fanzine" in 1978, 1979, and 1980. ''Janus/Aurora'' was the most prominent science fiction feminist zine during its run, as well as one of the only zines that dealt with such content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sf3.org/history/janus-aurora-covers/|title=Janus &amp; Aurora {{!}}|website=sf3.org|accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comics ===
Comics were mentioned and discussed as early as the late 1930s in the [[Science fiction fanzines|fanzines]] of [[science fiction fandom]]. They often included fan artwork based on existing characters as well as discussion of the history of comics. Through the 1960s, and 1970s, comic fanzines followed some general formats, such as the industry news and information magazine (''[[The Comic Reader]]'' was one example), interview, history and review-based fanzines, and the fanzines which basically represented independent comic book-format exercises.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1936, [[David Kyle]] published '' The Fantasy World '', possibly the first [[comics]] fanzine.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, David. [http://jophan.org/mimosa/m24/kyle.htm "Phamous Phantasy Phan"]. [[Mimosa (magazine)|''Mimosa'']] no. 24, pp. 25-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="powerofcomics"/&gt;

Malcolm Willits and Jim Bradley started ''[[The Comic Collector's News]]'' in October, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|QMnxCwAAQBAJ|Everyday Information: The Evolution of Information Seeking in America|page=286|keywords=The+Comic+Collector's+News|text=|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, [[Bhob Stewart]] published ''The EC Fan Bulletin'',&lt;ref name="powerofcomics"&gt;{{Google books|PA175|The Power of Comics: History, Form and Culture|page=175|keywords=EC+Fan+Bulletin|text=|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which launched [[EC Comics|EC]] fandom of imitative EC fanzines. Among the wave of EC fanzines that followed, the best-known was [[Ron Parker (writer)|Ron Parker]]'s ''Hoo-Hah! In 1960, [[Richard A. Lupoff|Richard and Pat Lupoff]] launched their [[Science fiction fandom|science fiction]] and comics fanzine [[Xero (SF fanzine)|Xero]] and in 1961, [[Jerry Bails]]' [[Alter Ego (fanzine)|Alter Ego]], devoted to [[Superhero|costumed heroes]], became a focal point for superhero comics fandom.&lt;ref name="powerofcomics"/&gt;

=== Horror ===
[[Calvin T. Beck]]'s ''Journal of Frankenstein'' (later ''[[Castle of Frankenstein]]'') and Gary Svehla's ''Gore Creatures'' were the first horror fanzines created as more serious alternatives to the popular [[Forrest J Ackerman]] 1958 magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].''{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} ''Garden Ghouls Gazette'' &amp;ndash; a 1960s horror title under the editorship of Dave Keil, then Gary Collins—was later headed by [[Frederick S. Clarke]] and in 1967 became the respected journal ''[[Cinefantastique]].'' It later became a prozine under [[journalist]]-[[screenwriter]] [[Mark A.

Several fans active in science fiction and comics fandom recognized a shared interest in rock music, and the rock fanzine was born. [[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] and [[Greg Shaw]] were two such SF-fans turned rock zine editors. Williams' ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' (1966) and Shaw's two California-based zines, ''Mojo Navigator'' ''Rock and Roll News'' (1966) and ''[[Who Put the Bomp]]'' (1970), are among the most popular early rock fanzines.

''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' (1966) quickly moved from its fanzine roots to become one of the first rock music "prozines" with paid advertisers and newsstand distribution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} ''Bomp'' remained a fanzine, featuring many writers who would later become prominent music journalists, including [[Lester Bangs]], [[Greil Marcus]], Ken Barnes, [[Ed Ward (writer)|Ed Ward]], [[Dave Marsh]], [[Mike Saunders]] and [[Richard Meltzer|R. Meltzer]] as well as cover art by Jay Kinney and Bill Rotsler (both veterans of SF and Comics fandom). Other rock fanzines of this period include ''[[denim delinquent]]'' (1971) edited by Jymn Parrett, ''Flash'' (1972) edited by Mark Shipper, ''Eurock Magazine'' (1973–1993) edited by Archie Patterson and ''Bam Balam'' written and published by Brian Hogg in East Lothian, Scotland, (1974).

In the 1980s, with the rise of stadium superstars, many home-grown rock fanzines emerged. At the peak of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s megastardom following the ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'' album and [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]] in the mid-1980s, there were no less than five Springsteen fanzines circulating at the same time in the UK alone, and many others elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Gary Desmond's ''Candy's Room'', coming from Liverpool, was the first in 1980, quickly followed by Dan French's ''Point Blank'', Dave Percival's ''The Fever'', Jeff Matthews' ''Rendezvous'', and Paul Limbrick's ''Jackson Cage''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} In the US, ''[[Backstreets Magazine]]'' started in Seattle in 1980 and still continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen's management and official website.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} ''Crème Brûlée'' documented post-rock genre and experimental music (1990s).{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== 1970s and Punk ==
[[Punk zine]]s emerged as part of the [[punk subculture]] in the late 1970s, along with the increasing accessibility to copy machines, publishing software, and home printing technologies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattern|first=Shannon|year=2011|title=Click/Scan/Bold: The New Materiality of Architectural Discourse and Its Counter-Publics|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=3|issue=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk emerged from the United Kingdom's black subcultures and became a genre for the working class because of the economic necessity to use creative DIY methods, echoed in both zine and Punk music creation. Zines became vital to the popularization and spread of punk spreading to countries outside the UK and America, such as Ireland, Indonesia, and more by 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loserdomzine.com/earlyirishfanzines.htm|title=Early Irish fanzines|publisher=Loserdomzine.com|accessdate=2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialhistory.org/en/collections/radical-zines-indonesia|title=Radical Zines - Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amateur, fan-created zines played an important role in spreading information about different scenes (city or regional-based subcultures) and bands (e.g. British fanzines like Mark Perry's ''Sniffin Glue'' and Shane MacGowan's ''Bondage'') in the pre-Internet era. They typically included reviews of shows and records, interviews with bands, letters, and ads for records and labels.

The [[punk subculture]] in the United Kingdom spearheaded a surge of interest in fanzines as a countercultural alternative to established print media.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The first and still best known UK 'punk zine' was ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'', produced by [[Deptford, London|Deptford]] punk fan [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]] which ran for 12 photocopied issues; the first issue produced by Perry immediately following (and in response to) the London debut of [[The Ramones]] on 4 July 1976.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Other UK fanzines included ''[[Blam!

In the US, ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]'' and ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'' were important punk zines for the Los Angeles scene, both debuting in 1977.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} In 1977 in Australia, Bruce Milne and [[Clinton Walker]] fused their respective punk zines ''Plastered Press'' and ''Suicide Alley'' to launch ''Pulp''; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with ''Fast Forward'', in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://messandnoise.com/features/4331535|title=Fast Forward: A Pre-Internet Story|author=|date=18 September 2011|website=messandnoise.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonwalker.com.au/fanzines-1970s.html|title=Fanzines (1970s)|author=|date=|website=Clinton Walker|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the American Midwest, a zine called Touch and Go described the area's hardcore scene from 1979 to 1983. We Got Power described the LA scene from 1981 to 1984, and included show reviews and band interviews with groups including [[D.O.A. (band)|DOA]], the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]] and the [[Circle Jerks]]. My Rules was a photo zine that included photos of hardcore shows from across the US an In Effect, launched in 1988 described the New York City punk scene. Among later titles, ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' is a major punk zine, with over 300 issues published. As a result, in part, of the popular and commercial resurgence of punk in the late 1980s, and after, with the growing popularity of such bands as [[Sonic Youth]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]], [[Bikini Kill]], [[Green Day]] and [[The Offspring]], a number of other punk zines have appeared, such as ''[[Punk Planet]]'', ''[[Razorcake]]'', ''[[Tail Spins]]'', ''[[Sobriquet (magazine)|Sobriquet]]'', ''[[Profane Existence]]'' and ''[[Slug and Lettuce (fanzine)|Slug and Lettuce]]''. The early American punkzine ''[[RE/Search|Search and Destroy]]'' eventually became the influential fringe-cultural magazine ''[[Re/Search]]''.

In the post-punk era several well-written fanzines emerged that cast an almost academic look at earlier, neglected musical forms, including Mike Stax' ''[[Ugly Things]]'', Billy Miller and [[Miriam Linna]]'s ''Kicks'', Jake Austen's ''[[Roctober (fanzine)|Roctober]]'', Kim Cooper's ''[[Scram (fanzine)|Scram]]'', P. Edwin Letcher's ''[[Garage &amp; Beat]]'', and the UK's [[Shindig! (magazine)|Shindig!]] and Italy's ''[[Misty Lane]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Mark Wilkins, the promotion director for 1982 onwards US punk/thrash label [[Mystic Records]], had over 450 US fanzines and 150 foreign fanzines he promoted to regularly. He and Mystic Records owner Doug Moody edited ''The Mystic News Newsletter'' which was published quarterly and went into every promo package to fanzines. Wilkins also published the highly successful Los Angeles punk humor zine ''Wild Times'' and when he ran out of funding for the zine syndicated some of the humorous material to over 100 US fanzines under the name of Mystic Mark.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== ''Factsheet Five'' ==
During the 1980s and onwards, ''[[Factsheet Five]]'' (the name came from a short story by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]), originally published by [[Mike Gunderloy]] and now defunct, catalogued and reviewed any zine or small press creation sent to it, along with their mailing addresses. In doing so, it formed a networking point for zine creators and readers (usually the same people). The concept of ''zine'' as an art form distinct from ''fanzine'', and of the "zinesters" as member of their own subculture, had emerged. Zines of this era ranged from perzines of all varieties to those that covered an assortment of different and obscure topics. Genres reviewed by Factsheet Five included quirky, medley, fringe, music, punk, grrrlz, personal, science fiction, food, humour, spirituality, politics, queer, arts &amp; letters, comix.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Commercialization ===
Starting in this decade, multinational companies started appropriating and commodifying zines and DIY culture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Their faux zines created a commercialized [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|''hipster'']] lifestyle. By late in the decade, independent zinesters were accused of "selling out" to make a profit.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Distribution and circulation ==
Before the invention of the [[printing press]] (1440), the Mesopotamians, Chinese and Egyptians used stamps and presses to emboss images into clay and print on cloth (BC).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prepressure.com/printing/history|title=Printing History|last=|first=|date=|website=PrePressure|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of [[paper]] in the second century AD, reproduction of literature became more efficient.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The thirteenth century brought [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]] and [[relief printing]] to the scene, a method used to produce religious scripts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Since then, [[offset printing]] (1875), the [[mimeograph]] (1886), the duplicator/''"[[Spirit duplicator|ditto machine]]"'' (1920s), [[Xerography]] (1938), [[inkjet printing]] (1951), [[laser printing]] (1965), and [[digital printing]] (1991) have made the process increasingly more accessible to the general public. Comparatively, digital printing produces 2,400 times more sheets per hour than the original printing press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kaocollins.com/historyofprinting/|title=Visual History of the Evolution of Printing|last=Collins|first=Kao|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zines are sold, traded or given as gifts at symposiums, publishing fairs, record and book stores and concerts, via independent media outlets, zine 'distros', mail order or through direct correspondence with the author. They are also sold online on distro websites, [[Etsy]] shops, blogs, or social networking profiles and are available for download. While zines are generally self-published, there are a few independent publishers who specialize in art zines such as Nieves Books in [[Zürich|Zurich]], founded by Benjamin Sommerhalder, and [[Café Royal Books]] founded by Craig Atkinson in 2005. In recent years a number of photocopied zines have risen to prominence or professional status and have found wide bookstore and online distribution. Notable among these are ''[[Giant Robot (magazine)|Giant Robot]]'', ''[[Dazed|Dazed &amp; Confused]]'', ''[[Bust (magazine)|Bust]]'', ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'', ''[[Aaron Cometbus|Cometbus]]'', ''Doris'', ''Brainscan'', The Miscreant, and ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Libraries ===
A number of major public and academic [[Library|libraries]] carry zines and other small press publications, often with a specific focus (e.g. women's studies) or those that are relevant to a local region.

=== Zine Fests, Workshops and Clubs ===
[[File:LA_Zinefest_2017.jpg|thumb|Zebrapizza tabling at the Los Angeles Zinefest in 2017|left|178x178px]]
There has been a recent insurgence in the alternative publication culture, in tandem with the influx of zine libraries and as a result of the digital age, which has sparked zine festivals across the globe. [https://lazinefest.com The Los Angeles Zine Fest], which is considered to be one of the biggest in the United States started in 2012 with only a handful of exhibitors, now hosting over 200 exhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lazinefest.com/2018-exhibitors/|title=LA Zine Fest Exhibitors|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Zine workshop with the SUNY New Paltz Zine Community and Design Society .png|thumb|158x158px|Zine workshop with SUNY New Paltz Zine Community and Design Society, 2017]]Other big zine fests across the globe include, [http://www.sfzinefest.org San Francisco Zine Fest], [https://brooklynzinefest.com Brooklyn Zine Fest], [http://chicagozinefest.org Chicago Zine Fest] [https://feministzinefestnyc.wordpress.com Feminist Zine Fest], Amsterdam Zine Jam, and [http://www.stickyinstitute.com Sticky Zine Fair]. At each zine fest, the zinester can be their own independent distributor and publisher simply by standing behind a table to sell or barter their work. Over time, zinesters have added posters, stickers, buttons and patches to these events. In many libraries, schools and community centers around the world, Zinesters hold meetings to create, share, and pass down the art of making zines.

== 2000s and the effect of the Internet ==

With the rise of the Internet in the mid-1990s, zines initially faded from public awareness possibly due to the ability of private web-pages to fulfill much the same role of personal expression. Indeed, many zines were transformed into [[Webzine]]s, such as [[Boingboing]] or [[monochrom]]. The metadata standard for cataloging zines is ''xZineCorex'', which maps to [[Dublin Core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zinelibraries.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Zinecore-Zine-Flats1.pdf|title=xZineCorex: An Introduction|last1=Miller|first1=Milo|publisher=Milo Miller|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-zine creators were originally referred to as "adopters" because of their use of pre-made type and layouts, making the process less ambiguous.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since, social media, blogging and vlogging have adopted a similar do-it-yourself publication model, with the most efficient form of communication yet.

In the UK ''[[Fracture (fanzine)|Fracture]]'' and ''[[Reason To Believe (fanzine)|Reason To Believe]]'' were significant fanzines in the early 2000s, both ending in late 2003. ''[[Rancid News]]'' filled the gap left by these two zines for a short while. On its tenth issue ''Rancid News'' changed its name to ''[[Last Hours]]'' with 7 issues published under this title before going on hiatus. ''Last Hours'' still operates as a [[webzine]] though with more focus on the anti-authoritarian movement than its original title. ''[[Artcore Fanzine]]'' (established in 1986) continues to this day, recently publishing a number of 30 year anniversary issues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Alt.zines ===

The [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] ''alt.zines'' was created in 1992 by Jerod Pore and Edward Vielmetti for the discussion of zines and zine-related topics. Since that time, alt.zines has seen more than 26,000 postings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zinewiki.com/Alt.zines|title=Alt.Zines|last=|first=|date=|website=ZineWiki|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1990s alt.zines was the only online forum for zinesters to promote, talk, and discuss small publishing issues and tips. It was a place where a zine reader or first time publisher could rub elbows with infamous zinesters.

=== Zine Wiki ===

An open-source wiki site solely for zines, [[small press]] publications and [[Alternative media|independent media]] as well as their history. The online encyclopedia for zines was launched in 2006 by Alan Lastufka and Kate Sandler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZineWiki|title=ZineWIki|last=|first=|date=|website=wikipedia.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zinewiki.com/ZineWiki:Introduction|title=ZineWikie: Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=zinewiki.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television shows ===
Two popular kids shows in the late 1990s – early 2000s featured zine-making: ''[[Our Hero]]'' (2000–02) and ''[[Rocket Power]]'' (1999-2004).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The main character in ''Our Hero'', Kale Stiglic, writes about her life in the Toronto suburbs. The episodes are narrated and presented in the form of zine issues that she creates, inheriting her father's storytelling passion. The show won titles from the Canadian Comedy Awards and Gemini Awards during its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262980/awards?ref_=tt_ql_op_1|title=IMDb Our Hero Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The (1254) '''''Zitong''''' 字通 or '''''Mastery of Characters''''' is a [[Chinese dictionary]] of [[orthography]] that was compiled by the [[Southern Song dynasty]] (1127-1279) scholar Li Congzhou 李從周. It discussed [[logographic]] differences among [[Chinese characters]] written in the ancient [[Qin dynasty]] [[seal script]], standard [[Han dynasty]] [[clerical script]], and contemporary Song [[regular script]].

==Title==
The title combines two common words: ''zì'' [[wikt:字|字]] "character; script; writing; graph; style" and ''tōng'' [[wikt:通|通]] "communicate/connect (with); join; understand thoroughly; master". While the title is usually [[transliterated]] as ''Zitong'' or ''Tzu-t'ung'', English translations are ''Summary of Characters'' (Zhou and Zhang 2003: 72), ''General Dictionary of Chinese Characters'' (Yong and Peng (2008: 198), and ''(A Scholar) Versed in Characters'' (Theobald 2013).

Li Congzhou's choice of title was the name of an earlier character dictionary that is now a [[lost work]]: the (c. 500) ''Zitong'' 字通 by Yang Chengqing 楊承慶 of the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty. It contained 13,734 [[Chinese character|character]] [[headword|head entries]], which was more than the (c. 350) ''[[Zilin]]'' with 12,824 entries (Zhou and Zhang 2003: 72; Lin 2008). Yang's ''Zitong'' has been partially reconstructed from fragments of early texts and quotations in classical texts (Xu 2013).

The similarly titled (1671) ''[[Zhengzitong]]'' 正字通  "Correct Character Mastery" (with ''zhèng'' [[wikt:正|正]] "right; straight; correct") was published by [[Qing dynasty]] scholar Liao Wenying 廖文英, who bought and renamed the (1627) ''Zihui bian'' 字彙辯 "''Zihui'' Disputations", which was written by the [[Ming dynasty]] author Zhang Zilie 張自烈 as a supplement to the (1615) ''[[Zihui]]'' dictionary.

Furthermore, the Japanese lexicographer Shirakawa Shizuka 白川静 edited an identically titled (1996) ''Jitsū'' 字通 "Mastery of Characters" [[Japanese dictionary]].

==History==
In an [[alphabetic language]] like English, [[orthography]] means "Correct or proper spelling; spelling according to accepted usage; the way in which words are conventionally written. (By extension) Any mode or system of spelling." (''[[OED]]'' 2009, v. 4.0). When semantically extended into a [[logogram|logographic language]] like Chinese, it means "the way in which [[Chinese characters]] are conventionally written", which includes [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphic]] aspects such as the [[Chinese script styles|script styles]], [[stroke order]], and character structure.

The first Chinese orthographic dictionaries, or "'character model' dictionaries", were compiled during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) in an effort to rectify discrepancies among characters written in seal, clerical, and regular scripts, and to standardize [[Variant Chinese character|variant characters]] (Yong and Peng 2008: 197, 177). [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] put the scholar and calligrapher [[Yan Shigu]] (581–645) in charge of the [[Palace Library]] in order to "verify and authorize" the ''[[Five Classics]]'' (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 194). The Archival Bureau's duties were to print authoritative editions of the classic works, to collate the styles of characters, to check and proofread government texts, and to produce a standard orthographic handbook. This became the first Chinese orthographic dictionary, Yan Shigu's book the ''Zìyàng'' 字樣 "Character Models" (aka ''Yanshi ziyang'' 顏氏字樣 "Mr. Yan's Character Models") gave model samples of writing characters in different scripts, which his grandson Yan Yuansun 顏元孫 (d. 732) used as the basis for his ''[[Ganlu Zishu]]'' orthographic dictionary.

In addition to the ''Zitong'', various orthography dictionaries and character books were published during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), for instance, the ''Fugubian'' 复古編 "Return to Old Chapters" by Zhang You 張有 and the ''Peixi'' 佩觿 "Ivory Bodkin" by the painter [[Guo Zhongshu]].

==Text==
The ''Zitong'' was in one volume, and based upon the classic (121) ''[[Shuowen jiezi]]'' character dictionary. It included 601 [[Chinese character|character]] [[headword|head entries]], which were arranged into 89 sections according to the number of strokes in the regular script. The head character was in seal script and entries were in regular script, giving notation first, followed by the definition. All the exegetic interpretations quote the ''Shuowen jiezi'' without any other sources.

There were flaws in the ''Zitong'', such as listing some characters twice and inconsistencies in the 89-radical system. It did have a useful appendix with 82 popular erroneous writings, such as ''yīchang'' 衣常 instead of ''yīshang'' [[wikt:衣裳|衣裳]] "clothing; clothes" (Theobald 2013). Nevertheless, this dictionary was important for the study of lexicographical theories concerning dictionary compilation in the Song Dynasty (Yong and Peng 2008: 198).
