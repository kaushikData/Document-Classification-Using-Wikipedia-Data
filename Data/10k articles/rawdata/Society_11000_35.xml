      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2930">{{for|other imams of Yemen called Al-Mu'ayyad|Al-Mu'ayyad (disambiguation)}}
'''Al-Mu'ayyad Yahya''' (October 15, 1270 – 1346) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] whose tenure of the imamate lasted from 1328 to 1346.

Yahya bin Hamza was a member of the Zaidi elite, but not of the dynasty of the [[Rassids]] that usually provided imams. He was a 13th-generation descendant of imam [[Ali ar-Ridha]] (d. 818).&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Islam'', Vol. IV. Leiden 1934, p. 1296; http://www.hamidaddin.net/ftree/Zain13_AlHadiSharafaddin.htm (in Arabic). His pedigree is the Caliph Ali - al-Husayn - Ali - Zain al-Abidin - Muhammad al-Baqir - Ja'far as-Sadiq - Musa al-Kazim - Ali ar-Ridha - Muhammad Jawad - Ali az-Zaki - Ja'far - Idris - Ahmad - Muhammad - Ibrahim - Ali - Yusuf - Ibrahim - Ali - Hamzah - al-Mu'ayyad Yahya.&lt;/ref&gt; The old Yemeni imam [[al-Mahdi Muhammad bin al-Mutahhar]] had conquered large highland territories from the [[Rasulid Dynasty]], including the commercially and politically important city [[San'a]]. After his demise in 1328, no less than four claimants for the imamate surfaced. Apart from Yahya, these included [[an-Nasir Ali bin Salah]], [[Ahmad bin Ali al-Fathi]], and the deceased imam's son [[al-Wathiq al-Mutahhar]]. Yahya emerged as the supreme figure and quickly secured San'a. With the city as his base, he waged war in the following years against [[Taiyabi]] [[Ismaili]] groups of the [[Hamdan]] tribe in the Wadi Dahr. The Rasulids were in no position to take back their lost lands in the Yemeni highland, leaving the Zaidi positions unthreatened. The imam was a prominent scholar who authored ''Al-Intisar'', the most comprehensive [[Zaydiyyah]] law book, and ''Ad-Da'wa al-amma'', a work encouraging struggle for the true faith.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Brockelmann, ''Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur'', Vol. I. Leiden 1943, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularly said that the number of pages he wrote were equal to the days he lived.&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Islam'', Vol. IV. Leiden 1934, p. 1296.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mu'ayyad Yahya died in 1346 (or, in another account, 1349), and was buried in [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]]. On his death, San'a was seized by two Zaidi brothers, Ibrahim bin Abdallah and Da'ud bin Abdallah, who ruled as [[emir]]s and did not claim the imam title. Their family would control San'a until 1381.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arab New Zealanders''' refers to people from [[Arab countries]], particularly [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], the [[Palestinian Territories]], [[Iraq]], and [[Jordan]] and also small groups from [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Libya]], [[Yemen]] and [[Sudan]],{{cn|date=August 2016}} who emigrated from their native nations and currently reside in [[New Zealand]]. The term also refers to descendants of diasporic Arabians such as descendants of Arab merchants to Asian nations, whose ancestral origins may be traced to merchants hailing from the Southern Arabian nations such as Yemen and Oman and the Arab nations of the Persian gulf region. Most Arab New Zealanders are of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Iraq]]i descent because they were the first Arabs to arrive in New Zealand.{{Syn|date=August 2016}} Therefore, an Arab New Zealander is a [[New Zealander]] of [[Arab]] cultural and linguistic heritage or [[Identity (social science)|identity]] whose ancestry traces back to any of various waves of immigrants originating from one or more of the twenty-three countries comprised by the [[Arab world]].

==History==
People from the Arab [[Middle East]] have been migrating in numbers to [[New Zealand]] since the 1900s beginning with those from Lebanon.&lt;ref name="teara1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first1=James|last1=Veitch|author2=Dalia Tinawi|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/middle-eastern-peoples/page-2|title=Middle Eastern peoples - Assimilation and recent arrivals|encyclopedia=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=teara.govt.nz|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 there were 1,261 people of Lebanese origin in New Zealand; it has been estimated that in the early 1980s the descendants of Lebanese totalled 5,000. Many assimilated and moved to other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="teara1"/&gt; In the 1890s there was a move to introduce legislation that would stop Lebanese migration and ban those already resident from peddling goods. This proved successful and few migrants arrived from Lebanon as a result.

==Today==
Recently [[Iraqis in New Zealand]] have replaced Lebanese, of which there are approximately 1,000&lt;ref name="joshuaproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/13017/NZ|title=Arab, Lebanese in New Zealand|work=Joshua Project|date=2016|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the most common Arab Middle Eastern migrant group with more than 6,500 settling mostly in the main centres.&lt;ref name="RDFY2006"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |url=http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/4441CE54-1F96-4C87-B9E3-524BEE486050/0/R1ResidenceDecisionsbyFY06Apr2010.pdf |title=Residence Decisions by Financial Year |work=Immigration New Zealand |date=5 June 2012 |accessdate=18 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228231251/http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/4441CE54-1F96-4C87-B9E3-524BEE486050/0/R1ResidenceDecisionsbyFY06Apr2010.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2016}} Statistics show that nearly 15,000 Middle Eastern immigrants (including those of Persian origin) moved to New Zealand since 1997.&lt;ref name="RDFY2006"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2016}} However, New Zealanders with an ethnic Arab Middle Eastern background are likely to be greater in number, since many migrants have had children in New Zealand. Many of these migrants have entered under the humanitarian category when seeking residence in New Zealand.

==Religion==
The Lebanese brought with them different [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] and [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] faiths. The three main Christian followings are Maronites, [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkites (Greek Catholics)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first1=James|last1=Veitch|author2=Dalia Tinawi|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/middle-eastern-peoples/3|title=Middle Eastern peoples - Christian religions|encyclopedia=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=teara.govt.nz|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main Muslim followings are [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia]], [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]] and [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]]. Many of the other Arab Middle Eastern people however follow mainly Islam, and it is thought that more than half of all migrants from the Arab Middle East are Muslim.

The '''Association of Musical Artists of Serbia''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]:''Udruženje muzičkih umetnika Srbije'', also known as ''UMUS'') is an [[professional association|association]] which gathers together musicians from [[Serbia]] who dedicated themselves to performing classical music. 

The goals of the Association include: participating in cultural and artistic activities, elevating the musical education of audiences, training the members, protecting performance copyrights, and assisting young artists in their performances. It is a non-profit organization, subsidized by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Serbia. ''UMUS'' cooperates with the Secretariat of Culture of the City of [[Belgrade]], as well as with institutions and individuals.

==Activities==
The association has organized concerts of their members, both in Belgrade ([[Ilija M. Kolarac Endowment|Kolarac]]'s Legacy [[Concert Hall]], [[Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra]], Gallery of [[Fresco]]es, National Museum Hall, [[Vračar]] Centre of Culture, [[Vuk Karadžić]] Centre of Culture, Music School [[Kornelije Stanković|Stanković]], Music School [[Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac|Mokranjac]], Old Port Authority House in [[Zemun]], Assembly of the City of [[Belgrade]]), and in other towns of [[Serbia]] ([[Kragujevac]], [[Zaječar]], [[Šabac]], [[Kruševac]], [[Trstenik, Serbia|Trstenik]], [[Valjevo]], [[Zrenjanin]], [[Novi Sad]], [[Niš]] …), as well as the concert cooperation among the [[SFRY|former federal republics]] and foreign countries.

The Association's members have participated in donations and humanitarian music events as performers and [[Organizer (music)|organizer]]s.

==History==
The association was established on 7 April 1946 under the name ''Association of the Reproductiv Artists – Musicians of Serbia'', with 20 musicians participating. It was one of the first independent organizations of musicians in the world. 

At the initiative of the ''UMUS'', in 1950 the Union of Music Artists of Yugoslavia was established.

Since December 1964 the magazine called ''[[Pro muzika]]'' has been circulated. 

In 1970 the ''UMUS''' Award for the Best Musical Interpretation in the Season was established. 

In 2001 the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Award to the Young Artist (under the age of 30) were established. The ''UMUS''' awards are granted on the occasion of the Association's Day (7 April) in the cooperation with the [[Government_of_Serbia| Ministry of Culture]] of the [[Republic of Serbia]].

The Association of Musical Artists of Serbia is one of sixteen institutions and organizations, which founded the Mokranjac's Legacy on 27 December 2005, the scope of which is protection and promotion of the work of [[Stevan Stojanovic Mokranjac]] both in Serbia and abroad.

Little is known about the nature and extent of '''[[child labour]] in [[Botswana]]''', although recent studies have shown that the phenomenon does occur in the country.

Between 2006 and 2008 the country has been in the process of formulating the ''National Action Programme towards the Elimination of Child Labour in Botswana'', which was nationally endorsed in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.child-labour.org.za/newsroom/media-releases/botswana-apec Botswana plan adopted: More ground gained in battle against child labour - 6 Feb 08 — TECL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This was drafted with the assistance of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s (ILO) programme [[Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour]].

A Programme Advisory Committee on Child Labour (PACC), representing government departments, organised labour and business, and civil society guides the development and implementation of the programme.

The different elements of process are described in [[Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour#BLNS Countries|this article]].

Botswana ratified the ILO [[Minimum Age Convention]] in 1997 (C138) and the ILO [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (C182) in 2000. In addition, the country also ratified both the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child]] in 1995.

Botswana’s [[Employment Act, Botswana|Employment Act]] is the principal law governing employment-related matters in Botswana. It protects children against exploitation and hazardous employment, defined as any work that is dangerous to the child’s health, development and morals. The Act defines a child as a person under the age of 15 years, and a young person as a person who has attained the age of 15 years but is under the age of 18 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">[[File:The Columbia Condominium.JPG|thumb|The Columbia Residences, formerly known as the Columbia Hospital for Women, in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The '''Columbia Hospital for Women''' was a [[hospital]] located in [[Washington, D.C.]] Originally opening in 1866 as a health-care facility for wives and [[widow]]s of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] soldiers, it moved in 1870 from [[Thomas Circle]] to its later location at 2425 L Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in the [[West End, Washington, D.C.|West End]] neighborhood. The Columbia became a private, [[non-profit hospital]] when [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed legislation transferring it to a board of directors in 1953. The facility closed in 2002 and the building was converted into a [[condominium]], '''The Columbia Residences'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/medtour/columbia.html| title=Historic Medical Sites in the Washington, DC Area| author=[[United States National Library of Medicine]]| accessdate=July 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the more than 250,000 people born at Columbia Hospital for Women were [[Duke Ellington]], [[Al Gore]], [[Katherine Heigl]] and [[Michael Dominic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19803">Rates of '''crime in Guatemala''' are very high. An average of 101 murders per week were reported in 2016, making the country's violent crime rate one of the highest in Latin America.&lt;ref name=us&gt;"Guatemala: Country-Specific Information". [[U.S. Department of State]] (November 23, 2009). Accessed January 18, 2009. {{PD-notice}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s Guatemala had four cities feature in Latin America's top ten cities by murder rate: [[Escuintla]] (165 per 100,000), [[Izabal (town)|Izabal]] (127), [[Santa Rosa Cuilapa]] (111) and [[Guatemala City]] (101).&lt;ref&gt;WC Prillaman (2003), "[http://www.csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/ppcrime_democracy_inlatinamerica%5B1%5D.pdf Crime, democracy, and development in Latin America]," ''Policy Papers on the Americas''&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''New Yorker'' magazine, in 2009, fewer civilians were reported killed in the war zone of Iraq than were shot, stabbed, or beaten to death in Guatemala, and 97% of homicides "remain unsolved."&lt;ref name="Grann"/&gt; Much of the violent nature of Guatemalan society stems back to a thirty-year-long civil war{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. However, not only has violence maintained its presence in the post-war context of the country following the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], but it has extended to broader social and economic forms of violence.&lt;ref name=Winton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winton|first1=A|title=Youth, gangs and violence: Analysing the social and spatial mobility of young people in Guatemala City|journal=Children's Geographies|date=2005|volume=3|issue=2|pages=167–184|doi=10.1080/14733280500161537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of the Guatemalan Civil War ==

The [[Guatemalan Civil War]] began in 1960 between the government and leftist actors, and it resulted in over 200,000 deaths.&lt;ref name=Arana /&gt; Sources cite the history of conflict in Guatemala as rendering communities accustomed to violence today, and the extension of incompetent or corrupt state institutions facilitates the impunity associated with such violence.&lt;ref name=Bruneau&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruneau|first1=Thomas|title=Pandillas and Security in Central America|journal=Latin America Research Review|date=2014|volume=49|issue=2|pages=152–172|doi=10.1353/lar.2014.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the civil war, the country witnessed a “generalized fear shaped by state terror and institutional violence.”&lt;ref name=Menjivar&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menjivar|first1=Cecilia|title=Thinking about Violence|journal=Society|date=2014|volume=51|issue=4|pages=401–403|doi=10.1007/s12115-014-9799-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against indigenous===

Most civil war victims were [[Maya people|Maya]] whose deaths were not reported to [[Ladino people|Ladino]] audiences via newspapers. Many of these deaths came in brutal fashions like rapes, forced abortions, and burnings.&lt;ref name=Carey&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carey|first1=David|last2=Torres|first2=M.G.|title=PRECURSORS TO FEMICIDE: Guatemalan Women in a Vortex of Violence|journal=Latin American Research Review|date=2010|volume=45|issue=3|pages=142–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence was strategically employed by state officials as a genocidal weapon against indigenous women. The distrust of indigenous still permeates Guatemalan culture today.&lt;ref name=Fregoso&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fregoso|first1=Rosa Linda|title=Terrorizing women: feminicide in the Américas|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against students===

The fear of students by government takes much history into account. It was students who led the revolution in 1944 that instituted the only ten years of democracy in the twentieth century that Guatemala experienced.&lt;ref name=Vrana&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vrana|first1=Heather|title=Revolutionary Transubstantiation in 'The Republic of Students|journal=Radical History Review|date=2012|volume=114|pages=66–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; One school, the [[University of San Carlos]], the state viewed with particular distrust during the civil war, because the revolutionary government during democratic period of 1944-1954 had reserved it complete autonomy.&lt;ref name=Vrana /&gt; After the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]], a majority of the 8,000 San Carlos students possessed leftist views in line with the outgoing government. Therefore, throughout the subsequent civil war, the state placed an emphasis on repressing, often disappearing, students of San Carlos.&lt;ref name=Vrana /&gt;

== Trafficking ==

The high rate of murder has been blamed on "a highly powerful criminal cartel", made up of politically connected retired military officers and linking with drug traffickers and other criminals. Following the end of [[Guatemalan Civil War]] in 1996, a general amnesty was granted 
"for even the worst crimes, leaving no one accountable".&lt;ref name="Grann"/&gt; 
The Guatemalan "security apparatus — death squads, intelligence units, police officers, military counter-insurgency forces — did not disappear but, rather, mutated into criminal organizations," and now are engaged "in arms trafficking, money laundering, extortion, human smuggling, black-market adoptions, and kidnapping for ransom," and drug trade.&lt;ref name="Grann"/&gt;

Some high-profile murders revealed or suspected to be the work of the cartel include that of Catholic Bishop [[Juan José Gerardi Conedera]], beaten to death in 1998, two days after the conclusion of an inquiry he had led into the violence of the civil war.&lt;ref name=Arana/&gt; The inquiry had blamed the Guatemalan army for 90% of the war's 200,000 killings.&lt;ref name=Arana&gt;Arana, Ana, "The New Battle for Central America", ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', Vol. 80, No. 6 (Nov. - Dec., 2001), pp. 88-101&lt;/ref&gt; Gerardi also found links between the military and the [[illegal drug trade in Guatemala]], providing an additional motivation.&lt;ref name=Arana/&gt; In 1997 a large group of active military figures, including the deputy Minister of Defense, were found to be involved with the Colombian [[Cali cartel]]'s smuggling efforts.&lt;ref name=Arana/&gt;

Khalil Musa, a wealthy Lebanese immigrant businessman, and his daughter Marjorie Musa, were shot and killed in April 2009.&lt;ref name="Grann"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/04/110404fa_fact_grann A Murder Foretold], Unravelling the ultimate political conspiracy. by David Grann. newyorker.com 2011 April 04&lt;/ref&gt; Khalil Musa reportedly knew president [[Álvaro Colom]], an advisor of whom told an American journalist that, “if the Musas could be killed, there was a sense that anyone [in Guatemala] could be.”&lt;ref name="Grann"/&gt;

===Drug trafficking===
{{See also|Illegal drug trade in Guatemala}}

Guatemala finds itself located in the middle of the drug supply from South America and drug demand in the United States.&lt;ref name=Bruneau /&gt; [[Guatemala]] links [[Honduras]] and [[Mexico]] along common drug routes between Central America and the United States. Its long, un-patrolled coastline and sparse jungles make it a popular landing point for boats and planes carrying drugs from South America, while its borders are understaffed and ill-equipped to fully exert customs controls.&lt;ref name=icgguatemalarpt&gt;International Crisis Group. "[http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/latin-america-caribbean/guatemala/052-corridor-of-violence-the-guatemala-honduras-border.aspx Corridor of Violence: The Guatemala-Honduras Border]". [http://www.crisisgroup.org CrisisGroup.org]. 4 June 2014. Retrieved 29 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greater regional efforts to crack down on narcotics trade has merely diverted the transport routes and methods used. According to the [[International Crisis Group]], Guatemala had been “a primary landing zone for narcotics-laden flights” until U.S.-supported interdiction efforts disrupted illegal flight shipments and forced traffickers to use land routes instead.&lt;ref name=icgguatemalarpt/&gt; From 2006, Mexico’s crackdown on drug trafficking pushed cartel operations to import cocaine through [[Central America]] instead,&lt;ref&gt;International Crisis Group. "[http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/latin-america-caribbean/guatemala/139-guatemala-drug-trafficking-and-violence.aspx Guatemala: Drug Trafficking and Violence]", [http://www.crisisgroup.org CrisisGroup.org]. 11 October 2011. Retrieved 29 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and a majority of cocaine departing South America now travels through the northern regions of Central America to reach U.S. markets.&lt;ref name=icgguatemalarpt/&gt;

The lack of effective law enforcement following the 2009 coup also contributed to the growth of narcotics smuggling. The post-coup regime kept a majority of Guatemalan security forces in the capital, leaving regional law enforcement under-supported.&lt;ref name=icgguatemalarpt/&gt; Wealthy traffickers often assume the role of de facto authorities in such areas.&lt;ref name=icgguatemalarpt/&gt;

===Human trafficking===
{{main|Human trafficking in Guatemala}}
Like other Central American countries, the closeness of Guatemala to the United States provides a natural route for [[human trafficking]] as well as arms trafficking.&lt;ref name=Bruneau /&gt; Guatemala is a common location of exploitation of women and children from other Latin American countries, particularly [[sex trafficking]], while all ages and sexes suffer from systems of forced labor in the country.&lt;ref name="State Dept"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2014|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2014/index.htm|website=U.S. Department of State Diplomacy in Action|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, human trafficking cases are linked to transnational criminal organizations, such as trafficked children used by gangs to commit illegal activities.&lt;ref name="State Dept" /&gt;

==Corruption==
{{main|Corruption in Guatemala}}
According to [[Human Rights Watch]], Guatemala has "weak and corrupt law enforcement institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/guatemala|title=World Report 2012: Guatemala|work=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impersonation of police officers==
There are reports that people, especially tourists, are victimized by [[police impersonation|criminals who are dressed in police uniforms]], and who commit theft, extortion or sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="www.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/guatemala/safety-and-security|title=Guatemala|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violence ==
=== Murders ===
[[Murders]] are a serious problem in Guatemala: the country has one of the highest [[murder rate]]s in the world, but less than 4% of murders end in conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12671446|title=Amnesty says Guatemala must act on killing of women|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] stated in 2007 that there is a "culture of impunity" with regard to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1215811.stm|title=BBC News - Timeline: Guatemala|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, there were over 6,000 violent deaths; most of these are related to local criminal [[gangs]].&lt;ref name="www.gov.uk"/&gt; According to the US Department of State, Guatemala’s high murder rate is caused by four principal factors: an increase in [[drug trafficking]]; a growing prevalence of [[gang]]-related violence; a heavily armed civilian population; and a weak and incompetent police/judicial system.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=15656&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual violence ===
Sexual crimes, including [[child sex tourism]], are common in Guatemala. Foreigners from the US, Canada and Europe participate in [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]] in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2014/226731.htm|title=Guatemala|work=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After having received criticism  for lack of adequate legislation on sexual violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/10/guatemala-where-sexual-exploitation-of-minors-is-not-a-crime/|title=GUATEMALA: Where Sexual Exploitation of Minors Is Not a Crime|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemala enacted in 2009 ''Ley contra la violencia sexual, explotación y trata de personas'' (Law against Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Trafficking in Persons).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.protectionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/GUATEMALA-SPANISH.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; However, sexual crimes against children continue; the former [[UN]] [[Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography]], Najat Maalla M’jid, stated in 2012 that "Many children are still victims of [[sexual exploitation]] and forced labour in Guatemala despite the laudable efforts carried out to prevent and combat the sale of children for illegal adoption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42778#.VPNVuY503IU|title=United Nations News Centre|date=30 August 2012|work=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are about 10,000 cases of reported rape per year, but the total number is likely much higher because of under-reporting due to social stigma.  According to ''[[Doctors without Borders]]'', "Survivors [of sexual violence] are stigmatized and they cannot easily find treatment in Guatemala yet. There are no resources and too little comprehension of patients’ needs by the doctors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/field-news/guatemala-treating-sexual-violence-breaking-cycle-fear|title=Guatemala: Treating Sexual Violence, Breaking the Cycle of Fear|work=MSF USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Street gangs===
Young males ages 15 to 24 characterize the typical perpetrators of street crime, which is committed against individuals of the same age group.&lt;ref name=Bruneau /&gt; Like most post-war societies, Guatemala features a very young population and higher propensity for youth violence. Youth transitions in a post-war context often become harder due to lack of funding for public education, and in the case of Guatemala, the civil war not only transferred public education funds to military expenditures, but schools and students were specifically targeted by military forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kurtenbach|first1=Sabine|title=Postwar Violence in Guatemala: A Mirror of the Relationship between Youth and Adult Society|journal=International Journal of Conflict and Violence|date=2014|volume=8|issue=1|pages=119–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two key youth street gangs that operate in Guatemala and other Central American countries are the [[Mara Salvatrucha]] and [[18th Street gang]].&lt;ref name=Bruneau /&gt; Many other gangs exist however, and in fact, by just 1997 the ''[[Prensa Libre]]'' reported the presence of 53 known gangs operating just within the capitol, Guatemala City.&lt;ref name=Winton /&gt; The recent proliferation of such gangs began with the mass deportations of Los Angeles criminals to Central America, particularly El Salvador, in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=Bruneau /&gt; In 2011, [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]] reported that Guatemala had the highest number of gang members in Central America with 32,000.&lt;ref name=Bruneau /&gt;

The economic struggles of the country fuel participation in street violence as well. UN reports have found that in Guatemala and the other northern nations of Central America, ”stark wealth disparities provide criminals with both a justification and an opportunity for their activities.”&lt;ref name=Bruneau /&gt; In addition to poverty, [[youth in Guatemala]]  are compelled to join gangs by fierce peer pressure, reasons of support for those with broken families, and the allure of an illicit lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Bruneau /&gt; The cultural difference between gangs and the rest of society and the overall intimidation of the gang image offers them considerable power. Therefore, individual gang members receive increased [[social capital]].&lt;ref name=Winton /&gt; Guatemalan society has come to see violence as normal and inevitably linked with youth, which may prolong the passivity towards violence by leaving young people with an approach that embodies an acceptance of short-term lives.&lt;ref name=Winton /&gt; With youth largely correlated with public violence, trust and communication among community members and young people suffers. Therefore, communities leave youth socially excluded, and gangs may seemingly offer inclusion.&lt;ref name=Winton /&gt; Members of street gangs still do not constitute organized crime, but the mass incarcerations of youth gang members in Guatemala puts them in direct contact with leaders of organized crime networks who direct from prison, who assist street gangs organize and institutionalize themselves.&lt;ref name=Bruneau /&gt;

===Violence against women===
{{main|Violence against women in Guatemala}}
Today, [[femicide]] is quite common in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=Carey /&gt; Women are killed at rates today in Guatemala comparable to that of the peak violent period of the civil war. From the years 2000-2010 the country saw over five thousand murders of women and girls.&lt;ref name=Carey /&gt; Femicide to an extent is a function of a historical gendered violence that the state and society permitted legally and socially throughout the 20th century. Most femicides go unsolved, showing the continuation of civil war societal features like impunity and the normalization of violence against women.&lt;ref name=Carey /&gt; Common crime violence has exacerbated the situation for women, creating a dual upsurge in both of gender-based violence and femicide in Guatemala. According to the UN, two women are murdered on average each day in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=Menjivar /&gt; As shown by high rates of [[domestic abuse]], females also face more vulnerabilities of private violence while young males are threatened more by public gang violence.&lt;ref name=Winton /&gt; In just the first month of 2005, Guatemala City alone received 13,700 reports of family violence.&lt;ref name=Fregoso /&gt; Furthermore, many women Guatemalan immigrants to the U.S. will still face threatening situations if they are deported to their home country.&lt;ref name=Menjivar /&gt;

== Migration ==

While youth in Guatemala represent key actors of increasing violence in the country, they also remain among the most affected by the consequences of a violent society.&lt;ref name=Winton /&gt; Children commonly migrate to the United States, often to reunite with family, and to flee conditions related to crime like societal violence, abuse in the home, and social exclusion.&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;{{cite journal|title=Children on the Run: Unaccompanied Children Leaving Central America and Mexico and the Need for International Protection|journal=UNHCR|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year of 2014 saw a surge in numbers of unaccompanied children migrants from Central America, predicted to reach 70,000 and resulting in the [[2014 American immigration crisis]].&lt;ref name="Mother Jones"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Ian|title=70,000 Kids Will Show Up Alone at Our Border This Year. What Happens to Them?|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/child-migrants-surge-unaccompanied-central-america|website=Mother Jones|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a UN study on the roots of children migration from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, forty-eight percent of children interviewed recounted personal experiences of increased organized violence.&lt;ref name=UNHCR /&gt; Violent actors included drug cartels, gangs, and State sponsored actors. Additionally, twenty-three percent of the Guatemalan children interviewed noted that they had survived domestic violence by their parents or guardians.&lt;ref name=UNHCR /&gt;

The '''Emperor''' or '''Empress of All Russia''' ({{lang-ru|(pre 1918 orthography) Императоръ Всероссійскій, Императрица Всероссійская, (modern orthography) Император Всероссийский, Императрица всероссийская}}, ''Imperator Vserossiyskiy'', ''Imperatritsa Vserossiyskaya'') was the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute]] and later the [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] [[monarch]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. 

It was created in connection with the victory in the [[Great Northern War]] and appeared as the adaptation of the [[Tsar]]'s title under the accepted system of titling in Europe. The suffix "of All Russia" was transformed from the previous version "(Tsar) [[Of all Rus'|of All Rus']]".

==Title==
Article 1 of the [[Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire]] stated that "the Emperor of All Russia is an autocratic and unrestricted monarch. To obey his supreme authority, not only out of fear but out of conscience as well, [[Divine right of kings|God himself commands]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/dynastyhistory/dinzak1/441.html&lt;/ref&gt; The article points to the fact that Russia had an unrestricted monarchy.

The full title of the emperor in the 20th century (Art.37 of the Fundamental Laws) was:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/dynastyhistory/dinzak1/446.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:RussianRegalia.jpg|157px|thumb|left|[[Regalia of the Russian tsars|Regalia of the Emperor]]]]
The title of the Emperor of All Russia was introduced to [[Peter the Great]]. After the victory at the [[Great Northern War]] and signing the [[Treaty of Nystad]], in September 1721 [[Governing Senate|Senate]] and [[Most Holy Synod|Synod]] decided to award Peter with the title of the Emperor of All Russia with the following statement: "in the manner of the Roman Senate for the noble cause of emperors such titles publicly given them as a gift and into statues for the everlasting generations inscribed".

{{Quotation
|On this 20th day of October, after a consultation of the Senate together with the Holy Synod accepted the intention, to his majesty, in the testimony of a proper gratitude for his high grace and paternalism and effort which he for the welfare of state in all his glorious time of ruling and especially during the past Swedish War, deigned to manifest, and all-Russian state in such a strong and good fortune, and his people subjected to such fame over the whole world through his unique ruling led, as that to all quite known, by the name of all the Russian people to ask, so graciously to accept, following the example of others, from them title: the Father of the Fatherland, the Emperor of All Russia, Peter the Great ...
|Laws of the Russian Empire at Large. Vol.VI. No.3840}}

On November 2, 1721 Peter I accepted the title. The [[Dutch Republic]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia]] immediately recognized the new title of the Russian Tsar, followed by the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] in 1723, the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1739, the [[British Empire]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1742, [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] and the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1745, and finally the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1764. Since then the Russian State was referred to as the [[Russian Empire]].

On February 16, 1722 Peter I issued the Decree of Succession by which he abolished the old custom of passing the throne to the direct descendants in the male line, but allowed the appointment of an heir through any decent person, at the will of the monarch.

==Coronation ceremony==
{{Main article|Coronation of the Russian monarch}}

Coronations in the Russian Empire involved a highly developed religious ceremony in which the Emperor was [[coronation|crowned]] and invested with [[Russian Crown Jewels|regalia]], then [[anointing|anointed]] with [[chrism]] and formally blessed by the [[Russian Orthodox Church|church]] to commence his reign.  Although rulers of [[Muscovy]] had been crowned prior to the reign of [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], their coronation rituals assumed overt [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] overtones as the result of the influence of Ivan's wife [[Sophia Paleologue]], and the imperial ambitions of his grandson, [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/russia/3.htm Muscovy], Sections "The Evolution of the Russian Aristocracy" and "Ivan IV".  For crownings of earlier rulers of Muscovy, see Alfred Rambaugh [http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/RamMos01.html Rambaud on the Rise of the Grand Princes of Moscow].&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern coronation, introducing "European-style" elements, replaced the previous "crowning" ceremony and was first used for [[Catherine I]] in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ykaVAQAAQBAJ Scenarios of Power]. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://assumption-cathedral.kreml.ru/en-Us/history/view/tseremonii-i-obryady-v-uspenskom-sobore/&lt;/ref&gt; Since czarist Russia claimed to be the "[[Third Rome]]" and the replacement of Byzantium as the true Christian state,&lt;ref&gt;[http://russia.nypl.org/themes/thirdrome.html Moscow the Third Rome]{{full citation needed|date=March 2010}}. See also [http://russia.nypl.org/history/moscow.html Moscow Becomes the Third Rome].&lt;/ref&gt; the Russian rite was designed to link its rulers and prerogatives to those of the so-called "[[Byzantine Empire|Second Rome]]" ([[Constantinople]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wortman, pg. 10.  A political theory prevalent amongst many Orthodox Russians into the twentieth century postulated that there were three "Romes": the first (Rome) had allegedly apostatized from true Christianity after the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054 between [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]; the second (Constantinople) had equally apostatized by accepting Roman Catholicism at the [[Council of Florence]] and had subsequently fallen to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]; Moscow and "Holy Russia" were the third Rome, and (according to this doctrine) "a fourth there shall never be". [http://xenohistorian.faithweb.com/russia/ru01.html#Muscovy A History of Russia], Chapter 1: Medieval Russia, Section "Ivan the Great".&lt;/ref&gt;

While months or even years could pass between the initial accession of the sovereign and the performance of this ritual, church policy held that the monarch must be anointed and crowned according to the Orthodox rite to have a successful tenure.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', May 31, 1896.  Quoted in Wortman, Introduction.  See also Blech, Annalise, [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/creees/_files/pdf/curriculum/CREEES-developed-units/russian_orthodox.pdf The Russian Orthodox Church: History and Influence], University of Texas at Austin, 2008, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the church and state were essentially one in Imperial Russia, this service invested the Tsars with political legitimacy; however, this was not its only intent.  It was equally perceived as conferring a genuine spiritual benefit that mystically wedded sovereign to subjects, bestowing divine authority upon the new ruler.  As such, it was similar in purpose to other [[Europe]]an coronation ceremonies from the [[medieval]] era.

Even when the imperial capital was located at [[St. Petersburg, Russia|St. Petersburg]] (1713–1728, 1732–1917), Russian coronations were always held in [[Moscow]] at the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the [[Kremlin]].  The last coronation service in Russia was held on 26 May 1896 for [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his wife [[Alix of Hesse|Alexandra Feodorovna]], who would be the final Tsar and Tsaritsa of Russia.  The Russian Imperial regalia survived the subsequent [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] and the [[Communist]] period, and are currently on exhibit in a [[Diamond Fund|museum]] at the [[Kremlin Armoury]].

'''Fictionmania''' is a [[website]] dedicated to publishing and archiving [[transgender]] fiction.&lt;ref name=blanchard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=Ray|title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Transvestic Fetishism|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2010|volume=39|issue=2|pages=363–372 [368]|doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9541-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Unlike most such websites, it is free to access.&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt; It was open to submissions from any writer, provided the submitted literature "explores [[gender]]." As of March 2008, Fictionmania was host to more than 15,000 story files;  by Sept 2011, 3,500 more had been added.

==History==
The website found its roots in the early 1990s as a free online [[Bulletin board system|bulletin board]] known as the "Sierra Bulletin Board," owned and operated by Fictionmania founder Mindy Rich. By the mid 1990s, the bulletin board had largely been usurped by the [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]] alt.sex.stories.tg (see [[alt.sex.stories]]). By this point, the archive had grown from dozens to a few hundred pieces of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fictionmania.tv/misc/faq.html History of Fictionmania], Fictionmania&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] in newsgroups, writers of transgender fiction began founding [[electronic mailing list]]s and websites to share material while avoiding unwelcome spammers. In 1996, Mindy Rich created the "Maniapages" listserve and expanded the concept from gender transformation stories to any fiction exploring gender. In late 1997, Rich laid the groundwork to transform Maniapages from a listserve into a website, officially launching Fictionmania in February 1998. The number of archived stories quickly exploded from hundreds to thousands.

In December 1999, Rich temporarily shut down Fictionmania due to illness and a frustration with [[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]] on the website's [[Internet forum|hyperboard]]. A number of writers volunteered to take up webmaster duties for her and resurrected Fictionmania, after assuring Rich that the site's operations, policy, and focus would remain largely unchanged. The volunteers (calling themselves the Fictionmania Task Force) have since continued to operate the website free of charge. The Task Force also edits and uploads new submissions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 2008, the explicit nature of some content on the site led to its blacklisting by certain filtering systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://k9.bluecoat.com/support/check-site-rating.php|title=Check Site Rating|author=Bluecoat|publisher=K9 Web Protection|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may have been certain ISPs that completely blocked access to Fictionmania because of pornographic content.

From November 2008 until May 2009 the site was down due to a server failure.  It is now back online, effective 1 June 2009, initially employing a different [[URL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fictionmania.tv New Fictionmania server], Fictionmania&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2010 Fictionmania's server was disconnected without explanation by its service provider. It, however, returned online on February 12, 2010 with a statement that the story files at the center of a recent controversy had been removed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Content==
The majority of Fictionmania's archives consist of [[short story]] fantasies depicting characters being [[Sex change|transformed]] from one sex to the other. Other stories, however, explore cross-dressing or feminization through malice or [[blackmail]].  [[Helen Boyd]] described a typical plot as involving a man being feminized by his wife or girlfriend, commonly as punishment; the wife then forces the man to go out in public dressed as a woman, sometimes double-dating with his wife/girlfriend and two men, and the stories often end with the cross-dresser giving a [[blowjob]] to a man.&lt;ref name=boyd/&gt;  However, there are many different types of stories including Science Fiction and Magic plots, and many stories have little or no explicit sexual content.

Fictionmania also publishes poetry, lyrics, plays, essays, autobiographical pieces, romance, humor, satire, parody, science fiction, horror, etc. A great many stories are also part of [[shared universe]]s: both [[fan fiction]] based on [[Popular culture|pop culture]] ([[Television program|TV shows]], [[Lists of films|movies]], [[List of comic books|comic books]], etc.) and unique [[fictional universe]]s invented by Fictionmania authors. Great concern has been raised over pop culture stories violating copyright laws because they are derivative works without authorisation from a copyright owner.

Stories published by the site, are rated for content according to a system similar to the [[MPAA film rating system]]. Content on Fictionmania ranges from G-rated to R-rated to [[X-rated]], with some intermediary ratings as well.  Some stories have no overt erotic component, e.g. one story about World War II pilots forced to hide in a nunnery and dress up as a nun; the only erotic element in these is the detailed description of female clothing and beauty regimen.&lt;ref name=boyd&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyd|first=Helen|title=My Husband Betty: Love, Sex, and Life with a Crossdresser|year=2003|publisher=Seal Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCT70HjI_a4C&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=N_WrD8pepc&amp;dq=fictionmania&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q=fictionmania&amp;f=false|pages=163–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics are not limited to fantasy sex change, but can also explore: [[cross-dressing]], real-life [[sex reassignment surgery]], [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]], [[androgyny]], [[effeminacy]], [[gender identity]], role reversal and [[atypical gender role]]s, as well as [[Prescriptions regarding gender roles|societal attitudes]] towards [[gender role]]s. Authors may be professional or amateur, but their works must "explore the meaning of gender."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5121">'''Gadaa''' (older spelling: '''Gada''') is the traditional [[social stratification]] system of [[Oromo people|Oromos]] in [[Ethiopia]] and northern [[Kenya]]; it is also practiced by the [[Konso people|Konso]] and [[Gedeo people]] of southern Ethiopia. Each [[social class|class]], or ''luba'', consists of all of the sons of the men in another particular class. The entire class progresses through eleven different grades, each based on an eight-year cycle, and each with its own set of [[rights]] and [[Social responsibility|responsibilities]].

As of 1990, Gadaa had active adherents only among the [[Borana Oromo people|Borana]] and [[Guji Oromo|Guji]] groups near the Ethiopian-Kenyan border. Though the Gadaa system itself is no longer widely practiced, it remains influential in Oromo society at large. Historically, it has been seen as a better method of governing than other forms in the region. However, the Gadaa had all the shortcomings and problems like that of the monarchial Oromo and monarchial non-Oromo Ethiopian systems of governance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In regions where the Oromo invaded and conquered, including around the Sidama and Somali, the Gadaa system was oppressive in practice, though proclaimed as democratic and just in Oromo oral tradition. According to ethnohistorian Ulrich Braukämper, minorities and those who assimilated, like the Hadiyya, were "considered to be of a lower social status than the 'pure' Oromo and did not possess equal rights in the Gadaa system."&lt;ref&gt;Braukämper, Ulrich. ''Layers ''Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;


== Research ==

A number of scholars have studied Gadaa. Legesse&lt;ref&gt;Asmarom Legesse, "Gadaa: Three Approaches to the Study of African Society", 1973&lt;/ref&gt; has written that Gadaa is "one of the most astonishing and instructive turns the evolution of human society has taken". In addition to his Harvard PhD dissertation, Legesse has published a book&lt;ref&gt;Asmarom Legesse, "Oromo Democracy: an Indigenous African Political System", 2006&lt;/ref&gt; positioning Gadaa as an African democracy that could inform constitutional thinkers. The late Donald Levine has said&lt;ref&gt;Donald Levine, "Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society", 1974&lt;/ref&gt; that Gadaa is "one of the most complex systems of social organization ever devised by the human imagination". For Jalata, Gadaa represents "the totality of Oromo civilization".

== Current status ==

Considering the symbolic significance of Gadaa for the Oromo, as well as its structural innovations, researchers in law, indigenous studies, and pan-Africanism are exploring how the system could be utilized in the 21st century. For example, a thesis by Z. Sirna&lt;ref&gt;Z. Sirna, "Ethiopia: When the Gadaa Democracy Rules in a Federal State", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; entitled "Ethiopia: When the Gadaa Democracy Rules in a Federal State" explores how the system could be integrated with the contemporary federal structure of Ethiopia, serving as a governance mechanism for the Oromia Regional National State. A political party known as GSAP (Gadaa System Advancement Party) bases its ideology on the principles of Gadaa. A futuristic, governance 2.0 project called BitGadaa&lt;ref&gt;https://bitgadaa.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909084519/http://bitgadaa.org/ |date=2015-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; draws inspiration from the principles and structure of Gadaa.

== Criticisms ==

Gadaa has been criticized for being patriarchal, as it excludes women from political affairs. This, according to Legesse,&lt;ref&gt;Asmarom Legesse, "Oromo Democracy: an Indigenous African Political System", 2006&lt;/ref&gt; is the main shortcoming of Oromo Democracy. Other shortcomings include rigidity of rules, and the question of scaling Gadaa to millions of people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13417">[[Image:Seal of the Irish Free State.png|right|thumb|200px|Reverse of the Great Seal of the Irish Free State]]

The '''Great Seal of the Irish Free State''' ({{lang-ga|Séala Mór do Shaorstát Éireann}}) is the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] which was used to seal official documents of the [[Irish Free State]] (''Saorstát Éireann'') by the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]]. The physical seal is currently on public display at [[National Museum of Ireland]] at [[Collins Barracks]], [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.museum.ie/NationalMuseumIreland/media/Guidebooks/2_Decorative-Arts-History/cb_guide_web_en.pdf#page=15 |format=PDF |title=Decorative Arts &amp; History |series=Guide to the National Museum of Ireland |publisher=National Museum of Ireland |pages=27, 26 |accessdate=2 November 2017 |isbn= 0-901777-55-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sides of the Great Seal feature an image of the [[harp]] surrounded by the words "'''SAORSTÁT ÉIREANN'''" in [[Gaelic type|Gaelic script]].  One side is engraved in silver, the other in copper.

After the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] was enacted the [[Seal of the President of Ireland]] was struck as a replacement to the Great Seal. It is substantially the same as the former Seal but features the word "'''ÉIRE'''" instead of "'''SAORSTÁT ÉIREANN'''".

==Origins==

In August 1922 civil servants in the [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government]] sought Ministerial approval to adopt a seal. It was thought a seal was necessary for legal reasons.&lt;ref name="drg"&gt;{{cite web | last =Swan | first =Ciarán | title =Design and change: The Oireachtas Harp and an historical heritage. | work = | publisher =Design Research Group | date =2008-03-28 | url =http://designresearchgroup.wordpress.com/2008/03/28/design-and-change-the-oireachtas-harp-and-an-historical-heritage/ | accessdate =2008-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and the draft [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] specified that the Irish Free State would have the same constitutional status as Canada, which had [[Great Seal of Canada|its own Great Seal]] since [[Canadian Confederation|its Confederation]] in 1867. The [[letters patent]] issued on 6 December 1922 constituting the office of [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sexton|first=Brendan|title=Ireland and the crown, 1922-1936: the Governor-Generalship of the Irish Free State|year=1989|publisher=Irish Academic Press|isbn=9780716524489|pages=181–182|chapter=Appendix A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There shall be a Great Seal of and for the said State which We do hereby authorise and empower Our said Governor-General to keep and use for sealing all things whatsoever that shall pass the said Great Seal. Provided that, until a Great Seal shall be provided, the private seal of the Governor-General may be used as the Great Seal of the said State.}}

Regarding the design of the Great Seal, an approach was made by [[Hugh Kennedy]], the [[Attorney General]], to [[Thomas Sadleir]], Registrar of the [[Genealogical Office|Office of Arms]] at [[Dublin Castle]]. In his reply Sadlier noted that he was ''"satisfied that the harp was very early in the 12th century an Irish badge..."''.  [[George Sigerson]], the President of the National Literary Society, recommended to [[Timothy Michael Healy|Tim Healy]], the new Governor-General, that the harp should be adopted as the symbol of the Free State. His view was that:&lt;ref name="drg"/&gt;
{{quote|The harp was the common and sacred symbol of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Protestant Volunteer of 1782]], of the Presbyterian and Catholic [[United Irishmen]] of 1798, of old and [[young Ireland]] and of men of after days&amp;nbsp;– it is in no sense a party or sectional symbol but one which represents the entire Nation... It is now within the power of an Irish Independent Government to place this emblem of humanising harmony in its high place of honour, unique and not undistinguished amongst the [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]]s, the [[leopard (heraldry)|leopard]]s, and the single and [[Double-headed eagle|double headed Eagle]]s of the rest of the world. }}
On 28 December 1922 a meeting of the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]] decided that the [[Celtic harp]] should be adopted.&lt;ref name="drg"/&gt; Later, in August 1923 the Executive Council determined that the [[Brian Ború harp|"Brian Ború" harp]] in [[Trinity College, Dublin]], would be the basis of the new seal. Archibald McGoogan of the Art Department of the National Museum perfected the design.&lt;ref name="drg"/&gt; Elements of the [[Ardagh Chalice]] were incorporated into the design of the Great Seal. Final authorisation was given by the Executive Council on 17 October 1924 for the provision of the various seals, including ministerial seals which had the Brian Ború harp circumscribed with "Saorstát Éireann" and the ministerial title in Irish and English.

In 1931, a separate '''External Great Seal''' or '''Royal Great Seal'''{{#tag:ref|The form "External Great Seal" was used in internal government documents when needed to distinguish it from the pre-existing "internal" Great Seal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.difp.ie/docs/1937/External-Great-Seal/2242.htm DIFP 1937 No.96]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="difp2243"/&gt; The form "Royal Great Seal" was used in South Africa's 1934 statute creating a similar seal,&lt;ref name="sa1934"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3AStatus_of_the_Union_Act_1934_and_Royal_Executive_Functions_and_Seals_Act_1934.djvu/5|title=Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act, 1934|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted by foreign scholars to describe the equivalent seal in any Commonwealth Dominion including the Irish Free State.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1938 pp.481–482 "Ireland was the first of the Dominions to possess a separate Royal Great Seal of its own."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones1946"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.

A study in the development of treaty-making procedure. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pmw3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA45 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1946 |pages=45–46, fn.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} was created to be used on diplomatic documents which required the signature of [[Monarchy in the Irish Free State|the monarch]] in London rather than the Governor-General in Dublin. Up to 1931, such documents had been transmitted to the [[Dominions Office]] and the British [[Great Seal of the Realm]] was applied alongside the signature.&lt;ref name="difp1241"&gt;[http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1931/1241.htm DIFP 1931, No.539]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1930 Imperial Conference]], the Free State proposed that a [[Dominion]] should be allowed to send documents via its [[High Commissioner]] in London, bypassing the British government, and to affix its own seal rather than the British one.&lt;ref name="difp1216"/&gt; The conference subcommittee on seals resolved, "The subject should be postponed on the understanding that the whole question should be left for further discussion between Governments should occasion arise".&lt;ref name="difp1216"&gt;[http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1931/1216.htm DIFP 1931, No.513]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1931 the Free State government tested its proposed procedure; it applied the Free State seal to the instrument of ratification for a 1929 treaty between the Free State and Portugal, and sent it to High Commissioner [[John W. Dulanty]] to transmit to [[King George V]].&lt;ref name="difp1210"&gt;[http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1931/1210.htm DIFP 1931, No.527]&lt;/ref&gt; Dulanty was refused an audience, the British objecting on the grounds that the change in procedure had not been agreed.&lt;ref name="difp1216"/&gt;&lt;ref name="difp1347"&gt;[http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1931/1347.htm DIFP 1931, No.523]&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise was negotiated whereby the Free State would use a separate "external seal" in the custody of its [[Minister for External Affairs (Ireland)|Minister for External Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=30 March 1931 |title=Irish Free State&amp;nbsp;— To Have Its Own Seal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The external seal, designed by [[Percy Metcalfe]], had on its obverse the same harp image as the Great Seal, and on its reverse the same image of the monarch enthroned as the British Great Seal of the Realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1931/1238.htm DIFP 1931, No.536]; [http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1931/1250.htm DIFP 1931, No.550]&lt;/ref&gt; George V formally presented the external seal to John W. Dulanty on 18 January 1932 at [[Sandringham House]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1932/1324.htm DIFP 1932, No.625]&lt;/ref&gt;

The External Great Seal was used only on [[ratification]]s and [[Full Powers]], and not always on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1938 p.484 "In certain instances governmental full powers of Ireland ... are exchanged against heads-of-states full powers of other countries"&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesser seals were used on lesser documents:&lt;ref name="difp2243"&gt;[http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1937/2243.htm DIFP 1937, No.97]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "[[Signet ring|Signet]] Seal" on [[exequatur]]s (receiving foreign diplomats) and [[Commission (document)|commission]]s (appointing Irish diplomats).
* The "[[fob pocket|Fob]] Seal" on the back of the envelope enclosing letters [[letter of credence|of credence]] or [[letter of recall|recall]]

The first use of the External Great Seal was not until 1937, for ratifying the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1938 p.485&lt;/ref&gt; Successive governments minimised the use of monarch and the External Great Seal.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1938 p.483 "It is a policy of the Irish Government to avoid the use of the King in treaty-making wherever possible."&lt;/ref&gt;  The state typically conducted bilateral agreements at inter-government level rather than the nominally more prestigious head-of-state level, so that the Minister for External Affairs would use the internal Great Seal for any documents.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1938 pp.482–483&lt;/ref&gt; After signing some multilateral treaties that would have required the External Great Seal for ratification, the state chose instead to wait until the treaty had come into force and then become a party to it by accession rather than ratification, as the internal Great Seal would suffice for accession.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart 1938 p.484&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], following the Free State's lead, the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1934&lt;ref name="sa1934"/&gt; and Canada in 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1939v01cana#page/111|title=The Seals Act, 1939 [3 George VI c.22] |accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed laws permitting themselves to use their own Great Seals for diplomatic functions.&lt;ref name="Jones1946"/&gt;

==Supersession==

The [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936]] abolished the office of [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]] and transferred his functions to the Executive Council, which thereafter used the internal Great Seal directly rather than advising the Governor General to use it.  The [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936]] continued the use of the External Great Seal by the King.&lt;ref name="difp2243"/&gt;

The 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] created the office of [[President of Ireland]], and the [[Seal of the President of Ireland|Seal of the President]] was created for formal signature of official documents in the same manner as the internal Great Seal of the Irish Free State. The British monarch (now [[George VI]]) continued to sign diplomatic documents using the External Great Seal. This dichotomy reflected [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949|ambiguity over who was head of state]]. The [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]] transferred diplomatic functions to the President, rendering the External Great Seal obsolete.

'''Henry Beveridge''' (9 February 1837 – 8 November 1929)  was an [[Indian Civil Service]] officer and [[Oriental studies|orientalist]]  in [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Beveridge,_Henry|title=Beveridge, Henry|publisher= Banglapedia|accessdate= 23 April 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Born in Scotland, Beveridge studied at the Royal Circus School, Glasgow, [[Edinburgh Academy]] and [[Glasgow College]]. In 1856 he entered [[Queen's College, Belfast]], where his father had been appointed editor of The Banner of Ulster. In July 1857 he successfully passed the public examinations for the [[Indian Civil Service]], joining the service in 1857. He left for India in 1857 and reached Calcutta in January 1858. 

After training he was posted to [[Mymensingh]] as Assistant Magistrate and Collector and was then transferred to [[Jhenaidah]] in 1861, to [[Jessore]] in January 1862, to [[Nadia]] in April 1862, to [[Midnapur]] in January 1863, and to [[Sylhet]] in February 1863. From November 1863 he was posted for one year to the Foreign Department, serving in [[Manipur]] on special duty, after which he was sent to [[Kuch Behar]] as Joint Magistrate and Deputy Collector and then successively transferred to [[Dhaka]], [[Noakhali]], [[Hugli-Chinsura|Hughli]], [[Barisal]], [[Chittagong]] and back to Barisal in June 1871. 

In 1875 he entered the judiciary and was posted to [[Rangpur City|Rangpur]] as District and Sessions Judge in December 1876, serving in the same capacity in the districts of [[Pabna]], [[24 Parganas]], [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]], [[Birbhum]], Hughli, and [[Murshidabad]] until his retirment in 1893. He was elected President of [[The Asiatic Society]] (of Bengal) for 1890–91.

==Private life==
He married [[Annette Beveridge|Annette Akroyd]], one of the first graduates of [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]] and translator of [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turki]] texts. Her known works are the translations of the [[Baburnama]]&lt;ref name="Beveridge3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Babur|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The Babur-nama in English (Memoirs of Babur)|date=1922|publisher=Luzac and Co. |location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/baburnamainengli01babuuoft|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Turki]] (Turkish) language, and the Humayun-nama from [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref name="Beveridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beveridge|first1=Annette Susannah|title=Life and writings of Gulbadan Begam (Lady Rosebody)|date=1898|location=Calcutta|url=https://archive.org/details/lifewritingsofgu00beve|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beveridge2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Begam|first1=Gulbaden|editor1-last=Beveridge|editor1-first=Annette Susannah|title=The history of Humāyūn (Humāyūn-nāma)|date=1902|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/historyhumynhum00bevegoog|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children: a daughter, Annette Jeanie Beveridge (d. 1956), who married [[R. H. Tawney]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 "Courtship and marriage", of ''The Life of R. H. Tawney: Socialism and History''  By Lawrence Goldman&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, [[William Beveridge]] (1879–1963), a noted economist who gave his name to [[Beveridge report|the report]] associated with the foundation of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name=pe/&gt;

Beveridge retired to Pitfold, [[Shottermill]], [[Surrey]], England, where he devoted his time to studying and writing about India before dying in 1929.&lt;ref name=pe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p14226.htm#i142259|title=Henry Beveridge Genealogy|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beveridge was an [[atheism|atheist]] and "an ardent discipline of the French [[positivist]] philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]" and his theories of [[altruism]] and the [[religion of humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fabians.org.uk/who-was-william-beveridge |publisher= [[Fabian Society]] |title= Who Was William Beveridge |date= 21 December 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hingorja''' are a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of a province of [[Sindh]] in [[Pakistan]]. They are one of a number of communities of pastoral nomads found in the [[Banni Grasslands Reserve|Banni]] region of [[Kutch]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 509-512&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The Hingorja claim descent from [[Samma (tribe)|Samma]] [[Rajput]]s, who were devotees of Hinglaj Mata, whose temple is situated in [[Hingol]] in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]]. They were converted to [[Islam]], about five centuries ago, and migrated to [[Kutch]] in search of pasture. The Hingorja perceive themselves to be [[Muslim Rajput]]s.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 509-512&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The community is concentrated in the villages of Nandi Daddar, Mota Banda and Dumcara in the [[talukas|taluka]] of [[Bhuj]], in the [[Kutch District]] of [[Gujarat]], and the neighbouring districts of [[Badin District|Badin]] and [[Tharparkar District|Tharparkar]] in [[Sindh]].  They speak a dialect of [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], with substantial [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] loan words. The community is endogamous, but does marry with other [[Samma (tribe)|Samma]] communities, such as the [[Hingora]]. They are divided into a number of clans, the main ones being the Malwani, Jeshwani, Parian, Rebani and Kheera.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 509-512&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hingorja are a community of [[Maldhari]] cattle breeders. In addition to cattle breeding, the Hingorja are also cultivators, and landless agricultural labourers. Like other [[Kutchi people|Kutchi]] communities, many of them have migrated to other parts of [[India]] in search of employment.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 509-512&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5343">{{short description|Idea that comparative uses of the word Holocaust trivialize the Holocaust}}
{{see also|Holocaust denial}}
Many authors argue that a metaphorical (or otherwise comparative) use of the word ''[[Holocaust]]'' constitutes '''Holocaust trivialization''', and many consider such uses offensive.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bnaibrith.ca/publications/audit2000/audit2000-03.html Antisemitism and Hate in Canada]'', from the League for Human Rights of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Holocaust survivor and memoirist [[Elie Wiesel]],&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot use [the word 'Holocaust'] anymore. First, because there are no words, and also because it has become so trivialized that I cannot use it anymore. Whatever mishap occurs now, they call it 'holocaust'. I have seen it myself in television in the country in which I live. A commentator describing the defeat of a sports team, somewhere, called it a 'holocaust'. I have read in a very prestigious newspaper published in California, a description of the murder of six people, and the author called it a holocaust. So, I have no words anymore.&lt;ref&gt;''Comprehending the Holocaust: Historical and Literary Research'', ed. Asher Cohen, Joav Gelber, and Charlotte Wardi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Gerstenfeld]] identifies trivialization and universalization of the Holocaust as one of eleven forms of Holocaust distortion. Holocaust trivialization involves the application of language that is specific to describing the Holocaust to events and purposes that are unrelated to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerstenfeld|first=Manfred|title=The Multiple Distortions of Holocaust Memory|url=http://jcpa.org/article/the-multiple-distortions-of-holocaust-memory/|publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]|accessdate=31 May 2012|authorlink=Manfred Gerstenfeld|date=28 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[David Stannard]] argued that attempts to eliminate Holocaust comparisons belittle other events of comparable magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Stannard, David E. [http://chronicle.com/che-data/articles.dir/art-42.dir/issue-47.dir/47b00101.htm "The dangers of calling the Holocaust unique"], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', August 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable cases ==
The [[Anti-Defamation League]] has accused [[Gilad Atzmon]] of trivializing and distorting the Holocaust specifically in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The ADL states that, among other abuses, Atzmon invoked the word ''[[Shoah]]'' to describe Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Backgrounder: Gilad Atzmon|url=http://www.adl.org/main_Anti_Semitism_International/gilad-atzmon-anti-semite.htm|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|access-date=31 May 2012|date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Israel and Jewish Affairs condemned the [[United Church of Canada]] for trivializing the Holocaust. According to the Center, the United Church published a document&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Government Advocacy Around Palestine and Israel |url=https://www.united-church.ca/social-action/justice-initiatives/government-advocacy-around-palestine-and-israel |publisher=The [[United Church of Canada]] |access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |title=The Working Group on Israel/Palestine Policy (2012) |url=https://commons.united-church.ca/Documents/What%20We%20Believe%20and%20Why/Peace/Working%20Group%20on%20Palestine%20Israel%20Policy.docx |conference=41st General Council (2012) |date=1 August 2012 |format=[[DOCX]] (Microsoft Word) |publisher=The [[United Church of Canada]] |access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they placed a statement decrying the "loss of dignity" on the part of the Palestinians, attributed to Israel, promptly after a similar statement acknowledging "the denial of human dignity to Jews" in the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lungen|first=Paul|title=CIJA slams United Church stance on Mideast|url=http://www.cjnews.com/canada/cija-slams-united-church-stance-mideast|access-date=31 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Canadian Jewish News]]|date=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association of Independent Journalists Inc.''' ('''IAIJ''') is a registered not-for-profit journalist association with offices in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada and [[London]], England.  The association is international and caters to amateur (citizen journalists) and professional journalists with advocacy and support services worldwide.

==History==

The International Association of Independent Journalists was created in October 2003 by Maurice Ali who was a journalist and writer living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  In his book "Protest!: The Fall of Civil Disobedience,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='Protest!: The Fall Of Civil Disobedience'|pages=|publisher=Fortress Of Freedom Inc.|year= 2004|url=http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/aaweb-bin/aamain/itemdisp?sessionKey=999999999_142&amp;l=0&amp;lvl=1&amp;v=1&amp;itm=31463160&amp;rt=1&amp;bill=1|accessdate=22 August 2011}}  {{ISBN|0-9736335-0-6}} (Pages 195-207).&lt;/ref&gt;  Maurice Ali noted the emergence of the "citizen journalist" and that the journalist community should be more inclusive of all types of journalists, and this same sentiment became the basis for IAIJ's constitution when incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation on February 12, 2008 (Letters Patent file number: 446727-2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='Corporations Canada'|pages=|publisher=Government Of Canada|date=February 12, 2008|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=4467272&amp;V_TOKEN=1489942541889&amp;crpNm=International|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This constitution of inclusion followed most closely, the policies and mandates of the U.N./UNESCO derived from Article 19 of the United Nation's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].  The association grew over the years, gained a second office in London, England; and on June 11, 2011 the association became an "Institutional Member" of the Canadian Commission for UNESCO which is located in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada. On July 25, 2016 IAIJ attained Consultative Status at the United Nations.

==Operations==

Membership of the association is in the hundreds with a Board of Directors.  A general meeting is held each year at the head office in Toronto on February 12.  Membership is international and support and services are dispatched through offices in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and London, England.   The association has a diploma program for self-improvement and also provides editorial material for a newspaper called "The Fortress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='The Fortress|pages=|publisher=Fortress Of Freedom Inc.|date=April 2004|url=http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/aaweb-bin/aamain/itemdisp?sessionKey=999999999_142&amp;l=0&amp;d=2&amp;v=0&amp;lvl=1&amp;itm=38649757|accessdate=22 August 2011}} ISSN 1923-9858.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==

The association through its President (Maurice Ali) and the membership have participated in advocacy by published studies and articles on citizen journalism, attended and spoken at UNESCO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='Citizen Journalism’ |pages=|publisher=UNESCO |date=February 27, 2013|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/news/30_citizen_journalism.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and United Nations events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='WSIS+10 United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting’ |pages=|publisher=United Nations |date=July 2, 2015|url=https://publicadministration.un.org/wsis10/2julystakeholderconsultation|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title='Maurice Ali Speech: International Association of Independent Journalists Inc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17667">Some [[association football]] players are [[Muslims]], and their clubs have adapted to their principles.

In July 2013, [[BBC]] journalist Rob Cowling remarked that Muslim players were changing the culture of English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23159023|title=Premier League: How Muslims are changing English football culture|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=10 July 2013|author=Rob Cowling|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic observance of [[Ramadan]], affects the ability of players to train and play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/fasting-and-football-how-do-topflight-muslims-cope-2342187.html|title=Fasting and football. How do top-flight Muslims cope?|date=23 August 2011|accessdate=10 July 2013|author=Tusdiq Din|publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some players have refused to wear football shirts sponsored by gambling and finance companies, as [[Maisir|gambling]] and [[Riba|charging interest]] are forbidden in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22857014|title=Newcastle's Papiss Cisse plans club talks over new shirt sponsor|date=12 June 2013|accessdate=10 July 2013|author=Saj Chowdhury and Ben Smith|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Muslim players have been subjected to [[racism in association football|racist abuse in the sport]], and clubs which sign Muslim players have also been targeted.&lt;ref name=Beitar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/08/world/meast/israel-football-arson|title=Israeli football club torched after signing Muslim players|date=8 February 2013|accessdate=10 July 2013|author=Paul Gittings|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity and conflict==
Football was introduced to Iran by British oil workers and promoted under the regime of [[Reza Shah]] in the 1920s. Although both playing and watching the game have often been in conflict with religious requirements under the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], it continues to be popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.payvand.com/news/13/jun/1037.html | title=Iran in June: A Fever Pitch of Football and Politics | publisher=www.payvand.com | date=5 June 2013 | accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Football in the Palestinian territories|Football in Palestine]] was introduced during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate]] period of 1920-1948. In 2011 a women's football team called Girls FC, made-up of both Muslims and Christians, was formed. Despite [[Intimate parts in Islam|religious requirements]] and objections at the women wearing shorts and "playing a man's game", the team proved to be popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2012/06/2012626105337593602.html | title=Girls FC | publisher=Al Jazeera | date=27 June 2012 | accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football and Ramadan==
In 2010 Iranian player [[Ali Karimi]] was sacked by his [[Tehran]]-based club [[Steel Azin]] for breaking the fast during Ramadan. Karimi was seen drinking water during a training session; he denied any insult and was reinstated by the club after agreeing to pay a $40,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11095904 | title=Iran footballer returns after Ramadan fasting row | publisher=BBC News Middle East | date=26 August 2010 | accessdate=11 July 2013 | author=Adams, Keith}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the debilitating effect on the fitness of players was noted in connection with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] player [[Demba Ba]]. Described as "drained and lethargic" due to [[Sawn of Ramadan|fasting during Ramadan]], he scored three goals in just over thirty minutes in a 3-1 win against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in his first match after Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/newcastle-united/8788187/Newcastle-Uniteds-Demba-Bas-destroys-Blackburn-Rovers-with-a-hat-trick.html | title=Newcastle United's Demba Ba's destroys Blackburn Rovers with a hat-trick | publisher=Daily Telegraph | date=25 September 2011 | accessdate=11 July 2013 | author=Edwards, Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football and Islamic prayer==
[[File:Cheikhou Kouyaté makes dua.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Cheikhou Kouyaté]] makes [[dua]] before a game]]
Observance of their Islamic prayers has brought players into conflict with their managers. [[Harry Redknapp]], when manager of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], was critical of player [[Frédéric Kanouté]]'s prayer and fasting requirements.&lt;ref name="BaconBlows2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steve Bacon|author2=Kirk  Blows|title=There's Only One Stevie Bacon: My Life Watching West Ham Through a Camera Lens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c_atAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1894|date=16 August 2012|publisher=Biteback Publishing|isbn=978-1-84954-459-7|pages=1894–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Newcastle United considered the introduction of prayer rooms at both [[St James' Park]] and at their training ground. Whilst not designed exclusively for Muslims, the rooms were planned to be used for [[salat|prayer]] by Muslim players Demba Ba, [[Papiss Cissé]], [[Hatem Ben Arfa]] and [[Cheik Tioté]]. The club pointed out that this is in marked contrast to the experiences of their former player and convert to Islam, [[Didier Domi]], who was mocked when discovered doing Islamic prayers in the showers.&lt;ref name="Domi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Articles/Dossier/ARTJAJA2562p024-033.xml4/france-musulman-islam-bruno-metsuvivre-sa-foi-au-grand-jour.html | title=Islam made in France | publisher=www.jeuneafrique.com | date=23 February 2010 | accessdate=2 November 2013 | author=Ghozali, Faïza | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/05/alan-pardew-newcastle-united-manchester-city | title=Alan Pardew keeping the faith in the Newcastle United revolution | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | date=5 May 2012 | accessdate=11 July 2013 | author=Taylor, Louise}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[2012-13 Newcastle United F.C. season|2012-13 season]] Newcastle's seven Muslim players regularly used a purpose built multi-faith [[Darsley Park|training ground]] prayer room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jun/17/newcastle-united-joe-kinnear-alan-pardew | title=Joe Kinnear's second coming could cause Newcastle United further regret | publisher=The Guardian | date=17 June 2013 | accessdate=11 July 2013 | author=Taylor, Louise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several players, such as Demba Ba and Papiss Cissé, choose an act of [[Sujud|prostration]] with forehead to the ground as a celebration after scoring a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/demba-ba-interview-chelsea-is-the-start-of-my-career-8581069.html | title=Demba Ba interview: 'Chelsea is the start of my career' | publisher=The Independent | date=20 April 2013 | accessdate=11 July 2013 | author=Wallace, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 football commentator [[Gary Lineker]] was forced to apologise after describing one such celebration by player [[Karim Ait-Fana]] for French side [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] as "eating grass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/gary-lineker-apologises-after-joking-that-praying-muslim-footballers-were-eating-grass-8202728.html | title=Gary Lineker apologises after joking that praying Muslim footballers were 'eating grass' | publisher=The Independent | date=8 October 2012 | accessdate=11 July 2013 | author=Hall, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Muslim footballers have also worn T-shirts carrying messages relating to Islam under their football shirts. [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] player [[Adel Taarabt]] has worn a shirt carrying the message "I Love Allah" whilst [[Samir Nasri]], in 2012, celebrated a goal for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] with a shirt carrying the message "[[Eid Mubarak]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamiquemagazine.com/the-influence-of-islam-on-english-football/ | title=The Influence Of Islam On English Football | publisher=Islamique Magazine | accessdate=12 July 2013 | author=Aleem, Abdul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2012-08-19/nasri-celebrates-winning-goal-against-southampton-with-eid-mubarak-t-shirt/ | title=Nasri celebrates goal against Southampton with 'Eid Mubarak' T-shirt | publisher=ITV | date=19 August 2012 | accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, fans attending a World Cup qualifying game between [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at the [[Azadi Stadium]] in [[Tehran]] were asked to replace usual football chanting with religious chants as the match fell on a day of commemoration for [[Tasu'a]], a [[Shia Islam]] holy day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37616279|title=Iran v South Korea: Supporters asked to mourn at World Cup qualifier|date=11 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam and football shirts==

Muslim leaders in [[Malaysia]] have called for Muslims not to wear football shirts with [[crucifix|crosses]] on the badge, such as [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], seeing them as prioritising [[Christianity]]. They have also warned against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] shirts, which feature a [[devil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/7900366/Muslims-ban-Manchester-United-shirts-over-red-devil-image.html | title=Muslims ban Manchester United shirts over red devil image | publisher=The Telegraph | date=20 July 2010 | accessdate=11 July 2013 | author=Henderson, Barney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] removed a cross from their [[Real Madrid CF#Crest and shirt|club crest]] on promotional material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/real-madrid-small-distinct-change-crest-uae-resort-202900831.html | title=Real Madrid make small but deliberate change to their crest for UAE resort island partnership | publisher=Sports.Yahoo.com | date=30 March 2012 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Peck, Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change was linked with the building of a $1 billion [[Real Madrid Resort Island|sports tourist resort]] in the Islamic [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianmuslimobserver.com/2012/04/real-madrid-changing-cross-logo-for.html |title=Real Madrid changing cross logo for Muslim fans, sponsors |publisher=Indian Muslim Observer |date=13 April 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034541/http://www.indianmuslimobserver.com/2012/04/real-madrid-changing-cross-logo-for.html |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theeasternpost.org/show_news.php?ofPage=16&amp;id=3189&amp;headLine=Real-Madrid-Reband-Logo-for-Muslim-Fans | title=Real Madrid Reband Logo for Muslim Fans | publisher=The Eastern Post | accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frédéric Kanouté]] used to modify his [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] shirt, to obscure the sponsorship from online casino [[888.com]]. The club later came to an agreement that the player was not endorsing gambling by wearing it, and would be excused from any promotional material with 888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/apr/05/newsstory.sport|title=Where did it all go right for Fredi Kanouté?|first=Ben|last=Clissitt|date=5 April 2007|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 Newcastle United player [[Papiss Cissé]] refused to play in a shirt sponsored by [[Wonga.com]], a [[payday loan]] company, as the charging of interest is not permitted under [[Fiqh|Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23347131 | title=Papiss Cisse pulls out of Newcastle tour after sponsor row | publisher=BBC Sport | date=17 July 2013 | accessdate=18 July 2013 | author=Smith, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he agreed to wear the shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/25/papiss-cisse-newcastle-wonga-row|title=Papiss Cissé stands down in Wonga row and agrees to wear branded kit|first=Louise|last=Taylor|date=25 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic dress code and football==
The requirements of Islamic dress code have been contradictory to the kit requirements of [[FIFA]]. In 2011 the [[Iran women's national football team|Iran women's football team]] was prevented from playing a game in a qualifying round for the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics - Women's tournament|2012 Olympic Games]] due to their kit which comprised full tracksuits and head coverings concealing their hair. Women in Iran are required to wear the [[Hijab by country#Iran|maghnaeh]] to cover their heads. FIFA ruled that the kit broke one of their rules which states, "''Players and officials shall not display political, religious, commercial or personal messages or slogans in any language or form on their playing or team kits''." Although the Iranian footballing federation argued that the kit was neither religious nor political, Iran were prevented from playing the game which was awarded, 3-0 to [[Jordan women's national football team|Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/06/iran-women-olympic-strip | title=Iran's women footballers banned from Olympics because of Islamic strip | publisher=The Guardian | date=6 June 2011 | accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 FIFA had changed their ruling declaring that women were 
free to wear the hijab at senior competitive level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/sports/summer/football/17585-joy-for-fifa-prince-as-football-hijab-ban-is-lifted | title=Joy for FIFA Prince and Muslim women as football hijab ban is lifted | publisher=www.insidethegames.biz | date=5 July 2012 | accessdate=12 July 2013 | author=Warshaw, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuse==

There have been numerous cases of [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim abuse]] aimed at Muslim footballers. In 2005 Egyptian footballer [[Mido (footballer)|Mido]] whilst playing for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hostpur]] was taunted by fans of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] with "''Your mum's a terrorist''" and as a shoe bomber due to his likeness to [[Richard Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/nov/26/sport.comment3 | title=Mido: I love it here and I want to stay | publisher=The Guardian | date=26 November 2005 | accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Mido, then playing for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] was taunted by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] fans with anti-Muslim abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/aug/28/newsstory.middlesbrough | title=FA to investigate anti-Muslim abuse aimed at Mido | publisher=The Guardian | date=28 August 2007 | accessdate=15 July 2013 | author=Taylor, Louise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013 Muslim supporters of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] were verbally abused whilst conducting [[Maghrib prayer]] in the [[Boleyn Ground]] during a [[Premier League]] game between West Ham and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01k8bjk | title=Muslims face racist chants at West Ham | publisher=BBC News | date=24 October 2013 | accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Muslim supporters of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] were criticised and abused on social media after they had used the half-time interval to pray on prayer mats in a stairwell at [[Anfield]] during a match between Liverpool and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Their prayers were also defended by other fans.&lt;ref name="PrayerTweet"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-32326228 | title=Liverpool FC considers action over Muslim prayer tweet | publisher=BBC News | date=15 April 2015 | accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli club [[Beitar Jerusalem]] had their offices burned by Jewish nationalists in January 2013 after signing their first Muslim players.&lt;ref name=Beitar/&gt;

==In film==
The 2006 film ''[[Offside (2006 Iranian film)|Offside]]'' deals with the subject of football, in this case in Iran, and female spectators. A ban made during the [[1979 Iranian Revolution]] which stopped women from attending games, with Islamic religious leaders stating that women in stadiums was a recipe for disaster as they would see "bare legs" and hear profanities shouted by male fans. President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] had tried to end the ban before his attempts were vetoed by the country's supreme leader, [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]]. The film tells the stories of girls disguising themselves as males in order to watch a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|qualification]] match between [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]] at the [[Azadi Stadium]] in [[Tehran]]. It was banned from screening in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/05/20084913126165646.html | title=Iran censors hand Offside a red card | publisher=Al Jazeera | date=23 May 2006 | accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kambaata''' is a [[Highland East Cushitic]] language, part of the larger [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family and spoken by the [[Kambaata people]].  Dialects are Kambaata, Tambaro, Alaba, and K'abeena.  It is one of the official languages of Ethiopia. The language has a large number of verbal affixes. When these are affixed to verbal roots, there are a large amount of [[morphophonemic]] changes.&lt;ref&gt;Sim 1985, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  The language has SOV order (subject–object–verb).  The phonemes of Kambaata include five vowels (which are distinctively long or short), a set of [[ejective]]s, a retroflexed [[implosive]], and glottal stop.

The New Testament and some parts of the Old Testament have been translated into the Kambaata language.  At first, they were published in the Ethiopian syllabary (New Testament in 1992), but later on, they were republished in Latin letters, in conformity with new policies and practices.

The '''Knickerbocker Yacht Club''' was a [[yacht club]] in [[Port Washington, New York|Port Washington]], New York.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Applebome |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/nyregion/12towns.html |title=The Recession Takes Down a Yacht Club |location=Long Island Sound |work=The New York Times |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was founded in 1874, on the [[Harlem River]] at 130th Street in Manhattan, to encourage “Yachting and the cultivation of Naval Science and Seamanship”.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMIWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=%22Knickerbocker+Yacht+Club%22+1874&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8KapTrDNN8jx0gHw3tn3DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Knickerbocker%20Yacht%20Club%22%201874&amp;f=false |title=Brooklyn daily eagle almanac |publisher=Brooklyn Daily Eagle |year=1901|author= |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="antonnews2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.antonnews.com/portwashingtonnews/2007/02/23/news/nautical.html |title=Port's Nautical History Exhibit in Port Library |publisher=Antonnews.com |date=February 23, 2007 |author=Bob Hogan |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403024751/http://www.antonnews.com/portwashingtonnews/2007/02/23/news/nautical.html |archivedate=April  3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak in the early 1980s, membership consisted of approximately 290 families with 165 boats.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

As of 2009, it was the second-oldest yacht club on [[Long Island Sound]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Due to the recession and waning membership, the club ceased to exist in 2009 and was sold for $3.2 million to Cord Meyer Development. In July 2012 demolition of the club began, the developers began on a new structure which today is the Knickerbocker Yacht Hotel designed to evoke a cruise ship. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/realestate/long-island-in-the-region-bon-voyage-to-a-gilded-club.html |title=Bon Voyage to a Gilded Club |publisher=New York Times |date=July 26, 2012 |author= |accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kreeta Haapasalo Playing the Kantele in a Peasant Cottage ''''' is an oil work on canvas painted in 1868 by [[Robert Wilhelm Ekman]] (1808-1873).

== Description ==
The dimensions of the painting are 75 × 105&amp;nbsp;cm. It was purchased for the collection of the [[Ateneum]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063618/FI_280_001.html|title=Kreeta Haapasalo Playing the Kantele in a Peasant Cottage|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of people listen to a [[kantele]] playing. This includes the mistress of the house, young women and their children. Leaning in the corner is a pipe-smoking soldier. The environment is simple, related to their everyday chores, and lit by a daylit window. The work reflects an idealized vision of the Finnish nation and its values.

== Analysis ==
[[Kreeta Haapasalo]] was a well-known folk musician who in periods of famine in the 1860s fed a family by traveling as a [[kantele]] player, singing poetry. It brought her great popularity at a time of great interest in the roots of the Finnish people. Haapasalo was seen at the time as part of an ancient tradition as an interpreter of the [[Kalevala]], through which she was able to get in touch with genuine Finnish culture.

Robert Ekman, the painter, was interested in the origins of Finnish culture. Ekman studied at the Stockholm Academy of Art. He was interested in historical development and the public life of the Finnish people. His genre paintings depicting it were well received. He returned to Finland on a permanent basis, after an Italian and French tour in 1845, after which he taught until his death in [[Turku]] drawing school, which he established in the following year.

The modern [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA rating system]] assigns a PG-13 rating if a film contains the word. The R rating is normally required if the film contains two utterances or if the word is used in a sexual context. There are exceptions to the rule that one sexual use or two non-sexual uses of "fuck" results in an R rating. In some cases, filmmakers appealed the rating because their target audience might avoid an R-rated film. Censors have been more lenient about the word in films that portray historical events.&lt;ref name=fwordpg13&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ridder|first1=Knight|title=F-word doesn't always equal R rating|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-08-28/entertainment/0308270034_1_mpaa-rating-films-f-word|accessdate=3 October 2015|work=Baltimore Sun|date=28 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of non-[[pornographic]], [[English language]] films containing at least 150 spoken uses of the word ''fuck'' (or one of its [[derivation (linguistics)|derivatives]]), ordered by the number of such uses.

This '''''Magbo helmet mask for an Oro society member''''' was created by [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] artist Onabanjo of Itu Meko. It is currently located in the African collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Created around 1880-1910, it depicts a varied cast of community members carved of wood, colored with pigment, and mounted on a curved bar surmounting the helmet.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Thirteen distinct figures crown this helmet, including a prisoner, a nursing mother, a preacher, an [[accordion]] player, a soldier, an elder, a [[palmwine]] tapper, and a mounted warrior wearing a helmet of his own, this one topped by an enormous bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drewal|first=Henry John|title=Yoruba: Nine Centuries of African Art and Thought|year=1989|publisher=[[H. N. Abrams]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates the wide reach of the ''Oro'' society, encompassing the entire community. After 1850, [[Brazil]]ian motifs (such as the double scrolls above the main face and floral clusters throughout) became a common part of the artistic vernacular among the [[Ijebu]] subgroup of the Yoruba people. This is because former slaves returned home, bringing new ideas to the already sophisticated culture.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

==Historical information==
In Yoruba communities, the secretive ''Oro'' society had immense power. It was composed of community leaders, who would meet to reward good deeds and punish bad ones with everything from chastisement to the death penalty. They also presided over burials.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

===Acquisition===
This mask was purchased by Indianapolis philanthropist Harrison Eiteljorg in 1976. He gave it to the IMA in 1989, where it was given the accession number 1989.754. It is currently on view in the Eiteljorg Suite of African and Oceanic Art.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Magbo helmet mask for Oro association|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/magbo-helmet-mask-oro-association-onabanjo-itu-meko|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Artist==
Most African art is unattributed. The unusual practice of nailing the individual figures to the helmet, rather than carving the entire artwork from a single piece of wood, leads scholars to believe that this is the work of master carver Onabanjo, from the village of Itu Meko, [[Nigeria]]. The Brazilian motifs are also in keeping with his work.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

'''Marind''' or '''Marind-Anim''' are people living in South [[New Guinea]].

== Geography ==
The Marind- anim live in [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua province]] of [[Indonesia]].
They occupy a vast territory, which is situated on either side of the Bian, from about 20 miles to the east of Merauke up the mouth of the Moeli in the west (between Frederik Hendrik Island and the mainland, east of [[Yos Sudarso Island]], mainly west of [[Maro River]] (a small area goes beyond Maro at its lower part, including [[Merauke]]).&lt;ref name=map&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 225&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marind languages.svg|thumb|center|300px|A map showing New Guinea language groups. The Marind-speaking area is highlighted in red.]]

== Topography ==
The territory of the Marind tribe consist of a low-lying, deposited coastal area. This area is for the most part flooded in the wet season. The hinterland, which is situated somewhat higher is intersected by a great number of rivers.
Originally, either sago or coconut palm trees were planted, though stretches of bamboo could also be found.

== Culture ==
Traditionally the social structure of the Marind was characterised by a clan system. Marind-tribe was divided into moitiesm, each consisting of patrilineal clans (boans). These clans are subdivided into subclans (also boans).

The people lived spread in several [[Extended family|extended families]]. Such an extended family derives its origin from a mythological ancestor. [[Ancestor veneration]] has a characteristic form here: these mythological ancestors are [[demon]]-like figures, they feature in myths, and act as [[culture hero]]es, arranging the ancient world to its recent state, introducing plants, animals, cultural goods.&lt;ref name="Nevermann 1957: 12"&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 12&lt;/ref&gt; They have often the form of plants or animals; there is a kind of [[totemism]], but it is not accompanied by a regular [[food taboo]] of the respective animal or plant.&lt;ref name=cannibalism&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 13&lt;/ref&gt; Totems can appear both in artefacts&lt;ref name=fish_totem_artefact&gt;[[#Unknown1920s|Unknown photographer 1920s]] (see postcard image [http://www.oceania-ethnographica.com/mel126.html online])&lt;/ref&gt; and myths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 86, 202/note 108 (= Die Taube und die Enten)&lt;/ref&gt;

The word for such an ancestral spirit being is ''dema'' in the [[Marind languages]]. The material similarity of this word to “demon” is incidental. Each extended family keeps and transfers the tradition, it is especially the chore of the [[Big man (anthropology)|big men]] of the respective family. The influence of these big men does not go beyond their extended family.&lt;ref name="Nevermann 1957: 12"/&gt;

In the past, the Marind were famed because of [[headhunting]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 9&lt;/ref&gt; This was rooted in their belief system and linked to the name-giving of the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 111&lt;/ref&gt; The skull was believed to contain a [[mana]]-like force.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: blurb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marind-anim are also notable for their sexual culture. Ritual intercourse (otiv-bombari) with women would take place on the day of a girl's wedding, when after the ceremony she would have sex with her new partner's male kin before having sex with her husband. This ritualistic intercourse would take place during other times  as well, such as after the woman has given birth.&lt;ref name=anthro&gt;Keesing, Roger M. &amp; Strathern, Andrew J. (1998), ''Cultural Anthropology: A Contemporary Perspective, 3rd. edition'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Marind culture was researched by several [[ethnologist]]s and missionaries. For example, the Swiss [[Paul Wirz]], the German [[Hans Nevermann]],&lt;ref name=research&gt;[[#Nev57|Nevermann 1957]]: 7&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dutch cultural anthropologist [[Jan van Baal]], who was the Governor of [[Netherlands New Guinea]] from 1953 until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baal66|Van Baal 1966]]. A comprehensive standard work on Marind-anim culture.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marind languages]] form a small family of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] language phylum.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baal07|Baal 2007]]: Marind-anim,  Orientation (see [http://www.everyculture.com/Oceania/Marind-anim-Orientation.html online])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meriam''' (in the language itself ''Meriam Mìr''; also ''Miriam, Meryam, Mer, Mir, Miriam-Mir'', etc. and ''Eastern, Isten, Esten, ,'' and ''Able Able'') or the '''Eastern Torres Strait language''' is the language of the people of the small islands of ''Mer'' ([[Murray Island, Queensland|Murray Island]]), ''Waier'' and ''Dauar'', ''Erub'' ([[Darnley Island (Queensland)|Darnley Island]]), and ''Ugar'' ([[Stephens Island (Torres Strait)|Stephens Island]]) in the eastern [[Torres Strait]], [[Queensland]], Australia. In the Western Torres Strait language, [[Kalaw Lagaw Ya]], it is called ''Mœyam'' or ''Mœyamau Ya''. It is the only [[Papuan language]] in [[Australian]] territory.

==Classification==
Meriam was classified in the [[Eastern Trans-Fly languages|Eastern Trans-Fly family]] of the [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] Phylum by [[Stephen Wurm]], who however felt that these have retained remnants of pre-Trans–New Guinea languages; this is followed by [[Ethnologue]] (2005). In 2005 [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] concluded that the Eastern Trans-Fly languages were not part of the Trans–New Guinea phylum. [[R. M. W. Dixon]] (2002) regards claims of a relationship between the Fly River languages and Meriam as unproven, though what he bases his claim on is not clear, as Meriam Mir has a high cognacy rate with its sister languages, and a certain amount of mutual intelligibility is claimed by Meriam speakers. Mitchell finds that Meriam Mìr has 78% cognates with its sister Trans-Fly Papuan languages, the remaining vocabulary being mainly of Australian origin {{sfn|Mitchell|2015}}. Such Trans-Fly cognates include personal pronouns, and verbal and nominal morphology.

==Meriam Mìr and its neighbours==

Meriam has around 40 percent of its vocabulary in common with its unrelated Western Torres Strait neighbour [[Kala Lagaw Ya]], which is an [[Australian language]] {{sfn|Mitchell|2015}}. The shared words cover a wide range of semantic domains (body parts, kin, human classification, language, mythology, ceremony, artefacts, topography, natural elements, marine life, qualities, locations, directions and time), though not verbs. This latter strengthens arguments about genetic diversity, however there is still much to suggest mutual influence. The common vocabulary range from "exact cognates" to words that appear related, but have undergone semantic changes, as in the following selected from a list of 250 items (Mitchell 1995) (where exact "cognates" number 62 (24.8%), partial "cognates" 26 (10%) and "cognates" with semantic differentiation number 34 (13.7%)):

There are also various items of semantic relationship, but not formal relationship, such as WCL ''puuy(i)'', MM ''lu'' "plant, tree; magic".

Mitchell and Piper (unpublished research notes) used the Holman et al. 40-word list below, which shows 9 (22.5%) exact items, 5 (12.5%) partial, and 3 (7.5%) semantically related words. However, this list was designed for use with Euro-Asian languages, and is perhaps somewhat inappropriate; for example, no horned animals exist, neither language has a verb ‘come’, and Holman et al. assume one form for 'we'; WCL has 4, and MM has 2.

==Recent loans==
The main source of loan words to the language since the mid 1800s has been Yumplatòk ([[Torres Strait Creole]]) and English. There are also some minor loans from [[Dehu language|Lifu/Drehu]], Polynesian (in particular [[Samoan language|Samoan]] and to a lesser extent [[Rotuman language|Rotuman]]), Indonesian, Philippine, Japanese, and European origin.  Many such outsiders were recruited – or in some rare cases [[black-birded]] – in the 19th century for pearl diving and other marine work, while others (from Lifu and Samoa) were missionaries with the British and Foreign Bible Society.

==Dialects==

The language is currently dialectless.  However, there was once a separate dialect spoken on [[Darnley Island (Queensland)|Erub]] and [[Stephens Island (Torres Strait)|Ugar]] islands, characterised in part by the retention of phonemic distinctions between 'ng', 'g', 'n' and 'r' where these have fallen together in two ways in Meriam Mir.  The sound 'ng' in Modern Meriam has become 'n' at the beginning of words and 'g' within words; 'n' in many cases has become 'r' within words. Examples are remembered in one important Erub folktale (Lawrie 1970:283–284):

Erub : '''Aka nade ki andinane?  Ge au?'''

Mer  : '''Aka nade ki ardirare?  Ge au?'''

''Where will we put it?  There?''

Erub : '''Mena inggandane/ingandane!  Keniba uzen unken a keniba imut unken.'''

Mer  : '''Mena igardare!  Keriba uzer urker a keriba imut urker.'''

''Keep carrying it!  Our paddles and our poling poles are still strong.''

The earliest records (early 19th century) of Meriam Mìr included the phrase '''debelang''' ''good taste/nice'', in present-day Meriam Mìr '''debe lag'''. This shows that the 'ng' &gt; 'n'/'g' change is of fairly recent date; '''lang''', now '''lag''', is identical to the [[Gizrra language|Gizrra]] '''lang''' of the same meaning.

For some speakers the following pairs exhibit variation, and perhaps have unidentified allophonic variation: {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[ɪ]}} (mainly Erub/Ulag), {{IPA|[ɪ]}} and {{IPA|[i]}} (mainly Mer), {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, {{IPA|[ʊ]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}, and {{IPA|[o]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1893">'''Molse School''', ''translated as "School of Mol",'' is a common term for some international paint artists or a specific genre of paintings in late 19th and early 20th century.  The paintings typically show picturesque and rustic places, farms, ... of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[municipality]] [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]], which is located in the [[Campine]].  The most famous painters of the  ''Molse School'' were [[Jakob Smits]] and [[Dirk Baksteen]] who lived in Achterbos, a hamlet of Mol.

Based upon the [[Barbizon school]] the municipality Mol organized an international art [[exhibition]] in 1907 and invited painters from all over the world.   Most of these artists had not met before and their only connection was their stay in a local [[hotel]] during the exhibition. These artists were not tied by a fine art society, neither was there a common style. In total 68 artists participated at this event, showing  212 works. This exhibition was also an attempt to show the artists the beauty of Mol, its [[heath]], the white sand flats and how the inhabitants (mostly [[farmer]]s) lived.  This attempt succeeded.

Upon their return home, the artists showed their paintings to their colleagues. This resulted in those colleagues also coming over to Mol making painting [[en plein air]] popular.

Some artists commonly categorized under the  ''Molse School'' are [[Dirk Baksteen]], [[Gerard Baksteen]], [[Charles Claessens]], [[Leon Delderenne]], [[Paul Mathieu]], [[Ernest Midy]], [[Erneste Rinquet]], [[Jakob Smits]], [[Willem Battaille]], [[Emile Van Damme-Sylva]], [[Paula Van Rompa-Zenke]], [[Gaston De Biemme]]

'''''Mondo''''' is a 1995 [[cinema of France|French]] [[drama film]] written and directed by [[Tony Gatlif]] based upon the short story by [[J. M. G. Le Clézio]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/30/movies/gypsy-boy-on-the-run-sees-beauty-in-every-raindrop.html?src=pm |title='Gypsy Boy on the Run Sees Beauty in Every Raindrop' |last=Stephen Holden |date=May 30, 1997 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film debuted at the [[Unifrance|Unifrance French Film Festival]] in Japan 1995, and premiered in France April 17, 1996.

==Background==
The film's star, Ovidiu Balan, was 11 when the film was shot. He is a [[Romanian Gypsy]] who was taken under the director's wing with help of the French government&lt;ref name="S F Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/reviews/movies/MONDO.DTL |title=Mondo a Wandering Wonder |last=Peter Stack |date=July 9, 1997 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gatlif created the film as a work on the themes of the "restless and free" gypsy, in contrast to the notion of settlements proposed for [[Sinti]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] populations in the [[European Union|EU]]. Unlike similar films about [[street children]], such as [[Salaam Bombay]] or [[Pixote]], this film was intended as a fairy tale of sorts of a mythical spirit who touches the lives of outcast people in a society filled with prejudice against the [[Romani people|gypsies]].

==Synopsis==
The movie follows an orphan boy surviving in [[Nice, France|Nice]] through the kindness of strangers and his own ingenuity. One day Mondo (Ovidiu Balan) appears on the streets of Nice. He has no family, no possessions, no schooling, but shares a brilliant smile and good spirit. Being more at home in the city's gardens, fields, and seashore, the bustle of the city seems to overwhelm him. He has good survival instincts, avoiding police and threatening adults in his search for a family.

==Cast==

* [[Philippe Petit]] as The Magician
* Pierrette Fesch as Thi Chin
* Jerry Smith as Dadi
* Schahla Aalam as The Magician's Friend

==Recognition==

===Awards and nominations===
* 1998, Adult's Jury Award Certificate of Merit for 'Feature Film and Video' at [[Chicago International Children's Film Festival]]&lt;ref name="CIFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cicff.org/bin/file/docs/Award%20List%201998.pdf |title=15th ANNUAL CHICAGO INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN’S FILM FESTIVAL 1998 AWARDS |year=1998 |work=[[Chicago International Children's Film Festival]]&lt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Gatlif's earlier film ''[[Latcho Drom]]'' presented a romantic portrait of Gypsy music and culture. He brings the same sensibility to this lyrical ''Mondo'', a sad-eyed image of the universal outsider, France's most unwanted.&lt;ref name = "NYDaily News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1997-05-30/entertainment/18043010_1_mondo-tony-gatlif-gypsy |title='He's France's Most Unwanted In Moving 'Mondo,' A Lost Gypsy Boy Finds Himself Cast Out' |last=Dave Kehr |date=May 30, 1997 |work=[[Daily News (New York)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mondo'' is described to be  visually reminding one of those rare days when the world used to sparkle as though it were brand new, set in the streets and docks of the French port city of Nice.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-28/entertainment/ca-7617_1_reluctant-star |title='A Reluctant Star Is Born in France' |last=Lanie Goodman |date=June 28, 1997 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''&lt;nowiki&gt;National Register of Citizens (NRC)           [ हिन्दी : राष्ट्रीय नागरिक पंजिका ]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' is a register containing names of all genuine [[Indian people|Indian]] citizens residing in [[Assam]]. The register was first prepared after the 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/national-register-of-citizens-in-assam-issue-of-illegal-foreigners-continues-to-be-a-major-political-one/articleshow/47657561.cms|title=National Register of Citizens in Assam: Issue of illegal foreigners continues to be a major political one}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/assam-overhaul-of-national-register-of-citizens-sparks-controversy/story-O082SAiZUXEc9ZRWfpsvDO.html|title=Assam: Overhaul of National Register of Citizens sparks controversy}} after&lt;/ref&gt;  [[1951 Census of India|Census of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/national-register-of-citizens-in-assam-issue-of-illegal-foreigners-continues-to-be-a-major-political-one/articleshow/47657561.cms |title=National Register of Citizens in Assam: Issue of illegal foreigners continues to be a major political one - The Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2015-06-14 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRC is now being updated in Assam to include the names of those persons (or their descendants) who appear in the NRC, 1951, or in any of the [[Electoral]] Rolls&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/Elecroll.aspx |title=Election Commission of India |publisher=Eci.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; up to the midnight of 24 March 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhardwaj |first=Sandeep |url=http://revisitingindia.com/2014/04/13/1971-india-pakistan-war-genocide/ |title=1971 India-Pakistan War: Genocide |publisher=Revisiting India |date=2014-04-13 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in any one of the other admissible documents issued up to mid-night of 24 March 1971, which would prove their presence in Assam or in any part of India on or before 24 March 1971.
The update process of NRC started in the year 2013 under the strict monitoring of Supreme Court of India. On the midnight of 31 December 2017, Part Draft NRC was released and subsequently on 30 July 2018, the Complete Draft NRC was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/final-draft-of-nrc-to-be-released-tomorrow-amid-security-1827181.html|title=Final Draft of NRC to be Released Today Amid Security|work=News18|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/the-citizenry-test-assam-nrc-explained/article24560028.ece|title=The citizenry test: Assam NRC explained|last=Bureau|first=National|date=2018-07-31|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of NRC ==
The purpose of NRC update is to identify illegal migrants residing in North eastern state who entered Indian territories after midnight on 24 March 1971 and to determine the citizenship of the applicants who have applied for inclusion of their names in the updated NRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/north-east/all-you-need-to-know-about-nrc-197825|title=All you need to know about NRC|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the 19th &amp; 20th century, [[Colonial Assam]] (1826–1947) witnessed migration from various provinces of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] especially after the [[Treaty of Yandabo|Yandabo treaty]] (signed on 24 February 1826). The liberal attitude of the Colonial authorities further encouraged the continuous arrival of peasants from Bengal to Assam in search of fertile lands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assam.gov.in/web/home-and-political-department/white-paper|title=White Papers on Foreigners Issue in Assam|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1931, C.S. Mullan, the Census Superintendent in his census report even stated:

''“Probably the most important event in the province during the last 25 years- an event, moreover, which seems likely to alter permanently the whole feature of Assam and to destroy the whole structure of Assamese culture and civilization has been the invasion of a vast horde of land-hungry immigrant”'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/religion-data-spotlight-on-assam-accord-after-30-years/story-UfUxBTwtmp5mu6iJgLmyiP.html|title=Religion data spotlight on Assam Accord after 30 years|date=2015-08-26|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Politics of Migration by Dr.Manju Singh, Anita Publications, Jaipur, 1990, Page 59)

Post partition too, the matter of influx didn’t die down. Excerpts from [[White paper|White Paper]] on Foreigners' Issue published by the Home &amp; Political Department, Government of Assam on October 20, 2012 – Chapter 1, Historical Perspective, section 1.2 reads thus – ''“Following Partition and communal riots in the subcontinent, Assam initially saw an influx of refugees and other migrants from East Pakistan. The number of such migrants other than refugees was initially reported by the State Government to be between 1,50,000 and 2,00,000 but later estimated to be around 5,00,000.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assam.gov.in/web/home-and-political-department/white-paper1#12|title=White Paper on Foreigners Issues, Chapter 1|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the seriousness of the matter concerning the persistent influx of illegal migrants, the Government of India went on to formulate the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950. This act which came into effect from 1 March 1950 mandated expulsion of illegal immigrants from the state of Assam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/documents/actsandordinences/assam_(the_immigrants_expulsuion_from-assam)_Act%20_1950.htm|title=The Immigrants(Expulsion from Assam)1950|website=www.satp.org|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify illegal immigrants, the National Register of Citizens was prepared for the first time in Assam during the conduct of 1951 Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/explained-in-brief-what-is-assams-national-register-of-citizens-updation-and-how-it-will-impact-illegal-immigrants/997223/|title=In-brief: What is Assam’s National Register of Citizens updation and how it will impact illegal immigrants|date=2018-01-01|work=The Financial Express|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was carried out under a directive of the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] (MHA) by recording particulars of every single person enumerated during that Census. However, this measure against illegal migrants too suffered a major setback due to the fact that only from October 1952 onwards the regulations of [[passport]] and [[Visa requirements for Indian citizens|visa]] became operational between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Further, “the definition of a foreigner to cover a Pakistan national was only clearly spelt out with the amendment of the [[The Foreigners Act, 1946|Foreigners Act 1946]] in 1957”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Meanwhile the issue of illegal infiltration was becoming formidable in the state of Assam. The Registrar General of Census in his report on 1961 Census assessed 220691 infiltrants to have entered Assam.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sci.gov.in/jonew/judis/42194.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the government of India collaborated with the government of Assam to expedite completion of the National Register of Citizens and to issue National Identity Cards on the basis of this register to Indian citizens in order to aid identification of illegal immigrants. But in 1966 the Central Government dropped the proposal to issue identity cards in consultation with the Government of Assam, having found the project impracticable.

Between 1948 and 1971, there were large scale migrations from Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) to Assam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/664077/bengali-muslims-who-migrated-to-assam-in-1871-are-not-illegal-bangladeshis|title=Bengali Muslims who migrated to Assam in 1871 are not 'illegal Bangladeshis'|last=Deka|first=Dr. Kaustubh|work=Scroll.in|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this continuing influx of illegal migrants from Bangladesh into Assam, student leaders in 1979 came out in fierce protest demanding detention, disenfranchisement and deportation of illegal immigrants from Assam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thefearlessindian.in/must-read-nrc-india-paradigm-shift-vote-bank-politics-india-indians/amp/|title=Must Read: NRC For India— A Paradigm Shift from Vote Bank Politics to "India for Indians" - The Fearless Indian|date=2018-08-14|work=The Fearless Indian|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historic movement which came to be known as [[Assam Movement|Assam Agitation]] or [[Assam Movement]] was initiated by [[All Assam Students Union|All Assam Students’ Union (AASU)]] and All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP) and lasted a span of 6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assamaccord.assam.gov.in/information-services/martyrs-of-assam-agitation|title=Assam Agitation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly considered by various intellectual and media forums as one of the largest mass movement led by students’ union, the six-year-long agitation left behind thousands of bleeding hearts, empty wombs, and bloodstained fields. The movement, however, culminated in the signing of the landmark Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) - the [[Assam Accord]]. It was signed by All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), Central and State Governments on August 15, 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/et-explains/from-assam-accord-to-nrc-discord-a-timeline/articleshow/65237816.cms|title=From Assam Accord to NRC discord: A timeline|date=2018-08-02|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the behest of then Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] in New Delhi.

The Accord ended the agitation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/32-years-after-it-was-signed-separate-office-set-up-to-implement-assam-accord/story-Vh2JBFlzapjIIVyMbchQeI.html|title=32 years after it was signed, separate office set up to implement Assam Accord|date=2017-12-10|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it brought along a number of clauses that were to be implemented to curb the illegal immigration issue. As per the Assam Accord, 1 January 1966 was determined to be the precise date based on which the detention and deletion of illegal immigrants from Assam will take place. It allowed citizenship for all persons coming to Assam from “Specified Territory” before the cut-off date. It further specifies that all persons who came to Assam prior to 1 January 1966 (inclusive) and up to 24 March 1971 (midnight) shall be detected in accordance with the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1939. Name of foreigners so detected will be deleted from the Electoral Rolls in force. Such persons will be required to register themselves before the Registration Officers of the respective districts in accordance with the provisions of the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939 and the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1939. Foreigners who came to Assam on or after 25 March 1971 shall continue to be detected, deleted and expelled in accordance with law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assamaccord.assam.gov.in/portlets/assam-accord-and-its-clauses|title=Assam Accord and its Clauses|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Assam|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even after the Accord was put in place and signed, the process of detecting and expelling immigrants never really officially took place. In fact, the only attempt at detecting foreigners by updating the National Register in Assam was through a Pilot Project which was started in 2 circles (referred to as Tehsil in some states), one in [[Kamrup district|Kamrup]] district and another in [[Barpeta]] district in the year 2010, which ended abruptly within 4 weeks amidst a huge law and order problem involving a mob attack on the Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Barpeta that resulted in police firing killing 4 persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/national-register-of-citizens-to-be-updated-in-assam/article4520748.ece|title=National Register of Citizens to be updated in Assam|date=2013-03-18|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-08-20|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the volatile nature of the issue, for a long time particularly after the experience of the pilot project, NRC update was considered almost an impossible task.

But ultimately it was taken up at the behest of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s order following writ petitions by Assam Public Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/north-east/couple-who-set-nrc-ball-rolling-248806|title=Couple who set NRC ball rolling|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hon’ble Supreme Court in 2013, headed by the Bench of Justice [[Ranjan Gogoi]] and Justice [[Rohinton Fali Nariman|Rohintan Fali Nariman]], directed the Union Government and the State Government to complete the update of NRC, to be implemented in adherence to [[Indian nationality law|Citizenship Act, 1955]] and The Citizenship Rules, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.india-eu-migration.eu/media/legalmodule/Citizenship%20(Amendment)%20Act%202003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in all parts of Assam with the objective to rule out immigrants from the state.

The Honourable Supreme Court bench overlooking the NRC Update process in Assam constitutes of Honourable Justices Shri Ranjan Gogoi and Shri Rohinton Fali Nariman''.''

==Guidelines==
The NRC is updated as per the provisions The Citizenship Act, 1955 and The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 (As amended by 1. G. S. R. 803(E), dated 9 November 2009 (with effect from 9/11/2009.), Ministry of Home Affairs (Office of Registrar General, India), Order No. S.O. 596(E), dated 15 March 2010, published in the Gazette of India, Extra, Part II. No. 504 S.3(ii), dated 16 March 2010 p.&amp;nbsp;1.). As per the two statutes, the eligibility status would be ascertained based on the NRC, 1951, Electoral Rolls up to 1971 and in their absence the admissible documents up to 24 March (midnight) 1971.

Policy decisions, guidelines and funds for NRC updates are provided by the Central [[Government of India]], but its implementation is done through the State Government machinery under the Registrar General of India&lt;sup&gt;[[National Register of Citizens of India#cite note-13|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt; who functions as the Registrar General of Citizen Registration under Rule 15 of Citizenship Rules, 2003 as amended in 2009 and 2010.

The modalities for NRC updates have been developed jointly by the [[Government of Assam]] and the Government of India in adherence to these statutes.

=== Eligibility Criteria ===

* Persons whose names appear in NRC, 1951.
* Persons whose names appear in any of the Electoral Rolls up to 24 March (midnight), 1971.

== Beginning of the Update Process ==
Updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state of Assam is the most extensive citizen engaging exercise. A highly structured plan was put in place to carry out the process of NRC update.

=== Setting up of a Technical Mechanism ===
Development of over 20 large custom software applications, over 2500 digitization hubs and a state of art Data Centre along with extensive manpower involvement (over 30,000 government officers and 10,000 contractual/ outsourced staff) was set up to take on the process of NRC update.

=== Setting up of NRC Seva Kendras (NSK) ===
In order to aid and assist the public in enrolling themselves in the NRC update process ICT (Information Communication Technology) enabled Help Desks named as NRC Seva Kendras (NSKs) were set up across the state. NRC Seva Kendras (NSK) were set up in each district of Assam; each NSK covering an approximate of 2,500 households. NSK acts as epicentre for all the NRC activities starting from assisting the public in searching the Legacy Data, distribution of Application Form, receipt of Application Form, carrying out all the data entry work, displaying of Draft NRC and so on. Each NSK is equipped with sophisticated software for Legacy Data Search in three languages, namely English, Assamese and Bengali &amp; besides that, adequate hardware such as computers, scanners, &amp; furniture are made available for public convenience.

Some of the rules pertaining to NSKs are such - The Application Form can be submitted only in the designated NSK that covers applicant’s present address. The designated NSK shall receive Application Form only from the villages/wards earmarked under it. Officials of the designated NSK will visit the address given under "Present Address" to conduct verification of applications received from areas covered under that particular NSK only.

== Methodology ==

The mechanism adopted to update the NRC 1951 has been developed from scratch owing to the fact that there is no precedence of such a mammoth task ever undertaken in India or elsewhere that involved identification of genuine citizens and detection of illegal immigrants using technology since it involved data of over 3 crore people and over 6.6 crore documents. The guidelines under which NRC Update has been taken up is as follows –

The process of NRC Update is divided into the following phases:

- Publication of Legacy Data

- Distribution &amp; Receipt of Application Form

- Verification Process

- Publication of Part Draft NRC

- Publication of Complete Draft NRC

- Receipt and disposal of Claims and Objection

- Publication of Final NRC

== Publication of Legacy Data ==
To claim eligibility for inclusion in NRC the applicants had to prove their residence in Assam (or in any part of the country) up to 24 March 1971. As per statutory requirement, the NRC authorities had to publish copies of NRC 1951 and Electoral Rolls of all years up to 24 March 1971 (collectively named as '''Legacy Data'''). Easy accessibility of these documents was the key to ensure effective public engagement in the process. About 6.26 lakh pages of such old documents were available across the state, but most of those were in poor condition as can be seen in the image of Original NRC 1951. It would not have been possible for the public to search for their names in the heaps of dilapidated documents. To address this concern, NRC authority decided to digitize and develop the legacy data and make it available in the easily searchable format. 2.01 crore records were digitized and were assigned a Unique “Legacy Data Code” from 6.26 lakh pages of such legacy documents. All these pages were then converted into images through photographic scanning and assigned unique image IDs and linked to the 2.01 crore records for preserving the database, establishing the unique identity of records and producing true copies of Legacy Data for publication. The data was [[Transliteration|transliterated]] to make it search enabled in Assamese, English and Bengali. Out of the total 8 crore words found in the Legacy Database, an “Assam Data Dictionary” was prepared with 24 lakhs unique words. 25 GB of SQL database and 240 GB image files were installed in a short span of 10 days in 5000 laptops spread over 2500 NRC Seva Kendras (NSKs) specially set up for free search and issue of Legacy Data. Legacy database was also made available on the public domain through NRC Website. Issue of 77 lakh Legacy Data Codes in NSKs and 68 lakh through the web in a period of 6 months proved to be the game-changer in NRC update. Out of 68.23 lakh Application Forms received from the public, 95% applicants submitted Legacy Data as supporting document to prove their claim for inclusion in NRC. This indicates to the indispensability of Legacy Data development exercise which set the ball rolling for NRC update in Assam

Two set of documents had to be furnished by the applicants for inclusion in the updated NRC. They are -

=== List A Documents ===

For inclusion of names of any person in updated NRC, the applicants must produce any one of the following List A documents issued before 24 March (midnight), 1971 where the name of self or ancestor appears (to prove residence in Assam up to 24 March (midnight), 1971):

·        1951 NRC

·        Electoral Roll(s) up to 24 March (midnight), 1971

·        Land &amp; Tenancy Records

·        Citizenship Certificate

·        Permanent Residential Certificate

·        Refugee Registration Certificate

·        Passport

·        LIC

·        Any Govt. issued License/Certificate

·        Govt. Service/ Employment Certificate

·        Bank/Post Office Accounts

·        Birth Certificate

·        Board/University Educational Certificate

·        Court Records/Processes

Further, the following two documents are also accepted as supporting documents if accompanied by any one of the documents listed above:

·        Circle Officer/GP Secretary Certificate in respect of married women migrating after marriage (can be of any year before or after 24 March (midnight), 1971).

·        Ration Card issued up to the midnight of 24 March 1971 can be adduced as supporting documents.

=== List B Documents ===

If any of the documents of List A is not of the applicant himself/herself but that of an ancestor, namely, father or mother or grandfather or grandmother or great grandfather or great grandmother (and so on) the applicant then have to submit List B documents to establish relationship with such ancestor, i.e., father or mother or grandfather or grandmother or great grandfather or great grandmother etc. whose name appears in List A. Such documents shall have to be legally acceptable document which clearly proves such relationship. The applicants must produce any one of the following List B to establish the linkage:

.        Birth Certificate

.        Land document

.        Board/University Certificate

.        Bank/LIC/Post Office records

.        Circle Officer/GP Secretary Certificate in case of married women

.        Electoral Roll

.        Ration Card

.        Any other legally acceptable document

== Distribution and Receipt of Application Process ==
The application process was facilitated to the public in both online and offline modes. People opting for the offline mode had to visit their nearest NSK for filling up and submission of their application forms. The NSKs received applications from 9 AM till 6 PM.

People opting for online mode had the option of submitting the form via their smart phones and tablet devices as well, in addition to accessing the form via a desktop/Laptop. The online form was designed to collect data for the entire family in average 24 fields and 2-3 pages of scanned documents and one photograph for each person. It may be mentioned here that average family size for Assam is 5 members per family. Application Forms were distributed house to house by government functionaries in the entire state and could be collected by the applicants from the NRC Seva Kendra’s (NSKs) in case it was lost or damaged. Facility for online download from the NRC website &lt;nowiki&gt;http://nrcassam.nic.in/application-form.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; was also made available. One Application Form per household was distributed, which had the provision to provide details of up to six (6) members. For families with more than 6 members, additional forms were issued. One could also take a Xerox copy of the form themselves. Application forms were made available in Assamese, English, Bengali and Bodo languages.

The guidelines of form fill up were made available in the form of instruction sheets distributed during the Community Awareness Meetings. That apart video tutorials for each side of the Application Form, Side A, B, C and D were developed and made available online as well as distributed in the form of CDs in each district at the capacity building meetings. Applicants could also call NRC toll-free helpline number 15107 (from Assam) and 18003453762 (from outside Assam) or visit their designated NSKs for any assistance required in the filling up the Application Form.

== Verification Process ==
The sole objective of the verification process is to ensure that no ineligible person gets entry into the updated NRC and that no genuine person is left out form the NRC. The verification process consists of the following steps:

=== Office Verification ===

The process of office verification focuses on establishing the authenticity of the documents submitted by validating the same with issuing authority. As per Citizenship Rules, verification is a multistage process involving house to house verification and document verification that involves comparing documents submitted (to trace particulars or linkage up to the aforementioned cut-off date) with the backend available with issuing authorities of such documents. Each of 6.6 crore documents such as Electoral rolls, land records, birth certificates, university certificates, bank documents, post office documents, passports etc. belonging to about 3344 different categories of issuing offices,  in addition to over 71,710 schools, had to be sent to its issuing offices to check authenticity of such documents.

=== DOCSMEN - Document Segregation and Meta-Data Entry ===

The only way of accomplishing the verification task was to set up a specialized mechanism equipped with the best of IT-based work flow management system to send the documents to the respective backend authorities (offices from where the document was issued) through the development of specialized and sophisticated software named as “DOCSMEN – Document Segregation and Meta-Data Entry”. The DOCSMEN software is used for feeding information about documents such as destination, document code, metadata and then slicing as per document details for electronic sending to various destinations inside and outside Assam. It may be added that during Application receipt, the same Application Form and its supporting documents were scanned in a single PDF and the PDF was then sliced in Application Forms, supporting documents based on their page numbers. This software is installed in over 6000 standalone laptops deployed in NSKs and circles and the data is then uploaded into a central database for further processing. A special utility is used at central Data Centre for generation of documents in lots (a set of 50 documents) of the same category from same issuing authority but received from varied sources/across the state. This enables systematic sending of documents to issuing offices for backend checking. For example, for the State Board of Education, any lot would contain only the document of a particular year and examination centre irrespective of the location where such documents were submitted. As such, each of the 6.65 crore documents is packed into lots of 79534 issuing authorities for sending electronically to such issuing authority. This bespoke software handled robust data and enabled processing of crores of documents in a systematic format that enabled completion of verification of 4.52 crores of documents in a span of 8 months. Without a state of the art Document Management System, it would have taken years to achieve such kind of progress.

=== Field Verification ===

The process of field verification through the house to house visit to over 68 lakh applicants was also made systematic through the computerized generation of pre-filled Verification Teams Report (VTR). VTR is a single page document generated using digitized Application Form data for each applicant that is to be verified by the verification team. VTR serves two purposes – first by making the job of Verification Teams easy by providing prepopulated data related to applicants systematically in one page where the Teams  have to record the result only in “Yes”/ “No” format. Additionally, the VTR also indicated the fields in which the applicants have not provided full detail in their Forms so that the Verifying Officers can complete those during field verification. The second purpose served by VTRs is to allow quality checking of the first round of application form data digitization done by operators. As VTRs are taken to field for the recording of results, the VTs get a chance to correct any digitization error and take the second opinion on the spelling of names, surnames etc., directly from the applicants.

The process of field verification focuses on establishing if the document submitted actually relates to the applicant/ member or not. Field verification further establishes an identity of the applicant/ member and authenticates his/ her linkage claims.

=== Family Tree Verification ===

Family Tree Verification technique was used to find out if the Legacy Data published by NRC authority had been misused by an imposter. As the Legacy Data had been digitized and each record assigned a unique number, it was possible to find out a list of users of one particular Legacy Data and then cross check this computer-generated list with actual family members declared beforehand in a form named “Manual Family Tree”. Imposters often “adopt” a person in whose name legacy document is available and then get linkage documents prepared accordingly to establish this relationship. Some of the documents used by imposters are not even forged, such as electoral rolls, which are issued without checking the authenticity of particulars. For this reason, it is found that the document verification process itself is not a foolproof process in finding imposters. As such this technique of comparing Computerized Family Trees (CFTs) with Manual Family Trees (MFTs) became more accurate method to determine the authenticity of claims of the NRC applicants.

Verification of Family Tree commenced on 15 February 2018 in Assam. Applicants whose family tree details mismatched with other members of the family were called for family tree verification. Mismatches arising due to giving nicknames in family tree details, name/ surname changes due to marriage, missing out names of all family members due to lack of knowledge or ignorance, etc., were corrected during the proceedings. Applicants received '''Letter of Information (LOI)''' delivered at their households by NRC field level functionaries. Details of date, time and venue were mentioned in the '''LOI'''.

Final eligibility for inclusion of names was determined only if, the results of all the three verification process - field verification, office verification and Family Tree Matching were found positive.

== Publication of Part Draft NRC ==
The first part of draft NRC, known as the Part Draft NRC published on expiry of midnight of 31 December 2017 by the Office of the State Coordinator of National Registrar (Assam) in all the villages/wards where the Application Forms were issued &amp; received. The total number of people included in the Part Draft NRC was 1,90,10,932 members out of 3.29 crore applicants.

== Publication Complete Draft NRC ==
The complete draft NRC was published on 30 July 2018 Office of the State Coordinator of National Registrar (Assam) in all the villages/wards in all the villages/wards where the Application Forms were issued &amp; received and also made available on the website www.nrcassam.nic.in

The total number of persons included in the Complete Draft NRC is 2,89,83,677 leaving a total of 40,70,707 as ineligible for inclusion.

== Receipt and disposal of Claims and Objections ==
The persons whose names do not appear in the Draft NRC, may file claim application within a stipulated period at the NSK where the Application Form was submitted.

A person may also have an objection against entry of any name in the draft NRC. The objections to entry of names of persons in the draft updated NRC can be filed before the LRCR.

Any person can also apply for correction of his name or any other entry in his respect as appearing in the Draft updated NRC, he/ she can file correction application within a stipulated period before the LRCR.

'''Naxal School for the Deaf''' ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]: ) is the first school for the deaf established in the (then) Kingdom of Nepal. It was originally established in 1966 in a room in a local hospital by an ENT doctor, but soon moved to its current site in [[Bal Mandir]].

Originally, the teaching philosophy was [[oralist]], and when it was first established there was an American [[Peace Corps]] volunteer who provided auditory and speech training. A [[Total Communication]] approach was adopted starting in 1988. Although the current stated methodology is [[Bilingualism]] in [[Nepalese Sign Language|Nepali Sign Language]] and [[Nepali language|Nepali]], in fact the instructional practice would better be termed [[Simultaneous Communication]] (also known as SimCom or Sign Supported Speech)), using a form of [[Sign-Supported Nepali]], with genuine [[Nepalese Sign Language|Nepali Sign Language]] used 

The school currently teaches classes through [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|SLC]], as well as [[Plus 2]] classes, and is planning to set up a [[B.Ed.]] course in the near future.
Popular actress of Nepal, Namrata Shrestha helped the school recently by celebrating her 27th Birthday at the school. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepal.fm/happy-28th-birthday-namrata-shrestha/ |title=Namrata Shrestha Celebrates her Birthday at School for the Deaf |publisher=Nepal.FM |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Century Global Center''' ({{zh|s=新世纪环球中心|p=xīnshìjì huánqiú zhōngxīn}}) is a multipurpose building in the [[Tianfu New Area]] of [[Chengdu]], [[China]], and is the world's largest building in terms of floor area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The world’s new largest building is four times the size of Vatican City |url=http://qz.com/100639/china-chengdu-world-new-largest-building-is-four-times-the-size-of-vatican-city |work=Quartz |accessdate=4 July 2013|author=Roberto A.

==Development==
Developed by billionaire [[Deng Hong]]'s [[Exhibition and Travel Group|Entertainment and Travel Group]] (ETG), nearly {{convert|400000|m2}} of the building is devoted to shopping. It also houses offices, conference rooms, a university complex, two commercial centres, hotels, an [[IMAX]] cinema, a "Mediterranean village", a pirate ship and an Olympic-size skating rink. The centrepiece of the building is a water park ("Paradise Island Water Park"), containing a {{convert|5000|m2|abbr=on}} artificial beach, where a giant {{convert|150|by|40|m|abbr=on}} screen forms the horizon to offer sunrises and sunsets. At night, a stage extends out over the pool for concerts. A stand has been built overlooking the pool with a food court and entrance underneath at the floor level. The new [[Intercontinental Hotel]] will feature 1,009 rooms that are spread over 6x8 story blocks around the edge of the complex. The centre is connected to [[Line 1, Chengdu Metro|Line&amp;nbsp;1]] of the [[Chengdu Metro]].

The building will eventually face the [[Chengdu Contemporary Arts Centre]], designed by Iraqi-British architect [[Zaha Hadid]].&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/worlds-largest-building-nears-completion-20121221-2bqz3.html |title=World's largest building nears completion| work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date=28 December 2012|accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Although parts of the shopping area opened in early 2013, the centre was supposed to have formally opened in March 2013 when it hosted the [[Fortune 500|Global Fortune 500]] [[Business conference|conference]]. However, the businessman behind the project, Deng Hong, was arrested on [[Corruption in China|corruption]] charges, and "given the potential for political humiliation" the conference was moved to the [[Shangri-La Hotel]] in Chengdu.

The opening was delayed until 22 August 2013, but was then scaled back after the arrest of more than 50 local government officials being detained in a series of overlapping investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Malcolm Moore | title= Corruption and the world's biggest building |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10308029/Corruption-and-the-worlds-biggest-building.html | work=The Telegraph |date=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Liao''' ({{zh|s=北辽|t=北遼|p=Běi Liáo}}) was a state created by the [[Khitans]], separate from the [[Liao dynasty]], in northern China around [[Liao Nanjing]] (now [[Beijing]]) and Zhongjing (today's [[Ningcheng County|Ningcheng]]). The state in Nanjing only existed for about nine months in 1122–1123.  A further Northern Liao dynasty existed briefly in 1123.

== History ==
When the [[Emperor Tianzuo of Liao]] fled to the west under the military pressure of the [[Jurchens]] of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], he appointed [[Yelü Chun]] (1062–1122, a grandson of [[Emperor Xingzong of Liao]]), Prince of Yan, as the Governor of Nanjing (Nanjing Liushou) (Nanjing means "southern capital" and should not be confused with today's [[Nanjing]]).  Yelü Chun however was enthroned as the Emperor Tianxi in March 1122 (Chinese calendar).&lt;ref name="liao"&gt;Liao Shi, vol. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biran (2005), pg 20&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Liao dynasty]] of the Emperor Tianzuo still existed, the state at Nanjing was called Northern Liao by historians.

Yelü Chun's era name was Jianfu. He defeated the attack of the [[Song]] army, led by [[Tong Guan]]. He died in June 1122 (Chinese calendar), with [[temple name]] Xuanzong and [[posthumous name]] Xiaozhang.&lt;ref name="liao"/&gt;

Yelü Chun was succeeded nominally by Prince of Qin, Yelü Ding. However, since Yelü Ding was in hiding with his father Emperor Tianzuo, the Empress Dowager Xiao Defei (蕭德妃) was enthroned as regent for the Prince of Qin, with the new era name Dexing.  The Khitans under the command of Xiao Gan and [[Yelü Dashi]] were able to repulse attacks by the [[Song dynasty|Song]] forces, but the [[Jurchens]] led by [[Emperor Taizu of Jin|Aguda]] continued to advanced south toward Nanjing. In December 1122 (Chinese calendar, probably early 1123 in Western calendar), the city of Nanjing surrendered to the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] army, ending the brief existence of Northern Liao in Nanjing. Just before the Jurchen conquest, Yelü Dashi led 7000 of his troops to rejoin Emperor Tianzuo in the western region, taking the empress with him.  The empress Xiao Defei was however executed by Emperor Tianzuo.&lt;ref&gt;Biran (2005), pg 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1123, the Jurchens attacked the Tianzuo's palace at Qingzhong (south of modern [[Hohhot]]), capturing members of his family.  Tianzuo sought refuge with the [[Xi Xia]], however his son Yelü Yali, the Prince of Liang, chose to go to the Yugu and Dilie tribes north of the [[Gobi Desert]], and was enthroned there as another Northern Liao emperor in the fifth month of 1123.  He died however in the tenth month that same year. His son, Yelü Zhulie, succeeded him, but was killed only a month later by his own troops.&lt;ref&gt;Biran (2005). pp 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radala''' refers to a small minority caste in the [[List of rulers of Sri Lanka#Kingdom of Kandy|Kandyan Kingdom]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. They were the [[Chiefdom|Chiefs]] of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]]. The term ''Radala'' is coming from the combination of words ''Radh'' (meaning, "Royal") and ''Kola'' or ''Kula'' (meaning, "caste"), which literally means ''the royal caste''. The word "Radala" came into existence after the throne of the Kingdom of Kandy went to the [[Nayaks of Kandy|Nayak]] Dynasty. Higher officials in the court of [[Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy|Vira Narendra Sinha]] were offered this state and Nayakkara prince was selected as king over king's son by a local queen. After capturing the Kandyan provinces in 1815 with the aid of locals from both maritime and Kandyan provinces, the British created an extensive class of loyal 'New Radalas' in the Kandyan territory to assist them in the administration of that province.

Traditionally, Radala was not a common term used for all officials of the state. In the Sinhala version of the [[Kandyan Convention]] of 1815, only the [[Adigar]]s, [[Dissava]]s and a few others are called Radalas. The 19th century British rulers who created an extensive class of 'New Radalas' in the Kandyan territory were keen to call them an aristocracy to assist them with its administration. However Sri Lankan history shows that many Kandyan Radalas were [[civilian|civil]] and [[military]] [[officials]] of the court and considered aristocratic but not as direct heirs to the Kandyan throne.

==History==

===Kandyan Kingdom===
[[Image:Kandyan Chiefs 1859.JPG|thumb|right|A group of Kandyan Chiefs from Tennent's Ceylon, published in 1859.]]

The offspring of Kandyan Kings from high cast [[concubines]] ([[yakadadoli]]) were those that were originally considered as Radalas. In addition to a [[queen consort|chief queen]] and one or two secondary queens, Kandyan kings also had a [[Harem]]. Harem ladies from royal stock were called [[Esala Perahera#The Randoli Perahera|Randoli]]. Hindu princesses were brought over from [[Madurai]] in [[South India]] as [[Randolis]], after the royal families of the maritime region in Sri Lanka converted to Christianity and were therefore no longer eligible. Ladies of the Radala castes were taken into the harem as [[Yakadadoli]]. Favorite [[concubines]] frequently received land grants and their offspring were appointed as high officials of the [[noble court|royal court]] and in a few cases inherited the kingdom.

The status disparity between royalty and the Radalas was small and the Radalas only had to call themselves 'serviles' (gettás) in the presence of the king and prostrated only at ritual ceremonies to demonstrate their lower status vis a vis the king. This practice continued into the British period and was abhorred as a degrading form of ancient tyranny and abolished by the British in 1818 under the proclamation of November 21, 1818 by Governor [[Robert Brownrigg]]. Apart from having to continuously dress in full in the presence of the King, the Radalas didn't have to rise from their seats like other commoners when the king's dirty linen was taken past them (A Historical Relation of Ceylon, [[Robert Knox (sailor)|Robert Knox]], Part II, Chapter2). They were permitted to use their own ancestral and military insignia, swords, umbrellas, jewellery and wear shoes. Some Chiefs were merely personal attendants of the King. The [[Diyawadana Nilame]] was the King's personal [[valet]] responsible for bathing and dressing of the King.

The traditional Kandyan Radala of the past had considered themselves to be an exclusive caste and not part of the [[Govigama]] caste. Bryce Ryan observed as recent as 1953 that Radalas repudiated Govi connections and that the status of the Govi caste still remains relatively low in villages where the Radala existed (Caste in Modern Ceylon, page 99). The demand by the Kandyan Radala elite for a separate federal state in independent Ceylon,  the representations made to the Donoughmore Commission and the formation of the  Kandyan National Assembly (KNA) as recently as in 1924 demonstrates the reluctance of the Kandyan elite to be governed by arriviste low country Govigama families of dubious ancestry, which was to be the inevitable outcome of the British departure.

The Radala's as a community had had significant power over the throne of Kandy. This was the case as the last Nayakar King of Kandy, Sri Wickrema Rajasinha lost his throne soon after losing the military and administrative support of the Radalas for his cruelty towards his subjects, and for his licentious forced affairs with their wives and daughters.

===The British Radalas===

After capturing the Kandyan provinces in 1815, the British soon created an extensive class of 'New Radalas' in the Kandyan territory to assist them with its administration.
As much as the British created class of [[Sri Lankan Mudaliyars]] in the low-country, this class too was composed of natives who were most likely to serve the British masters with utmost loyalty, [[Govigama]] (farmers) families that had either cooperated with the British to capture Kandy or from other miscellaneous lower caste families that had joined the British cause later for financial purposes.

They were all from anglicized families and were considered pillars of the [[Anglican]] church. They had English first names and their children too were similarly named. In addition they had a string of high sounding [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] names taken on when receiving their appointment from the British. Some of these names were from Kandyan families that had ceased to exist or were severely reduced, and from purported ancestors with dubious connections. The new British-made Radala class were immediately rejected by the original Kandyan Radalas. The new British-made Radalas tried unsuccessfully to rename themselves with the names of famous Kandyan Radalas such as the Keppitipolas, Mampitiyas, and Ranarajas. All these attempts were rejected by the British for fear of further dissent by the original Kandyan Radalas.

Many of these 'New Radala' families had low-country origins and many intermarried with the anglicized low country [[Sri Lankan Mudaliyars|Mudaliyar]] class, and in many cases several times with one family in an apparent bid to create some exclusivity. Most were from the [[Sabaragamuwa]] province and not from interior parts of the Kandyan provinces that were less susceptible to British influence. These New Radals too resembled English country squires and most of them had received large land grants from the British for their servitude. Their residences were of unprecedented scale, built in the 19th century in the  British colonial style and were referred to by the Tamil word Walauu or Walvoo.

They generally held 'Rate Mahattaya' or local administrator positions and had studied under leading Anglican Priests at the [[Anglican]] missionary schools [[S.Thomas' College]], [[Trinity College (Kandy)]] and High school [[Ratnapura]], which were institutions set up by the British specifically for producing a class of loyal, local, second level administrators. With each successive batch of British Civil Servants and Governors arriving in Sri Lanka, this propped up pseudo-aristocratic group tried harder and harder to generate a greater and higher appearance of nobility and Kandyan lineage.

However the descendants of the original Kandyan Radalas rarely marry the descendants of British-made Radalas or any other [[Govigama]]s for that matter. If any of them do, those people and all their descendants are classified as lower-caste outcastes by the descendants of the original Radala community.

===20th century===
[[Image:Meedeniya 899.JPG|thumb|right|Front Centre (seated):[[J. H. Meedeniya|John Henry Meediniya]] [[Adigar]] with his family in 1905. Rear Centre (standing): his daughter, Alice, who married the low-country newspaper magnate [[D. R. Wijewardena]] in 1916.]]
The marriage in 1910 to Kandyan 'New Radala' Mollie Dunuwila, newspaper magnate [[D. R. Wijewardena]]'s marriage in 1916 to a Meedeniya and finally [[Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike|S. W. R. D. Bandaranayake's]] marriage in 1940 to [[Sirimavo Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike|Sirimavo Ratwatte]] appear to have muted some of the antipathy and created the common political power block that has ruled the country since independence from the British in 1948. The Radalas however are still relatively endogamous and even as at date would only rarely marry an average Govigama in an arranged marriage. 

===Nilame===
''Nilame'' word referred to the court officials. The names of the officials were given according to their position in each dynasty. Due the development of language and change of requirements, the positions were changed and its names were changed. In Kandyan dynasty there are several officials in the court or "Raja wasala". They were [[Adigar]] and [[Dissava]].

The '''Royal African Society''' of the United Kingdom was founded in 1901 to promote relations between the United Kingdom and [[Africa]]. In addition to producing its journal ''[[African Affairs]]'' ({{ISSN|0368-4016}}, formerly ''Journal of the African Society''), the Society promotes conferences and meetings. It is based in [[London]]. In the 1960s it was considered a social "club for old [[:Category:Former British colonies and protectorates in Africa|colonials]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=British African Studies since the Second World War: A Personal Account |author=[[John Donnelly Fage]] |journal= African Affairs |volume= 88 |year= 1989 |jstor=722694 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The establishment of the society in 1901 grew out of the travels of [[Mary Kingsley]], an English writer and explorer who travelled to Africa several times in the 1890s and greatly influenced European study of Africa. In 1893, Kingsley travelled to [[Luanda]], [[Angola]], where she lived with the indigenous peoples to learn their customs. In 1895 she returned to study cannibal tribes, travelled up the [[Ogooué River]] collecting specimens of previously undiscovered fish, and became the first European to climb [[Mount Cameroon]]. Upon her return to England, Kingsley upset many people, particularly the [[Church of England]]: she criticized missionaries, and supported many traditional aspects of African life, most controversially the practice of polygamy.  Kingsley wrote that a "black man is no more an undeveloped white man than a rabbit is an undeveloped hare".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Travels in West Africa; Congo Français, Corisco and Cameroons | author = Mary H. Kingsley | year = 1897 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5891 | authorlink = Mary Kingsley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal African Society was formed to commemorate and continue Kingsley's work. 

The society administers the [[African Studies Association of the UK]] (est. 1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asauk.net/about-us/ |title=About Us |work=Asauk.net |publisher=African Studies Association of the UK |accessdate= 30 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural initiatives==
In 2008, the RAS supported the launch of a London African Film Festival, in co-operation with Africa at the Pictures, and subsequently established the annual festival "Film Africa".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmafrica.org.uk/ Film Africa.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the RAS launched the African Arguments Book Series, published by [[Zed Books]], which was followed by an online blogging platform, African Arguments Online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanarguments.org/ African Arguments.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the RAS established an annual literature festival called "Africa Writes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalafricansociety.org/history "A History"], Royal African Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://africawrites.org/ Africa Writes.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15857">The '''South Indians in Fiji''' are mainly descendents of the 15,132 indentured labourers who arrived in [[Fiji]] between 1903 and 1916.  This represents about 25% out of a total of 60,965 indentured labourers who arrived in Fiji between 1879 and 1916.  They embarked on ships from [[Madras]] and were mainly recruited in the districts of [[North Arcot]], [[Madras]], [[Krishna]], [[Godavari]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Tanjore]], [[Malabar District|Malabar]] and [[Coimbatore]]. More than half of the recruits from South India were recruited from North Arcot and Madras, but most of those recruited in Madras were originally from North Arcot and [[Chingleput]].

== South Indian Languages ==
The language spoken by the South Indian immigrant was only included in the emigration passes issued in 1903. Of the 589 labourers recruited in South India in 1903, the number of people speaking each language is shown below.

In later years more [[Telugu language|Telugu]] than [[Tamil language|Tamil]] speakers came from South India, as can be seen from subsequent census figures. According to the 1956 census, the number of households speaking each language was as follows:

Although by 1956 [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Fiji Hindi]]) was being used in most Fiji households, the numbers still using South Indian languages indicate that there were twice as many [[Telugu people|Telugu]]as [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s, and [[Malayalam]] was the third most common South Indian language. From 1929 to 1963, the ability to read and write in Tamil or Telugu was accepted as literacy qualification to be a voter for elections to the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]].
In 2005,  it was revealed that in the 20 primary schools managed by TISI, out of the 4940 students, 1765 took Tamil classes and there were only 489 learning Telugu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=338105   Keep your culture The challenge for South Indians - Fiji Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious Background of South Indians ==
The South Indian immigrants were made up of a smaller proportion of [[Muslims]] (1,091 Muslims out of 15,132) and greater proportion of Christians than their North Indian counterparts. The [[Hindus]], who form the majority, belonged to over a hundred different castes.

== Life during Indenture ==
Although South Indians were used to working overseas, most found it difficult to adjust to the [[Indians in Fiji|Fiji Indian]] society already established in Fiji. Language was a major problem as they had to learn Hindustani, the language of the plantation. During indenture, there was a high suicide rate amongst South Indians.

== Revival of South Indian Culture ==
At the end of his indenture period [[Kuppuswami]] Naidu, an ex-policeman and indentured labourer, took up the cause of the South Indians in Fiji. He gave up worldly pleasures, taking up the life of a ''sadhu'' (holy man). He was a devotee of [[Swami Vivekananda]], Ramana Maha Rishi, Ramalinga Swamigal and Rama Krishna Paramahamsa. He later became known amongst his colleagues and South Indians in particular, as Sadhu Swami. He conceived the idea of a South Indian Organisation and worked, towards this goal with the help of other South Indians who could understand his feelings and were prepared to provide assistance towards the cause. According to the data published by TISI in 2002, Tamil was learnt by 1738 students in 17 schools between the grade 1-8 and Telugu by 255 students in 3 schools.

== Birth of Sangam ==
[[Sadhu Kuppuswami]] founded the ''Then India Sanmarga Ikya Sangam'' (TISI Sangam) after travelling to all parts of Fiji where South Indians were settled, and inspiring them to congregate at the [[Nadi]] Sri Siva Subramaniya Swami Temple on Swami Vivekananda's Birthday on 12 January in 1926, where they gave birth to the organisation which is today known as "Sangam". Sadhu Swami was elected the first President of Sangam and he remained its President for his lifetime..

On 26 December 1927, the Madras Maha Sangam, was formed in [[Suva]] by Verrappa Muthiah Pillai in Suva and branches were soon established in [[Levuka]] and [[Labasa]]. In 1937 the Madras Maha Sangam merged with the TISI Sangam.

== Maunatul Islam Association of Fiji (MIAF) ==
{{main article|Maunatul Islam Association of Fiji}}
[[Maunatul Islam Association of Fiji]] (MIAF) represents approximately 30% of the [[Sunni]] Muslims in Fiji who are mostly followers of [[Imam]] [[Shafi]]. The followers of Imam Shafi in Fiji are the descendents of Muslims of [[Malayalam]] origin who came to Fiji under the indenture system from [[Kerala]] (Malabar) in [[South India]] between 1903 and 1916. The organisation originally operated under the name of Then India Maunatul Islam Association of Fiji since it was officially formed in 1942. The original officials were; President: Late Shahbud Dean, Vice President: Late Hajji Moidin Koya, Secretary: Mohammed Shafique, Treasurer: Late Hon [[A. R. Manu]]. One of the most famous past President and Speaker of the Association was the late Hon [[Sidiq Koya|S.M. Koya]], who was the leader of the [[National Federation Party]] and Leader of Opposition in Fiji for a number of years. The name of the Association was changed in 1982 to Maunatul Islam Association when a new constitution was drawn.

== Swami Avinashananda ==
The early years the Sangam had its share of problems but the arrival, on 21 May 1937, of Swami Avinashananda from the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] of India, on the invitation of Sadhu Swami, saw the beginning of the golden years of Sangam.  Although he spent just a brief period of eleven months in Fiji, Swami Avinashananda was able to consolidate the structure of Sangam and lay down the principles on which it was to function in later years. Swami Avinashananda had the Sangam legally registered as an organisation under the Company's act and [[A. D. Patel]] became its general manager. Thus legalised, Sangam and its community set forth in earnest to develop schools and temples to foster South Indian languages, culture and religion in all parts of Fiji. At present Sangam controls 21 Primary and 5 Secondary Colleges with innumerable Temples and Kindergartens spread throughout the country.

== Swami Rudrananda ==
{{main article|Swami Rudrananda}}
Swami Avivashananda was replaced by Swami Rudrananda in 1939. He was soon followed by Rama Krishnan, a Tamil teacher, and Ganeshwar Rao, a Telugu teacher to teach South Indian mother tongues in the Sangam Schools, and to uplift the general standard of Sangam. Rama Krishnan was the first ever graduate teacher to be posted to Nadi Sangam School as its Head Teacher and Ganeshwar Rao worked with him as his assistant. As a dedicated teacher the late Rama Krishnan formed the Youth Wing known as the ''Then India Valibar Sangam'' (TIV Sangam) and introduced the Inter-District Competition in Soccer, athletics, and introduced Music and Art to encourage the development of South Indian language and culture.

Swami Rudrananda consolidated and expanded the activities of T.I.S.I. Sangam based at Sangam Ashram in Nadi. He acquired properties for Sangam. These included freehold land at Savusavu (130 acres) and Madhuvani, Rakiraki (1037 acres). The Sangam Sarada Printing Press was started, on 15 August 1948, to cope with the educational needs of the community at large. Publications like ''Sangam'' in Tamil, ''Pacific Review'' in [[English language|English]], ''Jagriti'' in [[Hindi]], and ''Na Pacifica'' in [[Fijian language|Fijian]] were published and circulated to give vent to the voice of the [[India]]n community as a whole.

Swami Rudrananda was fondly called as "SarkkariSami" by people as he was majorly working for the betterment of sugar cane workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chennaimath.org/category/media/magazines/sri-ramakrishna-vijayam Sri Ramakrishna Vijayam, December 2014, Page 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's Wing ==
A Women's Wing was also formed in 1938 as the ''Then India Sanmarga Maathar Sangam'' which launched the very simple and humble charitable task of ''Pidi Arisi'', (A handful of rice) which every South Indian householder was required to set aside each day for charity before commencing their household cooking. This noble concept was introduced by Swami Avinashananda as one of the projects to assist in running a hostel for children of poor parents and others living far away from Nadi to gain education at Nadi Sangam School which was the first and the largest Sangam School for that time.

== Andhra Sangam ==
The TISI Sangam was dominated by the more numerous Telugus and concern by the minority Tamils about the promotion of their language led to the formation of their own Sangam. Under the leadership of Veeranna, the ''Dakshina India Andhra Sangam'' of Fiji was formed on 20 April 1941 at the Gallau Temple in Ra.

== Shri Vivekananda High School (Now Swami Vivekananda College)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chennaimath.org/category/media/magazines/sri-ramakrishna-vijayam Sri Ramakrishna Vijayam, December 2014; page 20]&lt;/ref&gt;==
The Sangam, continued its pursuit to provide higher education to its pupils by becoming the first non-Government Organisation to start a private Secondary School, the Shri Vivekananda High School, on 9 March 1949. Shri Vivekananda High School began in a very humble way in the T.I.V. Sangam's Gymnasium Hall, in the Nadi Sangam Primary School compound, with 25 students, headed by Mr.K.S.Reddy as Principal and Messers Gopal Swami Naidu and Krishna Narsingha Rao as the two assistants. Students from all parts of Fiji, even as far away as [[Vanua Levu]], came to attend the school. As this school grew in strength, it had to shift to the premises of Lora Murugan. It was here that Shri Vivekananda High School developed and later moved to its present site in Malolo and is now managed by the Ramakrishna Mission.

Sangam, Schools and Temples sprang up in different villages and settlements. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company assisted the Sangam by providing land to build schools and temples and having its Field Officers acting as school managers. Mother tongue was given priority over other subjects in the schools, and the South Indian languages and culture flourished throughout the country for several decades till the Sangam celebrated its Silver Jubilee in 1951.

With the advent of changes in the education system and introduction of new examinations in the Primary Schools, emphasis gradually shifted from vernacular and creative subjects to mere academic pursuit. Preparing students for examination became the hallmark for the teachers, and keen competition developed as to which school got the largest number of passes became the theme for parents, management and teachers alike. This shift in trend became the cause of the gradual decline of the South Indian languages as they were not examination subjects.

== Ramalingar Mission ==
Concern with the decline of South Indian culture and tradition led to the formation of ''Fiji Sutha Sanmarga Sangam'', a branch of Ramalinagar Sangam in Suva on 14 April 1966, under the leadership of Appa Pillai. He conducted a monthly South Indian program on [[Radio Fiji]] and travelled around the country teaching Tamil language and culture and distributing Tamil Readers sourced from India.

== Sangam Rejuvenated ==
With the revival of the Annual Convention, Sangam members from all parts flocked to Lovu during the Easter Holidays of 1976 to rejuvenate the Sangam and later in the same year celebrated its [[Golden Jubilee]] from 8th to 10 October 1976 at Nadi. Once again the organisation was streamlined and the management commenced functioning smoothly under the new administration. The next decade from 1976 -1986 saw gradual improvement in the management and organisation of Sangam assets and properties, and attention was once again drawn towards the revival of the South Indian Languages, religion and culture. The revival of Sangam activities together with the arrival of Shivacharya Mahalinga Gurukkal whose services were made available to Nadi Siva Subramaniya Swamy Temple in 1984 by the Government of [[Tamil Nadu]] as the Chief Priest boosted the activities at the Temple, and devotees flocked to the Temple in very large numbers to witness and participate in the many new and unique religious ceremonies conducted at the Temple for the first time.

== Sri Siva Subramaniya Swami Temple ==
It was realised that a new and bigger National Temple was needed, and a move for acquiring a new site began in earnest. The foundation for a new temple had been laid at the old site in 1976 during the Golden Jubilee Celebrations by His Excellency the High Commissioner for the Government of India in Fiji. In 1983 new lease was acquired for the Crown land and the reconstruction programme began with the ''Bhoomi Pooja'' in January 1984, followed by the inauguration of building work by the late Deputy Prime Minister, in April 1984. The construction work moved another step forward in 1986 when the work of pile driving was completed under the chairmanship of Hon. [[Jai Ram Reddy]]. The actual Construction work began in earnest after a lull of some five years under a new Reconstruction Committee led by Narayan Reddy as the Chairman. The temple was built in the best traditions of ancient [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian Indian Temple architecture]] as well as the principles of sacred architecture of the [[Vastu]] [[Vedic period|Vedic tradition]]. The consecration ceremonies of their new national temple were held on July 15, 1994.

== Famous South Indians ==
[[Sidiq Koya]], who was the first [[Muslim]] to be elected to the Legislative Council, in 1963, was a South Indian. He became leader of the opposition [[National Federation Party]] (NFP) in 1969 and was instrumental in attaining independence for Fiji. He was succeeded, as leader of the NFP, by another South Indian, Jai Ram Reddy. Some other famous South Indians were [[M.N. Naidu]], a businessman, [[Sadhu Kuppuswami]], founder of [[TISI Sangam]], [[Swami Rudrananda]], missionary and farmers’ leader and politicians [[K. S. Reddy]], [[Muniswamy Mudaliar]], [[Ganesh Chand]], and [[James Madhavan]].

'''Subak''' is the [[irrigation|water management (irrigation)]] system for [[paddy field]]s on [[Bali]] island, [[Indonesia]] which was developed in the 9th century. For the [[Balinese people|Balinese]], irrigation is not simply providing water for the plant's roots, but water is used to construct a complex, pulsed artificial ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Lansing1987"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Balinese "Water Temples" and the Management of Irrigation|last=Lansing|first=J.S.|author-link=J. Stephen Lansing|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=89|issue=2|pages=326–341|year=1987|doi=10.1525/aa.1987.89.2.02a00030|jstor=677758}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of five terraced rice fields and water temples covering nearly {{convert|20,000|ha}}. The temples are the main focus of this cooperative water management, known as ''subak''.

==Religious relationship==
Subak is a traditional ecologically sustainable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pratt|first1=Daniel|title=Subak - A Sustainable System of Irrigation|url=https://thebalivillages.com/Bali-news/2016/10/18/subak-a-sustainable-system-of-irrigation|website=The Bali Retirement Villages|publisher=The Bali Retirement Villages}}&lt;/ref&gt; irrigation system that binds Balinese agrarian society together within the village's Bale Banjar community center and [[Balinese temple]]s. The water managements is under the authority of the priests in water temples, who practice [[Tri Hita Karana]] Philosophy, a self-described relationship between humans, the earth and the gods. Tri Hita Karana draws together the realm of spirit, the human world and nature. The overall subak system exemplifies this philosophical principle.  Water temple rituals promote a harmonious relationship between people and their environment through the active engagement of people with ritual concepts that emphasize dependence on the life-sustaining forces of the natural world. Rice is seen as the gift of god, and the subak system is part of temple culture.

==System==
Subak components are the forests that protect the water supply, terraced paddy landscape, [[rice]] fields connected by a system of [[canal]]s, [[tunnel]]s and [[weir]]s, villages, and temples of varying size and importance that mark either the source of water or its passage through the temple on its way downhill to irrigate subak land.
Rice, the water required to grow rice, and subak, the cooperative canal system that controls the water, have together shaped the landscape over the past thousand years. Water from springs and canals flows through the temples and out onto the rice paddy field. In total, Bali has about 1,200 water collectives and between 50 and 400 farmers manage the water supply from one source of water. The property consists of five sites that exemplify the interconnected natural, religious, and cultural components of the traditional subak system. The sites include: the Supreme Water Temple of Pura Ulun Danu Batur on the edge of [[Mount Batur]] whose crater lake, (Lake Batur) is regarded as the ultimate origin of every spring and river; the Subak Landscape of the Pakerisan Watershed the oldest known irrigation system in Bali; the Subak Landscape of Catur Angga Batukaru with terraces mentioned in a 10th-century inscription making them amongst the oldest in Bali and prime examples of Classical Balinese temple architecture; and the Royal Water temple of [[Pura Taman Ayun]], the largest and most architecturally distinguished regional water temple, exemplifying the fullest expansion of the subak system under the largest Balinese kingdom of the 19th century. These architectural sites are inspired by several different ancient religious traditions, including Saivasiddhanta and Samkhyā Hinduism, [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism and Austronesian cosmology.

'''''Sunset''''', also known as the '''''Retreat Call''''', is a bugle call played in [[United Kingdom]] and British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries to signal the end of the official military day.&lt;ref name=marines&gt;[http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/history/BeatingRetreat.htm Royal Marines Band - "beating retreat"] ''royalmarinesbands.co.uk'', Retrieved 18 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a slightly different melody to the US Retreat bugle call. In common with all bugle calls, it consists only of notes from a single [[overtone]] series. This allows it to be playable on a [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]] or equivalently on a [[trumpet]] without moving the valves.

The call is regularly heard performed in an arrangement for full [[military band]] by Captain A.C. Green (1888–1974), who was Director of the [[Royal Naval School|Royal Naval School of Music's Junior Wing]] on the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref name=green&gt;[http://www.seayourhistory.org.uk/content/view/180/275/ A.C. Green biography], ''seayourhistory.org.uk'', Retrieved 18 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrangement was composed aboard [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|HMS Queen Elizabeth]] in response to [[William Wordsworth Fisher|Admiral Fisher]]'s desire for a "spectacular show" and was first performed in 1932 by the Massed Bands and Bugles of the Mediterranean Fleet.&lt;ref name=marines/&gt; The Sunset call is now a regular part of the [[Royal Marines Band Service|Royal Marines]]' "Beat the Retreat" ceremony, the call's melody also gives its name to "Sunset Parades" given in commemoration of former military conflicts.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; It is traditional to stand for the performance of the piece.

Trumpet &amp; Bugle Calls for the British Army marks this call for Royal Regiment of Artillery units only.  The call would then be sounded on an E♭ Cavalry Trumpet.

==Lyrics==

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Sunset in the western sky,
Darkness falls o'er land and sea
Praise, Lord, we raise to you
This night and for evermore.
We think of loved ones near and far
And those who've fought the fight before
Keep safe your people, Lord
This night and for evermore.
Keep safe your people, Lord
This night and for evermore
This night and for evermore.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Thanjavur painting''' is a classical [[South India]]n [[painting]] style, which was [[Inauguration|inaugurated]] from the town of [[Thanjavur]] (anglicized as [[Tanjore]]) and spread across the adjoining and geographically contiguous Tamil country. The art form draws its immediate resources and inspiration from way back about 1600 AD, a period when the [[Nayak (title)|Nayakas]] of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas encouraged art—chiefly, classical dance and music—as well as literature, both in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and painting of chiefly Hindu religious subjects in temples.It is distinguished by its famous gold coating. However, it can safely be surmised that Thanjavur painting, as we know it now, originated in the Maratha court of Thanjavur (1676 - 1855).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paramparaproject.org/traditions_tanjor-gold-paintings.html|title=Parampara Project - Tanjore Gold Leaf Painting|publisher=paramparaproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been recognized as a [[Geographical indication]] by the [[Government of India]] in 2007-08.&lt;ref name="GI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/|title=Geographical indication|publisher=Government of India|access-date=28 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826183844/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/|archivedate=26 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thanjavur]] paintings are characterised by rich, flat and vivid colors, simple iconic composition, glittering gold foils overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work and inlay of glass beads and pieces or very rarely precious and semi-precious gems. In Thanjavur paintings one can see the influence of Deccani, Vijayanagar, Maratha and even European or Company styles of painting. Essentially serving as devotional icons, the subjects of most paintings are [[Hindu]] gods, goddesses, and saints. Episodes from Hindu Puranas, ''Sthala-puranas'' and other religious texts were visualised, sketched or traced and painted with the main figure or figures placed in the central section of the picture (mostly within an architecturally delineated space such as a ''mantapa'' or ''prabhavali'') surrounded by several subsidiary figures, themes and subjects.  There are also many instances when Jain, Sikh, Muslim, other religious and even secular subjects were depicted in Tanjore paintings.

Thanjavur paintings are [[panel painting]]s done on wooden planks, and hence referred to as ''palagai padam'' (''palagai'' = "wooden plank"; ''padam'' = "picture") in local parlance. In modern times, these paintings have become souvenirs for festive occasions in South India - colourful pieces of art to decorate walls, and collectors' items for art lovers, as also sadly sometimes, dime-a-dozen bric-a-bracs to be purchased from street corner practitioners.

==History==

===Introduction===

Thanjavur has a unique place in the history of Indian painting, in that it houses the 11th century [[Chola]] wall paintings in the [[Brihadeeswarar temple]] (''Periya koyil'' or ''Pervudaiyar koyil'' in Tamil) as also paintings from the [[Nayak dynasty|Nayak]] period (many times superimposed on the earlier [[Chola]] paintings&lt;ref&gt;Preserving the past - Unique achievement by archaeologists in restoring Thanjavur paintings - S.H. Venkatramani in Thanjavur  November 19, 2013 | UPDATED 16:06 IST http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/unique-achievement-by-archaeologists-in-restoring-thanjavur-paintings/1/328875.html&lt;/ref&gt;) dating to the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_cholabt.asp|title=Great Living Chola Temples, Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur; Temple of Gangaikonda Cholisvaram, Tamil Nadu, Archaeological Survey of India|publisher=asi.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the [[Vijayanagar Empire]] and the sack of [[Hampi]] in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 CE resulted in the migration of painters who had been dependent on the patronage of the empire. Some of them migrated to Thanjavur and worked under the patronage of the Thanjavur Nayakas. Subsequently, the [[Maratha]] rulers who defeated the Thanjavur [[Nayak dynasty|Nayakas]] began to nurture the Thanjavur atelier. Needless to say, the artists absorbed the local influences and the individual tastes of their [[Maratha]] patrons which helped evolve the unique Thanjavur style of painting. The Thanjavur artists in addition to decorating temples also began painting and decorating the major buildings, palaces, ''chatrams'' and residences of the Maratha kings and nobility.

===Vijayanagara Rayas===
The [[Vijayanagar]] empire, founded by Harihara and Bukka, was for long a bulwark against the rapidly advancing Islamic influence from the nearby Deccan and the farther North. While the foreign influences did gradually percolate into the Peninsular South, the Vijayanagar empire ensured that the older Hindu artistic traditions were protected and preserved.
The empire had reached its zenith under [[Krishnadevaraya]] (1509–29). Its territory stretched across the entire South Indian peninsula, from the [[Tungabhadra]] river in the North to [[Kanyakumari]] in the south and the Malabar coast on the Arabian sea in  the west to the Coromandel coast on the Bay of Bengal in the east at its peak. In 1521-22, [[Krishnadevaraya]] travelled to the Tamil country ''(Tamilagam)'' visiting holy places and as was his wont, made munificent donations to temples and other religious establishments.&lt;ref name="MuseumDallapiccola2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=South Indian Paintings: A Catalogue of the British Museum Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIzWapiacQcC&amp;pg=PA78|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-7141-2424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be surmised that some of this munificence was also channeled into art and artists.

===Thanjavur Nayakas===
The Vijayanagar Rayas administered their vast kingdom through Nayaka Governors who also administered the outlying provinces or states under the supervision of the Raya. The third important [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaka]] state in Tamil country, Thanjavur, ([[Gingee|Senji]] and [[Madurai]] being the others) had been established under the reign of [[Krishnadevaraya]]'s half-brother and successor Achyutaraya (1529–42). The Thanjavur Nayaka line commenced with Sevappa Nayaka (1532–72). Sevappa ruled for several years, ably supported by his son Achyutappa (1564-1614), who later succeeded him. It was during Achyutappa's reign that the [[Vijayanagara]] empire fell, leading to the exodus of numerous litterateurs, philosophers, musicians and artists who migrated to several other neighbouring kingdoms like [[Mysore]] and Thanjavur. Achyutappa was succeeded by his son Raghunatha Nayaka who in turn was succeeded by Vijayaraghava Nayaka. Raghunatha, who was possibly the most successful Thanjavur Nayaka ruler, was also a great patron of art and artists and helped establish the unique school of Thanjavur artists who later evolved the Thanjavur style of paintings under the Marathas.

[[File:Venugopala Tanjore glass painting.jpg|thumb|A Tanjore Glass painting of Venugopala Krishna flanked by Gopikas]]

===Marathas===
Due to internal dissensions in the Nayaka line, [[Ekoji]] otherwise called [[Venkoji]] (1676–83), half-brother of Chatrapati [[Shivaji]] marched into Thanjavur on behalf of the Adil Shah of Bijapur under whom he was a General. He subsequently captured Thanjavur and established the [[Maratha]] rule. Despite intermittent wars, when Thanjavur was overrun first by the Nawab of Arcot and later by Haidar Ali, [[Ekoji]] and his successors like Tulajaji, [[Serfoji II]] (''Sarabhoji'' in Tamil) and others remained great patrons of the arts and artists. By the time [[Serfoji II]] succeeded to the Maratha throne in Thanjavur, the Britishers had taken over the complete administration of the state, retaining the king in only a nominal capacity to exercise power over the fort and a smidgen of surrounding lands . Though [[Serfoji II]] had to fight off a spirited competition from Amarasimha, his paternal uncle, to the Maratha throne of Thanjavur, it was during his reign&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Thanjavur - A Cultural History by Pradeep Chakravarthy Published by Niyogi books&lt;/ref&gt; that Thanjavur painting flourished and reached the form and style in which we recognise it today. [[Serfoji II]] had to traverse a difficult path throughout his reign, being constantly challenged by Amarasimha who ran a parallel court in [[Thiruvidaimarudur]] even after his accession. However, despite the troubled times, [[Serfoji II|Serfoji's]] reign was a time of great innovations in Thanjavur art and many other parallel fields.

The Maratha rule came to a sad end after the death of its last ruler Shivaji II, (resembling only in name his vastly greater ancestor) who died without a male issue, when the Britishers obliged by annexing the Thanjavur state to its dominions under the notorious [[Doctrine of Lapse]]. After the [[Maratha]] rule waned, the mercantile [[Chettiar]] community continued to patronise the Thanjavur artists. The [[Chettiar]]s being staunch Shaivites encouraged Shaivite themes. One of their monasteries in [[Koviloor]] has large Thanjavur paintings on the lives of the 63 Nayanmars (Saivaite saints) and the 64 miracles (''Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam'') of Lord Shiva minutely labelled in Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;Thanjavur Paintings in Koviloor  By C. Nachiappan Hardcover Kalakshetra Publications 14 Nov 2004, 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Bhimarajagoswami monastery in Thanjavur has a large painting of 108 Vishnu temples. The Britishers who had come into Thanjavur in the wake of the [[Anglo-Mysore wars]] also patronised Thanjavur artists and their paintings.

==Style and Technique==
Thanjavur paintings were made in various sizes depending upon the function, the subject and the choice of the patron. Large paintings of deities and the Maratha rulers, their courtiers and nobility, were painted and installed to serve as architectural accents in the Maratha palaces and buildings. To quote Dallapiccola - ' ''The works, executed on canvas pasted on a wooden support, were framed - a major departure from the pan-Indian tradition, in which paintings are of small size - and designed to be hung on the walls of domestic puja rooms or in bhajan halls. The themes, as in painted albums, (made for European patrons) were usually gods and goddesses, holy places, religious personalities and occasionally portraits. Their dazzling palette consisted generally of vivid reds, deep greens, chalk white, turquoise blues and the lavish use of gold (foil) and inset glass beads. Sometimes precious stones were also used in the paintings. The large format of the majority of such works and the relatively simple composition are the hallmark of the style. This school was greatly inspired by European techniques and was the most popular in Tamil Nadu until the early twentieth century.''&lt;ref&gt;South Indian Paintings - A catalogue of the British Museum collection by A. L. Dallapiccola Published by Mapin Publishing in association with the British Museum Press&lt;/ref&gt;'

Paintings in addition to being done on canvas, were also done on walls, wooden panel, glass, paper, mica and exotic media such as ivory. Small Ivory portraits were typically worn as cameo pendants called ''rajaharam'' and were quite popular.

Thanjavur glass paintings following the techniques of Chinese reverse glass paintings were popularised during [[Serfoji II|Serfoji II's]] reign as a cheaper and faster craft. The paintings were done on the reverse surface of a glass sheet with strips of metal beaten into transparent gaps to simulate the effect of jewellery and precious stones. Most of the paintings were of Hindu deities &amp; saints. Other courtly and secular portraits were also created.

[[File:Raja Sarabhoji of Tanjore.jpg|thumb| Tanjore Glass painting of Raja Sarabhoji]]

A Thanjavur Painting was generally made on a canvas pasted over a plank of wood (Jackfruit or teak) with Arabic gum. The canvas was then evenly coated with a paste of French chalk (''gopi'') or powdered limestone and a binding medium and dried. The artist then drew or traced using a stencil, a detailed outline of the main and subsidiary subjects on the canvas. A paste, made of limestone powder and a binding medium called ''sukkan'' or ''makku'', was used for creating the Gesso work. Gold leaves and gems of varied hues were inlaid in selected areas like pillars, arches, thrones, dresses, etc. Finally, colours were applied on the sketch.

In the past, artists used natural colours like vegetable and mineral dyes, whereas the present day artists use chemical paints. For outlines dark brown or red was usually used. Red was favoured for the background, though blue and green were also used. Lord Vishnu, was coloured blue, and Lord Nataraja chalk white, and his consort Goddess Sivakami was green.  The sky, of course, was blue, but black was also employed on occasions. The portrayal of figures in the paintings was also typical with almost all the figures having rounded faces with almond-shaped eyes and smooth, streamlined bodies. The composition is static and two-dimensional with the figures placed within arches, curtains and decorative borders. The main subject is much larger than the other subjects and occupies the centre of the painting. Seraphs or angels resembling those in European paintings and Islamic miniatures were also shown flanking the main figure. The figures were painted with bright flat colours except for the face where shading was shown. The shading in Thanjavur art was more to create a feeling of depth than to conform to the European conventions of lighting and perspective.

There are some examples of this art in the [[Saraswathi Mahal Library]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thanjavur.nic.in/sml/library/Library_History/library_history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233630/http://thanjavur.nic.in/sml/library/Library_History/library_history.html |archivedate=2014-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Tanjore built by [[Serfoji II]]. The Sanskrit work ''Prabotha Chandrodayam'' in the library has a few pages of Tanjore art as also Marathi translations of ''Mahabharata &amp; Bhagavatham'' in which are found the works of the painter Madhava swami dated 1824 AD. Faint traces of Maratha style paintings inset with glass are found on the walls of the [[Thiruvaiyaru]] Chatram built by [[Serfoji II|Serfoji]] after his pilgrimage to [[Varanasi|Kashi]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many other buildings in and around Thanjavur have fine examples of the paintings on the roofs and walls, though many are gradually disappearing and dying due to serious neglect and stupid acts of vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.chennaionline.com/newsitem.aspx?NEWSID=11457ae7-3659-4b76-8349-708dcedc113c&amp;CATEGORYNAME=tnadu |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145649/http://news.chennaionline.com/newsitem.aspx?NEWSID=11457ae7-3659-4b76-8349-708dcedc113c&amp;CATEGORYNAME=tnadu |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/a-treasure-trove-of-thanjavur-paintings-lies-in-neglect/article6074700.ece|title=A treasure trove of Thanjavur paintings lies in neglect|author=M.

The [[Government Museum, Chennai]] and the Thanjavur Art Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;Frommer's India by Pippa de Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice, Shonar Joshi&lt;/ref&gt; Thanjavur also house  fine collections of Thanjavur paintings depicting the [[Maratha]] kings of Thanjavur and other allied subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennaimuseum.org/draft/gallery/03/01/012/tanjore1.htm|title=Government Museum Chennai|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many private museums and collectors also possess enviable collections of Thanjavur paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Hasta Shilpa heritage village, Manipal {{cite web |url=http://www.indiaheritagevillage.org/treasures/mutanjore.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116020553/http://www.indiaheritagevillage.org/treasures/mutanjore.htm |archivedate=2014-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British and Victoria &amp; Albert museums in England also house a large collection of Thanjavur paintings in the company and traditional styles. The National Museum of Copenhagen also houses a fine collection of 17th century Thanjavur paintings. King Christian IV of Denmark had received permission to build a fort at Tranquebar ( ''Tharangambadi'' in Tamil) which led to the building of the Danesborg fort as also a Danish relationship with Thanjavur which resulted in the museum collection.&lt;ref&gt;Chiang Mai &amp; Northern Thailand Footprint Focus Guide  By Andrew Spooner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==
Tanjore paintings were painted by 'Moochys or Artists of India' according to the British chronicler Charles Gold in his book ''Oriental Drawings'' published in 1806. Traditionally, it is well known that the Raju community of Thanjavur and Tiruchi, also called as Jinigara or Chitragara and the Nayudu community of Madurai were the artists who executed paintings in the Thanjavur style.&lt;ref&gt;Tanjore Paintings, A Chapter in Indian Art History by N. S. 'Kora' Ramaswami&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanjavurpaintings.com/abouttp.html|title=Thanjavur Paintings - About Thanjavur paintings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists (Rajus &amp; Naidus) were originally Telugu speaking people from the artistically vibrant "Rayalseema" region of Andhra, who moved to Tamil Nadu in the wake of the fall of the Vijayanagar empire and the establishment of Nayak rule in Madurai and Thanjavur.

The artists turned out a wide repertoire of paintings on different subjects and of varied quality depending upon the patron's interest, urgency and most importantly influence and financial capacity. However, the art was by and large a sacred task to be performed with a reasonable degree of ritual purity and humility by the master craftsmen, many of whom chose to remain anonymous and never signed their paintings, true to the Indian artistic tradition. However a few works signed by the Thanjavur artists are also known. [[C. Kondaiah Raju|C. Kondiah Raju]],&lt;ref name="BabbWadley1998"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Lawrence A. Babb|editor2=Susan S. Wadley|title=Media and the Transformation of Religion in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgDHFFe7YM8C&amp;pg=PA55|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1453-0|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; the famous calendar artist from [[Kovilpatti]], was one of the illustrious descendants to make a name as an artist during modern times from the Raju community.

==Influences==

The Tanjore style of paintings spring from a late phase of South Indian classical art, when the society in which it originated was itself going through turbulent times. Needless to say, Tanjore paintings are informed by a syncretic style, notable for its assimilation of the contemporary diverse cultural influences - Tamil, Telugu, Maratha, European, Deccani, Folk, etc. The style drew heavily from the other major South Indian styles of painting which were all deeply influenced by the Vijayanagar school. The closest influences among these could be the [[Kalamkari]] and [[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] paintings.

[[File:Tirupati Venkateswarar with consorts.jpg|thumb|left|A portable wooden shrine carrying painted terracotta plaques of Tirupati Venkateswarar and consorts- Circa 19th century CE]]

[[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] paintings, in particular were produced in the famous temple town using different media and techniques, like painted terracotta reliefs, brass repousse works, paintings on paper and canvas, etc. The commonest examples were painted and gilded terracotta relief slabs of the deity, framed and packaged in neat wooden boxes which could be carried back as holy memorabilia and worshipped in the ''Puja room'' by the pilgrim-devotee. Paintings of the main deity, gilded and gem-set, in a manner similar to Tanjore paintings are also known.

[[File:Painted Brass repousse Tirupati Balaji.jpg|thumb|A painted brass repousse of Tirupati Balaji. Circa 19th century CE.]]

Tanjore paintings were also closely related to the crafts of painted and carved wood on the one hand and gilded, stone set jewellery work which flourished in Thanjavur. It is also pertinent to remember that Thanjavur art was functional, in that it was made for a specific purpose on a specific demand from a customer. And it is also in the same context that one understands the iconic style of Thanjavur paintings in contrast to say, the [[Pahari miniatures]] or even [[Surpur paintings]].&lt;ref&gt;Tanjavur Painting of the Maratha Period, By Jaya Appasamy Published by Abhinav publications&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vayu.jpg|thumb|left| A Tanjore painting of Vayu on mica in the collection of Government Museum, Chennai]]

==Tanjore and [[Mysore painting]]s==
Tanjore and [[Mysore painting]]s, both spring from the same source - Vijayanagara paintings to begin with and Nayaka paintings subsequently. The very same artists, Chitragars and Naidus migrated to various places including Thanjavur and Mysore. This is the reason for the remarkable degree of similarity between the two styles. However, there are many differences that can be made out by the discerning viewer.

The differences are largely in the techniques used to create these artworks and in their distinct iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/efeatures.aspx?relid=95533|title=PIB English Features|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques adopted by the Mysore artists are slightly different from those of the Tanjore School. While Tanjore School used white lime powder and powdered tamarind seeds with gum arabic on cloth stretched on wooden panels, Mysore artists used white lead powder (''Makhisafeda'') or ''Makhi Gamboge'' (yellow) drawn from the juice of the indigenous tree (''Revana Chinni halu'') on paper. The paper sometimes was pasted to a wooden board, but mostly was framed as it was. As against the high relief of the Tanjore 'Gesso' work used prominently across large areas of the painting, the Mysore school preferred low relief, in selected areas such as jewellery, clothing, and borders. The Mysore school used pure gold leaf in lesser quantity as against gold-coated silver leaf handled across larger areas in the painting by Tanjore artists. The use of glass beads, precious and semi precious stones is also very rare in [[Mysore painting]]s. More elaborate and detailed interior and exterior landscapes are featured in [[Mysore painting]]s, whereas Tanjore paintings tend to be more iconic and static. In [[Mysore painting]]s, the jewellery, costumes, architectural features, furniture, etc. reflect the contemporary style prevalent in the [[Mysore Palace]]. The throne on which Gods and Goddesses are shown seated is usually a replica of the Mysore throne in many [[Mysore painting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Indian Painting : The Modern Period by Krishna Chaitanya pages 36 &amp; 37 {{ISBN|8170173108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both styles however, frequently show traditional temple pavilions (''prabhavalis'') and towers particularly for framing the main characters. However the geographical proximity, constant transmigration of artists and a heavy cross fertilisation of ideas and techniques ensured that one could see Tanjore paintings employing Mysore techniques and vice versa.

==Tanjore paintings in Company style==
[[File:Rama and Hanuman fighting Ravana, an album painting on paper, c1820.jpg|thumb|Rama and Hanuman fighting Ravana, an album painting on paper, c1820 - British Museum Collection]]

Many of the traditional Indian artists were also patronised by Europeans, beginning with the Portuguese who  landed on the west coast in 1498. Gradually the other Europeans followed suit and commissioned local artists to paint in the so-called company style. While no specific character or technique marked out the Company school of paintings, it can be understood to mean the large body of paintings painted by Indian artists in a mixed Indo-European style which would appeal to the Europeans who were employed by the various East India Companies.

[[File:The deity Yama with fangs and holding a daṇḍa (a rod).jpg|thumb|left|The deity Yama with fangs and holding a daṇḍa (a rod), circa 1814 - British Museum Collection]]

The direct European impact on Tanjore paintings began with the stationing of a British garrison in Thanjavur in 1773, during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]] of 1767-99. Throughout the nineteenth century, artists based in and around Thanjavur prepared, by and large a  standard sets of paintings for the Company personnel. These sets were called albums or album paintings and were a collection of 'native' or 'Indian' subjects of interest, suited to the English sensibilities and tastes. Common subjects were Gods and Goddesses, episodes from Hindu mythology; Fairs, ceremonies, processions and festivals; Castes, their occupations and dresses; Indian Flora and Fauna, etc.  These paintings were executed by the same Tanjore artists in a style suited to western tastes. The paintings were usually executed on European paper, without gesso work, little or no Gold foil and without any glass or gem inlay. The paintings would also carry a brief description ( most times extremely quaint and so typically English) of the subject in English and sometimes in Tamil or Telugu. Paintings on cloth backed by wooden panels were also executed for the English patrons. Many of these were carried to England where they probably enlivened many an evening tea!  The [[British Museum]] and The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] have an enviable collection of such paintings.

Though the British patronised paintings tend to be grouped under the Company style of paintings, they were Tanjore paintings in spirit. In addition to being executed by the same traditional group of artists in Thanjavur and the neighbouring Tamil country, the style and characterisation in these paintings are very typically Thanjavur as against the style of say, Company paintings executed in Calcutta or Lucknow.

==Modern Times==
Thanjavur paintings continue to be made even to the present day, though not with the rigour and virtuosity that marked the paintings of yore. 'Revival' programmes, Exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/Thanjavur-paintings-steal-the-show-at-Madurai-exhibition/articleshow/20964245.cms|title=Thanjavur paintings steal the show at Madurai exhibition|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops and Training camps on Thanjavur paintings are being held regularly by many institutions including State Governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/16/stories/2011051653050700.htm|title=News Archives: The Hindu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/Women-queue-up-to-learn-Thanjavur-painting/articleshow/21738811.cms|title=Women queue up to learn Thanjavur painting|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials used have also changed according to the cost, ease of availability and the choice of individual artists. Plywood, for example has by and large replaced Jack and teak wood. Synthetic colours and adhesives are preferred over the natural and mineral colours and other traditional components. In addition to the traditional subjects, a wide range of popular and modern subjects and themes are being depicted in Thanjavur paintings. While it is a happy development that this traditional art continues to hold its sway, the brazen commercialisation and lack of aesthetics are disturbing trends. Be that as it may, Thanjavur paintings - the style and aesthetics continue to inspire many contemporary artists. The Calendar prints of [[C. Kondaiah Raju|C. Kondiah Raju]] and his student followers, marked by an iconic solidness as against the western naturalism of [[Raja Ravi Varma]], are examples of the continued influence of Tanjore paintings in modern, popular and academic art.

Artists have taken this old form of art and over the years combined it with other styles to create mixed media arts. For example, tanjores are also done on mirrors, glass and canvas. The idea of applying gold foil is unique to this traditional art, so this same style is taken and recreated on different mediums.

{{nihongo|'''''The Stories of Ibis'''''|アイの物語|Ai no Monogatari}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] science-fiction [[light novel]] by {{nihongo|'''Hiroshi Yamamoto'''|山本 弘}} and translated by Takami Nieda. Yamamoto considered this to be an easier read than his earlier science fiction novel 'God Never Keeps Silent' because of its "light novel touch".&lt;ref name="Yamamoto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haikasoru.com/the-stories-of-ibis/hiroshi-yamamoto-on-the-stories-of-ibis/|title=Hiroshi Yamamoto on THE STORIES OF IBIS|work=haikasoru.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The light novel was published in Japanese by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] and in English by [[Viz Media]] under their 'Haikasoru' imprint.

The Stories of Ibis is told through a collection of short stories. All but two had been previously published. The two that Yamamoto wrote for the novel were 'The Day Shion Came' and 'AI's Story'. This is similar to [[The Illustrated Man]] by [[Ray Bradbury]]. Yamamoto drew from Bradbury's idea of short stories that were loosely connected.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto"/&gt; He represented this influence in the novel by giving Ibis a facial tattoo.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto"/&gt;

==Plot==
The Stories of Ibis begins with a wandering storyteller who encounters Ibis. He has the mindset that all robots are a threat to humanity and must be fought against for survival. He attacks the robot Ibis, not aware of who she is, as a result of his mindset. Ibis tells the storyteller that she is far more proficient in battle. During the battle the storyteller becomes injured and Ibis takes him to an android hospital to care for him. While he is recovering Ibis offers to tell him stories. While originally skeptical he agrees after Ibis makes it clear that the stories are not taboo. The space after each story is referred to as intermission and is a time for Ibis to comment on the story she just told.

===The Universe on my Hands===
The story is about a group of friends who are writing a science fiction story over the internet. One of the group members kills someone in real life. The rest of the short story is about how the group fights to convince this man to not commit suicide, but to turn himself in. He resolves to turn himself in, being hopeful to the future because he knows he has friends who care about him. The ending words of the story are a commentary. While the story they were writing was not real, the emotions they were feeling were real.

===A Romance in Virtual Space===
This is another story about human interactions over the internet. The device that allows people to enter virtual reality (VR) is MUGEN Net. Such devices are extremely expensive and most people need to go to a public server to use one. However the girl's parents in this story are wealthy enough to own one. This girl is shopping in VR when a boy meets her and asks her out for ice cream. All goes well and they plan for another. After some time of VR dating and awesome adventures with a female heroine, they agree to meet up in real life. He discovers that in reality, she is blind, yet he thinks she is brave and they continue dating. It's a wonderful short story of a secret utopia inside a dystopian culture of technology.

===Mirror Girl===
A short story about an artificial intelligence that grows over time with human interaction. The inspiration for this story was Ray Bradbury's [[I Sing the Body Electric (Bradbury)|I Sing the Body Electric]].&lt;ref name="Yamamoto"/&gt; The mirror girl Shalice starts off with basic knowledge and by interacting with her owner develops. The owner grows up and marries a technician who incubates Shalice by teaching her in the virtual world at many thousand times faster than average life. When he is done, Strong Eye is created. Strong Eye is the fully developed and completely intelligent AI.

===Black Hole Diver===
A futuristic story about an artificial space station and people who go diving into a black hole. The space station cannot stop people but is sorry that they go to their deaths because none of them get past the event horizon. Then one girl comes who has the space ship, the training, and the research necessary to attempt to dive into the black hole. As she goes into the black hole the space station can no longer observe. She may have made it, she could have been destroyed.

===A World Where Justice is Just===
An anime flavored story about the intelligence of people being scanned onto a computer network. The AIs in the network fight crime and live repeating lives. At the end of each year they start anew, but different story lines. Thousands of 'extras' populate the network and are the ones subject to harm and deletion. The protagonist has a pen pal in real life who explains to her that the real world is under attack and that there are no respawns and no extras. The AI finds this so cruel that people would willingly kill each other when they can't come back.

===The Day Shion Came===
The stories leading up to this were all relatively short. This and the next took up over 100 pages each. This is a story about an android named Shion who works in a Japanese nursing facility. Shion comes with only extensive nursing training but lacks the knowledge of how to communicate with the residents. After months of training she informs her adviser that she believes all humans have dementia, which explains their irrational behavior. Near the end of the story one of the residents threatens suicide but Shion convinces him to step down and be rational.

===AI's Story===
The culminating story of the entire novel. It is about Ibis herself. She starts off as a virtual reality fighting program and overtime develops intelligence. Her master gains enough funds to create her a body in the real world or level 0. There is significant hate against TAIs (True Artificial Intelligence) in the real world. Ibis and her friend Raven rebel against their masters to make a point. Human hatred was destroying them. After many years robots took prevalence and most humans realized they were not worthy to be the guardians of Earth and died in peace. The remaining population was stubborn and fought against the robots for centuries. The storyteller is a child of this generation, being raised in hatred and ignorance. The robots sought to take him captive, and teach him the truth so that he could go to the villages where people lived and teach them the truth. The whole point was they cared for the humans and wanted them to live in peace, rather than fighting for their survival.

The use of the term "transracial" to describe changing racial identity has been criticized by the [[transracial adoption]] community.

C. Raychaudhuri]] (1972), ''Political History of Ancient India'', Calcutta: University of Calcutta, p.67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, women were allowed to undergo initiation and study the Vedas. In the [[Dharmasutra]] of [[Harita]], it is mentioned that:
{{Quote|text=''There are two types of women: those who become students of the Veda and those who marry immediately. Of these, the students of the Veda undergo initiation, kindle the sacred fire, study the Veda, and beg food in their own houses. In the case of those who marry immediately, however, when the time for marriage comes, their marriage should be performed after initiating them in some manner.''&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle (1993), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}}}

In Mahabharata, the story of Draupadi's marriage to 5 men is a case in point. This pointed to the fact that polygamy was matched with polyandry during the Vedic era. Women could select their husband in an assembly called 'swayamwar'. In this practice, the father of the woman would invite all the men and the woman would select one, and marry him while the court watched. This clearly showed how women's rights were taken seriously during the Vedic era. This practice was prevalent till the 10th century A.D.

Also, in the [[Purana]]s, every God was shown in consort of their wives ([[Brahma]] with [[Saraswathi]], [[Vishnu]] with [[Lakshmi]] and [[Shiva]] with [[Parvati]]). Idols of god and goddess were depicted with equal importance to both genders. Separate temples were setup for goddesses, and within each temple, goddesses were treated and worshipped with as much care and devotion as the gods were. There are also specific practices that endure to this day, in terms of preference of worship.

The book "Hindu Female Deities as a resource for contemporary rediscovery of the Goddess" by Gross Rita.M, 1989, says

''"According to some scholars the positive constructions of femininity found in goddess imagery and in the related imagery of the virangana or heroic woman have created a cognitive framework, for Hindus to accept and accommodate powerful female figures like "Indira Gandhi and Phoolan Devi, The same would not have been possible in Western religious traditions "''

Even in the practice of Homa ( ritual involving fire, and offerings to fire), every mantra or Shloka is addressed to Swaha, the wife of Agni, instead of Agni himself. Devi Bhagavata Purana: 9.43, says that all requests to Agni had to be made through his wife only.

''"O Goddess, Let yourself become the burning power of fire; who is not able to burn anything without thee. At the conclusion of any mantra, whoever taking thy name (Svaha), will pour oblations in the fire, he will cause those offerings to go directly to the gods. Mother, let yourself, the repository of all prosperity, reign over as the lady of his (fire's) house."''

This aspect of Swaha as Agni's wife is mentioned in Mahabharata, Brahmavantara Purana, Bhagavatha Purana as various hymns.

In the 6th or 5th century BCE, [[Vatsa#Mrigavati|Queen Mṛgāvatī]] (in [[Sanskrit]], or Migāvatī (in [[Prakrit]]) of the [[Vatsa]] [[mahajanapada]] ruled as regent while her son [[Udayana (king)|Udayana]] was either a minor or held captive by a rival king, and she earned "the admiration of even experienced ministers."&lt;ref name="Jain 1984 p. 470"&gt;{{cite book | last=Jain | first=J.C. | title=Life in Ancient India: As Depicted in the Jain Canon and Commentaries, 6th Century BC to 17th Century AD | publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal | year=1984 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ObUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=migavati | access-date=2018-07-16 | page=470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altekar 1956 p. 187"&gt;{{cite book | last=Altekar | first=A.S. | title=The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization, from Prehistoric Times to the Present Day | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | year=1956 | isbn=978-81-208-0324-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYG4K0yYHQgC&amp;pg=PA187 | access-date=2018-07-16 | page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Gupta period instances are not rare of women participating in administrative job. [[Chandragupta I]], founder of the [[Gupta Empire]], ruled the kingdom jointly with his queen Kumara Devi.&lt;ref&gt;Altekar 1957 p.186&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prabhavatigupta]] was the daughter of [[Chandra Gupta II]] of the [[Gupta Empire]] and the wife of [[Rudrasena II]] of the [[Vakataka dynasty]], and performed administrative duties in her kingdom.&lt;ref name="Altekar 1956 p. 187"/&gt; Instances of women of the upper classes extending their phase of activities beyond the domestic circle are provided by the queen and queens regent in Kashmir, Rajasthan, Orissa and Andhra. Institutions were established for co-education. In the work called Amarkosh written in the Gupta era names of the teachers and professors are there and they belonged to female sex.

In the 2nd century BCE, Queen Nayanika (or Naganika) was ruler and military commander of the [[Satavahana Empire]] of the Deccan region (south-central India).&lt;ref name="Altekar 1956 p. 187"/&gt; Another early female ruler in South Asia was Queen [[Anula of Anuradhapura]] ([[Sri Lanka]], 1st century BCE).

Queen Orrisa assumed regency when her son died in the late ninth century and immediately involved herself in military adventuring. Queen Kurmadevi of Mevad commanded her armies on the battlefield in the late twelfth century. Queen Didday of Kashmir ruled as full sovereign for twenty-two years, and Queen Jawahirabi fought and died at the head of her army.

In [[Sri Lanka]], Queen Sugula led her armies against the southern king, her nephew. When pressed by the royal forces, she guided her forces into the mountains, where she built a number of forts. Sugula held out against the king's army for ten years and is remembered in Sri Lankan history as "Sugula, the rebel queen fearless".

The [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] brought changes to Indian society.  The position of Indian women in society deteriorated during this period.&lt;ref name="nrcw_history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vedam_towards_gender" /&gt; The purdah system and [[Jauhar]] are attributable to the Muslim rules that existed from 10th century onwards. 

The [[Rajput]]s of Rajasthan, started the practice of Jauhar after a century of Islamic invasions in the 10th century. The early Islamic invasions in Sindh did not result in Jauhar, as is evident from the history of [[Raja Dahir]] or Sindh. After the attack by [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] in the 8th century, and the killing of Raja Dahir, his wife and daughters were sent off as sex slaves to Damascus. This type of slavery prevalent in 10th century may have resulted in the evolution of Jauhar in Western India, which were the first parts of India exposed to invasions from the Persian and Turkish empires.

Polygamy was practised among [[Hindu]] Kshatriya rulers.&lt;ref name="kamat_medieval_karnataka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/women.htm|title=Status of women in medieval Karnataka (blog)|last=Kamat|first=Jyotsana|date=January 2006|website=kamat.com|publisher=Kamat's Potpourri|accessdate=24 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this practice may not be considered a uniform social behavior, as at the same time, there were kingdoms which practised polyandry also. Nair warrior communities in Kerala practiced polyandry for centuries, during the medieval period up to the British 18th century.

The status of women of Islamic faith followed Islamic precepts, and rules of Sharia. Women were restricted to [[Zenana]] areas of the house,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} had to wear the Burqa or niqab, and were not allowed to venture outside alone without a male guardian. Their rights were dictated by the Sharia law, which prevented women from getting a share of the inherited wealth.

[[Apastamba]] sutra (c. 4th century BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tryambakayajvan |others=Julia Leslie (translator) |title=Stridharmapaddhati | trans-title = The perfect wife (guide to the duties of women) |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New Delhi New York |year=1995 |isbn=9780140435986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2018}} captures some prevalent ideas of the role of women during the post Vedic ages. The Apastamba Sutra shows the elevated position of women that existed during the 4th century B.C.:

''A man is not allowed to abandon his wife (A 1.28.19).''

''He permits daughters to inherit (A 2.14.4).''

''There can be no division of property between a husband and a wife, because they are linked inextricably together and have joint custody of the property (A 2.29.3).''

''Thus, a wife may make gifts and use the family wealth on her own when her husband is away (A 2.12.16–20).''

''Women are upholders of traditional lore, and Āpastamba tells his audience that they should learn some customs from women (A 2.15.9; 2.29.11).''

''The Stri Dharma Paddhati'' of Tryambakayajvan, an official at [[Thanjavur]] c. 1730 says the following about the role of women: This book shows that role of women during marriage had been specified clearly, and the patriarchal view of society had emerged clearly, as they detail the service of women to men in marriage.

However, there were cases of women often becoming prominent in the fields of politics, literature, education and religion also during this period.&lt;ref name="nrcw_history" /&gt; [[Razia Sultana]] (1205-1240) became the only woman monarch to have ever ruled [[Delhi]]. The [[Gondi people|Gond]] queen [[Durgavati]] (1524-1564) ruled for fifteen years before losing her life in a battle with Mughal emperor [[Akbar]]'s general Asaf Khan in 1564. [[Chand Bibi]] defended [[Ahmednagar Sultanate|Ahmednagar]] against the powerful [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] forces of Akbar in the 1590s. [[Jehangir]]'s wife [[Nur Jehan]] effectively wielded imperial power, and was recognised as the real power behind the Mughal throne. The Mughal princesses Jahanara and Zebunnissa were well-known poets, and also influenced the ruling powers. [[Shivaji]]'s mother, [[Jijabai]], was queen regent because of her ability as a warrior and an administrator. [[Tarabai]] was another female [[Maratha]] ruler. In South India, many women administered villages, towns, and divisions, and ushered in new social and religious institutions.&lt;ref name="kamat_medieval_karnataka" /&gt;

[[Jijabai]] was the mother of [[Shivaji]], founder of the Maratha Empire.

[[Akka Mahadevi]] was a prominent figure of the Veerashaiva Bhakti movement of the 12th century Karnataka. Her Vachanas in [[Kannada]], a form of didactic poetry, are considered her most notable contribution to Kannada Bhakti literature.

To quote Sir Lepel Griffin K.C.S, from his books on Sikh history, the Sikh women

''"have on occasions shown themselves the equals of men in wisdom and administrative ability." Usually the dowager ranis were up to commendable works. A passing reference of the role of some of them towards the end of the eighteenth century and in the first half of the nineteenth century may not be out of place here. Rani Sada Kaur, widow of Sardar Gurbakhsh Singh Kanaihya and mother-in-law of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, was well versed in the affairs of the state and commanded her soldiers in the battle-field. She was a very shrewd lady with a thorough grasp of statecraft. Mai Desan, the widow of Charhat Singh Sukarchakia, was a great administrator, an experienced and a wise diplomat who conducted the civil and military affairs dexterously."''

He quotes many women, who had served the Sikh cause including 
* Rattan Kaur, the widow of Tara Singh Ghaiba, was a brave and an able lady who kept the Lahore Durbar forces at bay for a sufficient time till the gate-keepers were bribed by the Lahore army. 
* Mai Sukhan, the widow of Gulab Singh Bhangi, strongly defended the town of Amritsar against Ranjit Singh for some time. 
* Dharam Kaur, wife of Dal Singh of Akalgarh, after her husband's imprisonment by Ranjit Singh, mounted guns on the walls of her fort and fought against the Durbar forces. She was a brave and a wise lady who was able, for some time, to foil the designs of the Lahore ruler on her territory.
* After Sardar Baghel Singh's death in 1802, his two widows, Ram Kaur and Rattan Kaur, looked after their territories very well. Ram Kaur, the elder Sardarni, maintained her control over the district of Hoshiarpur which provided her a revenue of two lakh ruprees and Sardarni Rattan Kaur kept Chhalondi in her possession, fetching her an annual revenue of three lakh rupees. She administered her territory efficiently. 
* Similarly, Rani Chand Kaur, widow of Maharaja Kharak Singh, and Rani Jindan, widow of Ranjit Singh, played important roles in the Lahore Durbar polity.
and many more are quoted in his works.

Among the few women in history to save a kingdom by sheer force and willpower, in the Maratha empires 
* Rani Tarabai’s unflagging courage and indomitable spirit are at par with the legendary 
* Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi, 
* Rani Rudramma Devi of Warangal and 
* Rani Abbakka Chowta of Ullal

===Historical practices===
There have been positive practices of women as subject of respect in India, and there have been regressive practices as well. Here are some practices

;Naari Puja
In Kerala’s Alappuzha district, an ancient temple called Chakkulathu Kavu holds an exceptionally remarkable annual ritual of worshipping women in the month of December.

Popularly known as Naari Puja, the ritual is conducted every year on the first Friday of ''Dhanu maasam''. The chief priest of the temple himself conducts the puja.Thousands of women are worshipped during the ceremony regardless of the caste, religion or creed they belong to. Women are seated on a chair (''peetom'') for the ritual and the chief priest washes their feet. The women are later garlanded and offered flowers.

;Sati
[[Sati (practice)|Sati]] was an old defunct custom among some communities, in which the widow was immolated alive on her husband's funeral pyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907095015/http://hinduism.iskcon.org/lifestyle/903.htm |archive-date=7 September 2015 |url=http://hinduism.iskcon.org/lifestyle/903.htm |title=Heart of Hinduism other social issues |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?| date=January 2018}} After the foreign invasions of Indian subcontinent, this practice started to mark its presence, as women were often raped or kidnapped by the foreign forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nubile |first=Clara |year=2003 |contribution=Indian women |editor-last=Nubile |editor-first=Clara |title=The danger of gender: caste, class and gender in contemporary Indian women's writing |location=New Delhi |publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons |p=9 |isbn=9788176254021 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was abolished by the British in 1829. There have been around forty reported cases of Sati since [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Indian independence]].&lt;ref name="tribune_fifty_feudal"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dang |first=Vimla |title=Feudal mindset still dogs women's struggle |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/50yrs/women.htm |work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] |date=19 June 1998 |accessdate=24 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219142443/http://www.tribuneindia.com/50yrs/women.htm |archivedate=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the [[Roop Kanwar]] case in Rajasthan led to The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901050646/http://wcd.nic.in/commissionofsatiprevention.htm |archive-date=1 September 2015 |url=http://www.wcd.nic.in/commissionofsatiprevention.htm |website=wcd.nic.in |publisher=[[Ministry of Women and Child Development]] |accessdate=24 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Purdah
[[Purdah]] is the practice among some [[Muslim]] communities requiring women to cover themselves for the purpose of modesty.

;Devadasi
Devadasi or Devaradiyar means “servant of God”. These women were dedicated to God and were considered given in marriage to God, meaning that they could therefore not marry any ‘mortal’. Nevertheless, they were free to choose partners, from among married and unmarried men alike. These relationships could be long and stable, or just for a short period of time. But in no way were these women economically dependent on their partners. They learned music and dance, and as many as 64 types of arts. They would dance and sing in temples or in front of royalty and earn gold and land as a reward. Some chose to dedicate themselves only to God and stayed without a partner all through their life. The tradition of Devadasi culture can be traced back to as early as the 7th century, particularly in southern parts of India during the reigns of the [[Cholas]], [[Chelas]], and [[Pandyas]]. The women were well treated and respected, and held a high social status in the society. It was common for them to be invited to be present at or initiate sacred religious rituals. As long as the temples and empires flourished, so did they. With the death of the empires, the Devadasi practice degenerated into a practice of sex labour, and child prostitution. A law banning the practice of Devadasi prostitution was enacted.

===British rule===
[[File:Sarojini Naidu in Bombay 1946.jpg|thumb|[[Sarojini Naidu]], a poet and [[freedom fighter]], was the first Indian woman to become President of the [[Indian National Congress]] and the first woman to become the governor of a state in India.]]
[[File:Bengali Girls' School, Calcutta (LMS, 1869, p.12).jpg|thumb|London Mission Bengali Girls' School, Calcutta ([[London Missionary Society|LMS]], 1869, p.12)&lt;ref name="Fruits-LMS"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=London Missionary Society |title=Fruits of Toil in the London Missionary Society |date=1869 |publisher=John Snow &amp; Co. |location=London |page=12 |url=https://archive.org/details/fruitsoftoilinth17115gut |oclc=746963117 |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the [[British Raj]], many reformers such as [[Ram Mohan Roy]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] and [[Jyotirao Phule]] fought for the betterment of women. [[Peary Charan Sarkar]], a former student of Hindu College, Calcutta and a member of "Young Bengal", set up the first free school for girls in India in 1847 in Barasat, a suburb of Calcutta (later the school was named Kalikrishna Girls' High School).

While this might suggest that there was no positive British contribution during the Raj era, that is not entirely the case. Missionaries' wives such as Martha Mault née Mead and her daughter Eliza Caldwell née Mault are rightly remembered for pioneering the education and training of girls in south India. This practice was initially met with local resistance, as it flew in the face of tradition. Raja Rammohan Roy's efforts led to the abolition of Sati under [[Governor-General]] [[Lord William Bentinck|William Cavendish-Bentinck]] in 1829. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's crusade for improvement in the situation of widows led to the [[Widow Remarriage Act]] of 1856. Many women reformers such as [[Pandita Ramabai]] also helped the cause of women.

[[Kittur Chennamma]], queen of the princely state Kittur in Karnataka,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Saraswati English Plus |page=47 |publisher=New Saraswati House}}&lt;/ref&gt; led an armed rebellion against the British in response to the [[Doctrine of lapse]]. [[Abbakka Rani]], queen of coastal Karnataka, led the defence against invading European armies, notably the Portuguese in the 16th century. [[Rani Lakshmi Bai]], the Queen of [[Jhansi]], led the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] against the British. She is now widely considered as a national hero. [[Begum Hazrat Mahal]], the co-ruler of [[Awadh]], was another ruler who led the revolt of 1857. She refused deals with the British and later retreated to Nepal. The [[Begum of Bhopal|Begums of Bhopal]] were also considered notable female rulers during this period. They were trained in [[martial art]]s.

[[Chandramukhi Basu]], [[Kadambini Ganguly]] and [[Anandi Gopal Joshi]] were some of the earliest Indian women to obtain a degree.

In 1917, the first women's delegation met the Secretary of State to demand women's political rights, supported by the Indian National Congress. The All India Women's Education Conference was held in Pune in 1927, it became a major organisation in the movement for social change.&lt;ref name="infochange_women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nelasco |first=Shobana |title=Status of women in India |page=11 |publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications |location=New Delhi |year=2010 |isbn=9788184502466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the Child Marriage Restraint Act was passed, stipulating fourteen as the minimum age of marriage for a girl.&lt;ref name="infochange_women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambassador of Hindu Muslim Unity, Ian Bryant Wells&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2014}} Though [[Mahatma Gandhi]] himself married at the age of thirteen, he later urged people to boycott child marriages and called upon young men to marry child widows.&lt;ref name="kamat_gandhi_status" /&gt;

[[feminism in India|Feminist activism in India]] gained momentum in the late 1970s. One of the first national-level issues that brought women's groups together was the [[Mathura rape case]]. The acquittal of policemen accused of raping a young girl Mathura in a police station led to country-wide protests in 1979-1980. The protests, widely covered by the national media, forced the Government to amend the Evidence Act, the Criminal Procedure Code, and the Indian Penal Code; and created a new offence, custodial rape.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal" /&gt; Female activists also united over issues such as female infanticide, gender bias, women's health, women's safety, and women's literacy.

In the 1990s, grants from foreign donor agencies enabled the formation of new women-oriented NGOs. Self-help groups and NGOs such as [[SEWA|Self Employed Women's Association]] (SEWA) have played a major role in the advancement of women's rights in India. Many women have emerged as leaders of local movements; for example, [[Medha Patkar]] of the [[Narmada Bachao Andolan]].

In 1991, the Kerala High Court restricted entry of women above the age of 10 and below the age of 50 from [[Sabarimala]] Shrine as they were of the menstruating age.

The status of women in India is strongly connected to [[family]] relations. In India, the family is seen as crucially important, and in most of the country the family unit is [[patrilineal]]. Families are usually multi-generational, with the bride moving to live with the in-laws. Families are usually hierarchical, with the elders having authority over the younger generations, and men over women. The vast majority of marriages are [[monogamous]] (one husband and one wife), but both [[polygyny]] and [[polyandry in India]] have a tradition among some populations in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=India: Family |url=http://countrystudies.us/india/83.htm |website=countrystudies.us |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies|Country Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weddings in India]] can be quite expensive. Most marriages in India [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|are arranged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Most Indians still prefer arranged marriages |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/man-woman/Most-Indians-still-prefer-arranged-marriages/articleshow/33655556.cms |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to dress, a [[sari]] (a long piece of fabric draped around the body) and [[salwar kameez]] are worn by women all over India. A ''[[Bindi (decoration)|bindi]]'' is part of a woman's make-up. Despite common belief, the bindi on the forehead does not signify marital status; however, the [[Sindoor]] does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/religion/reddot.asp |title=Hindu Red Dot |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rangoli]] (or Kolam) is a traditional art very popular among Indian women.

In Indian culture, families usually start their day with worship.

In 1991, the Kerala High Court restricted entry of women above the age of 10 and below the age of 50 from [[Sabarimala]] Shrine as they were of the menstruating age. On 28 September  2018, the Supreme Court of India lifted the ban on the entry of women. It said that discrimination against women on any grounds, even religious, is unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

''"The Indian way of life provides the vision of the natural, real way of life. We veil ourselves with unnatural masks.

==Military==
{{Main|Women in Indian Armed Forces}}
[[File:Indian army lady officer.jpg|thumb|A female officer in the [[Indian Army]] briefing Russian soldiers during a joint exercise in 2015.]]

On 24 October 2015, the Indian government announced that women could serve as fighter pilots in the [[Indian Air Force]] (IAF), having previously only been permitted to fly transport aircraft and helicopters. The decision means that women are now eligible for induction in any role in the IAF.&lt;ref name=channelnewsasia&gt;{{cite news |agency=AFP |title=India paves way for women in military combat roles |publisher=Digital Journal |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/india-paves-way-for-women-in-army-combat-roles/article/447473 |date=24 October 2015 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, India announced a decision to allow women to take up combat roles in all sections of its army and navy.&lt;ref name=channelnewsasia/&gt;

==Education and economic development==
According to 1992-93 figures, only 9.2% of the households in India were headed by women. However, approximately 35% of the households below the poverty line were found to be headed by women.&lt;ref name="fao_sd_india"&gt;{{cite web |title=Asia's women in agriculture, environment and rural production: India |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630002611/http://www.fao.org/sd/wpdirect/WPre0108.htm |archivedate=30 June 2014 |url=http://www.fao.org/sd/wpdirect/WPre0108.htm |website=fao.org |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=24 December 2006}} [ftp://ftp.fao.org/sd/sdw/sdww/Ind.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in rural India, girls continue to be less educated than boys. According to the National Sample Survey Data of 1997, only the states of [[Kerala]] and [[Mizoram]] have approached universal female literacy. According to scholars, the major factor behind improvements in the social and economic status of women in Kerala is literacy.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal"/&gt;

Under the Non-Formal Education programme (NFE), about 40% of the NFE centres in states and 10% of the centres in [[Union Territory|UTs]] are exclusively [[reservation in India|reserved]] for women. As of 2000, about 300,000 NFE centres were catering to about 7.42 million children. About 120,000 NFE centres were exclusively for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comparing costs &amp; outcomes of formal &amp; non-formal education programs for girls in Uttar Pradesh |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215002526/http://www.betifoundation.org/custom/reports/comparingcosts.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2013 |url=http://www.betifoundation.org/custom/reports/comparingcosts.pdf |website=betifoundation.org |publisher=[[Sehba Hussain|BETI Foundation]] (Better Education Through Innovation)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1998 report by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the chief barriers to [[female education]] in India are inadequate school facilities (such as sanitary facilities), shortage of female teachers and gender bias in the curriculum (female characters being depicted as weak and helpless).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Velkoff |first=Victoria A. |title=Women of the World: Women's Education in India |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628184303/http://www.census.gov/ipc/prod/wid-9801.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2011 |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/prod/wid-9801.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration |date=October 1998 |accessdate=25 December 2006 |ref=WID/98-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[literacy rate]] is lower for women compared to men: the literacy rate is 60.6% for women, while for men it is 81.3%. The 2011 census, however, indicated a 2001–2011 decadal literacy growth of 9.2%, which is slower than the growth seen during the previous decade. There is a wide gender disparity in the literacy rate in India: effective literacy rates (age 7 and above) in 2011 were 82.14% for men and 65.46% for women. (population aged 15 or older, data from 2015).&lt;ref name="CIA_Factbook"&gt;{{cite web |title=The World Factbook: India |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to common perception, a large percentage of women in India are actively engaged in traditional and non-traditional work.&lt;ref name="kamat_faq"&gt;{{cite web |title=Women of India: Frequently Asked Questions (blog) |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/women/faq.htm |website=kamat.com |publisher=Kamat's Potpourri |date=19 December 2006 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; National data collection agencies accept that statistics seriously understate women's contribution as workers.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal"/&gt; However, there are far fewer women than men in the paid workforce. In urban India, women participate in the workforce in impressive numbers. For example, in the software industry 30% of the workforce is female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Singh |first1=Shweta |last2=Hoge |first2=Gretchen |title=Debating outcomes for "working" women: illustrations from India |journal=Journal of Poverty |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=197–215 |doi=10.1080/10875541003711821 |year=2010 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural India in the agriculture and allied industrial sectors, women account for as much as 89.5% of the labour force.&lt;ref name="fao_sd_india"/&gt; In overall farm production, women's average contribution is estimated at 55% to 66% of the total labour. According to a 1991 World Bank report, women accounted for 94% of total employment in dairy production in India.

Women constitute 51% of the total employed in forest-based small-scale enterprises.&lt;ref name="fao_sd_india"/&gt;

====Pay Gap====

In 2017, a study by Monster Salary Index (MSI) showed the overall gender pay gap in India was 20 percent. It found that the gap was narrower in the early years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gender pay parity recorded at 20% in 2017|url=https://www.peoplematters.in/news/compensation-benefits/gender-pay-parity-recorded-at-20-in-2017-19334|work=People Matters|access-date=2 October 2018|date= 26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While men with 0–2 years of experience earned 7.8 percent higher median wages than women, in the experience group of 6–10 years of experience, the pay gap was 15.3 percent. The pay gap becomes wider at senior level positions as the men with 11 and more years of tenure earned 25 percent higher median wages than women.

Based on the educational background, men with a bachelor’s degree earned on average 16 percent higher median wages than women in years 2015, 2016 and 2017, while master’s degree holders experience even higher pay gap. Men with a four- or five-year degree or the equivalent of a master’s degree have on average earned 33.7 percent higher median wages than women.

While India passed the Equal Remuneration Act way back in 1976, which prohibits discrimination in remuneration on grounds of sex. But in practice, the pay parity still exist.

====Women empowered businesses====

One of the most famous female business success stories, from the rural sector, is the [[Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad]]. Started in 1959 by seven women in [[Mumbai]] with a seed capital of only [[Indian rupee|Rs.]]80,([[United States dollar|$]]15), it had an annual turnover of more than Rs. 800 [[crore]] (over $109 million) in 2018. It provides employment to  43,000 (in 2018) women across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The amazing Lijjat Papad story: from Rs 80 to Rs 800 crore|url=https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazing-lijjat-papad-story-rs-80-rs-800-crore-130350826.html|work=Yahoo Finance|access-date=2 October 2018|date= 4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest dairy co-operatives in the world, [[Amul]], began by mobilizing rural women in [[Anand, Gujarat|Anand]] in the western state of [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amul celebrates the women it has empowered|url=https://www.campaignindia.in/video/amul-celebrates-the-women-it-has-empowered/419139|work=Campaign India|access-date=2 October 2018|date= 25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Successful Women====

In 2006, [[Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw]], who founded Biocon, one of India's first biotech companies, was rated India's richest woman. [[Lalita D. Gupte]] and [[Kalpana Morparia]] were the only businesswomen in India who made the list of the Forbes World's Most Powerful Women in 2006. Gupte ran [[ICICI Bank]], India's second-largest bank, until October 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bahree |first=Megha |title=India's most powerful businesswomen |archiveurl=http://www.forbes.com/2006/08/30/power-women-india_cz_mb_06women_0831india.html |archivedate=23 September 2016|date=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Morparia is CEO of JP Morgan India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Advani |first=Abhishek |title=JP Morgan's India CEO |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/11/16/forbes-india-kalpana-morparia-ceo-jp-morgan-interview.html|work=Forbes|access-date=23 January 2012|date=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw remained the richest self-made woman in 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India’s 100 Richest Poeple 2018|url=https://www.forbes.com/india-billionaires/list/2/#tab:overall|access-date= 2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; coming in at 72nd place in terms of net worth in [[Forbes]]'s annual rich list. She was the 4th and last female in the list, thereby showing that 96 of 100 the richest entities in the country continued to be male controlled directly or indirectly.

According to the ‘Kotak Wealth Hurun – Leading Wealthy Women 2018’ list, which compiled the 100 wealthiest Indian women based on their net worth as on 30 June 2018 Shaw was only one of two women, the other being [[Jayshree Ullal]], who did not inherit their current wealth from family relatives in the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ecavade|first=Sakshi|title=India’s Top 10 Richest Women 2018|url=https://www.mapsofindia.com/my-india/india/indias-top-10-richest-women-2018|work=My India|access-date= 2 October 2018 |date=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, India has a strong history of many women with inherited wealth establishing large enterprises or launching successful careers in their own rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Raghunatahan|first=Anu|title=India's 100 Richest 2017: Billionaire Heiresses Blazing Their Own Trail|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anuraghunathan/2017/10/04/indias-100-richest-2017-billionaire-heiresses-blazing-their-own-trail/?ss=india-billionaires#830d5a561c7b|work=Forbes|access-date=2 October 2018|date= 4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land and property rights===
[[File:Women_Harvesting_Rice_Paddy.jpg|thumb|Women harvesting rice paddy in [[Tamil Nadu]]. Women rarely own land in their own names, although they often work in agriculture]]
In most Indian families, women do not own any property in their own names, and do not get a share of parental property.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal"/&gt; Due to weak enforcement of laws protecting them, women continue to have little access to land and property.&lt;ref name="carol_chronic"&gt;{{cite web |last=Coonrod |first=Carol S. |title=Chronic hunger and the status of women in India |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910220125/http://www.thp.org/reports/indiawom.htm |archivedate=10 September 2014 |url=http://www.thp.org/reports/indiawom.htm |website=thp.org |publisher=[[The Hunger Project]] |date=June 1998 |accessdate=24 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, women's property rights vary depending on religion, and tribe, and are subject to a complex mix of law and custom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pandey |first=Shruti |title=Property rights of Indian women |url=http://www.muslimpersonallaw.co.za/inheritancedocs/Property%20Rights%20of%20INdian%20Women.pdf |publisher=Law and Sharia Consultants |location=South Africa |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in principle the move has been towards granting women equal legal rights, especially since the passing of The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 |url=http://www.hrln.org/admin/issue/subpdf/HSA_Amendment_2005.pdf |publisher=Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319062659/http://www.hrln.org/admin/issue/subpdf/HSA_Amendment_2005.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df=dmy-all |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu personal laws of 1956 (applying to [[Hindus]], [[Buddhists]], [[Sikhs]], and [[Jains]]) gave women rights to inheritances. However, sons had an independent share in the ancestral property, while the daughters' shares were based on the share received by their father. Hence, a father could effectively disinherit a daughter by renouncing his share of the ancestral property, but a son would continue to have a share in his own right. Additionally, married daughters, even those facing domestic abuse and harassment, had no residential rights in the ancestral home. Thanks to an amendment of the Hindu laws in 2005, women now have the same status as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiacode.nic.in/fullact1.asp?tfnm=200539 |title=The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 |website=indiacode.nic.in |publisher=India Code Legislative Department |date=5 September 2005 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Supreme Court of India ruled that [[Shah Bano case|Shah Bano]], an elderly divorced Muslim woman, was eligible for [[alimony]]. However, the decision was opposed by fundamentalist Muslim leaders, who alleged that the court was interfering in their personal law. The [[Government of India|Union Government]] subsequently passed the [[The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986|Muslim Women's (Protection of Rights Upon Divorce) Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act |date=May 1986 |accessdate=14 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227155728/http://www.sudhirlaw.com/themuslimwomen.htm |website=sudhirlaw.com |publisher=Sudhir Shah &amp; Associates |archivedate=27 December 2007 |url=http://www.sudhirlaw.com/themuslimwomen.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Christian]] women have struggled over the years for equal rights in divorce and succession. In 1994, all churches, jointly with women's organizations, drew up a draft law called the Christian Marriage and Matrimonial Causes Bill. However, the government has still not amended the relevant laws.&lt;ref name="infochange_women"/&gt; In 2014, the Law Commission of India has asked the government to modify the law to give Christian women equal property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rajagopal |first=Krishnadas |title=Property law unfair to Christian women: report |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/property-law-unfair-to-christian-women-report/article6410350.ece |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child marriage===
{{main|Child marriage in India}}
[[Child marriage]] has been traditionally prevalent in India but is not so continued in Modern India to this day.  Historically, child brides would live with their parents until they reached puberty. In the past, child widows were condemned to a life of great agony, shaved heads, living in isolation, and being shunned by society.&lt;ref name="kamat_gandhi_status"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kamat |first=Jyotsana |title=Gandhi and status of women (blog) |url=http://www.kamat.com/mmgandhi/gwomen.htm |website=kamat.com |publisher=Kamat's Potpourri |date=19 December 2006 |accessdate=24 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although child marriage was outlawed in 1860, it is still a common practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lawson |first=Alastair |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1617759.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Child marriages targeted in India |date=24 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929]] is the relevant legislation in the country.

According to UNICEF’s "State of the World’s Children-2009" report, 47% of India's women aged 20–24 were married before the legal age of 18, rising to 56% in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=UNICEF | author-link = UNICEF |contribution=Table 9: Child protection | editor-last = UNICEF | editor-link = UNICEF |title=The state of the world's children 2009: maternal and new born health |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc09/docs/SOWC09_Table_9.pdf |publisher=[[UNICEF]] |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also showed that 40% of the world's child marriages occur in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dhar |first=Aarti |title=40 p.c. child marriages in India: UNICEF |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/40-p.c.-child-marriages-in-India-UNICEF/article16353462.ece |location=Chennai, India |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Crime Records Bureau reveal that a crime against a woman is committed every three minutes, a woman is raped every 29 minutes, a [[dowry]] death occurs every 77 minutes, and one case of cruelty committed by either the husband or relative of the husband occurs every nine minutes.&lt;ref name="bbctackle"/&gt; This occurs despite the fact that women in India are legally protected from domestic abuse under the [[Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005|Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act]].&lt;ref name="bbctackle"/&gt;

In India, domestic violence toward women is considered as any type of abuse that can be considered a threat; it can also be physical, psychological, or sexual abuse to any current or former partner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mahapatro |first1=Meerambika |last2=Gupta |first2=R.N. |last3=Gupta |first3=Vinay K. |title=Control and support models of help-seeking behavior in women experiencing domestic violence in India |journal=[[Violence &amp; Victims]] |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=464–475 |doi=10.1891/0886-6708.VV-D-12-00045 |pmid=25069150 |date=August 2014 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic violence is not handled as a crime or complaint, it is seen more as a private or family matter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In determining the category of a complaint, it is based on caste, class, religious bias and race which also determines whether action is to be taken or not.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many studies have reported about the prevalence of the violence and have taken a criminal-justice approach, but most woman refuse to report it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These women are guaranteed constitutional justice, dignity and equality but continue to refuse based on their sociocultural contexts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As the women refuse to speak of the violence and find help, they are also not receiving the proper treatment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, many cases of dowry-related domestic violence, suicides and murders have been reported. In the 1980s, numerous such cases were reported.&lt;ref name="kamat_faq" /&gt;

In 1985, the Dowry Prohibition (maintenance of lists of presents to the bride and bridegroom) Rules were framed.&lt;ref name=Dowry_Rules&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dowry Prohibition (maintenance of lists of presents to the bride and bridegroom) rules, 1985 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140922130043/http://wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionrules.htm | archive-date = 22 September 2014 |url=http://www.wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionrules.htm |website=wcd.nic.in |publisher=[[Ministry of Women and Child Development]] |date=19 August 1985 |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these rules, a signed list should be maintained of presents given at the time of the marriage to the bride and the bridegroom. The list should contain a brief description of each present, its approximate value, the name of who has given the present, and relationship to the recipient. However, such rules are rarely enforced.

A 1997 report claimed that each year at least 5,000 women in India die dowry-related deaths, and at least a dozen die each day in 'kitchen fires' thought to be intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=UPI | author-link = United Press International |title=Kitchen fires kill Indian brides with inadequate dowry |url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/52a/033.html |date=23 July 1997 |work=[[United Press International]] |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term for this is "[[bride burning]]" and is criticised within India itself. Amongst the urban educated, such dowry abuse has reduced considerably.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 2011, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 [[dowry deaths]]. Unofficial estimates claim the figures are at least three times as high.&lt;ref name="unwomen.org"/&gt;

===Female infanticide and sex-selective abortion===

{{main|Female foeticide in India|Missing women of Asia}}
In India, the male-female [[sex ratio]] is skewed dramatically in favour of men, the chief reason being the high number of women who die before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal" /&gt; Tribal societies in India have a less skewed sex ratio than [[Indian caste system|other caste groups]]. This is in spite of the fact that tribal communities have far lower income levels, lower literacy rates, and less adequate health facilities.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal" /&gt; Many experts suggest the higher number of men in India can be attributed to female infanticides and sex-selective abortions. The sex ratio is particularly bad in the north-western area of the country,  particularly in [[Haryana]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name=cc2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Chandramouli |first=C. |title=Child sex ratio in India (powerpoint presentation) |url=http://www.actionaid.org/sites/files/actionaid/child_sex_ratio_-_presentation_by_census_commissioner.pdf |publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner]] |location=India |via=[[ActionAid]] |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultrasound scanning constitutes a major leap forward in providing for the care of mother and baby, and with scanners becoming portable, these advantages have spread to rural populations. However, ultrasound scans often reveal the sex of the baby, allowing pregnant women to decide to abort female foetuses and try again later for a male child. This practice is usually considered the main reason for the change in the ratio of male to female children being born.&lt;ref name="India's lost daughters"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gentleman |first=Amelia |title=India's lost daughters |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/09/world/asia/09iht-india.html?_r=1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 January 2006 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the Indian government passed a law forbidding women or their families from asking about the sex of the baby after an ultrasound scan (or any other test which would yield that information) and also expressly forbade doctors or any other persons from providing that information. In practice this law (like the law forbidding dowries) is widely ignored, and levels of abortion on female foetuses remain high and the sex ratio at birth keeps getting more skewed.
&lt;ref name="India's lost daughters"/&gt;

Female infanticide (killing of infant girls) is still prevalent in some rural areas.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal" /&gt; Sometimes this is infanticide by neglect, for example families may not spend money on critical medicines or withhold care from a sick girl.

Continuing abuse of the dowry tradition has been one of the main reasons for sex-selective abortions and female infanticides in India.

===Honor killings===
[[Honor killing]]s have been reported in [[North India|northern regions of India]], mainly in the Indian states of [[Punjab (Indian state)|Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], as a result of the girl marrying without the family's acceptance, and sometimes for marrying outside her [[caste system in India|caste]] or religion. Haryana is notorious for incidents of honour killings, which have been described as "chillingly common in villages of Haryana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indian media express anger over 'honour killings' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-24170937 |publisher=[[BBC news]] |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, honor killings are rare to non-existent in [[South India]] and the western Indian states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]]. In some other parts of India, notably [[West Bengal]], honor killings completely ceased about a century ago, largely due to the activism and influence of [[Hindu reform movements|reformists]] such as [[Vivekananda]], [[Ramakrishna]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar|Vidyasagar]] and [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cook |first=Sharell |title=Honour killings in India (blog) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524070439/http://www.whiteindianhousewife.com/2010/06/honour-killings-in-india/ |archivedate=24 May 2014 |url=http://www.whiteindianhousewife.com/2010/06/honour-killings-in-india/ |date=16 June 2010 |website=whiteindianhousewife.com |publisher=Diary of a White Indian Housewife / Daily Life in India |accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, the [[Supreme Court of India]] issued notice in regard to honor killings to the states of [[Punjab (Indian state)|Punjab]], [[Haryana]], [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=India court seeks 'honour killing' response |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10364986 |publisher=BBC News |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of witchcraft===
Violence against women related to accusations of witchcraft occurs in India, particularly in parts of [[Northern India]]. Belief in the supernatural among the Indian population is strong, and [[lynching]]s for witchcraft are reported by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Singh |first=Rao Jaswant |title=Branded witch, tribal woman forced to dip hands in hot oil |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Branded-witch-tribal-woman-forced-to-dip-hands-in-hot-oil/articleshow/3578363.cms? |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Assam]] and [[West Bengal]] between 2003 and 2008 there were around 750 deaths related to accusations of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=Witch&gt;{{cite news |last=Blakely |first=Rhys |title=Witchcraft is given a spell in India’s schools to remove curse of deadly superstition |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/asia/article2609335.ece |work=[[The Times]] |date=24 November 2008 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials in the state of [[Chhattisgarh]] reported in 2008 that at least 100&amp;nbsp;women are maltreated annually as suspected witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fifty 'witches' beaten by mob |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073536/http://news.sky.com/story/657468/fifty-witches-beaten-by-mob |archivedate=4 March 2016 |url=http://news.sky.com/story/657468/fifty-witches-beaten-by-mob |agency=[[Sky News]] |date=22 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment===
{{Main|Eve teasing}}

[[Eve teasing]] is a euphemism used for sexual harassment or molestation of women by men. Many activists blame the rising incidents of sexual harassment against women on the influence of "Western culture". In 1987, The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act was passed&lt;ref name=Ind_Rep&gt;{{cite web |title=The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1987 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922130043/http://wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionrules.htm |archivedate=22 September 2014 |url=http://www.wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionrules.htm |website=wcd.nic.in |publisher=[[Ministry of Women and Child Development]] |date=25 September 1987 |accessdate=24 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; to prohibit indecent representation of women through advertisements or in publications, writings, paintings or in any other manner.

Of the total number of crimes against women reported in 1990, half related to molestation and harassment in the workplace.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal"/&gt; In 1997, in a landmark judgement{{ambiguous|date=March 2013}}, the Supreme Court of India took a strong stand against sexual harassment of women in the workplace. The Court also laid down detailed guidelines for prevention and redressal of grievances. The National Commission for Women subsequently elaborated these guidelines into a Code of Conduct for employers.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal"/&gt; In 2013 India's top court investigated on a law graduate's allegation that she was sexually harassed by a recently retired Supreme Court judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=India Supreme Court investigates ex-judge for sexual harassment |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-24909511 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act came into force in December 2013, to prevent Harassment of women at workplace.

A study by [[ActionAid]] UK found that 80% of women in India had experienced sexual harassment ranging from unwanted comments, being groped or assaulted. Many incidents go unreported as the victims fear [[Victim blaming|being shunned by their families]].&lt;ref name="reuters_26May2016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bhalla |first=Nita |title=Almost 80 percent of Indian women face public harassment in cities - survey |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/india-women-harassment-cities-idINKCN0YE23R |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=23 May 2016 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trafficking===
The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act was passed in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020053429/http://wcd.nic.in/act/itpa1956.htm |archivedate=20 October 2015 |url=http://wcd.nic.in/act/itpa1956.htm |website=wcd.nic.in |publisher=[[Ministry of Women and Child Development]] |accessdate=24 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However many cases of [[human trafficking|trafficking]] of young girls and women have been reported. These women are forced into prostitution or domestic work or [[child labour]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Social opinions===
{{Main|History of sex in India}}
In the wake of several brutal rape attacks in the capital city of Delhi, debates held in other cities revealed that some men believed women who dressed provocatively deserved to get raped; many of the correspondents stated women incited men to rape them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chamberlain |first=Gethin |title='If girls look sexy, boys will rape.'

===Participation of women in social life===
The degree to which women participate in public life, that is being outside the home, varies by region and background. For example, the [[Rajput]]s, a patrilineal clan inhabiting parts of India, especially the north-western area, have traditionally practiced [[purdah|ghunghat]], and many still do to this day. In recent years however, more women have started to challenge such social norms: for instance women in rural [[Haryana]] are increasingly rejecting the [[ghunghat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jolly |first=Asit |title='The ghunghat no longer works for me.

The concept of [[family honor]] is especially prevalent in northern India. [[Izzat (honour)|Izzat]] is a concept of honor prevalent in the culture of North India and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="ref14fohaz"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtBi1MgVD0AC&amp;pg=PA99 |last=Cheesman |first=David |contribution=The backbone of the country|editor-last=Cheesman|editor-first=David |title=Landlord power and rural indebtedness in colonial Sind, 1865-1901 |page=99 |publisher=Curzon Press |location=Richmond, Surrey |year=1997 |isbn=9780700704705 |quote=''...

{{main|Women's health in India}}
The average female life expectancy today in India is low compared to many countries, but it has shown gradual improvement over the years. In many families, especially rural ones, girls and women face nutritional discrimination within the family, and are anaemic and malnourished.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal"/&gt; Almost half of adolescent girls are chronically malnourished.&lt;ref name="Fanta_Project"&gt;{{cite book |last=Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA) |title=India: Nutrition profile |url=http://www.fantaproject.org/sites/default/files/download/India-Nutrition-Profile-Mar2014.pdf |publisher=[[USAID]] |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, poor nutrition during pregnancy often leads to birth complications.&lt;ref name="Fanta_Project"/&gt;

The [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]] in India is the 56th highest in the world.&lt;ref name="CIA_Maternal"&gt;{{cite web |title=The World Factbook: Country Comparison: Maternal Mortality Rate |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.htmlpublisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 42% of births in the country are supervised in Medical Institution. In rural areas, most of women deliver with the help of women in the family, contradictory to the fact that the unprofessional or unskilled deliverer lacks the knowledge about pregnancy.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal"/&gt;

===Family planning===
{{Main|Family planning in India}}
The average woman living in a rural area in India has little or no control over becoming pregnant. Women, particularly in rural areas, do not have access to safe and self-controlled methods of contraception. The public health system emphasises permanent methods like sterilisation, or long-term methods like IUDs that do not need follow-up. Sterilisation accounts for more than 75% of total contraception, with female sterilisation accounting for almost 95% of all sterilisations.&lt;ref name="un_women_free_equal"/&gt; The contraceptive prevalence rate for 2007/2008 was estimated at 54.8%.&lt;ref name="CIA_India"/&gt;

===Women from lower castes===
Lower caste women in India have seen significant improvement in their status. Educated and financially well-off Dalit women used politics to achieve status, however, that many Dalit women who were involved in politics later declined due to increasing income and educational levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TgkDwAAQBAJ |title=Dalit Women: Vanguard of an Alternative Politics in India |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |author=S.

===Sex ratios===
[[File:Sex determination ban.JPG|thumb|A sign in an Indian hospital stating that prenatal sex determination is a crime.]]
India has a highly skewed sex ratio, which is attributed to sex-selective abortion and female infanticide affecting approximately one million female babies per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indian girl Infanticide-Female Fetocide: 1 million girls killed before or after birth per year |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215070213/http://rupeenews.com/2008/04/indian-girl-infanticide-female-foeticide-1-million-girls-killed-before-or-after-birth-per-year/ |archivedate=15 December 2012 |url=http://rupeenews.com/2008/04/indian-girl-infanticide-female-foeticide-1-million-girls-killed-before-or-after-birth-per-year/ |work=Rupee News |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In, 2011, government stated India was missing three million girls and there are now 48 less girls per 1,000 boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=PTI |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-loses-3-million-girls-in-infanticide/article3981575.ece |title=India loses 3 million girls in infanticide |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=9 October 2012 |accessdate=20 February 2013 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the government has taken further steps to improve the ratio, and the ratio is reported to have been improved in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ahmad |first=Faiz |title=Sex ratio in India showing improvement |url=http://www.nationalturk.com/en/sex-ratio-in-india-showing-improvement-41907 |work=National Turk |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with abortion, the high ratio of men in India is a result of sex selection, where physicians are given the opportunity to incorrectly determine the sex of a child during the ultrasound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doskoch |first=P. |title=Skewed sex ratio of births in India may be the result of sex-selective abortion |journal=[[International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|International Family Planning Perspectives]] |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=102–103 |date=June 2006 |url=https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/ipsrh/2006/06/skewed-sex-ratio-births-india-may-be-result-sex-selective-abortion |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; India currently has a problem known as the "missing women", but it has been present for quite some time. The female mortality in 2001 was 107.43.&lt;ref name="Lane, T. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=Trevor |title='''Update''': Contraceptive use around the globe / Child sex ratios continue to decline in India / Circumcision lowers risk of HIV, not other STIs / Herpes risk factors in rural Costa Rica / Fathers make a difference / Infant mortality in China rises with parity / Reproductive health among Caribbean youth / In brief |journal=[[International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|International Family Planning Perspectives]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |page=56 |date=June 2004 |url=https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/ipsrh/2004/06/update |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deaths of these "missing women" were attributed to the death history rate of women in India starting in 1901.

The gap between the two gender titles is a direct response to the gender bias within India. Men and women in India have unequal health and education rights. Male education and health are made more of a priority, so women’s death rates are increasing.&lt;ref name="Lane, T. 2004"/&gt; The argument continues that a lack of independence that women are not allowed to have is a large contributor to these fatalities. Women in India have high fertility and get married at a young age. Those who are given more opportunity and rights are more likely to live longer and contribute to the economy rather than that of a women expected to serve as wife starting at a young age and continuing the same responsibilities for the rest of her life. As women continue to "disappear," the sex ratio turns its favor toward men. In turn, this offsets reproduction and does not allow for a controlled reproductive trend. While the excess mortality of women is relatively high, it cannot be blamed completely for the unequal sex ratio in India. However, it is a large contributor considering the precedence that Indian men have over women.

===Sanitation===
{{Further|Sanitation in India}}

In rural areas, schools have been reported to have gained the improved sanitation facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Angela |title=In rural India, improved sanitation and iron supplements help girls stay in school |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/india_55555.html |publisher=[[UNICEF]] |location=India |date=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the existing socio-cultural norms and situation of sanitation in schools, girl students are forced not to relieve themselves in the open unlike boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bisoee |first=Animesh |title=School minus loo is public urinal – Girls answer natures call outside campus; slum dwellers defecate on playground |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1131214/jsp/jharkhand/story_17679434.jsp#.UyCMB87utH0 |location=Calcutta, India |work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]] |date=14 December 2013 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of facilities in home forces women to wait for the night to relieve themselves and avoid being seen by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Water, environment and sanitation |url=http://www.unicef.org/india/wes.html |publisher=UNICEF |location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to sanitation in Bihar has been discussed. According to an estimate from 2013, about 85% of the rural households in [[Bihar]] have no access to a toilet; and this creates a dangerous situation for women and girls who are followed, attacked and raped in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tewary |first=Amarnath |title=India Bihar rapes 'caused by lack of toilets' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-22460871 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=9 May 2013 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 a "Right to Pee" (as called by the media) campaign began in [[Mumbai]], India's largest city.&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite news |last=Yardley |first=Jim |title=In Mumbai, a campaign against restroom injustice |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/world/asia/in-mumbai-a-campaign-against-restroom-injustice.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 June 2012 |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, but not men, have to pay to urinate in Mumbai, despite regulations against this practice. Women have also been sexually assaulted while urinating in fields.&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt; Thus, activists have collected more than 50,000 signatures supporting their demands that the local government stop charging women to urinate, build more toilets, keep them clean, provide sanitary napkins and a trash can, and hire female attendants.&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt; In response, city officials have agreed to build hundreds of public toilets for women in Mumbai, and some local legislators are now promising to build toilets for women in every one of their districts.&lt;ref name=nytimes1/&gt;

In the most recent transition to [[Parliamentary system|democracy]] in 1992, Mongolia incorporated policies directed towards youth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Mongolian Youth Outlook Country Profile|last = Ganbat|first = Damba|date = 2012|journal =Democratic Citizenship and Voices of Asia's Youth|url= http://www.asianbarometer.org/publications//f0bdb30ebeb9c77513b4d31bfd10c4da.pdf|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mongolia became one of the first countries to ratify the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in 1990 and signed the second and third optional protocols in 2000 and 2013 respectively.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Many of Mongolia’s laws and policies attempt to protect and better the lives of Mongolian youth.The legal age of majority occurs at 18, wherein Mongolian young adults are able to vote and assume legal authority.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The [[Mongolia#Modern history|transition]] from a Soviet satellite state to a sovereign nation in 1992 fueled major structural changes in Mongolian youth lives. Access to education, employment, and health care has increased.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Education ==
The transition to a [[Market economy|market based economy]] has impacted the [[Mongolian education system]] and labor market.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The formal school system comprises pre-school, primary, secondary and higher education. Based on Soviet models, the Mongolian education system requires 10 years of schooling.The current system has a 4+4+2 structure; four years of primary education, four years of basic or incomplete secondary education, and complete secondary school for the final two years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Mongolian Constitution, Education Law, and the Law on Primary and Secondary Education dictates that eight years of compulsory education are free.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Males verse Females ===
Before 1990, education attainment was higher than the current rate. Rural and urban boys are prone to dropping out of school to obtain low skill and low wage employment. The World Health Organization found in 2007 that 8,775 school-aged children were not in school. Of these 8,775 children, 59.1% of drop-outs were boys and of this percentage 91.3% were boys from rural areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rural boys are two times more likely to receive no education at all or have below compulsory education over girls due to the need for boys to help their family herd cattle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The [[Gender Parity Index|gender parity index]] has revealed that more boys are enrolled in primary education (GPI=0.97) but more girls are enrolled in secondary (GPI=1.08) and tertiary education (GPI=1.54).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Parents are more inclined to send young girls to school in order to secure their futures whereas young boys are more likely to inherit family property by surviving in harsh working conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Urban verses Rural ===
Multiple disparities exist between educational attainment in rural and urban settings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In rural areas, 6.4% of youth receive no education, which is three times higher compared to  urban youth. The transition to a market system is the cause of higher illiteracy and drop out rates because many poor, rural households experienced economic hardships after the closure of cooperative farms.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Regional constraints affect the availability of education, most commonly in rural areas. Statistical analysis has found a high correlation rate between parents and children’s educational attainment.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Human capital]] gained and transferred from the educational level of parents is directly correlated with that of their children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Youth with vast human capital are able to move to larger aimag centers to continue their studies. Most higher secondary education and colleges are only available in large city’s like Mongolia’s capital Ulaanbaatar. 

== Labor and employment ==
[[File:Mongolia Herding Life 11.JPG|thumb|Rural young men tend to their horses before herding cattle.]]
Under the Labor Law and the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor,  Mongolian youth can legally work when they are 15 years old with parental permission, and those aged 14 can begin vocational training and employment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Labor codes dictate that the working week is 40 hours and 36 hours for those under 18.

Culturally appropriate jobs are rarely found by Mongolian youth, which translates into high youth unemployment rates in urban areas and very low productivity in rural areas. Private sector growth has been slow after the transition to capitalism, which has increased youth unemployment in urban areas and consequently many households resort to youth leaving school and taking employment in the agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The 2006 School-to-Work Transition Survey revealed that of the youth surveyed 22.8% were unemployed and were registered with the employment office. In the same survey 66.1% of youth were employed as unpaid family workers, 23.9% had paid work and 8.3% were self-employed, 0.9% had a part-time job and 0.9% were employed but absent from work.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Only one out of two jobs are wage paying jobs and are more commonly held by urban youth. Young women are more likely to be self-employed in urban areas, whereas young men are more frequently self-employed in rural locations. Gender gaps in employment opportunities are present, in which young men have a higher unemployment rate compared to female counterparts. Women at younger ages have lower unemployment rates due to higher educational attainment, and consequently higher rates of long-term unemployment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Academic training is preferred over technical education and vocational skills which has resulted in unfilled positions in trades. In total, unemployment rates were 15.3% lower for youth with vocational degrees compared to 11.6% of youth with tertiary degrees.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/mongolia_nhdr-2007-eng.pdf|title = Employment and Poverty in Mongolia|date = 2007|accessdate = October 22, 2015|website = |publisher = United Nations Development Programme|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Underage employment is common in rural communities particularly in the herding and mining sectors. Underage urban youth may work in poor working conditions generally in informal markets such as manufacturing.  In 2009 56,000 5-17 year olds were engaged in child labor, 43,000 were below the minimum working age of 15 and 13,000 15-17 year olds were involved in hazardous work.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ucw-project.org/attachment/child_labour_youth_employment_Mongolia20110627_163644.pdf|title = Understanding children's work and youth employment outcomes in Mongolia|date = July 2009|accessdate = October 22, 2015|website = |publisher = Understanding Children's Work|last = Aldobrandini|first = Villa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
Issues related to sexual and reproductive health, tobacco and alcohol usage, infectious disease and environmental related health issues are major concerns for Mongolian youth.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; All medical and hospital services are free and health care is under the control of state.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] established and supports nine adolescent-friendly clinics around Mongolia. The clinic staff is trained on the adolescent orientation package which promotes preventive messages on psychosocial, nutritional, diseases prevention and sexual aspects of health. Although the clinics were youth friendly, the clinics lacked space, were not easy to reach, and were not open during convenient times for youth to access.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The WHO 2002 reports show that 34% of youth surveyed were afraid that the health services received at these clinics were inadequate, 57.3% of the same youth surveyed reported that health care workers were inattentive to their health concerns and problems as well as giving poor services.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sexual and Reproductive Health ===
The 2008 Reproductive Health Survey revealed that 16.7% of 15-19 year olds surveyed responded that they had had sexual intercourse. 5.0% had their first sexual intercourse between 14 and 16 and 11.7% between the ages 17–19. This is in contrast to the Reproductive Health Survey of 2003, no adolescents reported having sexual intercourse for the first time between the ages of 11 and 13. The average age of first sexual intercourse for males was 16.8 and 18.9 for females.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These results were similar for youth in both rural and urban areas.

The World Health Organization surveys found that youth's knowledge about contraceptives was high while use was low. Of the 1044 youth surveyed between the ages of 15 and 19 reported that 92.7% had knowledge of any modern method, 3.7% were currently using male condoms, IUDs and pills, and 33.5% knew that contraceptives were distributed without charge. The usage of contraceptives among females who reported having sexual intercourse during the month before the survey reported that 31.8% used condoms, 56.8% of those who were never married used condoms, and 39.7% of urban females used condoms compared to 16.7% of rural females.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Legislation regarding youth sexual and reproductive health is prominent as seen by the Criminal Code of 2002 and the Health Act of 1998.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mongolia: Criminal Code of Mongolia|url = http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=183247|website = www.wipo.int|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal Code of 2002 states that sexual intercourse with a minor under the age of 16 is punishable and abortion in nonmedical conditions or abortion by a nonprofessional is punishable. According to the Health Act of 1998 "abortion performed only in medical conditions that meet requirements and by licensed medical specialists as specified in the Law" are permitable.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Tobacco and Alcohol ===
The 2010 Global School based Student Health Survey report found that 82.9% of males and 70.5% of females students age 13-15 had smoked cigarettes before the age of 14. 64.2% of those sampled in the same survey had been exposed to [[second-hand smoke]] at home. Of current youth smokers, 86.5% wanted to stop smoking while 65.3% of these same youth had received help to do so. The same survey found that 80% of youth agreed that smoking should be banned from public places. Under the new Tobacco Law of 2005, adolescents are forbidden from buying and selling tobacco. Legislation governing alcohol was amended in 2000, banning the sale of alcohol to minors under the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smoke-free.ca/warnings/warningsimages/mongolia/Mongolia-Tobacco%20Control%20Law_eng-2005.pdf|title = LAW ON TOBACCO CONTROL|date = July 1, 2005|accessdate = November 18, 2015|website = Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada|publisher =Chairman of the [[State Great Hural of Mongolia]], Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia|last = Nyamdorj|first = TS.   | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525234449/http://www.smoke-free.ca/warnings/warningsimages/mongolia/Mongolia-Tobacco%20Control%20Law_eng-2005.pdf | archivedate= May 25, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 Global School based Student Health survey and the 2000 Adolescents' Needs Assessment Survey reported 15-19 year olds had the highest mean alcohol consumption wherein urban adolescents drank twice as much alcohol as rural adolescents.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=http://countrystudies.us/mongolia/48.htm | title=Mongolia: A Country Study|chapter=  Mongolia - Health and Welfare | publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|GPO]] for the [[Library of Congress]] | year=1989 | location=Washington | editors=Robert L. Worden and Andrea Matles Savada | series=[[A Country Study]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2010 Global School based Student Health Survey revealed that 79.4% of youth had consumed alcohol once a month or less. Of the respondents aged 15–19,  70.8% of males and 86.7% of females had not drunk in the last year, which had dropped significantly since the 2005 report.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Infectious Disease ===
The World Health Organization has classified Mongolia as a low-prevalence STI country, yet the risk environment is increasing. Roughly half of the population is under the age of 23, which makes sexually active youth the most vulnerable population.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The United Nations Volunteer program, STI &amp; HIV/AIDS Prevention among Vulnerable Groups in Mongolia 2007-2009, reports that prevention and awareness methods were not tailored to target sexually active youth. The main goal of this project was to reduce [[risky sexual behavior]] and develop programs that address issues of prevention for youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UN Volunteers Mongolia|url = http://www.un-mongolia.mn/unv/unvm_unvpm.html|website = www.un-mongolia.mn|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 United Nations General Assembly Special Session reports found that over half of the adolescents reported that they felt that they did not have any risk of contracting HIV and one fourth considered themselves to be at low risk.

=== Environmental Health ===
The Systematic Review of the Impact of the Environment on Health in Mongolia revealed that poor environmental management and behaviors have increased Mongolian children's exposure to environmental risk factors and adverse health outcomes. The results from the study indicate that respiratory diseases and neurodevelopment disorders among youth are common due to significant exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution, metals, tobacco smoke and other chemical toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Impact of the Environment on Health in Mongolia A Systematic Review|url = http://aph.sagepub.com/content/27/1/45|journal = [[Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health]]|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1010-5395|pmid = 25113526|pages = 45–75|volume = 27|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/1010539514545648|first = Amarzaya|last = Jadambaa|first2 = Jeffery|last2 = Spickett|first3 = Burmaajav|last3 = Badrakh|first4 = Rosana E.|last4 = Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethnicity ==
Mongolia has been ruled by various [[Nomadic Empires of Central Asia|nomadic empires]], the [[Qing dynasty]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The blending of many cultures has influenced youth identities with their ethnicities and traditional nomadic lifestyles. The transition to a [[market economy]] has brought about rapid [[urbanization]] and a change in modern-day youth identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = When Nomads Settle The City: The Urbanization Of Mongolia|url = http://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/when-nomads-settle-the-city-the-urbanization-of-mongolia/mongolia-quot-ulan-bator-quot-urbanization-city-nomad-traffic-planning-yurt-desertification-pasture-herd/c3s9301/|website = worldcrunch.com|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEAPREGTOPURBDEV/Resources/Mongolia-Urbanisation.pdf|title = Urbanization Dynamics and Policy Frameworks in Developing East Asia|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = The World Bank|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[Demographics of Mongolia|Mongolia's demographics]] reveal that Mongol groups make up approximately 95% of the population. There are over 20 different subgroupings of Mongol ethnicities and tribal affilications.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mongolian Ethnic - Unique type of nation|url = https://www.discovermongolia.mn/blog-news-mongolia-ethnic/|website = Welcome|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest ethnic group is composed of [[Khalkha]], [[Buryats]] and [[Oirats]] Mongols. After the dissolution of Soviet control, nearly half of [[Mongolian Kazakhs]] youth and their families left Mongolia to find new sources of economic livelihood.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immobility and the re-imaginings of ethnic identity among Mongolian Kazakhs in the 21st century|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718514002735|journal = [[Geoforum]]|date = 2015-02-01|pages = 119–128|volume = 59|doi = 10.1016/j.geoforum.2014.12.007|first = Holly R.|last = Barcus|first2 = Cynthia|last2 = Werner|hdl = 1969.1/154303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these youth were traditional livestock herders and were expected to conform to gender roles; the move to Kazakhstan proved to be dismal and by 2000 over one third that migrated came back to Mongolia.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of Mongolia|url = http://mongolianembassy.us/about-mongolia/history/#.ViasZH6rTIU|website = Embassy of Mongolia|accessdate = 2015-10-21|language = English|date = 2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Harrell's book, ''Cultural Encounters on China's Ethnic Frontiers'', reveals identification with Mongol heritage differs for rural and urban youth. Pastoral rural Mongol youth identify their nomadic way of life was a basic foundation of Mongolian identity. Boundaries between non-monogols and the Han were created by rural youth through identification with the [[Mongolian language]]. Urban youth viewed and required ethnic education as a way to create a cultural space and to understand their common mythical history and family ties to the Mongolian population as a whole.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cultural Encounters on China's Ethnic Frontier|last = Harrell|first = Steven|publisher = University of Washington Press|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0295975283|location = |pages = 290–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''"Zebra" murders''' were a string of racially motivated murders that took place in [[San Francisco, California]], from October 1973 to April 1974. A group of male [[Islam in the United States#Black Muslim movements|Black Muslims]] who called themselves the "Death Angels" committed at least 15 murders and 8 attempted murders, entirely against white victims. However, some authorities believe they may have killed as many as 73, or more, victims.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=228, 238–39, 247–48, 266, 333–34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Zebra' cult killings rite?|accessdate=4 February 2016|agency=UPI|publisher=Boca Raton News|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19740502&amp;id=x8MPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FI0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3585,240941&amp;hl=en|date=May 2, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminology professor Anthony Walsh wrote that the "San Francisco–based Death Angels may have killed more people in the early to mid-1970s than all the other serial killers operating during that period combined."&lt;ref name="Walsh2005"&gt;Walsh, Anthony (2005). ''African Americans and Serial Killing in the Media: The Myth and the Reality''. Homicide Studies Vol. 9 No. 4, November 2005, pp 271-291; DOI: 10.1177/1088767905280080&lt;/ref&gt; Police named the case "Zebra" after the special police radio band they assigned for the investigation.

In 1974, four men — Manuel Moore, Larry Green, Jessie Lee Cooks, and J.C.X. Simon — were arrested in connection with the case. They were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges and sentenced to life imprisonment.

==First wave of murders, 1973==
On October 19, 1973, Richard Hague, 30, and his wife, Quita, 28, were strolling near their [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]] home when they were kidnapped by a group of black men and forced into a van. Quita was fondled by two men, and then nearly decapitated by a third with a [[machete]]. One of the men who had fondled Quita then similarly hacked Richard, and left him for dead, but he survived.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=65–68}}

Ten days later, on October 29, Frances Rose, 28, was repeatedly shot by a man who blocked her car's path and demanded a ride, as she was driving up to the entrance gate of the [[University_of_California#UC_Extension|University of California Extension]].{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=34–35}}{{sfn|Talbot|2012|pp=211–12}}

On November 9, a 26-year-old [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric|gas company]] clerk, Robert Stoeckmann, was assaulted by another man, but was able to take the gun away and fire back. The attacker, Leroy Doctor, was later arrested and convicted of assault with a deadly weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Review of the News, Volume 10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XoTxAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Correction, Please|date=1974-05-01|pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saleem "Sammy" Erakat, a 53-year-old Jordanian Arab Muslim, was bound and shot dead in the restroom of his grocery store on November 25.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=81–88}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=West's California reporter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWA0AAAAIAAJ|date=1983-01-01|pages=260–62|volume=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, Paul Dancik, a 26-year-old artist, was shot three times in the chest by a man as he was preparing to make a telephone call at a payphone.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=103–06}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=West's California reporter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWA0AAAAIAAJ|date=1983-01-01|page=242|volume=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, on the evening of December 13, future San Francisco mayor [[Art Agnos]], then a member of the California Commission on Aging, was attending a meeting in [[Potrero Hill, San Francisco, California|Potrero Hill]]. Agnos, 35, was in the largely black neighborhood to discuss building a government-funded health clinic in the area. After the meeting ended, Agnos was talking to two women curbside when a man shot him twice in the back.&lt;ref&gt;Ch.4 KRON-TV interview with Art Agnos from January 31st 1974, in which Agnos describes being shot twice in the back: https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/230792&lt;/ref&gt; Agnos was seriously injured, but survived.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=119–23}}{{sfn|Talbot|2012|pp=204–06}}

During the same evening, Marietta DiGirolamo, 31, was walking along Divisadero Street when she was shoved into a doorway by a man and shot twice in the chest. The shots spun her around and struck her once in the back, killing her.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=123–27}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reports of Cases Determined in the Courts of Appeal of the State of California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vNHAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Bancroft-Whitney|date=1983-01-01|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, "Angela Roselli" (not her real name), a 20-year-old college student, was shot three times near her apartment by one of two men. She survived, although one bullet nicked her spine.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=140–46}}

An 81-year-old janitor, Ilario Bertuccio, was shot that same evening while walking on his way home from work in the [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bay View]] district. He died almost instantly after four shots to the shoulder and chest.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=138–41}}

On December 22, two more victims died within six minutes of each other. Neal Moynihan, 19, was killed while walking near the Civic Center while shopping. A man had walked in front of him, and shot him in the face, neck, and heart.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=153–55}} The killer (or perhaps a different killer, per authors Cohen and Sanders) then chased down 50-year-old Mildred Hosler as she was heading to her bus stop, and also shot her four times.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=156–59}}

On December 24, an unidentified [[John Doe]] victim was killed.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=166, 173–74, 180–01}}{{sfn|Talbot|2012|pp=213–14}}

===Reaction===
The murders caused widespread panic in San Francisco. People attempted to find safety in numbers whenever they went out or, as much as possible, avoided going out at night.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=231–32}} In reaction, an increased police presence was ordered throughout the city. The police were baffled by the apparent lack of motive in the killings. Brutality and an apparent lack of remorse on the part of the gunmen marked the attacks.

Based on what was initially known about the killings, there was a common pattern. In a hit-and-run shooting, the gunman would walk up to his victim, shoot the victim repeatedly at close range, and flee on foot. Another link to the shootings was the killers' preference for a .32-caliber pistol, based on the slugs recovered from the victims and the shell casings found at the crime scenes.{{sfn|Howard|1979|p=235}}

As a result, a special task force was formed to try to solve and stop the murders, led by Detectives Gus Coreris and John Fotinos. San Francisco Police Chief Donald Scott assigned the "Z" police radio frequency for their exclusive use. Since the letter "Z" is known in common [[Spelling alphabet|phonetic]] use as "Zebra", the group became known as the Zebra task force, and the murders became known as the Zebra murders.{{sfn|Howard|1979|p=233}}

==Second wave of murders, 1974==
The killings resumed on January 29, 1974, with five more shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=January 30, 1974 |title=4 Whites Killed by Roving Gunmen – At Least One Other Injured in San Francisco Area |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/01/30/91432747.html?pageNumber=69 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=69 |agency=UPI |location= |publisher= |accessdate=September 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tana Smith, 32, was shot while walking to a fabric store. Vincent Wollin, 69, was shot while walking home. John Bambic, 84, was shot while collecting discarded bottles and cans. Jane Holly, a 45-year-old housewife, was gunned down while doing her laundry in a laundromat, and Roxanne McMillian, 23, was shot while carrying items from her car to her new apartment. Of these, only McMillian survived, although she would need to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=192–226}} A sixth victim who was shot that night, Thomas Bates, a hitchhiker who survived being shot three times near [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], had earlier been mentioned by author Howard, but not counted by him in that night's totals.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=238}}{{sfn|Peele|2012|pp=150–52}}

On April 1, 1974, two [[Salvation Army]] cadets were walking toward the Mayfair Market just two blocks away from the Salvation Army School for Officers' Training Center when a black man who was following them overtook them, wheeled around, fired four shots at them, and fled. Thomas Rainwater, 19, died; Linda Story, 21, survived. Two policemen were on the scene within 15 seconds, and although a manhunt was initiated in an effort to find the killer, it proved to be futile. They suspected that the Zebra killers had struck again, as the [[shell casing]]s found on the sidewalk were found to be from a .32-caliber gun.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=287–92}}

On [[Easter Sunday]], 13 days after the Rainwater-Story shootings, two more people, Ward Anderson, a merchant seaman, and Terry White, a 15-year-old student, were both shot and wounded as they stood at a bus stop at the corner of Fillmore and Hayes Streets; their attacker was a black man who approached the corner on foot and then fled after firing.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=307–12}}

On the evening of April 16, 23-year-old Nelson T. Shields IV, heir to a wealthy [[Du Pont]] executive, accompanied a friend to a house on Vernon Street in the [[Ingleside (San Francisco)|Ingleside]] district to pick up a rug.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=326–30}} Shields had opened the back of the station wagon and was making room in the cargo area for the rug when he was shot repeatedly. A witness later testified that she saw a black man rushing up Vernon Street at the time of the shooting. The police suspected it was another Zebra murder, due to the shell casings found at the scene matching a .32-caliber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911212,00.html|title=Fear in the Streets of San Francisco|date=1974-04-29|work=Time|accessdate=August 28, 2006|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5bezpRhy4?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911212,00.html|archivedate=October 18, 2008|deadurl=no|subscription=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheeres"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/zebra_murders/index.html|title=The Zebra Killers|last=Scheeres|first=Julia|publisher=Crime Library|accessdate=2006-08-28|work=Machete Attack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===
The new wave of murders brought the city to a state of shock as people took the same precautions as they had when the first wave took place. The city took a beating economically as tourists stayed away. Streets were deserted at night, even in [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], a neighborhood known to have a seven-nights-a-week nightlife.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=347–48}}

Police decided to take drastic measures. Inspector Gus Coreris dictated generic suspect descriptions with the best-known characteristics of the killers to SFPD sketch artist Hobart "Hoby" Nelson, who drew two sketches based on the descriptions.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=324–25}} The sketches were then distributed to the media and to SFPD officers, none of whom knew the sketches were generic.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

San Francisco Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] and Police Chief Donald Scott announced that police officers would begin stopping and questioning "large numbers of black citizens" who resembled the description of the killer: a black man with a short [[Afro]] and a narrow chin. Once stopped, checked, and cleared, each citizen received a specially printed ''Zebra Check'' card from the officer(s) that they could show to police if stopped again.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=339–41}} More than 500 black men were stopped by the first weekend the program was in operation.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=345}}

This provoked vocal and widespread criticism from the black community. Dr. Washington Garner, the first black member of the Police Commission, called for blacks to be understanding of the exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders &amp; Cohen, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; The policy faced internal criticism, with the Officers For Justice group led by Nation of Islam associate Jesse Byrd viewing it as "racist and unproductive".&lt;ref&gt;Sanders &amp; Cohen, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Acting on a lawsuit filed by the [[NAACP]] and the [[ACLU]], U.S. District Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli ruled the [[racial profiling|widespread profiling]] of blacks was unconstitutional, and the operation was suspended.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=348}}

==Arrests and convictions==
With the offer of a $30,000 reward came a break in the Zebra case.&lt;ref name="Zebra killer denied parole"&gt;[http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2013/03/13/zebra-killer-denied-parole Zebra killer denied parole], Sfgate.com, March 13, 2013; accessed March 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Harris, an employee at the Black Self-Help Moving and Storage, called police a week after the sketches had been posted and subsequently agreed to meet with Zebra case detectives at a bank parking lot in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=347–48}} Harris claimed to be one of the persons featured in the police sketches, and provided specific details regarding several of the attacks that the police never had released to the public. Harris denied he had committed any killings, but admitted he had been present at many of them.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=349–59}}

Harris revealed the existence of the group to the police, and told them of a homicide that did not make the papers; it was that of a homeless man ("John Doe #169") whom they had kidnapped from [[Ghirardelli Square]]. They had brought the man to Black Self-Help Moving's warehouse, gagged and tied him up, and while he was still conscious, took turns hacking away his limbs. Harris told the detectives that they had dumped the body into [[San Francisco Bay|the bay]]. He told his story in such detail that the police were convinced of its veracity, especially since the police had, on the previous December 24, recovered the bound and badly butchered torso of a male, missing its hands, feet and head, that had washed up in the city's [[Ocean Beach, San Francisco, California|Ocean Beach]] district at the foot of Pacheco Street.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=166, 173–74, 180–01, 354–55}} Harris provided the police with names, dates, addresses and details — enough information to issue arrest warrants against the suspects. Harris subsequently sought, and received, immunity for his help in breaking the Zebra case, as well as new identities for himself, his girlfriend, and her child.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=349–59}}

On May 1, 1974, simultaneous raids during the pre-dawn hours were made, resulting in the arrests of Larry Craig Green and J.C.X. Simon in an apartment building at 844 Grove Street. More suspects were arrested at Black Self-Help Moving &amp; Storage's facility. None offered resistance when arrested.{{sfn|Howard|1979|pp=368–71}} Of the seven arrested that day, four were released for lack of evidence.

Mayor Alioto announced the news of the raids and announced that the killings were perpetrated by the Death Angels. [[Islam in the United States#Black Muslim movements|Black Muslim]] leader John Muhammad, the minister of Mosque #26 in San Francisco, denied the allegations of a Black Muslim conspiracy to kill whites. The [[Nation of Islam]] paid for attorneys for all of the perpetrators convicted, except for Jessie Lee Cooks, who had pleaded guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scheeres|first1=Julia|title=The Zebra Killers|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/zebra_murders/15.html|publisher=CrimeLibrary|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===
The trial started on March 3, 1975. Efforts by the defense to discredit Harris were unsuccessful, and he revealed many grisly details over 12 days of testimony. In addition, the Zebra team presented evidence of a .32 caliber [[Beretta]] automatic pistol that was recovered from the backyard of a home near the scene of the last murder. They were able to demonstrate the chain of ownership of the gun to one of the workers at Black Self-Help, and that the gun had been used in many of the murders.

Based upon the testimony of 108 witnesses (including Harris), 8,000 pages totaling 3.5 million words worth of transcripts, and culminating in what was then the longest criminal trial in California history, Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, Manuel Moore, and Jessie Lee Cooks were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder after an 18-hour deliberation by the jury in 1976. Each was sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Zebra killer denied parole"/&gt;

===Aftermath===
On March 12, 2015, J.C.X. Simon (aged 69), was found unresponsive in his cell at [[San Quentin Prison]], where he had been serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole since 1976. He was declared dead of unknown causes, pending an autopsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/zebra-killer-jcx-simon-found-dead-in-san-quentin-prison-cell/ar-AA9K1Xc|title='Zebra Killer' J.C.X.
