'''Authenticity''' is a concept in [[psychology]] (in particular [[Existential psychotherapy|existential psychiatry]]) as well as [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]] and [[aesthetics]] (in regard to various arts and musical genres). In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which an individual's actions are congruent with their beliefs and desires, despite external pressures; the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces, pressures, and influences which are very different from, and other than, itself. A lack of authenticity is considered in existentialism to be ''[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authenticity/ Authenticity (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The call of authenticity resonates with the famous instruction by the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]], “[[Know thyself]].” But authenticity extends this message: "Don’t merely know thyself – be thyself."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself!

Views of authenticity in cultural activities vary widely. For instance, the philosophers [[Jean Paul Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] had opposing views regarding jazz, with Sartre considering it authentic and Adorno inauthentic. The concept of authenticity is often aired in  musical subcultures, such as [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], where a purported lack of authenticity is commonly labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |title=Homeward Bound.

==Theories==

===Existentialism===
One of the greatest problems facing such abstract approaches is that the drives people call the "needs of one's inner being" are diffuse, subjective, and often culture-bound. For this reason among others, authenticity is often "at the limits" of language; it is described as the negative space around inauthenticity, with reference to examples of inauthentic living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Jacob | title = In Search of Authenticity | publisher = Routledge | year = 1995 | location = London and New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-11946-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's novels are perhaps the easiest access to this mode of describing authenticity: they often contain characters and [[antihero]]es who base their actions on external pressures—the pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person, the pressure to adopt a particular mode of living, the pressure to ignore one's own moral and aesthetic objections in order to have a more comfortable existence. His work also includes characters who do not understand their own reasons for acting, or who ignore crucial facts about their own lives in order to avoid uncomfortable truths; this connects his work with the philosophical tradition.

Sartre is concerned also with the "[[vertiginous]]" experience of absolute freedom. In Sartre's view, this experience, necessary for the state of authenticity, can be so unpleasant that it leads people to inauthentic ways of living. Typically, authenticity is seen as a very general concept, not attached to any particular political or aesthetic ideology. This is a necessary aspect of authenticity: because it concerns a person's ''relation'' with the world, it cannot be arrived at by simply repeating a set of actions or taking up a set of positions. In this manner, authenticity is connected with creativity: the impetus to action must arise from the person in question, and not be externally imposed. Heidegger takes this notion to the extreme, by speaking in very abstract terms about modes of living (his terminology was adopted and simplified by Sartre in his philosophical works). Kierkegaard's work (e.g. "Panegyric Upon Abraham" from ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'') often focuses on biblical stories which are not directly imitable. Sartre, as has been noted above, focused on inauthentic existence as a way to avoid the paradoxical problem of appearing to provide prescriptions for a mode of living that rejects external dictation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2= Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authenticity, according to Kierkegaard, is reliant on an individual finding authentic faith and becoming true to oneself. Kierkegaard develops the idea that news media and the bourgeois church-Christianity present challenges for an individual in society trying to live authentically. Kierkegaard thus sees “both the media and the church as intervening agencies, blocking people’s way to true experiences, authenticity, and God. “&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Kristoffer Holt, “Authentic Journalism? A Critical Discussion about Existential Authenticity in Journalism Ethics,” Journal of Mass Media Ethics 27 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction lies with the idea that mass-culture creates a loss of individual significance, which he refers to as “levelling.” Kierkegaard views the media as supporting a society that does not form its own opinions but utilizes the opinions constructed by the news. Similarly, he interprets religion as a tradition that is passively accepted by individuals, without the inclusion of authentic thought. Kierkegaard believes that authentic faith can be achieved by “facing reality, making a choice and then passionately sticking with it.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The goal of Kierkegaard's existentialist philosophy is to show that, in order to achieve authenticity, one must face reality and form his own opinions of existence. So as not to be discouraged by levelling, Kierkegaard suggests, “One must make an active choice to surrender to something that goes beyond comprehension, a leap of faith into the religious.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Even if one does not want to put forth the effort of developing his own views, he must do so in the quest for authentic faith.

Nietzsche's view of authenticity is an atheist interpretation of Kierkegaard. He rejects the role of religion in finding authenticity because he believes in finding truth without the use of virtues. Nietzsche believes of the authentic man as the following: Someone who elevates himself over others in order to transcend the limits of conventional morality in an attempt to decide for oneself about [[good and evil]], without regard for the virtues “on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Nietzsche, F.W., &amp; Zimmern, H. (1997). Beyond good and evil: Prelude to a philosophy of the future. Mineola, NY: Dover.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche rejects the idea of religious virtues due to the lack of questioning by the individual. One must avoid what he calls “herding animal morality,”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; if he is to find authenticity. To “stand alone” and avoid religiously constructed principles, it is essential to be “strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvaluate and invert ‘eternal valuations.’”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; One must be a free thinker and theorize views outside of their predilections. The commonality of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche’s existential philosophies is “the responsibilities they place on the individual to take active part in the shaping of one’s beliefs and then to be willing to act on that belief.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; For Nietzsche, the secular mentality is a form of weakness and, for authenticity to be achieved, one must truly transcend conventional morality.

According to Abulof, authenticity's calling – being true to oneself – deceivingly conceals the deep chasms between two divergent interpretations of the "self": essentialist and existentialist. Essentialist authenticity demands we find and follow our preordained destiny, our inborn core. Conversely, existentialist authenticity prescribes “determine your destiny!” urging people to become aware of their freedom to choose their own path, which may, but need not, join that of others. While essentialists search for signs of self-betrayals, existentialists defiantly ask, “How am I not myself?” and answer: only when I forget my freedom, and surrender to “bad faith.” Otherwise, my choices – whatever they might be – constitute me.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=530–532|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existential journalism====
[[List of existentialists|Existential philosophers]] like [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Heidegger]] investigate the existential-ontological significance of societally constructed norms to decipher authenticity. For an existential journalist, this aversion to, and turning away from, an unquestioning acceptance of norms contributes to the production of an authentic work. [[J. C. Merrill|Merrill]] believes that authentic journalism can exist if the journalist is true to one's self and rejects conformism. There are traditions that exist in media and news outlets that prevent journalists from achieving authenticity. Like Kierkegaard's view of media and church, Merrill believes that journalists are “gladly sacrificing individual authenticity to adapt nicely to the highly regimented, [[depersonalized]] corporate structure.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"&gt;Merril, J.C. (1995). Existential Journalism (rev. ed.) Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are restricted by “institutional red tape” and, thus, cannot achieve authenticity. It is beneficial for journalists to adhere to the “red tape” because their work will be published.

Actively shaping one's own belief and then acting upon that belief is a laborious task. A journalist that hesitates in writing a story because it is not within the norm is unable to achieve authenticity because of the notion that following the norm is more valuable than being authentic. The contention is, however, that “individual freedom and courage to act is more valuable than collective adherence to journalistic codes of conduct.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As journalists make conscious decisions to write authentically, they are able to contribute more value in their work. The consequence of authentic writing is positive and ensures that the journalist, according to Merrill, “grows, matures, creates himself, and projects himself into the future.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;

====Criticisms====
Philosopher [[Jacob Golomb]] argues that the existentialist notion of authenticity is incompatible with a morality that values all persons.&lt;ref&gt;Golomb, Jacob (1995). ''In Search of Authenticity: From Kierkegaard to Camus''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erich Fromm===
A very different definition of authenticity was proposed by [[Erich Fromm]]&lt;ref&gt;Fromm. E., Escape from Freedom, Farrar &amp; Rinehart 1941 (also published as "Fear of Freedom" Routledge UK 1942)&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1900s. He considered behavior of any kind, even that wholly in accord with societal mores, to be authentic if it results from personal understanding and approval of its drives and origins, rather than merely from conformity with the received wisdom of the society.  Thus a Frommean authentic may behave consistently in a manner that accords with cultural norms, for the reason that those norms appear on consideration to be appropriate, rather than simply in the interest of conforming with current norms. Fromm thus considers authenticity to be a positive outcome of enlightened and informed motivation rather than a negative outcome of rejection of the expectations of others. He described the latter condition – the drive primarily to escape external restraints typified by the "absolute freedom" of Sartre – as "the illusion of individuality",&lt;ref&gt;Fromm E., Fear of Freedom, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the genuine individuality that results from authentic living.

===Other perspectives===
Those who advocate [[Reform movement|social reform]] value the study of authenticity since it can provide a radical manifesto and an overview of the shortcomings of social structures. Michael Kernis and Brian Goldman defined authenticity as "the unimpeded operation of one's true or core self in one's daily enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Karen (May 01, 2008). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200804/dare-be-yourself "Dare to be yourself"]. ''Psychology Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While authenticity may be a goal intrinsic to "the good life," it is often a difficult state to actually achieve, due in part to social pressures to live inauthentically and in part to a person's own character. It is also described as a revelatory state, where one perceives oneself, other people, and sometimes even things, in a radically new way. Some writers argue that authenticity also requires self-knowledge, and that it alters a person's relationships with other people. Authenticity also carries with it its own set of moral obligations, which often exist regardless of race, gender and class. The notion of authenticity also fits into [[utopia]]n ideology, which requires authenticity among its citizens to exist, or which claims that such a condition would remove physical and economic barriers to pursuing authenticity.

==History==
Secular and religious notions of authenticity have coexisted for centuries under different guises; perhaps the earliest account of authenticity that remains popular is [[Socrates]]' admonition that "the unexamined life is not worth living". In aesthetics, "[[Authenticity in art|authenticity]]" describes the perception of art as faithful to the artist's self, rather than conforming to external values such as historical tradition, or commercial worth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} A common definition of "authenticity" in [[psychology]] refers to the attempt to live one's life according to the needs of one's inner being, rather than the demands of society or one's early conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A. M., Linley, P. A., Maltby, J., Baliousis, M., Joseph, S. (2008) [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/Authenticity%20Scale.pdf The authentic personality: "A theoretical and empirical conceptualization, and the development of the Authenticity Scale"]. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'' '''55''' (3): 385–399. {{doi|10.1037/0022-0167.55.3.385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://psych.athabascau.ca/html/Glossary/demo_glossary.cgi?mode=history&amp;term_id=1196 Authentic life]. Psychology Centre Athabasca University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://castle.eiu.edu/~psych/spencer/Existential.html "Existential Psychology"]. Eastern Illinois University. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603121545/http://castle.eiu.edu/~psych/spencer/Existential.html |date=June 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for authenticity is a hallmark of romantic modernity. Romanticists since the late 18th century prescribed intuition, emotion and a return to nature as a necessary corrective, even an antidote, to Enlightenment's “cold” reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935280039|title=Creative Imagination.|last=James.|first=Engell,|date=1980|publisher=HUP|isbn=9780674333253|location=Cambridge|oclc=935280039}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, Anglo-American discussions of authenticity often center around the writings of a few key figures associated with [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]], where the term originated; because most of these writers wrote in languages other than English, the process of translating and anthologizing has had a strong impact on the debate. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] might be credited with creating a "canon" of existentialist writers which include [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. For these writers, the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces and influences which are very different from itself; authenticity is one way in which the self acts and changes in response to these pressures.

The call of, and for, authenticity - "be theyself!" - has pervaded modern thought and culture. A [https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=be+yourself&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2018&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbe%20yourself%3B%2Cc0 Google ngram (1800-2008)] indicates the dramatic rise, since the 1960s, in relative frequency of this modern command: "in books, Hollywood films, commercials, and daily conversations, we advise, even order: be yourself!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cultural activities==
Due to different groups' and individual's different experiences, views of authenticity regarding cultural activities vary widely and often differ between groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini (2010). "Semiotic and semantic implications of "authenticity"". ''Psychological Reports'' '''106''' (2): 611–612.&lt;/ref&gt; For Sartre, [[jazz]] music was a representation of freedom; this may have been in part because jazz was associated with [[African American]] culture, and was thus in opposition to Western culture generally, which Sartre considered hopelessly inauthentic. [[Theodor Adorno]], however, another writer and philosopher concerned with the notion of authenticity, despised jazz music because he saw it as a false representation that could give the appearance of authenticity but that was as much bound up in concerns with appearance and audience as many other forms of art. Heidegger in his later life associated authenticity with non-technological modes of existence, seeing technology as distorting a more "authentic" relationship with the natural world.

Some writers on authenticity in the twentieth century considered the predominant [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]] to be inauthentic; not only because they were seen as forced on people, but also because, in themselves, they required people to behave inauthentically towards their own desires, obscuring true reasons for acting. [[Advertising]], in as much as it attempted to give people a reason for doing something that they did not already possess, was a "textbook" example of how Western culture distorted the individual for external reasons. Race relations are seen as another limit on authenticity, as they demand that the self engage with others on the basis of external attributes. An early example of the connection between inauthenticity and capitalism was made by [[Karl Marx]], whose notion of "[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]" can be linked to the later discourse on the nature of inauthenticity.
[[File:Das musste ja so kommen..!.jpg|thumb|150px|The punk subculture classifies members as "poseurs" if they are deemed to not understand or respect the subculture's values.]]
Individuals concerned with living authentically have often led unusual lives that opposed cultural norms; the rise of the [[counter-culture]] in the 1960s in Europe and America was seen by many as a new opportunity to live an authentic existence. Many, however, have pointed out that [[anti-authoritarianism]] and eccentricity does not necessarily constitute an authentic state of being. The connection of the violation of cultural norms to authenticity, however, is strong and real{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and continues today: among artists who explicitly violate the conventions of their profession, for example. The connection of inauthenticity to [[capitalism]] is contained in the notion of "[[selling out]]," used to describe an artist whose work has become inauthentic after achieving commercial success and thus becoming to an extent integrated into an inauthentic system.

Australian author [[Helen Demidenko]]'s novel ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'' promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature. The novel is about a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of [[Stalinist purges]] and state-imposed poverty and famine. When the media discovered Helen Dale's identity and legal name, this created debate in Australia's literary community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Susanna|last=Egan|title=The Company She Keeps: Demidenko and the problems of imposture in autobiography|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=October 2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_4_21/ai_n29152127/|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken|last=Stewart|title=Those infernal pictures: reading Helen Darville, her novel and her critics|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=May 1997|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_n1_v18/ai_n28692326/?tag=content;col1|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
{{See also|Rockism|Punk ideologies}}

The concept of authenticity is often raised in the [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musical subcultures, in which people or bands are criticized for their purported lack of authenticity by being labeled with the epithet "[[poseur]]".&lt;ref name="indiecult2006"/&gt; "Poseur" is used to refer to a person (or band) who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture. "The code of authenticity, which is central to the [[heavy metal subculture]], is demonstrated in many ways", such as through clothing, the use of an emotional singing voice and having serious themes in the songs.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Deena. ''Heavy Metal:The Music and its Subculture." Da Capo Press, 2009. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In metal, one study of how fans sought out authenticity within the metal scene noted three elements to authenticity: long-term dedication to the scene; knowing key events of metal culture; and making the right choices based on one's authentic inner voice.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Susanna. "I Bang My Head, Therefore I Am: Constructing Individual and Social Authenticity in the Heavy Metal Subculture" in ''Young.'' 21 (1). 2013. p. 95-110&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Black metal]], an [[extreme metal]] genre, sincerity, authenticity and extremity are valued above all else."{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} In the metal and hardcore punk subcultures, a band that began from a working class milieu that later signs to a major record label for a lucrative recording contract may be deemed to have "[[sell out|sold out]]" and lost their authenticity. In addition to the focus on authenticity in "...punk, [[house music|house]], grunge, garage, and hip-hop," ideas of authenticity have seeped into many other genres, including those considered by some to be less "authentic" than the aforementioned.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

{{Culture of Bhutan}}
'''Bhutanese art''' is similar to [[Tibetan art]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] and its pantheon of teachers and divine beings.

The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are the [[Drukpa Lineage]] and the [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu]] school and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment).  The Nyingma school is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]] ("Guru Rinpoche"), who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century.  According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find.  [[Tertön]]s are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.

Each divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.

Bhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan because the technique of making them was originally imported from that region of Tibet. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms.  Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered.  In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.

The arts and crafts of Bhutan that represents the exclusive "spirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom" is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the “thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan”; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the [[Folk Heritage Museum]] in Thimphu. There is also a Voluntary Artists Studio in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu. The thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan and the institutions established in Thimphu to promote these art forms are:&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"&gt;Brown, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arts&gt;{{Cite web|title= Bhutan:Arts &amp; Crafts|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/about-bhutan/arts-crafts|accessdate=2010-06-07|publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan:Government of Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional Bhutanese arts==
[[File:Ss460-319-070-Buddha2-1.jpg|thumb|Clay statue before painting]]
[[File:Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche, 8th century) LACMA AC1994.117.2.jpg|thumb|[[Padmasambhava]] or "Guru Rinpoche", 8th century]]

In Bhutan, the traditional arts are known as ''zorig chusum'' (''zo'' = the ability to make; ''rig'' = science or craft; ''chusum'' = thirteen).  These practices have been gradually developed through the centuries, often passed down through families with long-standing relations to a particular craft.  These traditional crafts represent hundreds of years of knowledge and ability that has been passed down through generations.
 
The great 15th century tertön, [[Pema Lingpa]] is traditionally credited with introducing the arts into Bhutan. In 1680, [[Ngawang Namgyal]], the [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]], ordered the establishment of the school for instruction in the thirteen traditional arts.  Although the skills existed much earlier, it is believed that the ''zorig chusum'' was first formally categorized during the rule of [[Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye]] (1680-1694), the 4th [[Druk Desi]] (secular ruler).  The thirteen traditional arts are:

* ''Dezo'' - Paper Making: Handmade paper made mainly from the [[Daphne (plant)|''Daphne'' plant]] and gum from a [[Combretum indicum|creeper root]]. 
* ''Dozo'' - Stonework: Stone arts used in the construction of stone pools and the outer walls of [[Dzong architecture|dzongs]], [[gompa]]s, [[stupa]]s and some other buildings.
* ''Garzo'' - Blacksmithing: The manufacture of iron goods, such as farm tools, knives, swords, and utensils. 
* ''Jinzo'' - Clay arts: The making of religious statues and ritual objects, pottery and the construction of buildings using mortar, plaster, and rammed earth. 
* ''Lhazo'' - Painting: From the images on [[thangka]]s, walls paintings, and statues to the decorations on furniture and window-frames. 
* ''Lugzo'' - Bronze casting: Production of bronze roof-crests, statues, bells, and ritual instruments, in addition to jewelry and household items using sand casting and [[lost-wax casting]].  Larger statues are made by [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]].
* ''Parzo'' - Wood, slate, and stone carving: In wood, slate or stone, for making such items as printing blocks for religious texts, masks, furniture, altars, and the slate images adorning many shrines and altars. 
* ''Shagzo'' - Woodturning: Making a variety of bowls, plates, cups, and other containers. 
* ''Shingzo'' - Woodworking: Employed in the construction of dzongs and gompas 
* ''Thagzo'' - Weaving: The production of some of the most intricately woven fabrics produced in Asia. 
* ''Trözo'' - Silver- and gold-smithing: Working in gold, silver, and copper to make jewelry, ritual objects, and utilitarian household items. 
* ''Tshazo'' - Cane and bamboo work: The production of such varied items as bows and arrows, baskets, drinks containers, utensils, musical instruments, fences, and mats. 
* ''Tshemazo'' – Needlework: Working with needle and thread to make clothes, boots, or the most intricate of [[appliqué]] thangkas.

==Characteristics of Bhutanese arts==
[[File:Bhutanese painted thanka of Milarepa (1052-1135), Late 19th-early 20th Century, Dhodeydrag Gonpa, Thimphu, Bhutan.jpg|thumb|Painted [[thangka]] of [[Milarepa]] (1052-1135), late 19th-early 20th century, Dhodeydrag Gonpa, [[Thimphu]].]]
Articles for everyday use are still fashioned today as they were centuries ago.  Traditional artisanship is handed down from generation to generation.  Bhutan's artisans are skilled workers in metals, wood and slate carving, and clay sculpture.  Artifacts made of wood include bowls and dishes, some lined with silver.  Elegant yet strong woven bamboo baskets, mats, hats, and quivers find both functional and decorative usage.  Handmade paper is prepared from tree bark by a process passed down the ages.

Each region has its specialties: raw silk comes from eastern Bhutan, brocade from Lhuntshi (Kurtoe), woolen goods from [[Bumthang District|Bumthang]], bamboo wares from [[Kheng, Bhutan|Kheng]], woodwork from Tashi Yangtse, gold and silver work from [[Thimphu]], and yak-hair products from the north or the [[Black Mountains (Bhutan)|Black Mountains]].

Most Bhutanese art objects are produced for use of the Bhutanese themselves.  Except for goldsmiths, silversmiths, and painters, artisans are peasants who produce these articles and fabrics in their spare time, with the surplus production being sold.  Most products, particularly fabrics, are relatively expensive.  In the highest qualities, every step of production is performed by hand, from dyeing hanks of thread or hacking down bamboo in the forest, to weaving or braiding the final product.  

The time spent in producing handicrafts is considerable and can involve as much as two years for some woven textiles.  At the same time, many modern innovations are also used for less expensive items, especially modern dyes, and yarns - Bhutan must be one of the few places where hand-woven [[polyester]] garments can be bought.

; Textiles
Bhutanese textiles are a unique art form inspired by nature made in the form of clothing, crafts and different types of pots in eye-catching blend of colour, texture, pattern and composition. This art form is witnessed all over Bhutan and in Thimphu in the daily life of its people. It is also a significant cultural exchange garment that is gifted to mark occasions of birth and death, auspicious functions such as weddings and professional achievements and in greeting dignitaries. Each region has its own special designs of textiles, either made of vegetable dyed wool known as ''yathra'' or pure silk called ''Kishuthara''. It is the women, belonging to a small community, who weave these textiles as a household handicrafts heritage.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

; Paintings
Most Bhutanese art, including ‘Painting in Bhutanese art’, known as ''lhazo'', is invariably religion centric. These are made by artists without inscribing their names on them. The paintings encompass various types including the traditional [[thangkas]], which are scroll paintings made in “highly stylised and strict geometric proportions” of [[Buddhist iconography]] that are made with mineral paints. Most houses in Bhutan have religious and other symbolic motifs painted inside their houses and also on the external walls.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

; Sculptures
The art of making religious sculptures is unique in Bhutan and hence very popular in the Himalayan region. The basic material used for making the sculptures is clay, which is known as ''jinzob''. The clay statues of Buddhist religious icons, made by well-known artists of Bhutan, embellish various monasteries in Bhutan. This art form of sculpture is taught to students by professional artists at the Institute of Zorig Chosum in Thimphu.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

; Paper making
Handmade paper known as ''deysho'' is in popular usage in Bhutan and it is durable and insect resistant. The basic material used is the bark of the [[Daphne plant]]. This paper is used for printing religious texts; traditional books are printed on this paper. It is also used for packaging gifts. Apart from handmade paper, paper factories in Bhutan also produce ornamental art paper with designs of flower petals, and leaves, and other materials. For use on special occasions, vegetable dyed paper is also made.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

; Wood carving
[[File:Slate carving, School of Traditional Arts, Thimphu.jpg|thumb|upright|Slate carving, School of Traditional Arts.]]
Wood carving known as ''Parzo'' is a specialised and ancient art form, which is significantly blended with modern buildings in the resurgent Bhutan. Carved wood blocks are used for printing religious prayer flags that are seen all over Bhutan in front of monasteries, on hill ridges and other religious places. Carving is also done on slate and stone. The wood that is used for carving is seasoned for at least one year prior to carving.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;
[[File:Hand woven Bhutanese fabrics, Bumthang.jpg|thumb|Contemporary hand woven Bhutanese fabrics, [[Bumthang District]]]]

; Sword making
The art of sword making falls under the tradition of ''garzo'' (or blacksmithing), an art form that is used to make all metal implements such as swords, knives, chains, darts and so forth. Ceremonial swords are made and gifted to people who are honoured for their achievements. These swords are to be sported by men on all special occasions. Children, wear a traditional short knife known as the ''dudzom''. [[Terton]] Pema Lingpa, a religious treasure hunter from central Bhutan, was the most famous sword maker in Bhutan.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

;Boot Making
It is not uncommon to see Bhutan’s traditional boots made of cloth. The cloth is hand stitched, embroidered and appliquéd with Bhutanese motifs. They are worn on ceremonial occasions (mandatory); the colours used on the boot denote the rank and status of the person wearing it. In the pecking order, Ministers wear orange, senior officials wear red and the common people wear white boots. This art form has been revived at the Institute of Zorig Chosum in Thimphu. Women also wear boots but of shorter length reaching just above the ankle.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

; Bamboo Craft
Bamboo Craft made with cane and bamboo is known as ''thazo''. It is made in many rural communities in many regions of Bhutan. Few special items of this art form are the ''belo'' and the ''bangchung'', popularly known as the Bhutanese “Tupperware” basket made in various sizes. Baskets of varying sizes are used in the homes and for travel on horseback, and as flasks for local drink called the ''arra''.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

;Bow and Arrow Making
To meet the growing demand for bow and arrow used in the national sport of archery, bamboo bows and arrows are made by craftsmen using specific types of bamboo and mountain reeds. The bamboo used are selected during particular seasons, shaped to size and skilfully made into the bow and arrow. Thimphu has the Changlimithang Stadium &amp; Archery Ground where Archery is a special sport.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 105"&gt;Brown, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

; Jewelry 
Intricate jewelry with motif, made of silver and gold, are much sought after by women of Bhutan. The traditional jewelry made in Bhutan are heavy bracelets, ''komas'' or fasteners attached to the ''kira,'' the traditional dress of Bhutanse women, loop ear rings set with [[turquoise]] and necklaces inlaid with gem stones such as antique turquoise, coral beads and the ''zhi'' stone. The ''zhi'' stone is considered a prized possession as it is said to have “protective powers”; this stone has black and white spiral designs called “eyes”. The ''zhi'' is also said to be an [[agate]] made into beads.&lt;ref name=Arts/&gt;

==Institutions==
; National Institute of Zorig Chusum 
The National Institute of Zorig Chusum is the centre for Bhutanese Art education. Painting is the main theme of the institute, which provides 4–6 years of training in Bhutanese traditional art forms. The curricula cover a comprehensive course of drawing, painting, wood carving, embroidery, and carving of statues. Images of Buddha are a popular painting done here.&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"/&gt;

; Handicrafts emporiums
There is a large government run emporium close to the National Institute of Zorig Chusum, which deals with exquisite handicrafts, traditional arts and jewelry; ''gho'' and ''kira'', the national dress of Bhutanese men and women, are available in this emporium. The town has many other privately owned emporiums which deal with thangkas, paintings, masks, brassware, antique jewellery, painted lama tables known as ''choektse'', drums, Tibetan violins and so forth; Zangma Handicrafts Emporium, in particular, sells handicrafts made in the Institute of Zorig Chusum.&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 114"&gt;Brown, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

; Folk Heritage Museum 
Folk Heritage Museum in Kawajangsa, Thimphu is built on the lines of a traditional Bhutanese farm house with more-than-100-year-old vintage furniture. It is built as a three storied structure with rammed mud walls and wooden doors, windows and roof covered with slates. It reveals much about Bhutanese rural life.&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"/&gt;

; Voluntary Artists Studio 
Located in an innocuous building, the Voluntary Artist Studio’s objective is to encourage traditional and contemporary art forms among the youth of Thimphu who are keen to imbibe these art forms. The art works of these young artists is also available on sale in the 'Art Shop Gallery' of the studio.&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 105"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dzongkhag&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thimphu.gov.bt/profile.php|title=Thimpu Dzongkhag|accessdate=2010-06-08|publisher=Government of Bhutan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908110431/http://www.thimphu.gov.bt/profile.php|archivedate=2010-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; National Textile Museum
The National Textile Museum in Thimphu displays various Bhutanese textiles that are extensive and rich in traditional culture. It also exhibits colourful and rare [[Kira (dress)|kira]]s and [[gho]]s (traditional Bhutanese dress, kira for women and gho for men).&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 105"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dzongkhag/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Biryani'' is an [[Urdu language|Urdu]] word derived from the [[Persian language]], which was used as an official language in different parts of medieval India by various Islamic dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nl5uAAAAMAAJ |title=A thousand laurels—Dr. Sadiq Naqvi: studies on medieval India with special reference to Deccan |last1=Naqvī |first1=Ṣādiq |last2=Rao |first2=V.

==Origin==
The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. In [[North India]], different varieties of biryani developed in the Muslim centers of Delhi ([[Mughlai cuisine]]), [[Lucknow]] ([[Awadhi cuisine]]) and other small principalities. In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from [[Telangana]] (specifically [[Hyderabad]]), [[Tamil Nadu]] ([[Ambur]]), [[Kerala]] ([[Malabar region|Malabar]]), and [[Karnataka]], where minority Muslim communities were present. [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] is the only region of [[South India]] that does not have many native varieties of biryani.&lt;ref name="Pratibha2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=Pratibha |last=Karan |title=Biryani |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZe-r38DYjcC |year=2009 |publisher=Random House India |isbn=978-81-8400-254-6 |pages=1–12, 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://food.ndtv.com/lists/10-best-biryani-recipes-696324 |title=10 Best Biryani Recipes |first=Sparshita |last=Saxena |website=NDTV Food |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Safavid dynasty]] (1501–1736) in [[Persia]], a dish called ''Berian Pilao'' ([[Nastaliq script]]: {{Nastaliq|بریان پلو}}) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight — with [[dahi (curd)|dahi]], [[Herb|herbs]], spices, [[Dried fruit|dried fruits]] (e.g., [[raisin]]s, [[prune]]s, or [[pomegranate]] seeds) — and later cooked in a [[Tandoor|tannour]] oven. It was then served with [[steamed rice]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

According to [[historian]] Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the [[Mughal Empire]] (1526–1857), as a confluence of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian ''[[pilaf]]''.&lt;ref name="Lizzie2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Collingham |first=Lizzie |title=Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr3GUyWe3O0C&amp;pg=PA27 |date=6 February 2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-988381-3 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian [[restaurateur]] Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia, and was brought to India by the Mughals.&lt;ref name="Dhillon2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dhillon |first=Kris |title=The New Curry Secret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kj3BBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT234 |year=2013 |publisher=Little, Brown Book Group |isbn=978-0-7160-2352-4 |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another theory claims that the dish was known in India before the first Mughal emperor [[Babur]] came to India.&lt;ref name="Vir_invention"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.hindustantimes.com/rude-food/2010/03/03/biryani-nation/ |title=Biryani Nation |first=Vir |last=Sanghvi |author-link=Vir Sanghvi |accessdate=24 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817181203/http://blogs.hindustantimes.com/rude-food/2010/03/03/biryani-nation/ |archivedate=17 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th-century Mughal text ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word "biryani" is of older usage in India.&lt;ref name="TheHindu2012"/&gt; A similar theory, that biryani came to India with [[Timurid dynasty|Timur]]'s invasion, appears to be incorrect, because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.&lt;ref name="Vir_invention" /&gt;

According to Pratibha Karan, the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the Indian subcontinent by the [[Arab people|Arab]] traders. She speculates that the ''pulao'' was an army dish in medieval India. The armies, unable to cook elaborate meals, would prepare a one-pot dish where they cooked rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between "pulao" and "biryani" being arbitrary.&lt;ref name="Pratibha2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vir_invention" /&gt; According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]] in South India.&lt;ref name="rediff_Priya2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2004/apr/09spec.htm |title=Of biryani, history and entrepreneurship |last=Ganapti |first=Priya |date=9 April 2004 |website=[[Rediff.com]] |access-date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference between biryani and pulao===
[[File:Indian biryani.jpg|thumb|Biryani contains more gravy and is cooked for longer with condiments]]
[[Pilaf]] or ''pulao'', as it is known in the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the [[cuisines of the Indian subcontinent]] and [[Middle Eastern cuisine]]. Opinions differ on the differences between pulao and biryani, and whether there is a difference between the two at all.&lt;ref name="KrishTulasi2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaffer |first=Holly |chapter=6: Dum Pukht |editor1-last=Ray |editor1-first=Krishnendu |editor2-last=Srinivas |editor2-first=Tulasi |title=Curried Cultures: Globalization, Food, and South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1kZBqJBjOgC&amp;pg=PA124 |year=2012 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-27011-4 |pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Nakhvi, pulao tends to be (comparatively) plainer than the biryani and consists of meat (or vegetables) cooked with rice. Biryani on the other hand contains more gravy (due to the use of [[yahni|''yakhni'']] in it), is often cooked for longer (hence yielding more tender meat or vegetables) and with additional condiments.&lt;ref name="ndtvravish"/&gt; Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani comprises two layers of rice with a layer of meat (or vegetables) in the middle; the pulao is not layered.&lt;ref name="Vir_invention" /&gt;

[[Colleen Taylor Sen]] lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VN_vCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194 |title=Feasts and Fasts: A History of Food in India |last=Taylor Sen |first=Colleen |publisher=Reaktion Books |year=2014 |isbn=9781780233918 |pages=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biryani is the primary dish in a meal, while the pulao is usually a secondary accompaniment to a larger meal
* In biryani, meat and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together. Pulao is a single-pot dish: meat and rice are simmered in a liquid until the liquid is absorbed. However, some other writers, such as Holly Shaffer (based on her observations in [[Lucknow]]), R. K. Saxena and Sangeeta Bhatnagar have reported pulao recipes in which the rice and meat are cooked separately and then mixed before the [[dum pukht|dum cooking]].&lt;ref name="KrishTulasi2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BhatnagarSaxena1997"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sangeeta |last1=Bhatnagar |first2=R. K. |last2=Saxena |title=Dastarkhwan-e-Awadh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XBNHAAAAYAAJ |date=1 January 1997 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers, India |isbn=978-81-7223-230-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biryanis have more complex and stronger spices compared to pulao. The [[British Raj|British-era]] author [[Abdul Halim Sharar]] mentions this as their primary difference: biryani has a stronger taste of curried rice due to a greater amount of spices.&lt;ref name="KrishTulasi2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abdul1913"&gt;{{cite book |first=ʻAbdulḥalīm |last=Sharar |authorlink=Abdul Halim Sharar |title=Lucknow: The Last Phase of an Oriental Culture (Hindustan Men Mashriqi Tamaddun ka Akhri Namuna) |translator=E.S.

==Ingredients==
Ingredients vary according to the region the biryani is from and the type of meat used. Meat (of either chicken, goat, beef, prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of the Indian subcontinent, some vegetables are also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter richer ingredients such as [[cashew]]s, [[kismis]] and fruits such as [[Apple|apples]] and [[pineapple]]s.&lt;ref name="ndtvravish" /&gt;

The spices and [[condiment]]s used in biryani may include [[ghee]] (clarified butter), [[nutmeg]], [[Mace (spice)|mace]],&lt;ref name="WWeek"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-17853-the-melting-pot.html |first=Ruth |last=Brown |date=17 August 2011 |title=The Melting Pot – A Local Prep Kitchen Incubates Portland's Next Generation of Food Businesses |newspaper=[[Willamette Week]] |volume=37 |number=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[clove]]s,&lt;ref name="WWeek" /&gt; [[cardamom]], [[cinnamon]], [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]], [[coriander]], [[Mentha|mint]] leaves, [[ginger]], [[Onion|onions]], [[Tomato|tomatoes]], and [[garlic]]. The premium varieties include [[saffron]].&lt;ref name="WWeek" /&gt; In all biryani, the main ingredient that accompanies the spices is the chicken or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with [[dahi chutney]] or [[raita]], [[korma]], [[curry]], a sour dish of [[aubergine]] ([[brinjal]]), [[boiled egg]], and [[salad]].

'''Kacchi biryani'''
:In a ''kacchi'' biryani, raw marinated meat is layered with raw rice before being cooked together. It is also known as ''kacchi yeqni''. It is cooked typically with chicken or [[goat meat]] but rarely with fish or [[prawn]]s. The dish is cooked layered with the meat and the dahi-based marinade at the bottom of the cooking pot and the layer of rice (usually [[basmati rice]] or chinigura rice) placed over it. Potatoes are often added before adding the rice layer. The pot is usually sealed (typically with wheat dough) to allow cooking in its own steam and not opened until it is ready to serve.

'''Tehari'''
:[[Tehri (dish)|Tehari]], tehri or tehari are variants on the name given to the vegetarian version of biryani. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim [[Nawab]]s. It is prepared by adding the potatoes to the rice as opposed to the case of traditional biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In [[Kashmir]], tehari is sold as [[street food]]. Tehari became more popular during [[World War II]], when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani.

'''Beef biryani'''
[[File:Food-Beef-Biryani-2.jpg|thumb|Beef biryani |right]]

It was started by the Arab settlers who married the local Jain women. Its variants include beef, goat, chicken, titar, egg, fish, crab, prawn and vegetable biryani.

===In the Indian subcontinent===
[[File:Vegetable Biriyani.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabadi]] vegetable biryani served in [[Tampa]], U.S.]]
There are many varieties of biryani, the names of which are often based on the region they are from (for example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India, etc.). Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it (for example: [[Haji Biriyani]], Haji Nanna Biriyani in [[Old Dhaka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/page2/content/story/489063.html |title=The king of rice dishes |first=Mohammad |last=Isam |website=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Fakhruddin Biriyani in [[Dhaka]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nibizsoft.com/dhakas-biryani-a-taste-of-aristocracy/ |title=Dhaka's Biryani - A Taste of Aristocracy |date=23 May 2015 |website=NIBiz Soft |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bdnews24.com/lifestyle/2016/03/28/dhakas-biryani-can-be-unesco-world-heritage-says-food-critic-matt-preston |title=Dhaka's biryani can be UNESCO world heritage, says food critic Matt Preston |first=Hassan |last=Bipul |date=28 March 2016 |website=[[Bdnews24.com]] |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students biryani in [[Karachi]], Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai).&lt;ref name="ndtvravish" /&gt; Biryanis are often specific to the respective Muslim community from where it comes, as it is usually the defining dish of that community. Cosmopolitanism has also created these native versions to suit the tastes of others as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.hindustantimes.com/rude-hotels/2009/02/01/where-does-biryani-come-from/ |title=Where does biryani come from? |website=Hindustan Times |access-date=20 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624141257/http://blogs.hindustantimes.com/rude-hotels/2009/02/01/where-does-biryani-come-from/ |archivedate=24 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delhi biryani'''
:The Delhi version of the biryani developed with a unique local flavour as the Mughal kings shifted their political capital to the North Indian city of Delhi. Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their house and rarely ate out. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travellers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. As per Nakhwi, this is the reason most shops historically selling biryani in Delhi tend to be near mosques such as [[Jama Masjid]] (for travelers) or traditional shopping districts (such as [[Chandni Chowk]]). Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc. The Nizamuddin biryani is usually sparse in the more expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] shrine and thereafter to distribute to devotees.&lt;ref name="ndtvravish" /&gt; A non-''dum'' variety of biryani, using a lot of green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shop located outside National Sports Club, Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani. Another version of Delhi biryani uses ''achaar'' (pickles) and is called achaari biryani.&lt;ref name="pratibha"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karan |first1=Pratibha |year=2009 |title=Biryani |publisher=Random House (India) |isbn=978-8184000931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sindhi Biryani.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sindhi biryani]]]]
:The exotic and aromatic [[Sindhi cuisine|Sindhi]] biryani is known in Pakistan for its spicy taste, fragrant rice and delicate meat. Sindhi biryani is a beloved staple in food menus of [[Pakistani cuisine]] and [[Sindhi cuisine]]. Sindhi biryani is prepared with meat and an amalgamation of basmati rice, vegetables and various types of spices. Sindhi Biryani is often served by [[Pakistan International Airlines]] (PIA) in most of their international flights. A special version of Sindhi biryani sold by a shop in [[Karachi]] called "Students center" is popularly called "Students biryani."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Karachi based historian Salim Mohammed, Karachi |date=August 1999 |website=Institute for Business, Innovation and Strategic Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Hyderabadi biryani]]'''
:Hyderabadi biryani is one of India's most famous biryanis; some say biryani is synonymous with Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.india.com/food-2/10-cities-in-india-for-the-food-lovers-soul-212397/ |title=10 Cities In India For The Food Lover's Soul |date=5 December 2014 |website=India.com |access-date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crown dish of the [[Hyderabadi Muslims]], Hyderabadi biryani developed under the rule of [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Asaf Jah I]], who had been appointed as the Governor of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. It is made with basmati rice, spices and goat meat. Popular variations use chicken instead of goat meat. There are various forms of Hyderabadi biryani. One such biryani is the kachay gosht ki biryani or the dum biryani, where the goat meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/04/14/indias-best-city-for-biryani-is-2/ |title=India's Best City For Biryani Is... |date=14 April 2013 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Thalassery biryani]]'''
[[File:Biriyani.jpg|thumbnail|[[Thalassery biryani]]]]
:Thalassery biryani is the variation of biryani found in the Indian state of [[Kerala]]. It is one of the many dishes of the [[Mappila|Malabar Muslim community]], and a very popular one at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cZe-r38DYjcC |title=Biryani |last=Karan |first=Pratibha |year=2012 |publisher=Random House India |isbn=978-8-18400-254-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The ingredients are chicken, spices and the specialty is the choice of rice named Khyma. Khyma rice is generally mixed with [[ghee]]. Although a huge amount of spices such as mace, [[cashew nuts]], sultana [[raisin]]s, fennel-[[cumin seeds]], tomato, onion, ginger, garlic, [[shallot]], cloves and cinnamon are used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Abdulla |first=Ummi |title=Malabar Muslim Cookery |publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=1993 |isbn=978-8125013495 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is only a small amount of chili (or chili powder) used in the preparation.
:A ''pakki'' biryani, the Thalassery biryani uses a small-grained thin (not round) fragrant variety of rice known as Khyma or Jeerakasala. The ''dum'' method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough (maida) or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here.

'''Kolkata biryani'''
:Calcutta or [[Kolkata]] biryani evolved from the [[Lucknow]] style, when Awadh's last [[Nawab]] [[Wajid Ali Shah]] was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of [[Metiabruz]].&lt;ref name="rediff_Priya2004"/&gt; Shah brought his personal chef with him. The poorer households of Kolkata, which could not afford meat, used potatoes instead, which went on to become a specialty of the Calcutta biryani. The Calcutta biryani primarily uses meat and potatoes. However, this theory is vehemently opposed by Janab Shahanshah Mirza, great great grandson of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. According to him, Awadh's last ruler used to get an annual pension of Rs.12 Lakh and he was the highest pensioner in India. He was an animal lover and had set up a zoo in Kolkata. He used to spend about 25% of his pension amount on the maintenance of zoo and upkeep of animals. A man who can spend a substantial part of his income on the welfare of animals can certainly afford meat in his biryani, argues Mirza. He points out that potatoes were first introduced in Surat in 17th century. It slowly spread to different regions and was brought to Bengal by the English traders. In those days, potato was an exotic vegetable and because of low yield it was extremely expensive. The chefs who had accompanied Nawab Wajid Ali Shah tried various combinations and experiments to enhance the taste of biryani. On one such occasion potatoes were added while cooking biryani. It appealed to the taste buds of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. He was so pleased that he ordered that henceforth whenever biryani is cooked it should be with this vegetable. And the rest is history.
:The Calcutta biryani is much lighter on spices. The marinade primarily uses [[nutmeg]], [[cinnamon]], [[mace (spice)|mace]] along with [[cloves]] and [[cardamom]] in the [[dahi (curd)|dahi]]-based marinade for the meat which is cooked separately from rice. This combination of spices gives it a distinct flavour as compared to other styles of biryani. The rice is flavoured with [[Pandanus tectorius|ketaki]] water or [[rose]] water along with saffron to give it flavour and light yellowish colour.

'''Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani'''
:Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a type of biryani cooked in neighboring towns of [[Ambur]] and [[Vaniyambadi]] in the [[Vellore district]] in the northeastern part of [[Tamil Nadu]], which has a high Muslim population. It was introduced by the [[Nawab of Arcot|Nawabs of Arcot]] who once ruled the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://viralvidos.com/easy-chicken-biriyani-recipe/ |title=Easy chicken Biriyani Recipe |date=3 February 2017 |website=Viralvidos.com |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is accompanied with 'dhalcha,' a sour [[brinjal]] curry and 'pachadi' or raitha, which is sliced onions mixed with plain curd, tomato, chillies and salt. It has a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach. The usage of spice is moderate and curd is used as a gravy base. It also has a higher ratio of meat to rice.&lt;ref name="TheHindu2012"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/Food/food-safari-in-search-of-ambur-biryani/article3452311.ece |title=Food Safari: In search of Ambur biryani |last1=Padmanabhan |first1=Mukund |last2=Jeyan |first2=Subash |last3=Wilson |first3=Subajayanthi |date=26 May 2012 |newspaper=The Hindu |accessdate=6 August 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018041053/http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/Food/food-safari-in-search-of-ambur-biryani/article3452311.ece |archive-date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bhatkali/Navayathi biryani'''
:This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a speciality of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who left behind not only biryani but a variation of kababs and Indian breads. In Bhatkali biryani the meat is cooked in an onion and green chilli based masala and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy and heady flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange. Though similar to the ones in Thalassery and Kozhikode, this biryani differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic, and a few chillies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkal biryani. No oil is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kumar |first1=K. C.

The Kalyani biryani was served by the Kalyani nawabs to all of their subjects who came from Bidar to Hyderabad and stayed or visited their [[devdi]] or noble mansion.
:This was the practice for many decades. But after [[Operation Polo]] in which the Indian army took over [[Hyderabad State]], the state of the nobles went into decline. Some of their illustrious cooks set up their own stalls and introduced the Kalyani biryani to the local populace of Hyderabad state.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Outside the Indian subcontinent===

====Burma====
[[File:Kyet Shar Soon biryani.jpg|right|thumb|A dish of Burmese biryani (locally known as ''danpauk''), as served at Kyet Shar]]
In [[Myanmar]] ([[Burma]]), biryani is known in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] as ''danpauk'' or ''danbauk'', from the Persian ''[[dum pukht]]''. Featured ingredients include cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf. In Burmese biryani, the chicken is cooked with the rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/recipes/article/The-Burmese-Way-A-visit-to-the-land-of-pagodas-3238193.php#photo-2382531 |newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=The Burmese Way / A visit to the land of pagodas and enchanting cuisine |quote=Burmese chicken biryani differs from its Indian counterpart: the chicken is cooked with the rice. |first=Mai |last=Pham |date=11 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016}} Biryani is also eaten with a salad of sliced onions and cucumber.

====Middle East====
One form of "Arabic" biryani is the Iraqi preparation (برياني: "biryani"), where the rice is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is most popular in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds and raisins spread liberally over the rice.&lt;ref name="rediff_Priya2004"/&gt; Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (maraq).

In Iran, during the [[Safavid dynasty]] (1501–1736), a dish called ''Berian'' ([[Nastaliq script]]: {{Nastaliq|بریان پلو}}) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight — with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like [[raisin]]s, [[prune]]s or [[pomegranate]] seeds — and later cooked in a [[Tandoor|tannour]] oven. It was then served with [[steamed rice]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====Afghan biryani====
A different dish called ''biryan'' is popular in Afghanistan. Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, and is today sold in [[Afghanistan]] as well as in [[Bhopal]], India. Biryan is prepared by cooking [[gosht]] and rice together, but without the additional gravy (''yakhni'') and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between the [[Pilaf|pulao]] and biryani. The Afghani biryani tends to use a lot of dry fruit and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.&lt;ref name="ndtvravish"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Ravish Kumar interviews historian Sohali Hashmi |date=9 September 2016 |title=प्राइम टाइम : क्या-क्या अलग करेंगे बिरयानी से? |trans-title=Prime Time: What will separate from Biryani? |medium=Television production |language=hi |url=https://khabar.ndtv.com/video/show/prime-time/prime-time-what-will-be-separate-from-biryani-430689?yt |access-date=19 October 2016 |time= |location=Old Delhi |publisher=NDTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
[[Nasi kebuli]] is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee. Nasi kebuli is descended from [[Kabuli Palaw]] which is an Afghani rice dish, similar to biryani served in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lintas.me/go/travel.kompas.com/sajian-kebuli-mandi-dan-biryani |title=Sajian Kebuli, Mandi, dan Biryani |website=Kompas.com |date=6 July 2014 |language=id |access-date=24 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903084827/http://www.lintas.me/go/travel.kompas.com/sajian-kebuli-mandi-dan-biryani |archivedate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not a staple diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. Nasing Biringyi is similar to the ''Nasi [[Briyani]]'' dish of Malaysia in style and taste, but is also compared to a saffron-cooked version of [[Paella|Spanish Paella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://aboucheamused.com/2012/01/16/come-taste-my-philippines-the-food-of-pampanga/ |title=Come Taste My Philippines — the food of Pampanga |date=16 January 2012 |website=A Bouche Amused |access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Africa====
In the [[Cape Malay]] culture, a variation of biryani incorporates lentils as a key ingredient into the dish along with meat (usually goat meat or chicken). The dish may be seasoned with [[garam masala]] or a curry spice mix (though this is not authentic to the local style) and coloured, sometimes heavily, with turmeric.

'''''Blacklight: Tango Down''''' is a [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[cyberpunk]]-themed [[Online game|online]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Zombie Studios]] and published by [[Ignition Entertainment]]. The game was released on July 7, 2010 on [[Xbox 360]] as a downloadable title, and was released on [[Microsoft Windows]] (with [[Games for Windows – Live]] requirement) on July 14, 2010. The game was also released on October 26, 2010 for the [[PlayStation 3]]. The PC version is the one to receive all three patches, where as the Xbox 360 received only the first two patches, and the PlayStation 3 version received no patches, being at retail, launch day version.

Zombie was planning to make ''Blacklight'' a multimedia franchise that would include the video game, a feature film, and a trilogy of comic books, however the company became defunct on January 8, 2015. The idea was conceptualized by Zombie executives which later pitched the idea to several film and comic book production companies. The film rights were immediately bought by [[Fox Atomic]] to create a film adaptation of the franchise. Fox Atomic's comic subsidiary, Fox Atomic Comics, was also to be creating the ''Blacklight'' comics, but after the closing of Fox Atomic, the trans-media rights have been purchased by [[Imagine Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/01/imagine-does-transmedia-storytelling-deal/#more-23161 |title=Imagine's 'Transmedia Storytelling' Deal |publisher=Deadline |date=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, comic books, and game will not share the same storylines, but tell different stories in the ''Blacklight'' universe at different time periods.&lt;ref name="An Early Glimpse of Zombie's Blacklight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=1087|first=Chris|last=Faylor|publisher=[[Shack News]]|title=An Early Glimpse of Zombie's Blacklight|date=March 17, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531225145/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=1087|archivedate=May 31, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2018, there are no new updates for the film's status, other than that [[Jason Hall (screenwriter)|Jason Hall]] was the screenwriter for the project in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firstshowing.net/2009/fox-atomic-developing-adaptation-of-blacklight-game/|title=Fox Atomic Developing Adaptation of Blacklight Game - Updated!|work=FirstShowing.net|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game contains modes such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Domination, Capture the Flag, Last Man Standing, and Last Team Standing, with two slightly more unique modes, those being Retrieval and Detonate. In Detonate, a neutral bomb is at the center of the map, and a player from one team has to plant the bomb at the base of the enemy team, and prevent it from being defused. Retrieval is a modified version of Capture the Flag, where you cannot take the item (being either a bomb or a canister with sensitive information) to your base. There are two of them on the map, one belonging to each team. The points are scored whenever the canister/bomb is at the retrieval zone of the enemy team, where it accumulates points, but it is still an enemy team canister/bomb.

The game makes use of its near-future setting by offering HRV (Hyper Reality Visor) that allow players to see an enemy's presence through walls and other obstacles, as well as two types of grenades that counter other players' visors through the use of a blurring effect, similar to a digital smokescreen, along with a type of grenade which emits EMP that forces the enemy's HUD to reboot and reset, resulting in temporary blindness.

The game also features a "Black Ops" game-mode, which supports up to four players, in online co-operative play, through a campaign that takes the player or players through a war-torn city. Blacklight: Tango Down features five distinct weapons, including an assault rifle, a sub-machine gun, a light machine gun, a sniper rifle and a shotgun. Each weapon comes with its own unique futuristic appearance, as well as a wide variety of upgrades and customizations, including variations of magazines, barrels, and camouflages. The weapon customization lets you affect the accuracy, speed, and health for the four different load-out kits you get.&lt;ref name="Blacklight: Tango Down Revealed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/107/1072973p1.html|first=Erik|last=Brudvig|publisher=IGN|title=Blacklight: Tango Down Revealed|date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game contains XP and level up system, familiar to that employed in [[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]], which allows the player rank up through 70 levels. Weapon customizations will unlock as the player gains skill and experience points and will include more basic add-ons like sniper scopes as well as more complex enhancements, such as stocks, barrels, muzzles, magazines, weapon tags, etc.&lt;ref name="Blacklight: Tango Down Revealed" /&gt;

==Backstory summary==
''Blacklight: Tango Down'' takes place in a [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[cyberpunk]] overpopulated near-future where [[Megacorporation|megacorporations]] reign supreme and try to manipulate world governments and agencies, and within the confines of a fictional [[Eastern Europe]]an city called 'Balik'. The city is a former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet state]] that has become rundown and dilapidated, with some [[Megacorporation|megacorporate]] presence, of which retreated after its president assassinated by a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] [[Rebel groups|rebel group]] named '''The Order''', ending its totalitarian military dictatorship that was on a downward spiral due to corporate influence and civil unrest, but subsequently caused '''The Order''' to take over the city and intentionally create an epidemic with an obscure and mysterious virus named 'Q-Fever' that induces symptoms similar to rabies, and having the infected be named SIVs (slang for Sentient Insanity Virus). 

Meanwhile an [[United States]] agency, named '''Blacklight''', is contracted to wage war against the terrorist group after they've killed the initially deployed Tango squad, sent in to locate a Colonel Klein and his personal Blacklight squad after they went missing in the area, which begins to plunge the world into a downward spiral as [[Megacorporation|megacorporations]] exploit warfare for profit and manipulative political and economical power.

The game was officially announced by Zombie and Fox Atomic on March 16, 2009 at a press conference. The pair announced not only the game, but the collaboration on the film and comic book series as well. The comic book, which tells the story that resulted in the events of the final game, is a loose adaptation of the novel [[Heart of Darkness]]. 

The only details revealed were the first-person perspective and futuristic setting of the game. However, a screenshot of the game, released in 2009, indicates it may have been third-person,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and that within the game's files, may have had a single-player, with many different mechanics hinted (for example, manual saves and under-barrel grenade-launchers). The designers described ''Blacklight'' as "Science Fact", as opposed to [[science fiction]]. It was explained that this meant Zombie researched the cutting edge of modern-day technology and applied them to the armor and weapons of the game to give it a real but futuristic atmosphere. The weapons are inspired by designs used in the [[U.S Army]] from the 1960's and onward. Zombie, having worked with the Army on several training games, have had the ability to check the advances in R&amp;D as far as new technologies.&lt;ref name="An Early Glimpse of Zombie's Blacklight" /&gt;

The following day Zombie founder Mark Long had a public interview revealing much more information about the game. A basic plot summary was issued as well as some weapon designs. Although no release date was set, he noted that the comic book will come first and the game will come "sooner than later".

A few screenshots of the game were released alongside the interview. Most of the screens, in a unique marketing approach, all depict the same scene from different angles and perspectives. The scene depicts a battle between two warring factions dressed in advanced combat armor in an urban environment with several skyscrapers. Some of the buildings are shown being crumbled and some are destroyed with large holes in them from previous battles.  Ignition Entertainment announced on March 1, 2010 that they would be publishing the game for the [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref name="Blacklight: Tango Down Revealed" /&gt;

The most positive review came from Daemon Hatfield of [[IGN]], who described the game as a "fun and inexpensive way to get your multiplayer fix", and that "when you first jump into the game it may be hard to believe you only paid $15 for it". However, despite commending the game for being solid, he admitted it was "not particularly inspired".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/28/blacklight-tango-down-review|title=Blacklight: Tango Down Review|last=Hatfield|first=Daemon|date=2010-07-27|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] gave a similar review to IGN, saying that the game "seeks to bring the beloved multiplayer modes of AAA shooters to a downloadable game that only costs fifteen bucks, and in many respects it does this well", but called the co-op modes "linear" and "uninspired".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/blacklight-tango-down-review/|title=Blacklight: Tango Down review|work=gamesradar|access-date=2018-12-02|language=EN-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The title's unique weapon customization mechanic came under particular praise by [[NTSC-uk]], claiming it provided "not only the largest variety of guns seen in any competitive shooter today, but also the most balanced online ranking system that is on the market".{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The lowest scored review came from Jim Sterling of [[Destructoid]], who rated the game 3/10. He criticized the co-op missions, saying that the "Black Ops levels seem thrown in for no good reason", and that the "multiplayer is only marginally better". However he did note "''Tango Down'' looks really quite good, with visuals that almost look convincingly retail", but that "graphics really aren't worth buying the game for".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-blacklight-tango-down-178661.phtml |title=Review: Blacklight: Tango Down |publisher=Destructoid |date=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Picture bride kidnapping.jpg|thumb|]]
'''Bride kidnapping''', also known as '''marriage by abduction''' or '''marriage by capture''', is a practice in which a man abducts&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/out-of-eden-walk/articles/2017-06-captured-hearts/]&lt;/ref&gt; the woman he wishes to marry. Bride kidnapping has been practiced around the world and throughout history. It continues to occur in countries in Central Asia, the [[Caucasus]] region, and parts of Africa, and among peoples as diverse as the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] in Southeast Asia, the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] in Mexico, and the [[Romani people|Romani]] in Europe.

In most nations, bride kidnapping is considered a [[sex crime]] rather than a valid [[types of marriages|form of marriage]]. Some types of it may also be seen as falling along the continuum between [[forced marriage]] and [[arranged marriage]]. The term is sometimes used to include not only abductions, but also [[elopement]]s, in which a couple runs away together and seeks the consent of their parents later; these may be referred to as non-consensual and consensual abductions respectively. However, even when the practice is against the law, judicial enforcement remains lax in some areas, such as [[Moldova]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Chechnya]].

Bride kidnapping is distinguished from ''[[raptio]]'' in that the former refers to the abduction of one woman by one man (and his friends and relatives), and is still a widespread practice, whereas the latter refers to the large scale abduction of women by groups of men, possibly in a time of war (see also [[war rape]]).

Some cultures today maintain symbolic bride kidnapping ritual as part of [[Wedding#International wedding customs|traditions surrounding a wedding]], in a nod to the practice of bride kidnapping which may have figured in that culture's history. According to some sources, the [[honeymoon]] is a relic of marriage by capture, based on the practice of the husband going into hiding with his wife to avoid reprisals from her relatives, with the intention that the woman would be pregnant by the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g., ''William Shepard Walsh, ''Curiosities of Popular Customs and of Rites, Ceremonies, Observances, and Miscellaneous Antiquities'', (J.B. Lippincott Co., 1897), p. 654; John Lubbock, ''The Origin of Civilisation and the Primitive Condition of Man: Mental and Social Condition of Savages'', (Appleton, 1882), p. 122. Curtis Pesmen &amp; Setiawan Djody, ''Your First Year of Marriage'' (Simon and Schuster, 1995) p. 37.  ''Compare with'' Edward Westermarck, ''The History of Human Marriage'' (Allerton Book Co., 1922), p. 277 (refuting the link between honeymoon and marriage by capture).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and rationale ==
{{See also|Raptio}}

Though the motivations behind bride kidnapping vary by region, the cultures with traditions of marriage by abduction are generally [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] with a strong [[social stigma]] on sex or pregnancy outside marriage and [[illegitimacy|illegitimate births]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Brian Stross, "Tzeltal Marriage by Capture", ''Anthropological Quarterly'', Vol. 47, No. 3, Kidnapping and Elopement as Alternative Systems of Marriage (Special Issue) (Jul. 1974), pp. 328–346 (describing Tzeltal culture as patriarchal with a few opportunities for "pre-marital cross-sex interaction")[hereinafter Stross, ''Tzeltal Marriage by Capture'']; Sabina Kiryashova, [http://www.iwpr.net/?p=wpr&amp;s=f&amp;o=258105&amp;apc_state=henpwp "Azeri Bride Kidnappers Risk Heavy Sentences"], Institute of War and Peace Reporting, 17 November 2005  (discussing the shame brought on Azeri kidnap victims who spend a night outside of the house); Gulo Kokhodze &amp; Tamuna Uchidze, [http://www.iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=321627&amp;apc_state=henh "Bride Theft Rampant in Southern Georgia"], (discussing the Georgian case, where "great social stigma attaches to the suspicion of lost virginity."). Compare with {{cite journal |first=Barbara |last=Ayres |title=Bride Theft and Raiding for Wives in Cross-Cultural Perspective |journal=Anthropological Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=3 |year=1974 |pages=245 |doi=10.2307/3316978 |quote=There is no relationship between bride theft and status distinctions, bride price, or attitudes toward premarital virginity. The absence of strong associations in these areas suggests the need for a new hypothesis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some modern cases, the couple collude together to elope under the guise of a bride kidnapping, presenting their parents with a ''fait accompli''. In most cases, however, the men who resort to capturing a wife are often of lower [[social status]], because of poverty, disease, poor character or criminality.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Stross, ''Tzeltal Marriage by Capture'' (Tzeltal culture); {{cite thesis |first=George |last=Scott |title=The Migrants Without Mountains: The Sociocultural Adjustment Among the Lao Hmong Refugees In San Diego |year=1986 |type=PhD |publisher=University of California, San Diego |pages=82–85 |oclc=34162755 }} (Hmong culture); Alex Rodriguez, ''Kidnapping a Bride Practice Embraced in Kyrgyzstan'', Augusta Chronicle, 24 July 2005 (Kyrgyz culture);&lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes deterred from legitimately seeking a wife because of the payment the woman's family expects, the [[bride price]] (not to be confused with a [[dowry]], paid by the ''woman's'' family).&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Stross, ''Tzeltal Marriage by Capture'', pp. 342–343; {{cite news |first=Craig S. |last=Smith |title=Abduction, Often Violent, a Kyrgyz Wedding Rite |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 April 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/30/world/asia/abduction-often-violent-a-kyrgyz-wedding-rite.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In agricultural and patriarchal societies, where bride kidnapping is most common, children work for their family.  A woman leaves her birth family, geographically and economically, when she marries, becoming instead a member of the groom's family.  (See [[patrilocality]] for an anthropological explanation.) Due to this loss of labour, the women's families do not want their daughters to marry young, and demand economic compensation (the aforementioned bride price) when they do leave them. This conflicts with the interests of men, who want to marry early, as marriage means an increase in social status, and the interests of the groom's family, who will gain another pair of hands for the family farm, business or home.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, ''Reconciled to Violence: State Failure to Stop Domestic Abuse and Abduction of Women in Kazakhstan'', Vol. 8, No. 9, September 2006, p. 117 ("Families in Kyrgyzstan generally exploit the labor of new brides as a way of adding to the resources and productivity of the household with little cost to the family.Families in Kyrgyzstan generally exploit the labor of new brides as a way of adding to the resources and productivity of the household with little cost to the family."); Sabina Kiryashova, [http://www.iwpr.net/?p=wpr&amp;s=f&amp;o=258105&amp;apc_state=henpwpr "Azeri Bride Kidnappers Risk Heavy Sentences"], Institute of War and Peace Reporting, 17 Nov 2005, ("Even more sinister are reports of kidnapped brides being taken abroad or used as slaves at home. "There have been cases when girls were abducted and used as housekeepers", said Saida Gojamanli from the Human Rights and Legislation Protection Bureau.")&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the legal system under which she lives, the consent of the woman may not be a factor in judging the validity of the marriage.

In addition to the issue of [[forced marriage]], bride kidnapping may have other negative effects on the young women and their society. For example, fear of kidnap is cited as a reason for the lower participation of girls in the education system.&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children, [http://www.positivedeviance.org/projects/ethopedu/Ethiopia_girls_ed.pdf Learning from Children, Families and Communities to Increase Girls' Participation in Primary School] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217053046/http://www.positivedeviance.org/projects/ethopedu/Ethiopia_girls_ed.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism of marriage by abduction varies by location. This article surveys the phenomenon by region, drawing on common cultural factors for patterns, but noting country-level distinctions.

==Africa==
In three African countries, bride kidnapping often takes the form of [[Kidnapping|abduction]] followed by rape.

===Rwanda&lt;!-- There's a good source for Rwanda that I haven't had access to yet: A Study on Beliefs, Attitudes and Socio-cultural Practices Related to Gender in Rwanda, by Republic of Rwanda, Ministry of Gender and Women in Development, United Nations Population Fund. This would be great for expanding this section. --&gt;===

Bride-kidnapping is prevalent in areas of [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;Julius Adekunle, ''Culture and Customs of Rwanda'', Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Often the abductor kidnaps the woman from her household or follows her outside and abducts her. He and his companions may then rape the woman to ensure that she submits to the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Streissguth, ''Rwanda in Pictures'', p. 39; Jean Ruremesha, 
[http://www.aegis.com/default.asp?req=http://www.aegis.com/news/ips/2003/IP031005.html RIGHTS-RWANDA: Marriage by Abduction Worries Women's Groups] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525202932/http://www.aegis.com/default.asp?req=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aegis.com%2Fnews%2Fips%2F2003%2FIP031005.html |date=25 May 2011 }}, Inter Press Service, 7 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The family of the woman either then feels obliged to consent to the union,&lt;ref name="aegis.com"&gt;Ruremesha, 
[http://www.aegis.com/default.asp?req=http://www.aegis.com/news/ips/2003/IP031005.html RIGHTS-RWANDA: Marriage by Abduction Worries Women's Groups]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; or is forced to when the kidnapper impregnates her, as pregnant women are not seen as eligible for marriage. The marriage is confirmed with a ceremony that follows the abduction by several days. In such ceremonies, the abductor asks his bride's parents to forgive him for abducting their daughter.&lt;ref name="aegis.com" /&gt; The man may offer a cow, money, or other goods as restitution to his bride's family.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bride-kidnap marriages in Rwanda often lead to poor outcomes. Human rights workers report that one third of men who abduct their wives abandon them, leaving the wife without support and impaired in finding a future marriage.&lt;ref name="aegis.com" /&gt; Additionally, with the growing frequency of bride-kidnapping, some men choose not to solemnize their marriage at all, keeping their "bride" as a [[concubine]].&lt;ref name="aegis.com" /&gt; [[Domestic violence]] is also common and is not illegal.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100499.htm Rwanda: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – 2007], 11 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Bride kidnapping is not specifically outlawed in Rwanda, though violent abductions are punishable as rape. According to a criminal justice official, bride kidnappers are virtually never tried in court: "When we hear about abduction, we hunt down the kidnappers and arrest them and sometimes the husband, too. But we're forced to let them all go several days later," says an official at the criminal investigation department in [[Nyagatare]], the capital of [[Umutara]].&lt;ref name="aegis.com" /&gt; Women's rights groups have attempted to reverse the tradition by conducting awareness raising campaigns and by promoting gender equity, but the progress has been limited so far.&lt;ref name="aegis.com" /&gt;

===Egypt===
Coptic Christian women and girls are often abducted, [[forced religious conversions in Egypt|forced to convert to Islam]] and then married to Muslim men.&lt;ref name=trafficking&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/04/21/house-members-press-white-house-confront-egypt-forced-marriages/ | title = House Members Press White House to Confront Egypt on Forced Marriages | last = Abrams | first = Joseph | date = April 21, 2010 | work = foxnews.com | accessdate = November 8, 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101123194447/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/04/21/house-members-press-white-house-confront-egypt-forced-marriages/ | archivedate = November 23, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcforcedmarriage&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12014779 | title = Christian minority under pressure in Egypt | last =  | first =  | date = December 17, 2010 | work = BBC News | accessdate = January 1, 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170322014332/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12014779 | archivedate = March 22, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopia===
Bride kidnapping is prevalent in many regions of [[Ethiopia]].

===Kenya===
Forced marriages continue to be a problem for young girls in [[Kenya]]. The [[United States Department of State]] reports that children and young teenaged girls (aged ten and up) are sometimes married to men two decades older.&lt;ref&gt;United States State Department, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100487.htm ''Kenya: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices  – 2007''], 11 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage by abduction used to be, and to some extent still is, a [[customary law|customary practice]] for the [[Gusii people|Kisii]] ethnic group. In their practice, the abductor kidnaps the woman forcibly and rapes her in an attempt to impregnate her. The "bride" is then coerced through the stigma of pregnancy and rape to marry her abductor. Though most common in the late 19th century through the 1960s, such marriage abductions still occur occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2e452,45f147f811,0.html "Kenya: Information on Kisii marriage customs and whether women are, at times, abducted and coerced into marriage"],&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Turkana people|Turkana]] tribe in [[Kenya]] also practised marriage by abduction. In this culture, bridal kidnapping (''akomari'') occurred before any formal attempts to arrange a marriage with a bride's family. According to one scholar, a successful bridal kidnapping raised the abductor's reputation in his community, and allowed him to negotiate a lower [[bride price]] with his wife's family. Should an attempted abductor fail to seize his bride, he was bound to pay a bride price to the woman's family, provide additional gifts and payments to the family, and to have an arranged marriage (''akota'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. D. |last=Emley |title=The Turkana of Kolosia District |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=57 |year=1927 |pages=157–201 |doi=10.2307/2843681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The practice is known as [[ukuthwalwa]] or simply thwala in among the [[nguni]] speaking tribes. The [[Basotho]] call it [[Tjhobediso]]. Among [[Zulu people]], thwala, or bride abduction, was once an acceptable way for two young people in love to get married when their families opposed the match (and so actually a form of [[elopement]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/12/world/la-fg-zulu-women-20120712|title=Bride Abductions 'a distortion' of South Africa's Culture|last=Dixon|first=Robyn|date=12 July 2012|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thwala has been abused, however, "to victimize isolated rural women and enrich male relatives."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fourteen percent of married women answered that they were kidnapped at the time and that two thirds of these cases were consensual, the woman knew the man and had agreed with it up front. This means that about five percent of current marriages in Kyrgyzstan are cases of 'Ala Kachuu'. &lt;ref&gt; Gorby, ''Kyrgyzstan Public Safety Survey'', Civil Union “For Reforms and Results” (2015) page 30-31 http://wp.unil.ch/icvs/news/information-and-data-from-kyrgyzstan/  &lt;/ref&gt; Five percent is still a lot, but it contradicts the notion that it is ´´accepted and common´´.

There is another source that mentions much higher numbers.

Bride kidnappings that involve [[rape]] do so to psychologically force the would-be bride to accept her kidnapper and his family’s pressure to marry him, since if she then refuses she would never be considered marriageable again. Of 12,000 yearly bride kidnappings in [[Kyrgyzstan]], approximately 2,000 women reported that their kidnapping involved rape by the would-be groom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/news-life/its-hard-to-believe-that-bride-kidnapping-exists-in-2017/news-story/9e7a445078231d94da67be33e3bb9157&lt;/ref&gt; The matter is somewhat confused by the local use of the term "bride kidnap" to reflect practices along a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], from forcible abduction and rape (and then, almost unavoidably, marriage), to something akin to an [[elopement (marriage)|elopement]] arranged between the two young people, to which both sets of parents have to consent after the act.

Although the practice is illegal in Kyrgyzstan, bride kidnappers are rarely prosecuted. This reluctance to enforce the code is in part caused by the pluralistic legal system in Kyrgyzstan where many villages are ''de facto'' ruled by councils of elders and ''[[aqsaqal]]'' courts following [[Custom (law)|customary law]], away from the eyes of the state legal system.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Judith |last=Beyer |title=Kyrgyz Aksakal Courts: Pluralistic Accounts of History |journal=Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law |volume=38 |year=2006 |issue=53–54 |pages=141–176 |doi=10.1080/07329113.2006.10756601 |postscript=; }} Handrahan, pp. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aqsaqal'' courts, tasked with adjudicating family law, property and torts, often fail to take bride kidnapping seriously. In many cases, ''aqsaqal'' members are invited to the kidnapped bride's wedding and encourage the family of the bride to accept the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, ''Reconciled to Violence'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kazakhstan===
In [[Kazakhstan]], bride kidnapping (''[[alyp qashu]]'') is divided into non-consensual and consensual abductions, ''kelisimsiz alyp qashu'' ("to take and run without agreement") and ''kelissimmen alyp qashu'' ("to take and run with agreement"), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Cynthia |last=Werner |chapter=The Rise of Nonconsensual Bride Kidnapping in Post-Soviet Kazakhstan |title=The Transformation of Central Asia: States and Societies from Soviet Rule to Independence |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2004 |editor-first=Pauline Jones |editor-last=Luong |page=70 |isbn=0-8014-4151-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some kidnappers are motivated by the wish to avoid a [[bride price]] or the expense of hosting wedding celebrations or a feast to celebrate the girl leaving home, other would-be husbands fear the woman's refusal, or that the woman will be kidnapped by another suitor first.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, in nonconsensual kidnappings, the abductor uses either deception (such as offering a ride home) or force (such as grabbing the woman, or using a sack to restrain her) to coerce the woman to come with him.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Once at the man's house, one of his female relatives offers the woman a kerchief (''oramal'') that signals the bride's consent to the marriage. Though in consensual kidnappings, the woman may agree with little hesitation to wear the kerchief, in non-consensual abductions, the woman may resist the kerchief for days.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the abductor's family generally asks the "bride" to write a letter to her family, explaining that she had been taken of her own free will. As with the kerchief, the woman may resist this step adamantly.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the "groom" and his family generally issues an official apology to the bride's family, including a letter and a delegation from the groom's household. At this time, the groom's family may present a small sum to replace the bride-price. Though some apology delegations are met cordially, others are greeted with anger and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the apology delegation, the bride's family may send a delegation of "pursuers" (''qughysnshy'') either to retrieve the bride or to verify her condition and honour the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent victimization survey in Kazakhstan (2018) included the crime of kidnapping of young women for marriage. 4% of married women answered that they were kidnapped at the time and that two thirds of these cases were consensual, the woman knew the man and had agreed with it up front. This means that about 1-1.5% of current marriages in Kazakhstan are the result of non-consensual abductions &lt;ref&gt; Van Dijk, J.J.M., Van Kesteren, J.N., Trochev, A. &amp; Slade, G.

Regardless of whether rape occurs or not, the woman is generally regarded as impure by her relatives, and is therefore forced to marry her abductor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwpr.net/?p=wpr&amp;s=f&amp;o=258105&amp;apc_state=henpwpr Azeri Bride Kidnappers Risk Heavy Sentences]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite a 2005 Azeri law that criminalised bride kidnapping, the practice places women in extremely vulnerable social circumstances, in a country where [[spousal abuse]] is rampant and recourse to law enforcement for domestic matters is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. State Department, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78801.htm ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – 2006'', Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Azerbaijan]], women abducted by bride kidnapping sometimes become slaves of the family who kidnap them.&lt;ref&gt;Sabina Kiryashova, [http://iwpr.net/report-news/azeri-bride-kidnappers-risk-heavy-sentences "Azeri Bride Kidnappers Risk Heavy Sentences"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in the car, the victim may be taken to a remote area or the captor's home.&lt;ref&gt;Gulo Kokhodze &amp; Tamuna Uchidze, ''Bride Theft Rampant in Southern Georgia''&lt;/ref&gt; These kidnappings sometimes include rape, and may result in strong stigma to the female victim, who is assumed to have engaged in sexual relations with her captor.&lt;ref&gt;''Violence Against Women in Georgia'', {{cite web |url=http://www.omct.org/pdf/VAW/2006/CEDAW_36th/CEDAW36_VAW_in_Georgia_en.pdf |title=Archived Document |accessdate=2008-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013121017/http://www.omct.org/pdf/vaw/2006/CEDAW_36th/cedaw36_vaw_in_georgia_en.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}; Ireland: Refugee Documentation Centre, [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4a360c7b19.html "Georgia: Bride-kidnapping in Georgia"], 8 June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Women who have been victims of bride kidnapping are often regarded with shame; the victim's relatives may view it as a disgrace if the woman returns home after a kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;''Bride Theft Rampant in Southern Georgia'', http://www.iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=321627&amp;apc_state=henh&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the kidnapping is a consensual elopement.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154425.htm 2010 Human Rights Report: Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] reports that prosecutors often refuse to bring charges against the kidnappers, urging the kidnap victim to reconcile with her aggressor.&lt;ref&gt;Georgia: Human Rights Developments, https://www.hrw.org/wr2k2/europe9.html&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcing the appropriate laws in this regard may also be a problem because the kidnapping cases often go unreported as a result of intimidation of victims and their families.&lt;ref&gt;United States State Department, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78813.htm Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Georgia]; Amnesty Int’l, "Georgia—Thousands Suffering in Silence: Violence Against Women in the Family", AI Index: EUR 56/009/2006, September 2006, at 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== East and South Asia ==

=== India ===
Marriage by abduction is also practiced by some patriarchal tribes of [[Central India]]. Usually, the groom carries away the bride and the villagers chase them. If they are not found after a few hours, they are considered to be married. There are however, different rules for different tribes.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

While not technically considered bride kidnapping, in Central India, among the [[Bhil people|Bhil tribe]], there is a large festival called [[Bhagoria Festival]] where matchmaking takes place in a peculiar manner. Girls dance in the inner circle and boys in the outer. When the music stops, a boy may elope with a girl.

Marriage by capture is slowly dying today. The Indian government disapproves of it but cannot do much as it comes under the personal laws of the tribal community.

===Pakistan===

An estimated one thousand Christian and Hindu women are kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam and marry Muslim men every year in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1098452 |title=1,000 minority girls forced in marriage every year: report |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223223436/https://www.dawn.com/news/1098452 |archive-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===

In Bali tradition, Balinese men historically must abduct women for marrying.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ikads.com/budaya/ngerorod/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hmong culture ===
Marriage by abduction also occurs in traditional [[Hmong customs and culture|Hmong culture]], in which it is known as ''zij  poj niam''.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Population Fund]], [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070817041522/http://www.unfpa.org/16days/documents/pl_bridenapping_factsheet.doc "Bride Kidnapping Fact Sheet"]; Nilda Rimonte, "A Question of Culture: Cultural Approval of Violence against Women in the Pacific-Asian Community and the Cultural Defense", ''Stanford Law Review'', Vol. 43, No. 6 (July 1991), pp. 1311–1326 [hereinafter Rimonte'', A Question of Culture''].&lt;/ref&gt; As in some other cultures, bride kidnapping is generally a joint effort between the would-be groom and his friends and family. Generally, the abductor takes the woman while she is alone. The abductor then sends a message to the kidnap victim's family, informing them of the abduction and the abductor's intent to marry their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Teng Moua, [http://www.uwstout.edu/lib/thesis/2003/2003mouat.pdf ''The Hmong Culture: Kinship, Marriage &amp; Family Systems''] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; If the victim's family manage to find the woman and insist on her return, they might be able to free her from the obligation to marry the man. However, if they fail to find the woman, the kidnap victim is forced to marry the man. The abductor still has to pay a bride price for the woman, generally an increased amount because of the kidnapping. Because of this increased cost (and the general unpleasantness of abduction), kidnapping is usually only a practice reserved for a man with an otherwise blemished chance of securing a bride, because of criminal background, illness or poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=George |last=Scott |title=The Migrants Without Mountains: The Sociocultural Adjustment Among the Lao Hmong Refugees In San Diego |year=1986 |type=PhD |publisher=University of California, San Diego |pages=82–85 |oclc=34162755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, members of the Hmong ethnic group have engaged in bride kidnapping in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;There is significant dissent in the Hmong-American community about the acceptability of bride capture. See {{cite journal |first=Madhavi |last=Sunder |title=Piercing the Veil |journal=[[Yale Law Journal]] |volume=112 |issue=6 |year=2003 |pages=1399–1472, at 1470 |doi=10.2307/3657449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the defendant has been allowed to plead a cultural defense to justify his abduction.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Ann Yang, "Marriage By Capture in the Hmong Culture: The Legal Issue of Cultural Rights Versus Women's Rights", ''Law and Society Review'' at UCSB, Vol. 3, pp. 38–49 (2004); Rimonte'', A Question of Culture'', p. 1311; Pat Schneider, "Police to Meet with Asians on Cultural Issues", ''Capital Times'' (Madison, Wisconsin), 13 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This defense has sometimes been successful. In 1985, Kong Moua, a Hmong man, kidnapped and raped a woman from a Californian college. He later claimed that this was an act of ''zij poj niam'' and was allowed to plead to [[false imprisonment]] only, instead of kidnapping and rape. The judge in this case considered cultural testimony as an explanation of the man's crime.&lt;ref&gt;Rimonte'', A Question of Culture'', p. 1311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Until the 1940s, marriage by abduction, known as ''qiangqin'' ({{zh|t=搶親|p=qiǎngqīn}}), occurred in regions of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;''See generally'' Anne E. McLaren, "Marriage by Abduction in Twentieth Century China", ''Modern Asian Studies'', vol. 4, pp. 953–984.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one scholar, marriage by abduction was sometimes a groom's answer to avoid paying a [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill Gates, ''China's Motor: A Thousand Years of Capitalism'', p. 131, cited in Anne E. McLaren, "Marriage by Abduction in Twentieth Century China", ''Modern Asian Studies'', vol. 4, p. 955.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the scholar argues, it was a collusive act between the bride's parents and the groom to circumvent the bride's consent.&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, p. 955.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Qiangqin'', though illegal in [[Qing Dynasty|imperial China]],  was common in rural areas, and often became a local "institution" that could be carefully planned and undertaken in a public context.&lt;ref&gt;Anne E. McLaren, "Marriage by Abduction in Twentieth Century China", ''Modern Asian Studies'', vol. 4, p. 957&lt;/ref&gt;

In one form of a typical ''qiangqin'', the abductor would arrive at a woman's house flanked by around twenty men. While the friends carried the woman away, the "groom" would use scissors to cut off the woman's panties. The woman, struggling to preserve her dignity, would be unable to adequately fight off her abductors. The victim would then be taken to the groom's house, where the marriage would be consummated.&lt;ref&gt;Anne E. McLaren, "Marriage by Abduction in Twentieth Century China", ''Modern Asian Studies'', vol. 4, pp. 959–960&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese scholars theorise that this practice of marriage by abduction became the inspiration for a form of institutionalised public expression for women: the bridal lament.&lt;ref&gt;Anne McLaren &amp; Chen Qinjian, "The Oral and Ritual Culture of Chinese Women: Bridal Lamentations of Nanhui", ''Asian Folklore Studies'', Vol. 59, No. 2 (2000), pp. 205–238, at 208.&lt;/ref&gt; In imperial China, a new bride performed a two- to three-day public song, including chanting and sobbing, that listed her woes and complaints. The bridal lament would be witnessed by members of her family and the local community.&lt;ref&gt;McLaren &amp; Qinjian, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years bride kidnapping has resurfaced in areas of China. In many cases, the women are kidnapped and sold to men in poorer regions of China, or as far abroad as [[Mongolia]]. Reports say that buying a kidnapped bride is nearly one tenth of the price of hosting a traditional wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Insight News TV, [http://www.insightnewstv.com/d08/ "China, Mongolia: Kidnapped Wives"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206041831/http://www.insightnewstv.com/d08/ |date=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of State]] tie this trend of abducting brides to China's [[one-child policy]], and the consequent [[gender imbalance]] as more male children are born than female children.&lt;ref&gt;United States State Department, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100518.htm Country Reports on Human Rights Practices  – 2007 (China)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Americas==
[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|The painting depicts a Chilean woman being kidnapped during a [[malón]].]]
The practice of kidnapping children, teenagers and women from neighbouring tribes and adopting them into the new tribe was common among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] throughout [[the Americas]]. The kidnappings were a way of introducing new blood into the group. Captured European women sometimes settled down as adopted members of the tribe and at least one woman, [[Mary Jemison]], refused "rescue" when it was offered.&lt;ref&gt;''Captured By Indians: Mary Jemison Becomes an Indian'' [http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5794/ History Matters]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Several reports of bride kidnapping for religious reasons have surfaced recently. Most known are the [[kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart]] in Utah and the [[kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard]] in California. Both perpetrators have been convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault. Other cases exist within some [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormonism]] around the Utah-Arizona border; however, accurate information is difficult to obtain from these closed communities. Most of these cases are usually referred to as [[forced marriage]]s, although they are similar to other bride kidnappings around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carolyn Jessop |author2=Laura Palmer |publisher= |title=Escape|year=2007|isbn=0767927567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
[[Image:Mexico states chiapas.png|thumb|Map of Chiapas, Mexico]]
Among the Tzeltal community, a [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] tribe in [[Chiapas]], Mexico, bride kidnapping has been a recurring method of securing a wife.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Stross, ''Tzeltal Marriage by Capture'', pp. 328–346.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tzeltal people are an indigenous, agricultural tribe that is organised patriarchally. Premarital contact between the sexes is discouraged; unmarried women are supposed to avoid speaking with men outside their families.&lt;ref&gt;Stross, pp. 334–335.&lt;/ref&gt; As with other societies, the grooms that engage in bride kidnapping have generally been the less socially desirable mates.&lt;ref&gt;Stross, pp. 340–341 (describing the grooms in marriage by capture as "poor . . . ugly . . . interested in girls who did not reciprocate their interest").&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tzeltal tradition, a girl is kidnapped by the groom, possibly in concert with his friends. She is generally taken to the mountains and raped. The abductor and his future bride often then stay with a relative until the bride's father's anger is reported to have subsided. At that point, the abductor will return to the bride's house to negotiate a bride-price, bringing with him the bride and traditional gifts such as rum.&lt;ref&gt;Stross, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
Among the [[Mapuche]] of Chile, the practice was known as ''casamiento por capto'' in Spanish, and ''ngapitun'' in [[Mapudungun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Course|first=Magnus|title=Becoming Mapuche: Person and Ritual in Indigenous Chile|year=2011|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252036477|pages=76, 173|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iWpYXYT-zsC&amp;pg=PA76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===Roma (Romani) communities===
Bride kidnapping has been documented as a marital practice in some [[Romani people|Romani]] community traditions. In the [[Romani society and culture|Romani culture]], girls as young as twelve years old may be kidnapped for marriage to teenaged boys.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Henry McDonald, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/23/ireland "Gardai hunt gang accused of seizing Roma child bride"], 3 September 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'', UK&lt;/ref&gt; As the Roma population lives throughout Europe, this practice has been seen on multiple occasions in [[Ireland]], [[England]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, "Gardai hunt gang accused of seizing Roma child bride"; OSCE, [http://www.osce.org/odihr/66044 "Building the Capacity of Roma Communities to Prevent Trafficking in Human Beings"], 2007, p. 17 ; Alexey Pamporov, [http://epc2006.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=60261 "Roma/Gypsy population in Bulgaria as a challenge for the policy relevance"]&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnapping has been theorised as a way to avoid a [[bride price]] or as a method of ensuring [[exogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pamporov, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexey Pamporov, [http://www.issrpl.org/programs/images/2011_pix/readings/Pamporov-Sold-like-Donkey.pdf "Sold like a donkey?

{{See also|Raptio}}
Marriage by capture was practised in ancient cultures throughout the [[Mediterranean area]]. It is represented in mythology and history by the tribe of Benjamin in the Bible;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Book of Judges]], [http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/judges/judges21.htm Chapter 21] in the Bible.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Greek hero [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] stealing the beautiful [[Helen of Troy]] from her husband [[Menelaus]], thus triggering the [[Trojan War]];&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Homer, ''The Iliad''.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[the Rape of the Sabine Women]] by [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]], the founder of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;See "Livy, 'The Rape of the Sabine Women'," in Mary R.

&lt;!--significant gap here between legendary times and the Christian Roman Empire--&gt;

In 326 A.D., the [[Constantine I|Emperor Constantine]] issued an edict prohibiting marriage by abduction. The law made kidnapping a public offence; even the kidnapped bride could be punished if she later consented to a marriage with her abductor.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Evans-Grubbs, "Abduction Marriage in Antiquity: A Law of Constantine (CTh IX. 24. I) and Its Social Context", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 79, (1989), pp. 59–83, at 59, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Spurned suitors sometimes kidnapped their intended brides as a method of restoring honor. The suitor, in coordination with his friends, generally abducted his bride while she was out of her house in the course of her daily chores. The bride would then be secreted outside the town or village. Though the kidnapped woman was sometimes raped in the course of the abduction, the stain on her honor from a presumptive consummation of the marriage was sufficient to damage her marital prospects irreversibly.&lt;ref&gt;Evans-Grubbs, pp. 60–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the "abduction" masked an [[Elopement (marriage)|elopement]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans-Grubbs, pp. 62, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The custom of ''[[fuitina]]'' was widespread in [[Sicily]] and continental [[southern Italy]]. In theory and in some cases it was an agreed elopement between two youngsters; in practice it was often a forcible kidnapping and rape, followed by a so-called "rehabilitating marriage" (matrimonio riparatore).&lt;ref name="Pirro"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pirro|first1=Deirdre|title=Italian Sketches: The Faces of Modern Italy|date=2009|publisher=TheFlorentinePress|isbn=9788890243448|page=94|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kK7y_GFLujkC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, this custom was brought to national attention by the case of [[Franca Viola]], a 17-year-old abducted and raped by a local small-time criminal, with the assistance of a dozen of his friends.  When she was returned to her family after a week, she refused to marry her abductor, contrary to local expectation.  Her family backed her up, and suffered severe intimidation for their efforts; the kidnappers were arrested and the main perpetrator was sentenced to 11 years in prison.

The exposure of this "archaic and intransigent system of values and behavioural mores"&lt;ref name="theflorentine.net"&gt;[http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=3143 "Franca Viola"] by Deirdre Pirro in ''The Florentine'' (issue no. 78/2008 / 30 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; caused great national debate. In 1968, Franca married her childhood sweetheart, with whom she would later have three children. Conveying clear messages of solidarity, [[Giuseppe Saragat]], then [[President of the Italian Republic|president of Italy]], sent the couple a gift on their wedding day, and soon afterwards, [[Pope Paul VI]] granted them a private audience. A 1970 film, ''[[La moglie più bella]]'' (''The Most Beautiful Wife'') by [[Damiano Damiani]] and starring [[Ornella Muti]], is based on the case. Viola never capitalised on her fame and status as a feminist icon, preferring to live a quiet life in [[Alcamo]] with her family.&lt;ref name="theflorentine.net" /&gt;

The law allowing "rehabilitating marriages" to protect rapists from criminal proceedings was abolished in 1981.&lt;ref name="Cleave07"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Cleave|first1=Rachel A.|title=Rape and the Querela in Italy: False Protection of Victim Agency|url=https://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=pubs|publisher=[[Golden Gate University School of Law]]|page=283|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pirro"/&gt;

===Ireland===
The inciting incident for the 12th-century [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] was an instance of wife-stealing: in 1167, the [[King of Leinster]] [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] had his lands and kingship revoked by order of the [[High King of Ireland]], [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]] as punishment for abducting the wife of another king in 1152. This lead Diarmait to seek the assistance of King [[Henry II of England]] in order to reclaim his kingdom.

The abduction of heiresses was an occasional feature in [[Ireland]] until 1800,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/60y/chapter3.htm {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/1312834636216809?url=http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/60y/chapter3.htm |date=11-08-08 }}&lt;!--DashBotWC--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

===Slavic tribes===
[[Image:Radzivill Olga-Avenge-to-Drevlians.jpg|left|thumb|Early Drevlian tribe in battle]]
[[East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes, [[History of Russia|predecessor tribes to the Russian state]], practised bride kidnapping in the eleventh century. The traditions were documented by [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian monk]] [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]]. According to his ''[[Primary Chronicle|Chronicles]]'', the [[Drevlian]] tribe captured wives non-consensually, whereas the [[Radimich]], [[Viatich]], and [[Severians|Severian]] tribes "captured" their wives after having come to an agreement about marriage with them.&lt;ref&gt;M. Kowalewsky, "Marriage among the Early Slavs", ''Folklore'', Vol. 1, No. 4 (Dec. 1890), pp. 463–480 [hereinafter Kowalewsky].&lt;/ref&gt; The clergy's increase in influence may have helped the custom to abate.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalewsky, p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage by capture occurred among the [[South Slavs]] until the beginning of the 1800s. Common in [[Serbia]], Montenegro, [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], the custom was known as ''otmitza''.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalewsky, pp. 475–476.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was mentioned in a statute in the [[Republic of Poljica|Politza]], the 1605 Croatian legal code.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalewsky, pp. 475–476; Maxime Kovalesky, ''Modern Customs and Ancient Laws of Russia'', London: David, Nutt &amp; Strand (1891), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; According to leading intellectual and Serbian folk-chronicler [[Vuk Karadzic]], a man would dress for "battle" before capturing a woman. Physical force was a frequent element of these kidnappings.&lt;ref&gt;Kovalesky, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bride kidnapping was also a custom in [[Bulgaria]]. With the consent of his parents and the aid of his friends, the abductor would accost his bride and take her to a barn away from the home, as superstition held that pre-marital intercourse might bring bad luck to the house. Whether or not the man raped his bride, the abduction would shame the girl and force her to stay with her kidnapper to keep her reputation. As in other cultures, sometimes couples would elope by staging false kidnappings to secure the parents' consent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mercia MacDermott]], ''Bulgarian Folk Customs'' (1998), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==

===Catholic law===
In [[Catholic]] [[canon law]], the [[Annulment#Annulment in the Catholic Church|impediment]] of ''[[Raptus#Raptus as abduction|raptus]]'' specifically prohibits marriage between a woman abducted with the intent to force her to marry, and her abductor, as long as the woman remains in the abductor's power.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Amans Ayrinhac, ''Marriage Legislation in the New Code of Canon Law'', Published by Benziger brothers, 1918, pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; According to the second provision of the law, should the woman decide to accept the abductor as a husband after she is safe, she will be allowed to marry him.&lt;ref name="Ayrinhac, pp. 160-161"&gt;Ayrinhac, pp. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt; The canon defines ''raptus'' as a "violent" abduction, accompanied by physical violence or threats, or fraud or deceit. The [[Council of Trent]] insisted that the abduction in ''raptus'' must be for the purpose of marriage to count as an impediment to marriage.&lt;ref name="Ayrinhac, pp. 160-161" /&gt;

===Islamic law===
{{See also|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}
Most [[Islam]]ic scholars take the view that forced marriage is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=She was forced to marry someone she did not want. Can she use contraceptive pills?|url=https://islamqa.info/en/47439|website=IslamQA|language=en|date=15 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===

Bride capture has been reflected in feature films from many cultures, sometimes humorously, sometimes as social commentary.

Bride kidnapping is depicted as a frontier solution in the 1954 Hollywood musical ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]''. The 1960 [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong film]] ''Qiangpin'' (''The Bride Hunter'') portrays the custom in the format of an all-female [[Shaoxing opera]] comedy, in which [[Xia Meng]] plays a gender-bending role as a man masquerading as a woman. Bride kidnapping is displayed somewhat humorously in [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s 1990 [[Cinema of Spain|Spanish hit]] ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!|¡Átame!]]'' (''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''), starring [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Victoria Abril]].  It is the underlying theme behind the 2005 [[Cinema of Korea|Korean movie]] ''[[The Bow (film)|The Bow]]''.  In the 2006 comedy ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', the eponymous fictional reporter [[Borat]], played by British comedian/satirist [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], attempts to kidnap Canadian actress [[Pamela Anderson]] in order to take her as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;"Kazakhstani comedian offers lesson in laughter", ''Darwin Palmerston Sun'' (Australia), 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He brings a "wedding sack" which he has made for the occasion, suggesting that such kidnappings are a tradition in his parody of [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [[Mary Wiltenburg]], "Backstory: The Most Unwanted Man in Kazakhstan", ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 30 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more serious note, a 1970 [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film]], ''[[La moglie più bella]]'' (''The Most Beautiful Wife'') by [[Damiano Damiani]] and starring [[Ornella Muti]], is based on the story of Franca Viola, described above.  However, before the national debate caused by the Viola case, a 1964 satire directed by [[Pietro Germi]], ''[[Seduced and Abandoned]]'' (''Sedotta e abbandonata''), treated the Sicilian custom as a dark comedy. The 2009 film ''[[Baarìa - la porta del vento]]'' shows a consensual ''fuitina'' in 20th-century Sicily (atypically having the couple enclosed in the girl's house) as the only way the lovers can avoid the girl's arranged marriage to a richer man.

Some Russian films and literature depict bride kidnapping in the [[Caucasus]].  There is a [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet comedy]] entitled ''[[Kidnapping, Caucasian Style]]'' ({{lang|ru|Кавказская пленница, или Новые приключения Шурика|italic=yes}}, literally translated as ''The Girl Prisoner of the Caucasus''), where a bride kidnapping occurs in an unidentified Caucasian country.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Bruce. "Good Russian Prisoner: Naturalizing Violence in the Caucasus Mountains" in ''Cultural Anthropology''. Vol. 20, No. 1 (Feb. 2005), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 Kyrgyz film ''[[Pure Coolness]]'' also revolves around the bride kidnapping custom, mistaken identity, and the clash between modern urban expectations and the more traditional countryside.

===Documentaries===
In 2005, a documentary film entitled ''[[Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan]]'' made by [[Petr Lom]] was presented at the UNAFF 2005 festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaff.org/2005/f_bride.html |title=UNAFF 2005 : Films : Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan |publisher=Unaff.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and [[Investigation Discovery]] (ID) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/kyrgyzstan/thestory.html |title=FRONTLINE/WORLD . Kyrgyzstan – The Kidnapped Bride . The Story |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film met controversy in Kyrgyzstan because of ethical concerns about the filming of real kidnappings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/kyrgyzstan/lom.html Peter Lom's view of the ethical controversy and the perception of his filming in Kyrgyzstan]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the website Vice.com did a full [https://web.archive.org/web/20111206044555/http://www.vice.com/vice-news/bride-kidnapping-in-kyrgyzstan-part-1 documentary film about bride kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan].

==In literature==

In Frances Burney's novel, ''[[Camilla (Burney novel)|Camilla]]'' (1796), the heroine's sister, Eugenia, is kidnapped by an adventurer called Alphonso Bellamy. Eugenia decides to stay with her husband on the grounds that she believes her word is a solemn oath. Eugenia is fifteen years old, and so underage, and is coerced into the marriage—both were grounds for treating the marriage as illegal.

A [[Sherlock Holmes]] story features bride kidnapping. In "[[The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist]]", a woman is employed as a [[governess]] by a man who knows that she will soon inherit a fortune, with the intent of a confederate marrying her. The ceremony does eventually occur, but is void.

The manga Otoyomegatari ''[[A Bride's Story]]'' takes place in central Asia. The heroine is married to a boy in an outside clan, but regrets regarding this decision occur when her original clan has problems bearing heirs. Her birth family comes to retrieve her with the intention of marrying her to someone else, but without success.  Her new family tells the invaders that the girl has been impregnated, which would be the last seal on the marriage.  They doubt this has occurred as the groom is very young and, desperate, they resort to a kidnap attempt, but again fail.

The fantasy novel ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' features marriage by capture (or "stealing a woman") as the traditional form of marriage north of the Wall. The Free Folk consider it a test for a man to "steal" a wife and outwit her attempts on his lifelong enough for her to respect his strength and come to love him. More often, though, marriages by capture are conducted between a couple already in love, an elopement without the extra element of attempted murder. [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] and Ygritte have such a marriage by capture, although at the time Jon was ignorant of the custom and thought he was merely taking her prisoner. The Ironborn are also known to practice this custom, taking secondary wives while reaving the mainland, which they refer to as "salt wives".

The Tamora Pierce fantasy novel [[The Will of the Empress]] includes bride kidnapping as a major plot point and has extensive discussions of the morality of bride kidnapping. Multiple characters are kidnapped for the purpose of marriage during the novel, which is used as a warning against it (in keeping with the women's rights focus of her series), particularly in the case of poor women or those without social support systems.

==In television==
In the BBC radio and television comedy series ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', the character [[Papa Lazarou]] comes to the fictional town of [[Royston Vasey]] under the guise of a peg-seller. He seeks to kidnap women by entering their homes, talking gibberish to them ([[Gippog]]) and persuading them to hand over their wedding rings. He 'names' them all 'Dave', and, after obtaining their rings, proclaims;  "you're my wife now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', [[Criminal Minds (season 4)|season 4, episode 13]] titled "Bloodline" depicts bride kidnapping.

The '''Church of the Holy Saviour in Chora''' ({{lang-el|Ἐκκλησία τοῦ Ἁγίου Σωτῆρος ἐν τῇ Χώρᾳ|}}, {{lang-tr|Kariye Müzesi, Kariye Camii, Kariye Kilisesi}}) is a medieval [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] Greek Orthodox church preserved as the Chora Museum in the [[Edirnekapı, Istanbul|Edirnekapı]] neighborhood of [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Ousterhout|1988}} The neighborhood is situated in the western part of the [[List of municipalities in İstanbul Province|municipality]] ([[:tr:Belediye|belediye]]) of the [[Fatih]] district. In the 16th century, during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, the church was converted into a mosque; it became  a museum in 1948. The interior of the building is covered with some of the oldest and finest surviving  Byzantine [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]es; they were uncovered and restored after the building was secularized and turned into a museum.

The Chora Church was originally built as part of a monastery complex outside the walls of [[Constantinople]], to the south of the [[Golden Horn]]. Literally translated, the church's full name was the '''Church of the Holy Saviour in the Country''':  although "The Church of the Holy Redeemer in the Fields" would be a more natural rendering of the name in English.  ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|ἡ Ἐκκλησία τοῦ Ἁγίου Σωτῆρος ἐν τῇ Χώρᾳ}}, ''hē Ekklēsia tou Hagiou Sōtēros en tēi Chōrai'').&lt;ref&gt;and therefore sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Saint Saviour"&lt;/ref&gt; The last part of that name, '''Chora''', referring to its location originally outside of the walls, became the shortened name of the church. The original church on this site was built in the early 4th century, and stood outside of the [[Walls_of_Constantinople#Wall_of_Constantine|4th century walls]] of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine the Great]]. However, when [[Theodosius II]] built his formidable [[Walls of Constantinople#Theodosian Walls|land walls]] in 413–414, the church became incorporated within the city's defences, but retained the name ''Chora''. The name must have carried symbolic meaning, as the mosaics in the [[narthex]] describe [[Christ]] as the ''Land of the Living'' ({{lang|grc|ἡ Χώρα τῶν ζώντων}}, ''hē Chōra tōn zōntōn'') and [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus]], as the ''Container of the Uncontainable'' ({{lang|grc|ἡ Χώρα τοῦ Ἀχωρήτου}}, ''hē Chōra tou Achōrētou'').

The majority of the fabric of the current building dates from 1077–1081, when Maria Dukaina, the mother-in-law of [[Alexius I Comnenus]], rebuilt the Chora Church as an [[Cross-in-square|inscribed cross]] or [[quincunx]]: a popular architectural style of the time. Early in the 12th century, the church suffered a partial collapse, perhaps due to an [[earthquake]]. The church was rebuilt by [[Isaac Komnenos (son of Alexios I)|Isaac Comnenus]], Alexius's third son. However, it was only after the third phase of building, two centuries after, that the church as it stands today was completed. The powerful Byzantine statesman [[Theodore Metochites]] endowed the church with many of its fine [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]s. Theodore's impressive decoration of the interior was carried out between 1315 and 1321. The mosaic-work is the finest example of the [[Palaeologus|Palaeologian]] Renaissance. The artists remain unknown. In 1328, Theodore was sent into exile by the usurper [[Andronicus III Palaeologus]]. However, he was allowed to return to the city two years later, and lived out the last two years of his life as a [[monk]] in his Chora Church.

In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the monastery was home to the scholar [[Maximus Planudes]], who was responsible for the restoration and reintroduction of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]'s [[Ptolemy's Geography|''Geography'']] to the Byzantines and, ultimately, to [[Renaissance Italy]]. During the last [[Fall of Constantinople|siege of Constantinople]] in 1453, the [[Icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] [[Hodegetria]], considered the protector of the City, was brought to Chora in order to assist the defenders against the assault of the [[Ottomans]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Millingen&lt;/ref&gt;

Around fifty years after the fall of the city to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Atık Ali Paşa, the [[Grand Vizier]] of Sultan [[Bayezid II]], ordered the Chora Church to be converted into a [[mosque]] — ''Kariye Camii''. Due to the [[iconoclasm|prohibition against iconic images]] in [[Islam]], the mosaics and frescoes were covered behind a layer of plaster. This and frequent earthquakes in the region have taken their toll on the artwork.

In 1948, Americans [[Thomas Whittemore]] and Paul A. Underwood, from the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] and the [[Dumbarton Oaks]] Center for Byzantine Studies, sponsored a restoration program. From that time on, the building ceased to be a functioning mosque. In 1958, it was opened to the public as a museum — ''Kariye Müzesi''.

== Interior ==
The Chora Church is not as large as some of the other surviving Byzantine churches of Istanbul (it covers 742.5 m²) but it is unique among them, because of its almost completely still extant internal decoration. The building divides into three main areas: the entrance hall or ''[[narthex]]'', the main body of the church or ''[[nave|naos]]'', and the side [[chapel]] or ''[[parecclesion]]''. The building has six [[dome]]s: two in the esonarthex, one in the parecclesion and three in the naos.

=== Narthex ===
The main, west door of the Chora Church opens into the [[narthex]]. It divides north-south into the ''exonarthex'' and ''esonarthex''.

==== Exonarthex ====

[[File:StPeter-mosaic-from-Chora-church-in-Istanbul.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Peter [[mosaic]]]]

The exonarthex (or outer narthex) is the first part of the church that one enters. It is a transverse corridor, 4 m wide and 23 m long, which is partially open on its eastern length into the parallel esonarthex. The southern end of the exonarthex opens out through the esonarthex forming a western ante-chamber to the parecclesion. The mosaics that decorate the exonarthex include:

# Joseph's dream and journey to Bethlehem;
# Enrollment for taxation;
# Nativity, birth of Christ;
# Journey of the Magi;
# Inquiry of King Herod;
# Flight into Egypt;
# Two frescoes of the massacres ordered by King Herod;
# Mothers mourning for their children;
# Flight of Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist;
# Joseph dreaming, return of the holy family from Egypt to Nazareth;
# Christ taken to Jerusalem for the Passover;
# John the Baptist bearing witness to Christ;
# Miracle;
# Three more Miracles.
# Jesus Christ;
# Virgin and Angels praying.

==== Esonarthex ====
[[File:HSX Mary genealogy.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the Virgin Mother with child, north dome of the inner narthex]]
[[File:Chora Christ south coupole.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]], south dome of the inner narthex]]

The esonarthex (or inner narthex) is similar to the exonarthex, running parallel to it. Like the exonarthex, the esonarthex is 4 m wide, but it is slightly shorter, 18 m long. Its central, eastern door opens into the naos, whilst another door, at the southern end of the esonarthex opens into the rectangular ante-chamber of the parecclesion. At its northern end, a door from the esonarthex leads into a broad west-east corridor that runs along the northern side of the naos and into the [[Prothesis (altar)|prothesis]]. The esonarthex has two domes. The smaller is above the entrance to the northern corridor; the larger is midway between the entrances into the naos and the pareclession.

# Enthroned Christ with [[Theodore Metochites]] presenting a model of his church;
# [[Saint Peter]];
# [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]];
# [[Deesis]], Christ and the Virgin Mary (without John the Baptist) with two donors below;
# Genealogy of Christ;
# Religious and noble ancestors of Christ.

The mosaics in the first three bays of the inner narthex give an account of the [[Life of the Virgin]], and her parents. Some of them are as follows:
# Rejection of [[Joachim|Joachim's]] offerings;
# Annunciation of [[Saint Anne]], the angel of the Lord announcing to Anne that her prayer for a child has been heard;
# Meeting of Joachim and Anne;
# Birth of the Virgin Mary;
# First seven steps of the Virgin;
# The Virgin given affection by her parents;
# The Virgin blessed by the priests;
# Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple;
# The Virgin receiving bread from an Angel;
# The Virgin receiving the skein of purple wool, as the priests decided to have the attendant maidens weave a veil for the Temple;
# [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] praying, when it was the time to marry for the Virgin, High Priest Zechariah called all the widowers together and placed their rods on the altar, praying for a sign showing to whom she should be given;
# The Virgin entrusted to Joseph;
# Joseph taking the Virgin to his house;
# [[Annunciation]] to the Virgin at the well;
# Joseph leaving the Virgin, Joseph had to leave for six months on business and when he returned the Virgin was pregnant and he is suspicious of that.

[[File:HSX Koimetesis.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the ''Koimesis'' in the Naos]]

=== Naos ===
The central doors of the esonarthex lead into the main body of the church, the ''naos''. The largest dome in the church (7.7 m diameter) is above the centre of the naos. Two smaller domes flank the modest [[apse]]: the northern dome is over the [[Prothesis (altar)|prothesis]], which is linked by short passage to the [[bema]]; the southern dome is over the [[diaconicon]], which is reached via the parecclesion.
# ''Koimesis'', the [[Assumption of Mary|Dormition of the Virgin]]. Before ascending to Heaven, her last sleep. Jesus is holding an infant, symbol of Mary's soul;
# Jesus Christ;
# ''Theodokos'', the Virgin Mary with child.

[[File:Chora Church Constantinople 2007 010.jpg|thumb|View into the ''[[parecclesion]]'']]

=== Parecclesion ===
To the right of the esonarthex, doors open into the side chapel, or ''parecclesion''. The parecclesion was used as a mortuary chapel for family burials and memorials. The second largest dome (4.5 m diameter) in the church graces the centre of the roof of the parecclesion. A small passageway links the parecclesion directly into the naos, and off this passage can be found a small oratory and a storeroom. The parecclesion is covered in [[fresco]]es:

# [[Resurrection|Anastasis]], the Resurrection. Christ, who had just broken down the gates of hell, is standing in the middle and pulling Adam and Eve out of their tombs. Behind Adam stand John the Baptist, David, and Solomon. Others are righteous kings;
# Second coming of Christ, the last judgment. Jesus is enthroned and on both sides the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist (this trio is also called the Deesis);
# Virgin and Child;
# Heavenly Court of Angels;
# Two panels of Moses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">The '''''chreia''''' or '''''chria''''' ({{lang-el|[[wikt:χρεία#Ancient Greek|χρεία]]}}) was, in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]], both a genre of literature and one of the [[progymnasmata]].

==Definition==

A chreia was a brief, useful (χρεία means "use") anecdote about a particular character.  That is, a chreia was shorter than a narration—often as short as a single sentence—but unlike a maxim, it was attributed to a character.  Usually it conformed to one of a few patterns, the most common being "On seeing..." (ιδών or ''cum vidisset''), "On being asked..." (ἐρωτηθείς or ''interrogatus''), and "He said..." (ἔφη or ''dixit'').&lt;ref&gt;On the meaning of ''chria'' cf. Quintilian, ''Institutio oratoria'' 1,9,4. and Seneca, ''Epistulae morales'' 33,7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The following chreia, the most common in ancient sources, is illustrative:

{{Quotation|[[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], on seeing a youth misbehaving, struck his [[pedagogy|paedagogus]], adding "Why do you teach such things?"}}

Chreiai could be silly:

{{Quotation|[[Olympias]], on hearing that her son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] was proclaiming himself the offspring of Zeus, said "Won't this fellow stop slandering me to Hera?"}}

Or solemn:

{{Quotation|A [[Sparta|Laconian]], who had become a prisoner of war and was being sold, on being asked by someone what he could do, said, "Be free."}}

Wise:

{{Quotation|[[Aristeides]], on being asked what justice is, said: "Not desiring the possessions of others."}}

Or witty:

{{Quotation|Diogenes, on being asked why people give to beggars but not to philosophers, said: "Because they suppose they might become lame and blind but they never suppose they might take up philosophy."}}

Or all of these:

{{Quotation|[[Socrates]] the philosopher, when a certain student named Apollodorus said to him, "The Athenians have unjustly condemned you to death," said with a laugh, "But did you want them to do it justly?"}}

As a literary genre the chreia was a subject of collection. Scholars such as [[Plutarch]] or [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] kept their own private collections of chreiai.  Published collections were also available.  The chreia is primarily known, however, for its role in education.  Students were introduced to simple chreiai almost as soon as they could read.  Later they practiced the complex grammar of Greek by putting these chreiai through changes of [[voice (grammar)|voice]] and [[grammatical tense|tense]].  As one of the last stages in their preparation for rhetoric—this is where chreiai serve as one of the progymnasmata—they would elaborate the theme of a chreiai into a formal eight-paragraph essay.  The student would praise, paraphrase, explain, contrast, compare, provide an example, make a judgment, and, in conclusion, exhort the reader.

Chreiai are also common in the [[New Testament]], mainly in the [[Gospel]]s. An example is in Mark 13: 1-2:

{{Quotation|And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down (King James Version.)}}

The famous passage in Luke 20: 21-25 also has the typical structure of a chreia, though its length is somewhat unusual:

{{Quotation|And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me? Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's. And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's. (King James Version.)}}

[[File:Net Neutrality Vigil (15727220061).jpg|thumb|Net Neutrality Vigil demonstrating, USA]]
A '''civil society campaign''' is one that is intended to mobilize public support and use democratic tools such as [[lobbying]] in order to instigate [[social change]]. [[Civil society]] campaigns can seek local, national or international objectives. They can be run by dedicated single-issue groups such as [[Infant formula|Baby Milk]] Action, or by professional [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs), such as the [[World Development Movement]], who may have several campaigns running at any one time. Larger coalition campaigns such as 2005's [[Make Poverty History]] may involve a combination of NGOs.

Effective campaigning can sometimes achieve much more than [[Divine grace|good works]] or giving to charity. For example, the [[Jubilee 2000]] debt campaign persuaded [[G7]] governments to cancel $100 billion of debt owned by poor countries, releasing more money for development than 1,000 years of [[Christian Aid]] in weeks. In the UK, ASH ([[Action on Smoking and Health]])’s campaign for a ban on smoking in public places in 2006 saved over 2,000 lives and billions of pounds a year. The [[Empty Homes Agency]] is working with UK [[Local government|local authorities]] to bring thousands of properties into use as a result of a successful amendment to the UK [[Housing Act 2004]].

Campaigning is increasingly recognised as an important way for NGOs to achieve their objectives. Many charities employ campaigners, produce campaigning materials and train their supporters to campaign. The [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]] says that “charities may undertake campaigning and political activity as a positive way of furthering or supporting their purposes.”&lt;ref&gt;Charity Commission, CC9 - Speaking Out - Guidance on Campaigning and Political Activity by Charities, &lt;www.charity-commission.gov.uk/publications/cc9.asp#2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisations, such as the [[Centre for Policy Studies]], want to keep charities and community groups out of politics. Many NGOs and community groups are wary of campaigning. They worry about being political or offending their funders.

The problems voluntary organisations deal with often need political action, as well as good works. Over 200 years ago there were charities for the welfare of slaves, but abolishing the institution of [[slavery]] was also necessary. There is still a lot wrong with the world about which to campaign. Not all problems can be solved by campaigning. Sometimes it is better to provide a service, as a private business, a [[social enterprise]] or a charity. But many problems are best solved by influencing the policies and actions of an industry, firm, public service or government rather than trying to fix them yourself.{{Says who|date=March 2011}}

Most campaigns are small, such as improving play space in a park, creating access for [[Disability|people with disabilities]] or changing work practices. Some tackle very big issues, like [[climate change]], world poverty and injustice. Many campaigns don’t get anywhere or make very slow progress. Some{{Who|date=March 2011}} even undermine their own cause, because they turn people off or make mistakes. Influencing others takes skill and knowledge as well as commitment.

== Lobbying ==
A key element of campaigning is researching and offering policy suggestions. A campaigning organisation will usually attempt to keep track of legislative processes, and mobilise its supporter base to provide mass lobbies at critical junctures. [1]

== Stunts and actions ==
While civil society campaigners may come from a range of political backgrounds, modern campaigning owes its largest debt to the ideas of the [[Situationists]], such as [[Guy Debord]], who recognised that as society falls increasingly under the thrall of the spectacle, it is impossible to generate political momentum without existing in the visual plane.
A frequent tactic of civil society campaigns is thus the deployment of high-profile stunts and actions to draw attention to their cause. An example of a stunt is the group [[Fathers4Justice]] dressing as popular superheroes and scaling tall buildings to draw attention to their cause. The occupation of the [[Brent Spar]] platform by [[Greenpeace]] to prevent [[exoskeleton|Shell]] dumping it at sea was an action rather than a stunt as it had intrinsic influence as well as generating publicity. [2]

== Direct Action ==
[[Direct action]] is politically motivated activity undertaken by individuals, groups, or governments to achieve political goals outside of normal social/political channels.

== Human Rights ==
[[Human rights]] refer to the "basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled." Campaigners use the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]], such as the [[right to life]] and liberty, [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], to further their cause.

== Using the Arts ==
Some campaigners use the arts to get their message across. For example, [[radical cheerleading]] is used at demonstrations to promote a radical message in a media-friendly, people-friendly way.

== Demonstrations ==
A [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] is a form of nonviolent action by groups of people in favor of a political or other cause, normally consisting of walking in a march and a meeting (rally) to hear speakers

== Petitions ==
A [[petition]] is a request to change something, most commonly made to a government official or public entity

== Social Media ==
The use of [[social media]] is helping campaigners to recruit members and communicate.  Social media can take many different forms, including [[Internet forums]], [[Blog|weblogs]], [[social blogs]], [[wikis]], [[podcasts]], pictures and video.

== Influencing Parliament ==
In the UK, Parliamentary Outreach works with NGOs to help them to understand Parliamentary processes

== Freedom of Information Legislation ==
Campaigners can now use [[Freedom of Information legislation]] to request Government held information and receive it freely or at minimum cost.

A '''clothes line''' or '''washing line''' is any type of [[rope]], cord, or [[twine]] that has been stretched between two points (e.g. two sticks), outside or indoors, above the level of the ground. [[Clothing]] that has recently been  washed is hung along the line to dry, using clothes pegs or [[clothespin]]s. Washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall, and are frequently located in [[back garden]]s, or on [[balconies]]. Longer washing lines often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing.

More elaborate rotary washing lines save space and are typically retractable and square or triangular in shape, with multiple lines being used (such as the [[Hills Hoist]] from Australia). Some can be folded up when not in use (although there is a very minor hazard of getting fingers caught, so there is usually a safety button).

In [[Scotland]], many [[tenement]] buildings have a "drying green", which is a communal area predominantly used for clothes lines – it may also be used as a recreational space - as well as a [[clothes horse]] connected to a pulley system inside which can be used in the frequently cold winter weather.

* Laundry items do not shrink (hot air from a mechanical [[clothes dryer]] may shrink items)
* No [[static cling]] and no perfume smells throughout the neighborhood from fabric softener and anti-static dryer sheets.
* Laundry items stay softer to the touch (mechanical clothes dryers tend to remove short, soft, fine fibers), and may be less wrinkled
* Laundry items often do not need ironing if line dried in a breeze
* Avoids the potential of airborne lint and reduced air quality
* Eliminates the noise from a mechanical clothes dryer
* Does not vent indoor air to the outside and waste the large volume of conditioned (heated or cooled) air that a mechanical dryer's blower does.
* For a simple line drying arrangement (rope and clothes pins) the repair and replacement costs are about $20.00 per 1,000 loads of laundry or 2 cents per load. For non-commercial mechanical clothes drying the repair and replacement costs (including labor expenses) are about $200.00 per 1,000 loads of laundry or 20 cents per load.

===Disadvantages===
* Putting laundry on a line usually takes more time than putting it into a mechanical dryer (as laundry items have to be hung up and fixed one by one).
* Laundry items need to be hung indoors during rainy weather, or may get wet if the weather changes.
* Neighbours may find it aesthetically unpleasant&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;
* Exposing dirty laundry can lessen privacy, showing information about inhabitants' living habits.
* Risk of theft or vandalism of clothes
* Environmental contaminants such as soil, dust, smoke, automotive or industrial pollutants, pollen and bird and animal droppings can come in contact with clothing.
* Clothespins can leave imprints (including rust from the spring) on the clothes.

==Drying laundry indoors==
[[File:Klestørk 3.jpg|thumb|Clothes drying indoors]]

Laundry may be dried indoors rather than outdoors for a variety of reasons including:

* inclement weather
* physical disability
* lack of space for a line
* reduce the damage to fabrics from sun's UV rays
* legal restrictions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/20_right_to_dry_states_outlaw_clothesline_bans_is_yours_among_them&lt;/ref&gt;
* to raise the humidity level indoors, and lower the air temperature indoors
* convenience
* to preserve privacy

Several types of devices are available for indoor drying. A [[drying rack]] or [[clotheshorse]] can help save space in an [[apartment]], or clothes lines can be strung in the [[basement]] during the winter. Small loads can simply be draped over furniture or a shower curtain pole. The drying time indoors will typically be longer than outdoor drying because of the lack of direct [[solar radiation]] and the [[convection|convective]] assistance of the wind.

The [[evaporation]] of the moisture from the clothes will cool the indoor air and increase the humidity level, which may or may not be desirable. In cold, dry weather, moderate increases in humidity make most people feel more comfortable.  In warm weather, increased humidity makes most people feel even hotter.  Increased humidity can also increase growth of fungi, which can cause health problems.

An average-sized wash load will convert approximately {{nowrap|4965 kilojoules}} of ambient heat into latent heat that is stored in the evaporated water, as follows. A typical 4&amp;nbsp;kg load of laundry can contain 2.2&amp;nbsp;kg of water, after being spun in a laundry machine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-clothes-tumble-dryers-work.html&lt;/ref&gt; To determine how much heat has been converted in drying a load of laundry, weigh the clothes when they are wet and then again after the clothes have dried. The difference is the weight of the water that was evaporated from them. Multiply that weight in [[Kilogram|kg]] by 2,257 kJ/kg,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fluids-evaporation-latent-heat-d_147.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enthalpy of vaporization|which is the heat of vaporization per kilogram]], to obtain the number of kilojoules that went into evaporating the water, or multiply by 0.6250 kWh/kg to get [[kilowatt-hours]]. (Note: If the moisture later [[condensation|condenses]] inside the house, the latent heat will be converted back into ambient heat which could increase the temperature of the air in the room slightly.) &lt;ref name="evaporation"&gt;Diamond, Sheldon R. (1970). Fundamental Concepts of Modern Physics. USA: AMSCO School Publications, Inc. pp. 205. "During evaporation... The surroundings thereby become the ultimate source of the energy required to change the phase of [water] from liquid to gas."&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain a good approximation of the effect this would have in a particular situation, the process can be traced on a [[Psychrometrics|psychrometric chart]].

==Factors that determine the drying duration==
Various factors determine the duration of drying and can help to decide rather to use a drier or a clothes line
* The environmental [[temperature]] - increase of temperature decreases the drying duration
* The environmental [[humidity]] - decrease of humidity will decrease the drying duration
* [[Wind]] velocity - Sometimes people put a [[Mechanical fan|fan]] near the clothes when drying them indoors
* Direct sun - usually only the external line will be exposed to direct sun, so usually people put the thickest clothes on the most external line.
* Cloth thickness

==Drying laundry in freezing conditions==

Laundry may be dried outdoors when the temperature is well below the freezing point. First, the moisture in the laundry items will freeze and the clothing will become stiff. Then the frost on the clothes will [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate into the air]], leaving the items dry. It takes a long time and it is usually much quicker to dry them indoors; however, indoor drying removes heat from the air so it is a trade-off between speed and energy efficiency.

==Controversy in North America==

Controversy surrounding the use of clothes lines has prompted many governments to pass "right-to-dry" laws allowing their use.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2068">[[File:Kokosnuss-Coconut.jpg|thumb|right|Coconut, one of the staples of the Nauruan people.]]

The '''cuisine of [[Nauru]]''' is the traditional cuisine of the [[island state]] on the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Due to the diversity of the country's inhabitants, the cuisine is highly diverse.

Nauru has the [[Obesity in Nauru|world's highest rate of obesity]].&lt;ref name="Forbes Fattest Countries"&gt;{{cite web|last=Streib|first=Lauren|title=World's Fattest Countries|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/07/worlds-fattest-countries-forbeslife-cx_ls_0208worldfat.html|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|date=2 August 2007|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic foods==
[[Image:Cononut milk.JPG|thumb|Coconut]]
Like its other island neighbors, Nauruans consume a large amount of seafood, as well as foods made from coconuts and bananas. [[Coconut milk]] is also used extensively in Nauru.

==Influences==
Nauruan cuisine is greatly influenced by [[Chinese cuisine]]. The Chinese are the major foreign community of the country, and there are a number of Chinese restaurants on the island, most notably in [[Yaren District|Yaren]]. In 2010, there were 138 Chinese restaurants in Nauru,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matthieur|first1=Paley|title=A typical Naurauan dish|url=http://paleyphoto.photoshelter.com/image/I0000LJmHUW5_JkM|website=Matthieur Paley Photography|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a country of hardly 10,000 people.

Nauruan cuisine also shows strong Western influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nauru Travel Profile|url=http://itap-world.com/news/australia/nauru/id/1646|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
The majority of Nauruans are Christians, and members of the [[Nauru Congregational Church]]. They often celebrate Christmas with cakes made from banana and coconut.

Some desserts, such as coconut mousse, are consumed on special occasions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3813">[[File:Mongols clothes man and woman.jpg|thumb|Mongolian '''deel''' for a man (left) and a woman (right). This type is especially used by [[Bayads]], one of the Tribes of Mongolia.]]
[[File:Przed rozpoczęciem lokalnego festiwalu Naadam (06).jpg|thumb|Men in traditional Mongolian costumes (deel) before starting of a local [[:en:Naadam|Naadam festival]] in [[Kharkhorin]]]]

A '''deel''' ({{lang-mn|дээл}} {{IPA-mn|deːɮ|}}; [[Buryat language|Buryat]]: дэгэл, {{IPA-mn|dɛɡɛɮ|}}) is an item of traditional clothing commonly worn since centuries ago among the [[Mongols]] and other nomadic tribes of [[Central Asia]], including various [[Turkic peoples]], and can be made from [[cotton]], [[silk]], wool, or [[brocade]]. 
The deel is still commonly worn by both men and women outside major towns, especially by herders. In urban areas, deels are mostly only worn by elderly people, or on festive occasions. The deel appears similar to a [[caftan]] or an old European folded [[tunic]]. Deels typically reach to below the wearer's knees and fan out at the bottom and are commonly blue, olive, or burgundy, though there are deels in a variety of other colors.

==Description==
The deel looks like a large overcoat when not worn. Instead of buttoning together in the middle, the sides are pulled against the wearer's body, the right flap close to the body with the left covering. On the right side of the wearer are typically 5 or 6 clasps to hold the top flap in place. There is one clasp below the armpit, three at the shoulder, and either one or two at the neckline.

A deel is traditionally worn with a large sash, usually made of [[silk]] but leather belts with large, ornate buckles have become more common in the modern era.  The area between the flaps and above the belt creates a large pocket in which Mongolians keep many things, Mongolian men will occasionally even carry silver bowl or cup, snuff box in their deel.  Though there is no major difference in material or outline between male and female deels, females tend to wear the "pocket" closer (that is, women often prefer a more snug-fitting deel), while males' may have both larger pockets, looser fit, and wider sleeves.

In Mongolia, the usage of the word deel has been extended to cover other long winter coats as well. For example, fur and leather overcoats of western design are referred to as "''nekhii deel''" and "''sawkhin deel''", respectively, meaning "fur deel", "leather deel" and "cashmere deel", which is made of the luxurious material [[cashmere wool|cashmere]].  Nevertheless, other Mongol regions, such as [[Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Bortala]] in [[Xinjiang]] retain the specific meaning of the word "deel" as the traditional garment, and refer to other overcoats as "''olondoi''".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Types==
Deel design varies among cultures, ethnic groups and time periods to a certain degree. There are even distinct variations among different Mongol tribes mostly on the design of the upper chest opening edges. For instance the [[Khalkha]] Mongol deel opening edges are round while a [[Buryat people|Buryat]] deel's is square. It can also vary among other tribes such as [[Chahar Mongols|Chakhar]], [[Torguud]], and [[Uzemchin]]. Deels are designed for different occasions and environments. The design also varies due to function. There are deels for ceremonies like weddings and holidays and deels for daily wear. Deels for special occasions have their outer layer made of [[silk]] while the common deels are usually made of wool, [[cotton]] and other relatively inexpensive materials.

==Incidence and causes==

Researcher Vicky Williamson at Goldsmiths, University of London, found in an uncontrolled study that earworms correlated with music exposure, but could also be triggered by experiences that trigger the memory of a song ([[involuntary memory]]) such as seeing a word that reminds one of the song, hearing a few notes from the song, or feeling an emotion one associates with the song.  The list of songs collected in the study showed no particular pattern, other than popularity.&lt;ref name="theworld" /&gt;

According to research by James Kellaris, 98% of individuals experience earworms. Women and men experience the phenomenon equally often, but earworms tend to last longer for women and irritate them more.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2901/why-do-songs-get-stuck-in-your-head|work=The Straight Dope|title=Why do songs get stuck in your head?|date=October 16, 2009|first=Cecil|last=Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kellaris produced statistics suggesting that songs with lyrics may account for 73.7% of earworms, whereas instrumental music may cause only 7.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/news/kellaris.htm|title=Songs That Cause The Brain To 'Itch': UC Professor Investigating Why Certain Tunes Get Stuck In Our Heads|last1=Hoffman|first1=Carey|date=2001-04-04|publisher=University of Cincinnati|accessdate=2012-08-06|quote=Of the 1,000 respondents, the kind of music respondents said they got stuck on most recently were songs with lyrics for 73.7 percent, jingles or ads for 18.6 percent and an instrumental tune for 7.7 percent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, published data in the ''[[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Psychology]]'' directly addressed the subject, and its results support earlier claims that earworms are usually 15 to 30 seconds in length and are more common in those with an interest in music.&lt;ref name=beaman/&gt;

==Cures==
Scientists at [[Western Washington University]] found that engaging [[working memory]] in moderately difficult tasks (such as [[anagram]]s, [[Sudoku]] puzzles, or reading a novel) was an effective way of stopping earworms and of reducing their recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9950143/Get-that-tune-out-of-your-head-scientists-find-how-to-get-rid-of-earworms.html|title=Get that tune out of your head – scientists find how to get rid of earworms|last=Gray|first=Richard|date=24 March 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2298444/Got-song-stuck-head-Solving-anagram-help-rid-it.html Got a song stuck in your head? Solving an anagram can help get rid of it], Daily Mail, 24 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another publication points out that melodic music has a tendency to demonstrate repeating rhythm which may lead to endless repetition, unless a climax can be achieved to break the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Machine Models of Music|page=174|first=Stephan M.|last=Schwanauer|first2=David A.|last2=Levitt|publisher=MIT Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-262-19319-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research reported in 2015 by the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences at the [[University of Reading]] demonstrated that [[chewing gum]] could help by similarly blocking the sub-vocal rehearsal component of auditory short-term or "working" memory associated with generating and manipulating auditory and musical images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR631000.aspx "Listen up – new research shows chewing gum could remove that stuck record in your head"], University of Reading, 22 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cases==
[[Jean Harris]], who murdered [[Herman Tarnower]], was obsessed with the song "[[Put the Blame on Mame]]", which she first heard in the film ''[[Gilda]]''. She would [[Intrusive thoughts|recall this regularly]] for over 33 years and could hold a conversation while playing it in her mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jean Harris' Obsessive Film Song Recall|first=Cora L.|last=Díaz de Chumaceiro|url=http://www.psyartjournal.com/article/show/de_chumaceiro-jean_harris_obsessive_film_song_recall|journal=PsyArt|date=October 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Please only include examples where an earworm is a significant part of the work, not merely an reference. Include a reference to a reliable source that indicates its significance. --&gt;

[[Mark Twain]]'s 1876 story "[[A Literary Nightmare]]" (also known as "Punch, Brothers, Punch") is about a [[jingle]] that one can get rid of only by transferring it to another person.

In 1943 [[Henry Kuttner]] published the short story "[[Nothing but Gingerbread Left]]" about a song engineered to damage the Nazi war effort, culminating in [[Adolf Hitler]] being unable to continue a speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://henrykuttner.bravehost.com/Kuttner,%20Henry%20-%20Nothing%20But%20Gingerbread%20Left.html|title=Nothing But Gingerbread Left|last=Kuttner|first=Henry|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314223346/http://henrykuttner.bravehost.com/Kuttner,%20Henry%20-%20Nothing%20But%20Gingerbread%20Left.html|archive-date=14 March 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=10 October 2017}} ''Full text of story''&lt;/ref&gt;

A short story, "Pie and Punch and You-Know-Whats" in [[Robert McCloskey]]'s 1951 [[Homer Price]] collection "Centerburg Tales" features a earworm from a jukebox that nearly infects the whole town.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki/Earworms|title=Zhurnaly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Alfred Bester]]'s 1953 novel ''[[The Demolished Man]]'', the protagonist uses a jingle specifically crafted to be a catchy, irritating nuisance as a tool to block mind readers from reading his mind.

In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1957 science fiction short story "[[The Ultimate Melody]]", a scientist, Gilbert Lister, develops the ultimate melody – one that so compels the brain that its listener becomes completely and forever enraptured by it. As the storyteller, Harry Purvis, explains, Lister theorized that a great melody "made its impression on the mind because it fitted in with the fundamental electrical rhythms going on in the brain." Lister attempts to abstract from the hit tunes of the day to a melody that fits in so well with the electrical rhythms that it dominates them completely. He succeeds and is found in a catatonic state from which he never awakens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://deoxy.org/alephnull/melody.htm|title=The Ultimate Melody by Arthur C. Clarke|work=The Web site of aleph|first=Michael|last=Chorost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Fritz Leiber]]'s [[Hugo Award]]-nominated short story "Rump-Titty-Titty-Tum-TAH-Tee" (1959), the title describes a rhythmic drumbeat so powerful that it rapidly spreads to all areas of human culture, until a counter-rhythm is developed that acts as an antidote.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JATrt8qhXqIC&amp;pg=PA218|title=The Wavewatcher's Companion|first=Gavin|last=Pretor-Pinney|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7475-8976-1|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]'s 1988 book ''[[Touching the Void (book)|Touching the Void]]'', he talks about not being able to get the tune "[[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]" by [[Boney M]] out of his head. The book tells of his survival, against the odds, after a mountaineering accident in the remote [[Siula Grande]] region of South America. Alone, badly injured, and in a semi-delirious state, he is confused as to whether he is imagining the music or really hearing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson |first=Joe|title=Touching the Void|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In episode 20 of [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants episodes#Season 7: 2009–2011|season 7]] of ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', entitled "Ear Worm" (2010), SpongeBob gets a song stuck in his head called "Musical Doodle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spongebob.nick.com/videos/clip/sponge-bob-ear-worm-clip-1.html|title=Ear Worm: Musical Doodle|publisher=Nick.com|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode refers to the earworm as a physical creature that enters one's head upon one's listening to a catchy song.

In the ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' episode titled "Head Band", a contagious group of [[virus]]es force their host to sing what they are saying to the same "boy band" tune. The only way to be cured of the Boy Band Virus is for the viruses to break up and start their own solo careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tv.com/shows/dexters-laboratory/head-band-stuffed-animal-house-used-ink-1591794/|title = Dexter's Laboratory: Head Band / Stuffed Animal House / Used Ink|date = |accessdate = 29 May 2014|website = TV.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. B. White]]'s 1933 [[Satire|satirical]] short story "The Supremacy of Uruguay" (reprinted in ''[[Timeless Stories for Today and Tomorrow]]'') relates a fictional episode in the history of Uruguay where a powerful earworm is discovered in a popular American song. The Uruguayan military builds a squadron of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|pilotless aircraft]] armed with [[phonograph]]s playing a highly amplified recording of the earworm, and conquers the entire world by reducing the citizens of all nations to mindless insanity. "[T]he peoples were hopelessly mad, ravaged by an ineradicable noise ... No one could hear anything except the noise in his own head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armandobronca.com/the-supremacy-of-uruguay_95|title=The Supremacy of Uruguay|publisher=www.armandobronca.com|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' titled "[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]", Sheldon obsesses about a tune stuck in his head. He eventually figures out that it is [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|"Darlin'"]] by [[The Beach Boys]].

The [[Wise Guys (band)|Wise Guys]], a German pop band/a cappella group, created a song called Ohrwurm&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TheDani708|title=wiseguys-Ohrwurm-lyrics|date=2012-03-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4rTYWjQkNU|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that tells a story about a man with a song stuck in his head that he can't get out and is designed to give you an earworm.

The '''National Flag of the [[Philippines]]''' ({{lang-fil|Pambansang Watawat ng Pilipinas}}) is a horizontal flag [[List of flags by design#Bicolour|bicolor]] with equal bands of [[royal blue]] and [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]], and with a white, equilateral triangle at the [[hoist (flag)|hoist]]. In the center of the triangle is a golden-yellow [[Sun (heraldry)|sun]] with eight primary rays, each representing a Philippine province.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=rays /&gt; At each vertex of the triangle is a five-pointed, golden-yellow star, each of which representing one of the country's three main island groups—[[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]], the central star originally referred to [[Panay]].&lt;ref&gt;Note: Panay is where Iloilo is located, the first province outside Luzon to have raised this flag.&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique feature of this flag is its ability to indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red side on top, which is effectively achieved by flipping the flag upside-down.&lt;ref name="flag blunder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20100927-294642/RP-flag-blooper-in-New-York-not-intentionalUS-embassy |title=RP flag blooper in New York not intentional—US embassy |via=INQUIRER.net |author=Jerry E.

The flag's length is twice its width, giving it an [[aspect ratio]] of 1:2. The length of all the sides of the white triangle are equal to the width of the flag. Each star is oriented in such manner that one of its tips points towards the vertex at which it is located.&lt;ref name=ra8491&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-8491.php |title=An Act Prescribing the Code of the National Flag, Anthem, Motto, Coat-of-Arms and Other Heraldic Items and Devices of the Philippines – Republic Act No. 8491 |date=February 12, 1998 |website=The Corpus Juris |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619235459/http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-8491.php |archivedate=2017-06-19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the gap-angle between two neighbours of the 8 ray-bundles is as large as the angle of one ray-bundle (so 22.5°), with each major ray having double the thickness of its two minor rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Official Gazette |url=http://www.gov.ph/1936/03/25/executive-order-no-23/ |title=Executive Order No. 23, s. 1936 – Description and Specification of the Filipino Flag |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828020342/http://www.gov.ph/1936/03/25/executive-order-no-23/ |archivedate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden sun is not exactly in the center of the triangle but shifted slightly to the right.

===Color===
The shade of blue used in the flag has varied over time, beginning with the original color ''lazuli Rosco''. The exact nature of this shade is uncertain, but a likely candidate is the blue of the [[Flag of Cuba|Cuban flag]], which a theory says influenced the flag's design.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Specifications for the flag's colors with shades matching those used in the American flag were adopted by the National Historical Institute in 1955. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] ordered the colors restored to the original light blue and red of the Cuban flag in 1985, but this was immediately rescinded after the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that removed him from power. For the 1998 independence centennial celebrations, the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines ([[Republic Acts of the Philippines|RA]] 8491) was passed, designating [[royal blue]] as the official variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ph-blue.html |title=Philippines: the shade of blue |accessdate=2007-12-22 |last=Quezon III |first=Manuel L. |date=2002-04-12 |work=Flags of the World|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818070335/http://www.fotw.net/flags/ph-blue.html|archivedate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
[[File:Sun Symbol of the National Flag of the Philippines.svg|thumb|Official design of the eight-ray sun&lt;br&gt;(3.75°-spacing)]]
[[File:Flag of the Philippines - cropped sun.svg|thumb|An erroneous design of the sun&lt;br&gt;(5°-spacing)]]
The Philippine national flag has a rectangular design that consists of a white equilateral triangle, symbolizing [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|liberty, equality, and fraternity]]; a horizontal blue stripe for peace, truth, and justice; and a horizontal red stripe for [[patriotism]] and [[Courage|valor]]. In the center of the white triangle is an eight-rayed golden sun symbolizing unity, freedom, people's democracy, and sovereignty. Each ray represents a province with significant involvement in the 1896 [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spain; these provinces are [[Manila (province)|Manila]], [[Bulacan]], [[Cavite]], [[Pampanga]], [[Bataan]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Batangas]], and [[Nueva Ecija]] (some sources specify other provinces as alternatives to some of these&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=rays /&gt;).&lt;ref name="declaration"&gt;[[s:Philippine Declaration of Independence|Philippine Declaration of Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=malacanang&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/3846-origin-of-the-symbols-of-our-national-flag/|title=Origins of the Symbols of the National Flag|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610205018/http://malacanang.gov.ph/3846-origin-of-the-symbols-of-our-national-flag/|archivedate=2013-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the Declaration of Independence and a research by UP Professor Ambeth Ocampo, the rays of the sun symbolized the first 8 provinces of the Philippines which was declared under martial law during the First Philippine Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBqdSb-KkL0|title=Philippine Readers and Writers Festival 2016 - Independence x 6|first=|last=nbsalert|date=13 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428004012/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBqdSb-KkL0|archivedate=28 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three five-pointed stars, one for each of the triangle's points, stand for the three major island groups where the revolution started: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]].

The flag's original symbolism is enumerated in the text of the independence proclamation, which makes reference to an attached drawing, though no record of the drawing has surfaced.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;  The proclamation explains the flag as follows:
{{Quotation|{{cquote|''And finally it was resolved unanimously that this Nation, already independent from today should use the same flag which it has used,  whose shape and colors are described in the attached drawing rendering realistically the three aforementioned forces representing the white triangle as the distinctive symbol of the famed Society of the Katipunan, which through the blood compact impelled the masses to rise in revolt; the three stars representing the three principal islands of this Archipelago — Luzon, Mindanao, and Panay (Visayas) in which the revolutionary movement broke out; the sun indicating the gigantic steps taken by the children of this country on the road to progress and civilization; the eight rays symbolizing the eight provinces of the Philippines,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=rays /&gt; and the colors of blue, red and white commemorating the flag of the United States of North America as a manifestation of our profound gratitude towards this Great Nation for its disinterested protection which it lends us, and continues to lend us.  And, carrying this flag, I unfurl it before the gentlemen assembled here—[List of names of the delegates]—and we all solemnly swear to acknowledge and defend it to the last drop of our blood.''}}}}

The symbolism given in the 1898 [[Proclamation of Philippine Independence]] differs from the current official explanation. According to the document, the white triangle signifies the emblem of the [[Katipunan]], the secret society that opposed Spanish rule. It says the flag's colors commemorate the [[flag of the United States]] as a manifestation of gratitude for American aid against the Spanish during the [[Philippine Revolution]]. It also says that one of the three stars represents the island of [[Panay]], rather than the entire [[Visayas|Visayan islands]]. Panay, which recent interpretations call as ''"as representative of the entire Visayas region"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ph/2015/06/12/english-speech-of-president-aquino-at-the-celebration-of-independence-day-2015/ |title=[English] Speech of President Aquino at the celebration of Independence Day |date=June 12, 2015 |work=Official Gazette |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227151727/http://www.gov.ph/2015/06/12/english-speech-of-president-aquino-at-the-celebration-of-independence-day-2015/|archivedate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proclamation also declares that the sun represents the gigantic steps made by the sons of the country along the path of Progress and Civilization, and lists [[Bataan]] instead of Tarlac among the eight provinces symbolized by the sun's rays.

==History==

===Historical flags of the Philippine Revolution===
{{see also|Flags of the Philippine Revolution}}
It has been common since the 1960s to trace the development of the Philippine flag to the various war standards of the individual leaders of the [[Katipunan]], a pseudo-[[Freemasonry|masonic]] revolutionary movement that opposed Spanish rule in the Philippines and led the [[Philippine Revolution]].&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ph-hist.html |title=History of the Philippines Flag |accessdate=2007-06-06 |last=Quezon |first=Manuel L. III |date=2002-04-02 |publisher=Flags of the World|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205225309/http://www.fotw.net/flags/ph-hist.html|archivedate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while some symbols common to the Katipunan flags would be adopted into the iconography of the Revolution, it is inconclusive whether these war standards can be considered precursors to the present Philippine flag.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

&lt;gallery class="center" heights="100px" widths="150px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The first flag of the Katipunan was a red rectangular flag with a horizontal alignment of three white Ks (an acronym for the Katipunan's full name, ''Kataas-taasang Kagalang-galangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan'' - Supreme and Venerable Society of the Sons of the Nation). The flag's red field symbolized blood, as members of the Katipunan signed their membership papers in their own blood.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

The various leaders of the Katipunan, such as [[Andrés Bonifacio]], [[Mariano Llanera]], and [[Pío del Pilar]], also had individual war standards. The organization was represented in [[Cavite]] province by two factions: the ''Magdiwang'' faction and the ''Magdalo'' faction, with each adopting a flag. Both used a white sun. Instead of the letter K the flags bore the symbol for the syllable ''ka'' in [[Baybayin]], the pre-Hispanic writing script of the Tagalogs.

The Katipunan adopted a new flag in 1897 during an assembly at [[Naic, Cavite]]. This new flag was red and depicted a white sun with a face. The sun had eight rays, representing eight provinces of the Philippines.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=rays /&gt;

===Current flag===
The earlier design of the current Philippine flag was conceptualized by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] during his exile in [[British Hong Kong]] in 1897. The first flag was sewn by Marcela Mariño Agoncillo,  with the help of her daughter Lorenza and [[Delfina Herbosa Natividad]] (a niece of ''Propagandista'' [[José Rizal]]). It was first displayed in the [[Battle of Alapan]] on May 28, 1898.

[[File:Philippines flag.jpg|thumb|right|Flag of the Philippines at the [[Philippine International Convention Center]]]]
The flag was formally unfurled during the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|proclamation of independence]] on June 12, 1898 in [[Kawit, Cavite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Renato Perdon|title=Footnotes to Philippine History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqKsKUUSNNQC|year=2010|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=978-1-59942-842-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vqKsKUUSNNQC&amp;pg=PA38 38]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Manila Times]] article by Augusto de Viana, Chief History Researcher, National Historical Institute, mentions assertions in history textbooks and commemorative rites that the flag was first raised in Alapan, [[Imus, Cavite]], on May 28, 1898, citing Presidential Proclamation No. 374, issued by then-President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] on March 6, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The original design of the flag adopted a mythical sun with a face influenced by [[Flags of South America|Latin American republics]] [[Argentina]], [[Peru]], and [[Uruguay]]; a triangle, representing the Katipunan which inspired by the Eye of Providence in the [[Great Seal of the United States]] and the Masonic Triangle and which enshrined [[Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité]]; the stripes and colors derived from the [[flag of the United states|American flag]]. The particular shade of blue of the original flag has been a source of controversy. Based on anecdotal evidence and the few surviving flags from the era, historians argue that the colors of the original flag was influenced by the flags of [[flag of Cuba|Cuba]] and [[flag of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

During the session of the [[Malolos Republic|Malolos Congress]], Aguinaldo presented the symbolism of the official flag to the members, delegates and representatives of the assembly as follows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=INQUIRER.net |author=Ambeth R. Ocampo |date=June 12, 2018 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/999863/flag-unites-archipelago-into-one-nation |title=Flag unites archipelago into one nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

{{quotation|The Flag bears three colors, three stars, and a sun, the meaning of which are as follows: the red is symbolic of Filipino courage which is second to none, and was the color used during the war in the province of Cavite since the 31st of August 1896, until the Peace of Biak-na-Bato [in 1897]; the blue carries an allegorical meaning that all Filipinos will prefer to die before submitting ourselves to the invader, whoever he may be; the white conveys the idea that, like other nations, the Filipinos know how to govern themselves, and that they do not recede from observation of foreign powers. The sun and its rays stirred up Filipinos and spread the light over their world, piercing the clouds that enshrouded it; it is now the light which brightens every spot in the Philippine islands, and under its influence the Itas, Igorots, Manguians, and Moros, all of whom I believe were made in the image of God, and whom I recognize as our brethren, now come down from the mountains to join with us}}

The original flag that was first hoisted on May 28, 1898 and unfurled during the Declaration of independence on June 12, 1898 is being preserved at the Gen Emilio Aguinaldo Museum in [[Baguio City]]. There were plans to restore the flag by replacing the worn-out portion but the idea was abandoned because matching threads could not be found. The flag is more elaborate than the flag which is currently in use. It bears the embroidered words, ''Libertad, Justicia and Ygualidad'' (Liberty, Justice and Equality) on one side of the flag and ''Fuerzas Expedicionarias del Norte de Luzon'' (Expeditionary forces of Northern Luzon) on the other&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/31121-ph-flag-first-flown-in-1898-go-to-baguio|title=Want to see PH flag first flown in 1898?

Hostilities broke out between the Philippines and the United States in 1899. The flag was first flown with the red field up on February 4, 1899 to show that a state of war existed. Aguinaldo was captured by the Americans two years later, and swore allegiance to the United States.

With the defeat of the Philippine Republic, the Philippines was placed under American colonial rule and the display of the Philippine flag was declared illegal by the Sedition Act of 1907. This law was repealed on October 24, 1919.&lt;ref name=nhcp-flag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhcp.gov.ph/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=760|title=The Declining Reverence for the Philippine Flag|publisher=[[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426153938/http://www.nhcp.gov.ph/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=760|archivedate=April 26, 2013|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the legalization of display of the Philippine flag, the cloth available in most stores was the red and blue of the [[flag of the United States]], so the flag from 1919 onwards adopted the "National Flag blue" color. On March 26, 1920, the [[Philippine Legislature]] passed Act. No 2928 on March 26, 1920, which legally adopted the Philippine flag as the official flag of the Philippine Islands.&lt;ref name=nhcp-flag /&gt; Up until the eve of World War II, [[Flag Day]] was celebrated on annually on October 30, commemorating the date the ban on the flag was lifted.

The [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was inaugurated in 1935. On March 25, 1936, President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] issued Executive Order No. 23 which provided for the technical description and specifications of the flag.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; Among the provisions of the order was the definition of the triangle at the hoist as an [[equilateral triangle]], the definition of the aspect ratio at 1:2, the precise angles of the stars, the geometric and aesthetic design of the sun, and the formal elimination of the mythical face on the sun. The exact shades of colors, however, were not precisely defined. These specifications have remained unchanged and in effect to the present. In 1941, Flag Day was officially moved to June 12, commemorating the date that Philippine independence was proclaimed in 1898.

The flag was once again banned with the Japanese invasion and occupation of the Philippines beginning in December 1941, to be hoisted again with the establishment of the Second Republic of the Philippines, a client state of Japan. In ceremonies held in October 1943, Emilio Aguinaldo hoisted the flag with the original Cuban blue and red colors restored. The flag was initially flown with the blue stripe up, until President [[José P. Laurel]] proclaimed the existence of a state of war with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] in 1944. The Commonwealth government-in-exile in Washington, D.C. continued to use the flag with the American colors, and had flown it with the red stripe up since the initial invasion of the Japanese. With the combined forces of the Filipino &amp; American soldiers and the liberation of the Philippines in 1944 to 1945, the flag with the American colors was restored, and it was this flag that was hoisted upon the granting of Philippine independence from the United States on July 4, 1946.

===Ninth ray for the flag's sun===
[[File:Philippine flag (proposed 9 ray sun).svg|thumb|Sun in the Philippine flag with the proposed 9th ray.]]
====As representative of a ninth province====
Prior to the 1998 independence centennial celebrations, the provincial government of [[Zambales]] lobbied that the sunburst design accommodate a ninth ray, reasoning that their province was also in a state of rebellion in 1896. The Centennial Commission however refuted this change, based on research by the National Historical Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.us/flags/ph-hist2.html#rays|title=Adjusting the rays of the flag?|accessdate=2008-06-15|date=1998-03-09|work=Flags of the World|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627224822/http://www.fotw.us/Flags/ph-hist2.html#rays|archivedate=2008-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2003, then Foreign Affairs Secretary [[Blas Ople]] also lobbied for a ninth ray, saying that [[Quezon province]] should be added. He reasons that the first uprising against the Spaniards happened at the foot of [[Mount Banahaw]] which was led by [[Hermano Pule]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mallari|first1=Delfin|title=Ople urges putting of Quezon in rays of Philippine flag|accessdate=2014-07-23|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=2003-08-20|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&amp;dat=20030820&amp;id=uERaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZSUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3144,16334224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As representative of an ethnic group====
{{as of|2018|6}}, there is a proposal to add a ninth ray to the Philippine flag's sun to represent the [[Moro people]] or Filipino Muslims, as well as other indigenous groups as well for their role against colonization.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Senator [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] filed Senate Bill No. 2590 which aimed to amend Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines in 2008. This measure was later substituted by Senate Bill No. 3307 which was sponsored by Senator [[Francis Escudero]] which was approved in September 2009. The bill was sent to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] for concurrence&lt;ref name="onemoreray"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ventura |first1=Dinah |title=One more ray, the way to unity |url=http://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2018/06/13/one-more-ray-the-way-to-unity/ |accessdate=13 June 2018 |work=Daily Tribune |date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ubac |first1=Michael Lim |title=RP flag to have 9th ray to the sun |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090924-226635/RP-flag-to-have-9th-ray-to-the-sun |accessdate=13 June 2018 |work=Philippine Daily Inquire |date=24 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601183939/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090924-226635/RP-flag-to-have-9th-ray-to-the-sun |archivedate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came up with House Bill 6424.

{{as of|2014}}, the Ninth Ray movement is among the prominent groups pushing for the addition of a ninth ray to the flag's sun. Proponents of the movement believe that a ninth ray should be added to represent the Muslim and indigenous people of the country who kept colonizers away from their lands.&lt;ref name=fourthstar&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cabreza|first1=Vincent|title=Place for Sabah in flag sought|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/69001/place-for-sabah-in-flag-sought/|accessdate=22 October 2014|date=13 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106094212/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/69001/place-for-sabah-in-flag-sought/|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth star===
{{see also|North Borneo dispute}}
Emmanuel L. Osorio, one of the founders of the Ninth Ray movement, came up with a proposal adding not only a ninth ray to the flag's sun but also adding a fourth star to the flag representing [[North Borneo]] (present-day [[Sabah]]), a territory claimed by the Philippines but currently under [[Malaysia]]n sovereignty. The flag's triangle is changed into a rectangle to accommodate a fourth star. According to Osorio, the star representing Sabah in his proposed flag was added "in principle" and said the flag proposal seeks to express the Ninth Ray movement's view that "if we get Sabah, then it could be represented by the star".&lt;ref name=fourthstar /&gt;

===Crescent moon===
There have been numerous proposals as to how the crescent moon should be incorporated into the flag, including one such proposal from former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1370&amp;dat=19950611&amp;id=Ja8mAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FAsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2144,1752616|title=Crescent moon in flag soon?|date=June 11, 1995|newspaper=Manila Standard|author=Fel V.

==Usage==

===Display===

The flag should be displayed in all government buildings, [[official residence]]s, [[plaza|public plazas]], and schools every day throughout the year. All other places as may be designated by the National Historical Commission as such.&lt;ref&gt;On May 12, 2010, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Republic Act No. 10086 reverting the National Historical Institute into its original form as the [[National Historical Commission]] of the Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; The days of the 28th of May (National Flag Day) and the 12th of June (Independence Day) are designated as flag days, during which all offices, agencies and instrumentalities of government, business establishments, institutions of learning and private homes are enjoined to display the flag.&lt;ref name=ra8491/&gt; But in recent years, the flag days are now from May 28 to June 30 yearly to promote patriotism and to celebrate the nation's independence.

By law, the Philippine flag must be permanently hoisted and illuminated at night at the following locations:&lt;ref name=ra8491 /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The display of the Philippine flag in [[Cockfight|cockpit arenas]], casinos, disco venues, night and day clubs, gambling joints and "places of vice or where frivolity prevails" is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Acosta |first1=Persida |title=Improper display of the Philippine flag |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/improper-display-philippine-flag/310399/ |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=Manila Times |date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Half-mast====
[[File:Philippine Flag in half-mast (Rizal Pak, Manila; 2015).jpg|upright|thumb|The Philippine flag at Rizal Park, flown at half-mast on January 30, 2015, during the ''National Day of Mourning'' in the aftermath of the [[Mamasapano clash]]]]
The flag may be flown at [[half-mast]] as a sign of mourning.&lt;ref name=ra8491 /&gt; Upon the official announcement of the death of the [[President of the Philippines|President]] or a former President, the flag should be flown at half-mast for ten days. The flag should be flown at half-mast for seven days following the death of the [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]], the [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]], the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|President of the Senate]] or the [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]].

The flag may also be required to fly at half-mast upon the death of other persons to be determined by the National Historical Institute, for a period less than seven days. The flag shall be flown at half-mast on all the buildings and places where the decedent was holding office, on the day of death until the day of interment of an incumbent member of the Supreme Court, the Cabinet, the Senate or the House of Representatives, and such other persons as may be determined by the National Historical Commission.

When flown at half-mast, the flag should be first hoisted to the peak for a moment then lowered to the half-mast position. It should be raised to the peak again before it is lowered for the day.

A bill was filed on 2014, to mandate the flying of the flag at half-mast as a tribute to public school teachers. Under the proposal the flag shall be flown at half-mast for at least five days at the school or district office the deceased teacher was assigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Salaverria |first1=Leila |title=Bill wants flag flown at half mast for public school teachers who die |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/587318/bill-wants-flag-flown-at-half-mast-for-public-school-teachers-who-die |accessdate=27 June 2018 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In wakes and burials====
The flag may also be used to cover the caskets of the dead of the military and civil uniformed services, veterans of previous wars, national artists, and outstanding civilians as determined by the local government. In such cases, the flag must be placed such that the white triangle is at the head and the blue portion covers the right side of the casket. The flag should not be lowered to the grave or allowed to touch the ground, but should be solemnly folded and handed to the heirs of the deceased.

====As a war ensign====

The Philippines does not utilize a separate [[war flag]]; instead, the national flag itself is used for this purpose.&lt;ref name=ra8491 /&gt; To indicate a state of war, the red field is flown upwards and is placed on the right (i.e., the observer's left) when hung vertically.

The only instance that the flag was not oriented with red as superior in a state of war was at its debut during the [[Battle of Alapan]] in 1898, 15 days before the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] in Kawit, Cavite.

===In intellectual property===
The Philippine Flag itself is not eligible to be [[trademarked]] according to the [[Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines]] (IPOPHIL) since the flag is "owned by the public" in line with prohibitions on the flag's usage stated in Republic Act 8491.&lt;ref name=ra8491 /&gt; The [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], which the Philippines is a member of, also prohibits the registration of the state flags of its members as trademark. However both small and large businesses in the Philippines have used elements of the Philippine flag for their intellectual property. When it comes to this concern, the IPOPHIL has allowed businesses to use elements of the flag to invoke the national symbol as long as the intellectual property is neither a "true representation" of the Philippine flag nor a "modification that would amount to defacement of the flag".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Philippine Flag as a trademark |url=https://www.ipophil.gov.ph/releases/2014-09-22-06-26-21/770-the-philippine-flag-as-a-trademark |accessdate=27 June 2018 |publisher=Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines |date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibited acts===
[[File:Flag of the Philippines (vertical display).svg|thumb|Section 10 of RA 8491 states that when the flag is displayed on a wall during peacetime, the blue field is to the observers' left, as shown here.&lt;ref name=ra8491 /&gt;]]
According to '''Republic Act 8491''' itself, it shall be prohibited:&lt;ref name=ra8491 /&gt;
:a) To mutilate, deface, defile, trample on or cast contempt or commit any act or omission casting dishonor or ridicule upon the flag or over its surface;
:b) To dip the flag to any person or object by way of compliment or salute;
:c) To use the flag:
::1) As a drapery, festoon, tablecloth;
::2) As covering for ceilings, walls, statues or other objects;
::3) As a pennant in the hood, side, back and top of motor vehicles;
::4) As a staff or whip;
::5) For unveiling monuments or statues; and
::6) As trademarks, or for industrial, commercial or agricultural labels or designs.
:d) To display the flag:
::1) Under any painting or picture;
::2) Horizontally face-up. It shall always be hoisted aloft and be allowed to fall freely;
::3) Below any platform; or
::4) In discothèques, cockpits, night and day clubs, casinos, gambling joints and places of vice or where frivolity prevails.
:e) To wear the flag in whole or in part as a costume or uniform;
:f) To add any word, figure, mark, picture, design, drawings, advertisement, or imprint of any nature on the flag;
:g) To print, paint or attach representation of the flag on handkerchiefs, napkins, cushions, and other articles of merchandise;
:h) To display in public any foreign flag, except in embassies and other diplomatic establishments, and in offices of international organizations;
:i) To use, display or be part of any advertisement or infomercial; and
:j) To display the flag in front of buildings or offices occupied by aliens.

The Act mandates that violators shall, upon conviction, be punished by fine or imprisonment.&lt;ref name=ra8491 /&gt;

==Relevant customs==
===Pledge===
{{main article|Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag}}
[[File:PH4-070416.jpg|thumb|Government employees and officials raising their right hand for the pledge of allegiance to the Philippine flag.]]
[[File:PH flags near ccp.jpg|thumb|left|Philippine flags on bamboo poles]]
The Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine flag (distinct from the [[Oath of Allegiance (Philippines)|Patriotic Oath of Allegiance]]) should be recited while standing with the right hand with palm open raised shoulder high. Individuals whose faith or religious beliefs prohibit them from making such pledge are permitted to excuse themselves, but are required by law to show full respect when the pledge is being rendered by standing at attention.&lt;ref name=ra8491 /&gt;

The law makes no statement regarding the language in which the pledge must be recited, but the pledge is written (and therefore recited) in the [[Filipino language]].

===Flag anthem===
{{main article|Lupang Hinirang}}
Spanish, Tagalog and English versions of the national anthem have been given official status throughout Philippine history. However, only the most recent and current "Filipino" version is officially recognized by law. The Flag and Heraldic Code, approved on February 12, 1998 specifies, ''Lupang Hinirang'', "The National Anthem shall always be sung in the national language within or without the country";&lt;ref name=ra8491 /&gt; violation of the law is punishable by a fine and imprisonment.

===National Flag Day===
The National Flag Day in the Philippines is celebrated every May 28, the very day of the 1898 [[Battle of Alapan]]. The official National Flag flying period starts from May 28 and ends on Independence Day, June 12, every year, although the flying period for the flag in homes, businesses and public establishments may start on a specified day of May (to be given by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines) and may last until June 30.

A '''gender reveal''' party is a celebration where either the guests, the expecting parents, or both find out the [[sex]] of the baby.

== Description ==
{{see also|List of historical sources for pink and blue as gender signifiers}}
The gender reveal party can be seen as an analogue of the [[baby shower]], which also employs the trope of [[baby pink|pink]] (denoting a female) or [[baby blue|blue]] (denoting a male) to designate gender. However, it is typically held earlier, near the moment, formerly private, when parents learn the baby's predicted sex. Gender reveal parties also typically are open to men and women, unlike the traditionally all-female baby shower. The rise of the gender reveal party seems "inextricably tied to social media." [[YouTube]] searches report that there are "more than 500,000 videos of expectant couples slicing cakes, setting off smoke bombs and bashing pi&amp;ntilde;atas to expose one of two colors: pink or blue". Other methods include the release of balloons from a box.&lt;ref name="Hafner"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/12/gender-reveals-gender-identity-cisgender/98535822/|title=Gender reveals: Insanely popular — and also outdated?|last=Hafner|first=Josh|date=March 12, 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The term "gender reveal" often criticized as a [[misnomer]], as all available tests measure the child's [[sex]],&lt;ref name=Hafner /&gt; which may be [[Sex and gender distinction|distinguished from gender]].

Gender reveal parties have become much more popular due to cell-free fetal DNA testing being available as early as ten weeks; some are marketed as detecting fetal sex as early as five weeks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drabiak-Syed|first=Katherine|date=2010|title=Baby Gender Mentor |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303837509_Baby_Gender_Mentor_Class_Action_Litigation_Calls_Attention_to_a_Deficient_Federal_Regulatory_Framework_for_DTC_Genetic_Tests_Politicized_State_Statutory_Construction_and_a_Lack_of_Informed_Consent|journal=Michigan State University Journal of Medicine and Law|volume=14|issue=1|pages=71–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA test is non-intrusive as it only requires blood from the mother. Previously, the sex of the unborn baby was determined via [[obstetric ultrasonography]] between 16–20 weeks. The tests are not perfectly accurate, and in cases of [[sex chromosome disorders (disambiguation)|sex chromosome disorders]] or other abnormalities of development their results may not match those of fetal ultrasound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A significant issue is that as many as 4% of infants are [[intersex]] (formerly known as [[androgynous]] or [[hermaphrodite]]), though it is incredibly difficult to determine the frequency of these cases.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Caleb|last2=Gearhart|first2=John|date=2004|title=Current views on evaluation, management and gender assignment of the intersex infant|url=https://www.nature.com/nrurol/journal/v1/n1/full/ncpuro0028.html|journal=Nature Clinical Practice Urology|volume=1|issue=1|page=38|doi=10.1038/ncpuro0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|date=1993|title=The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough |url=https://crl.ucsd.edu/~elman/Courses/HDP1/2000/LectureNotes/fausto-sterling.pdf|journal=The Sciences|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics note the existence of [[nonbinary]] gender and reject an essential and inextricable link from sex to gender.&lt;ref name=":butler"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Butler|first=Judith|date=2002|title=Gender trouble|url=https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2006-0-05040-6&amp;isbn=9781135959937}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2018}}

The parties have been criticized for perpetuating [[gender stereotype]]s through themes such as "Rifles or Ruffles?" and "Wheels or Heels?".&lt;ref name=Hafner /&gt;

Gender parties are also viewed as vain and unnecessary, a holiday championed by party supply companies in order to boost sales.

Aspects of [[genetics]] including [[mutation]], [[hybridisation (biology)|hybridisation]], [[cloning]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[eugenics]] have appeared in fiction since the 19th century.

Genetics is a young science, having started in 1900 with the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s study on the inheritance of [[phenotypic trait|traits]] in pea plants. During the 20th century it developed to create new sciences and technologies including [[molecular biology]], [[DNA sequencing]], cloning, and genetic engineering. The [[bioethics|ethical implications]] were brought into focus with the eugenics movement.

Since then, many [[science fiction]] novels and films have used aspects of genetics as plot devices, often taking one of two routes: a genetic accident with disastrous consequences; or, the feasibility and desirability of a planned genetic alteration. The treatment of science in these stories has been uneven and often unrealistic. The film ''[[Gattaca]]'' did attempt to portray science accurately but was criticised by scientists.

==Background==
{{see|History of genetics}}
[[File:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|upright|The 1953 discovery of the [[double helix]] chemical structure of [[DNA]] transformed [[genetics]] and launched the science of [[molecular biology]].]]

Modern genetics began with the work of the monk [[Gregor Mendel]] in the 19th century, on the inheritance of [[phenotypic trait|traits]] in pea plants. Mendel found that visible traits, such as whether peas were round or wrinkled, were [[particulate inheritance|inherited discretely]], rather than by [[blending inheritance|blending]] the attributes of the two parents.&lt;ref name="mendel"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mendel's Paper in English |url=http://www.mendelweb.org/Mendel.html |first=Roger B. |last=Blumberg |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113051202/http://www.mendelweb.org/Mendel.html |archivedate=13 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, [[Hugo de Vries]] and other scientists rediscovered Mendel's research; [[William Bateson]] coined the term "genetics" for the new science, which soon investigated a wide range of phenomena including [[mutation]] (inherited changes caused by damage to the genetic material), [[genetic linkage]] (when some traits are to some extent inherited together), and [[hybridization (biology)|hybridisation]] (crosses of different [[species]]).&lt;ref name="bateson_genetics"&gt;{{cite conference |author=Bateson, W. |authorlink=William Bateson |title=The Progress of Genetic Research |editor=Wilks, W. |booktitle=Report of the Third 1906 International Conference on Genetics: Hybridization (the cross-breeding of genera or species), the cross-breeding of varieties, and general plant breeding |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Eugenics]], the production of better human beings by selective breeding, was named and advocated by [[Charles Darwin]]'s cousin, the scientist [[Francis Galton]], in 1883. It had both a positive aspect, the breeding of more children with high intelligence and good health; and a negative aspect, aiming to suppress "race degeneration" by preventing supposedly "defective" families with attributes such as profligacy, laziness, immoral behaviour and a tendency to criminality from having children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Claude Moore Health Sciences Library |title=Origins of Eugenics: From Sir Francis Galton to Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924 |url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/eugenics/2-origins/ |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=20 July 2018 |date=2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328131644/http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/eugenics/2-origins/ |archivedate=28 March 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DNA: The Secret of Life |last1=Watson |first1=James D. |author1link=James D.

[[Genetic engineering]], the modification of the genetic material of a live organism, became possible in 1972 when [[Paul Berg]] created the first [[recombinant DNA]] molecules (artificially assembled genetic material) using [[virus]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.69.10.2904 |last1=Jackson |first1=D.

[[Cloning]], the production of genetically identical organisms from some chosen starting point, was shown to be practicable with the creation of [[Dolly the sheep]] from an [[somatic cell|ordinary body cell]] in 1996 at the [[Roslin Institute]].&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Edwards | first=J. | title=Why dolly matters: Kinship, culture and cloning| journal=Ethnos| volume=64| issue=3–4| pages=301–324| year=1999 | doi=10.1080/00141844.1999.9981606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics themes==

===Mutants and hybrids===
{{further|Mutants in fiction}}
[[File:IslandOfDrMoreau.JPG|thumb|upright|[[H. G. Wells]]'s  1896 ''[[The Island of Dr Moreau]]'' imagined the use of [[hybridisation (biology)|hybridisation]] to create [[Human–animal hybrid|human-like hybrid beings]].]]

[[Mutation]] and [[hybridisation (biology)|hybridisation]] are widely used in fiction, starting in the 19th century with [[science fiction]] works such as Mary Shelley's 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and [[H. G. Wells]]'s  1896 ''[[The Island of Dr Moreau]]''.&lt;ref name=Moraga&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moraga |first=Roger |title=Modern Genetics in the World of Fiction |url=http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/moraga_11_09/ |journal=Clarkesworld Magazine |date=November 2009 |issue=38 |archivedate=19 July 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719114128/http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/moraga_11_09/ |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her 1977 ''Biological Themes in Modern Science Fiction'', Helen Parker identified two major types of story: "genetic accident", the uncontrolled, unexpected and disastrous alteration of a species;&lt;ref name=Parker1977&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parker |first1=Helen N. |title=Biological Themes in Modern Science Fiction |date=1977 |publisher=UMI Research Press |url=https://archive.org/details/biologicalthemes00park}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmeink2017&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmeink |first=Lars |title=Biopunk Dystopias Genetic Engineering, Society and Science Fiction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz3jDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 |year=2017 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=978-1-78138-332-2 |pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "planned genetic alteration", whether controlled by humans or [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], and the question of whether that would be either feasible or desirable.&lt;ref name=Parker1977/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmeink2017/&gt; In science fiction up to the 1970s, the genetic changes were brought about by [[radiation]], breeding programmes, or manipulation with chemicals or [[surgery]] (and thus, notes Lars Schmeink, not necessarily by strictly genetic means).&lt;ref name=Schmeink2017/&gt; Examples include ''The Island of Dr Moreau'' with its horrible manipulations; [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1932 ''[[Brave New World]]'' with a breeding programme; and [[John Taine]]'s 1951 ''[[Seeds of Life]]'', using radiation to create supermen.&lt;ref name=Schmeink2017/&gt; After the discovery of the double helix and then recombinant DNA, genetic engineering became the focus for genetics in fiction, as in books like [[Brian Stableford]]'s tale of a genetically modified society in his 1998 ''Inherit the Earth'', or [[Michael Marshall Smith]]'s story of [[organ farming]] in his 1997 ''Spares''.&lt;ref name=Schmeink2017/&gt;

[[Science fiction comics|Comic books]] have imagined mutated [[superhumans]] with extraordinary powers. The [[DC Universe]] (from 1939) imagines "[[metahuman]]s"; the [[Marvel Universe]] (from 1961) calls them "[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]", while the [[Wildstorm]] (from 1992) and [[Ultimate Marvel]] (2000–2015) Universes name them "[[posthuman]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Burlingame |first1=Russ|title=The Flash: What are Metahumans? |url=http://comicbook.com/2014/10/04/the-flash-what-are-metahumans-/ |website=Comicbook.com |accessdate=23 July 2016 |date=4 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617015315/http://comicbook.com/2014/10/04/the-flash-what-are-metahumans-/ |archivedate=17 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Stan Lee introduced the concept of mutants in the Marvel X-Men books in 1963; the villain Magneto declares his plan to "make ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' bow to ''Homo superior''!", implying that mutants will be an evolutionary step up from current humanity. Later, the books speak of an X-gene that confers powers from [[puberty]] onwards. X-men powers include [[telepathy]], [[telekinesis]], healing, strength, flight, [[time travel]], and the ability to emit blasts of energy. Marvel's god-like Celestials are later (1999) said to have visited Earth long ago and to have modified human DNA to enable mutant powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Booker |first=M.

[[James Blish]]'s 1952 novel ''Titan's Daughter'' (in [[Kendell Foster Crossen]]'s ''Future Tense'' collection) featured stimulated [[polyploidy]] (giving organisms multiple sets of genetic material, something that can create new [[species]] in a single step), based on spontaneous polyploidy in [[flowering plants]], to create humans with more than normal height, strength, and lifespans.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

===Cloning===
{{see|Cloning#In popular culture}}
[[File:Jurassic Park Tyrannosaurus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1993 film ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' portrayed the recreation of [[dinosaur]]s from cloned fossil DNA.]]

[[Cloning]], too, is a familiar plot device. In his 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', [[Michael Crichton]] imagined the recovery of the complete [[genome]] of a [[dinosaur]] from [[fossil]] remains, followed by its use to recreate living animals of an [[extinct]] species.&lt;ref name=Moraga/&gt; [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1931 dystopian novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' imagines the ''[[in vitro]]'' cloning of fertilised human [[Egg (biology)|eggs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Huxley, Aldous |authorlink=Aldous Huxley |title=Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited | page=19 |publisher=HarperPerennial |date=2005 |isbn=978-0060776091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bhelkar |first1=Ratnakar D. |title=Science Fiction: Fantasy and Reality |date=2009 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist |isbn=9788126910366 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bvt_NyXYGb0C&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=Bokanovsky's%20Process&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley was influenced by [[J. B. S. Haldane]]'s 1924 non-fiction book ''[[Daedalus; or, Science and the Future]]'', which used the Greek myth of [[Daedalus]] to symbolise the coming revolution in genetics; Haldane predicted that humans would [[Directed evolution (transhumanism)|control their own evolution]] through directed [[mutation]] and [[in vitro fertilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=More |first1=Max |last2=Vita-More |first2=Natasha |title=The Transhumanist Reader: Classical and Contemporary Essays on the Science, Technology, and Philosophy of the Human Future |date=April 2013 |isbn=978-1-118-33429-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YeFo_20rfz0C&amp;pg=PT22&amp;lpg=PT22&amp;dq=Daedalus;+or,+Science+and}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloning was explored further in stories such as [[Poul Anderson]]'s 1953 ''UN-Man''.&lt;ref name="stableford"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stableford |first=Brian M. |title=Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia |date=2006 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415974608 |pages=91–92 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uefwmdROKTAC&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=cloning%20in%20science%20fiction&amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Clone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning is a recurring theme in science fiction films like ''Jurassic Park'' (1993), ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997), ''The 6th Day'' (2000), ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' (2002), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Episode II]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' (2005). The process of cloning is represented variously in fiction. Many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample; the replication may be instantaneous, or take place through slow growth of human embryos in [[artificial womb]]s. In the long-running British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Fourth Doctor]] and his companion [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples ("[[The Invisible Enemy (Doctor Who)|The Invisible Enemy]]", 1977) and then—in an apparent [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]''—shrunk to microscopic size in order to enter the Doctor's body to combat an alien virus. The clones in this story are short-lived, and can only survive a matter of minutes before they expire.&lt;ref name="muir"&gt;{{cite book |last=Muir |first1=John Kenneth |title=A Critical History of Doctor Who on Television |date=2007 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476604541 |pages=258–259 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qMKSCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones'' have featured human [[foetus]]es being cultured on an industrial scale in enormous tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mumford |first=James |title=Ethics at the Beginning of Life: A Phenomenological Critique |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0199673969 |page=108 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UCnmRCDGJ0cC&amp;lpg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cloning humans from body parts is a common science fiction trope, one of several genetics themes parodied in [[Woody Allen]]'s 1973 comedy ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'', where an attempt is made to clone an assassinated dictator from his disembodied nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Humber |first=James M. |last2=Almeder|first2=Robert|title=Human Cloning|date=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1592592050 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vNGUBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=woody%20allen%20sleeper%20cloning%20nose&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=woody%20allen%20sleeper%20cloning%20nose&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic engineering===

[[Genetic engineering]] features in many science fiction stories.&lt;ref name="SFE"&gt;{{cite web |title=Genetic Engineering |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/genetic_engineering |website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=15 May 2017 |archiveurl=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/genetic_engineering |archivedate=26 August 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''The Island'' &lt;!--2005, as above--&gt; and ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) bring the engineered creature to confront the person who created it or the being it was cloned from, a theme seen in some film versions of ''Frankenstein''. Few films have informed audiences about genetic engineering as such, with the exception of the 1978 ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' and the 1993 ''Jurassic Park'', both of which made use of a lesson, a demonstration, and a clip of scientific film.&lt;ref name=Moraga/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wellcome&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Michael |title=Genetic themes in fiction films: Genetics meets Hollywood |url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD023539.html |publisher=[[The Wellcome Trust]] |accessdate=19 July 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518055848/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD023539.html |archivedate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[Frank Herbert]]'s novel ''[[The White Plague]]'' described the deliberate use of genetic engineering to create a [[pathogen]] which specifically killed women.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Another of Herbert's creations, the ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' series of novels, starting with ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' in 1965, emphasises genetics. It combines [[selective breeding]] by a powerful sisterhood, the [[Bene Gesserit]], to produce a supernormal male being, the Kwisatz Haderach, with the genetic engineering of the powerful but despised [[Tleilaxu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Koboldt |first1=Daniel |title=The Science of Sci-Fi: How Science Fiction Predicted the Future of Genetics |url=https://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/16677-genetics-science-fiction-future |website=Outer Places |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=29 August 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719233445/https://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/16677-genetics-science-fiction-future |archivedate=19 July 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eugenics congress logo.png|thumb|1921 conference logo, depicting [[eugenics]] as a tree uniting many fields]]

Genetic engineering methods are weakly represented in film; Michael Clark, writing for [[The Wellcome Trust]], calls the portrayal of genetic engineering and biotechnology "seriously distorted"&lt;ref name=Wellcome/&gt; in films such as [[Roger Spottiswoode]]'s 2000 ''[[The 6th Day]]'', which makes use of the trope of a "vast clandestine laboratory ... filled with row upon row of 'blank' human bodies kept floating in tanks of nutrient liquid or in suspended animation". In Clark's view, the biotechnology is typically "given fantastic but visually arresting forms" while the science is either relegated to the background or fictionalised to suit a young audience.&lt;ref name=Wellcome/&gt;

===Eugenics===
[[Eugenics]] plays a central role in films such as [[Andrew Niccol]]'s 1997 ''[[Gattaca]]'', the title alluding to the letters G, A, T, C for [[guanine]], [[adenine]], [[thymine]], and [[cytosine]], the four [[nucleobase]]s of [[DNA]]. Genetic engineering of humans is unrestricted, resulting in [[genetic discrimination]], loss of diversity, and adverse effects on society. The film explores the [[Bioethics|ethical implications]]; the production company, Sony Pictures, consulted with a gene therapy researcher, French Anderson, to ensure that the portrayal of science was realistic, and test-screened the film with the Society of Mammalian Cell Biologists and the American [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] before its release. This care did not prevent researchers from attacking the film after its release. Philim Yam of ''[[Scientific American]]'' called it "science bashing"; in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' Kevin Davies called it a ""surprisingly pedestrian affair"; and the [[Molecular biology|molecular biologist]] [[Lee M. Silver|Lee Silver]] described the film's extreme [[genetic determinism]] as "a [[straw man]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/science/11gene.html?pagewanted=all |title=Now: The Rest of the Genome |first=Carl |last=Zimmer |date=November 10, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirby2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kirby |first=David A. |title=The New Eugenics in Cinema: Genetic Determinism and Gene Therapy in "GATTACA" |journal=Science Fiction Studies |date=July 2000 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=193-215 |jstor=4240876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth and oversimplification==

The [[geneticist]] Dan Koboldt observes that while science and technology play major roles in fiction, from [[fantasy]] and science fiction to [[thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, the representation of science in both literature and film is often unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Koboldt2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Koboldt |first1=Daniel |title=Putting the Science in Fiction |url=http://dankoboldt.com/writing/putting-the-science-in-fiction/ |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827213458/http://dankoboldt.com/writing/putting-the-science-in-fiction/ |archivedate=27 August 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Koboldt's view, genetics in fiction is frequently oversimplified, and some myths are common and need to be debunked. For example, the [[Human Genome Project]] has not (he states) immediately led to a ''Gattaca'' world, as the relationship between [[genotype]] and [[phenotype]] is not straightforward. People do differ genetically, but only very rarely because they are missing a [[gene]] that other people have: people have different [[allele]]s of the same genes. Eye and hair colour are controlled not by one gene each, but by multiple genes. Mutations do occur, but they are rare: people are 99.99% identical genetically, the 3 million differences between any two people being dwarfed by the hundreds of millions of DNA bases which are identical; nearly all DNA variants are inherited, not acquired afresh by mutation. And, Koboldt writes, believable scientists in fiction should know their knowledge is limited.&lt;ref name="Koboldt2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Koboldt |first1=Daniel |title=Genetics Myths in Fiction Writing |url=http://dankoboldt.com/genetics-myths-fiction-writing/ |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=1 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719234712/http://dankoboldt.com/genetics-myths-fiction-writing/ |archivedate=19 July 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Burnett, Lord Monboddo''' (baptised 25 October 1714; died 26 May 1799), was a Scottish judge, scholar of [[evolutionary linguistics|linguistic evolution]], philosopher and [[deist]]. He is most famous today as a founder of modern comparative historical [[linguistics]].&lt;ref name=Hobbs/&gt; In 1767 he became a judge in the [[Court of Session]].

As such, Burnett adopted an honorary title based on the name of his father's estate and family seat, [[Monboddo House]]. Monboddo was one of a number of scholars involved at the time in development of early concepts of [[evolution]]. Some credit him with anticipating in principle the idea of [[natural selection]] that was read by (and acknowledged in the writings of) [[Erasmus Darwin]]. [[Charles Darwin]] read the works of his grandfather Erasmus and later developed the ideas into a [[theory|scientific theory]].&lt;ref name="Bowler1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cloyd/&gt;

==Early years==
James Burnett was born in 1714 at [[Monboddo House]] in Kincardineshire, Scotland. After his primary education at the parish school of [[Laurencekirk]], he studied at [[Marischal College]], Aberdeen, from where he was graduated in 1729. He also studied at [[University of Edinburgh]] and the [[University of Groningen]]. At Edinburgh University he graduated in law and was admitted to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in 1737.

Burnett married Elizabethe Farquharson and they had two daughters and a son. Burnett's younger daughter [[Elizabeth Burnett]] was an [[Edinburgh]] celebrity, known for her beauty and amiability. Tragically, she died from consumption ([[tuberculosis]]) at the age of 24. Burnett's friend the Scottish poet [[Robert Burns]] had a romantic interest in Elizabeth and wrote a poem, "Elegy on The Late Miss Burnet of Monboddo", praising her beauty, which became her [[elegy]].

Monboddo's early work in practising law found him in a landmark piece of litigation of his time, known as the Douglas "cause", or case. The matter involved the inheritance standing of a young heir, [[Archibald James Edward Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas]], and took on the form of a mystery novel of the era, with a complex web of events spanning Scotland, France and England. Burnett, as the solicitor for the young Douglas heir, was victorious after years of legal battle and appeals.

==Later years==
[[File:The grave of Lord Patrick Grant, Greyfriars Kirkyard.jpg|thumb|The grave of Lord Patrick Grant, Greyfriars Kirkyard - containing Lord Monboddo]]
From 1754 until 1767 Monboddo was one of a number of distinguished proprietors of the [[Canongate Books|Canongate]] Theatre. He clearly enjoyed this endeavour even when some of his fellow judges pointed out that the activity might cast a shadow over his sombre image as jurist. Here he had occasion to further associate with [[David Hume]] who was a principal actor in one of the plays. He had actually met Hume earlier when Monboddo was a curator of the Advocates Library and David Hume served as keeper of that library for several years while he wrote his history.

From 1769 until 1775 [[John Hunter (classicist)|John Hunter]] acted as his personal secretary.&lt;ref name="FRS" /&gt;

[[Image:Parliament House, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|right|The old [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], housing the [[Court of Session]]]]

In the era after Monboddo was appointed to Justice of the high court, he organised "learned suppers" at his house on 13 St John Street,&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt; where he discussed and lectured about his theories. Local intellectuals were invited to attend attic repasts. [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]] was conspicuously absent from such socialising; while Kames and Monboddo served on the high court at the same time and had numerous interactions, they were staunch intellectual rivals.  Monboddo rode to London on horseback each year and visited [[Hampton Court]] as well as other intellectuals of the era; the King himself was fond of Monboddo's colourful discussions.&lt;ref name=watt/&gt; Monboddo is buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] in Edinburgh along with his daughter Elizabeth where they have unmarked graves in the burial enclosure of [[Patrick Grant, Lord Elchies]] (within the non-public section known as the Covenanters Prison).

==Historical linguistics==
{{globalize|date=December 2012}}

In ''The Origin and Progress of Language'' Burnett analysed the structure of languages, and argued that humans had evolved language skills in response to changing environment and social structures. Burnett was the first to note that [[Evolutionary linguistics|some language]]s create lengthy words for rather simple concepts. He reasoned that in early languages there was an imperative for clarity, so that redundancy was built in and seemingly unnecessary syllables added. He concluded that this form of language evolved when clear communication might be the determinant of avoiding danger.

[[File:Monboddoinkwellrazorback.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Lord Monboddo's original inkwell from c. 1760]]

Monboddo studied languages of peoples colonised by Europeans, including those of the [[Island Caribs|Carib]], [[Eskimo]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], [[Demographics of Peru|Peruvian]] ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]]?) and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] peoples. He saw the preponderance of polysyllabic words, where some of his predecessors had dismissed these languages as a series of monosyllabic grunts. He also observed that in Huron (or Wyandot) the words for very similar objects are astoundingly different. This fact led Monboddo to perceive that these peoples needed to communicate reliably regarding a more limited number of subjects than in modern civilisations, which led to the polysyllabic and redundant nature of many words. He also came up with the idea that these languages are generally vowel-rich and that correspondingly, languages such as German and English are vowel-starved. According to Burnett, this disparity partially arises from the greater vocabulary of Northern European languages and the decreased need for the polysyllabic content.

Monboddo also traced the evolution of modern European languages and gave particularly great effort to understanding the ancient [[Greek language]], in which he was proficient. He argued that Greek is the most perfect language ever established because of its complex structure and tonality, rendering it capable of expressing a wide gamut of nuances. Monboddo was the first to formulate what is now known as the [[single-origin hypothesis]], the theory that all human origin was from a single region of the earth; he reached this conclusion by reasoning from linguistic evolution (Jones, 1789). This theory is evidence of his thinking on the topic of the [[evolution]] of Man.

[[Joshua Steele]]'s disagreement, and subsequent correspondence, with Monboddo over details of the "melody and measure of speech" resulted in Steele's ''[[Prosodia Rationalis]]'', a foundational work both in [[phonetics]] and in the analysis of verse rhythm.

==Evolutionary theorist==
[[File:Orang utans, Singapore Zoo 2.JPG|thumb|Monboddo analysed man's relation to other species]]

Monboddo is considered by some scholars&lt;ref name=watt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovejoy1933"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; as a precursive thinker in the theory of [[evolution]]. However, some modern evolutionary historians do not give Monboddo an equally high standing in the influence of [[history of evolutionary thought]].&lt;ref name="Bowler1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayr1982"/&gt;

:"Monboddo: Scottish jurist and pioneer anthropologist who explored the origins of language and society and anticipated principles of Darwinian evolution."&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

:"With some wavering, he extended [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s doctrine of the identity of species of man and the chimp into the hypothesis of common descent of all the [[anthropoids]], and suggested by implication a general law of evolution." Lovejoy.

[[Charles Neaves]], one of Monboddo's successors on the high court of Scotland, believed that proper credit was not given to Monboddo in evolutionary theory development. Neaves wrote in verse:&lt;ref name=Neaves/&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;Though Darwin now proclaims the law
And spreads it far abroad, O!
The man that first the secret saw
Was honest old Monboddo.
The architect precedence takes
Of him that bears the hod, O!
So up and at them, Land of Cakes,
We'll vindicate Monboddo.&lt;/poem&gt;

[[Erasmus Darwin]] notes Monboddo's work in his publications (Darwin 1803). Later writers&lt;ref name=Cloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; consider Monboddo's analysis as precursive to the theory of Evolution. Whether Charles Darwin read Monboddo is not certain. Monboddo debated with [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] regarding man's relationship to other primates. Charles Darwin did not mention Monboddo,&lt;ref name="Darwin1896" /&gt; but commented on Buffon: "the first author who in modern times has treated [evolution] in a scientific spirit was Buffon". Buffon thought that man was a species unrelated to lower [[primate]]s, but Monboddo rejected Buffon's analysis and argued that the anthropoidal ape must be related to the species of man: he sometimes referred to the anthropoidal ape as the "brother of man". Monboddo suffered a setback, in his standing on evolutionary thought, because he stated at one time that men had caudal appendages (tails); some historians failed to take him very seriously after that remark, even though Monboddo was known to bait his critics with preposterous sayings.

Bailey's ''The Holly and the Horn''&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; states that "Charles Darwin was to some degree influenced by the theories of Monboddo, who deserves the title of Evolutionist more than that of Eccentric." Henderson says:
:"He [Monboddo] was a minor celebrity in Edinburgh because he was considered to be very eccentric. But he actually came up with the idea that men may have evolved instead of being created by God. His views were dismissed because people thought he was mad, and in those days it was a very controversial view to hold. But he felt it was a logical possibility and it caused him a great deal of consternation. He actually did not want to believe the theory because he was a very religious person."&lt;ref name="Henderson2000" /&gt;

Monboddo may be the first person to associate language skills evolving from [[primate]]s and continuing to evolve in early humans (Monboddo, 1773). He wrote about how the language capability has altered over time in the form not only of skills but physical form of the sound producing organs (mouth, vocal cords, tongue, throat), suggesting he had formed the concept of evolutionary adaptive change.

[[Image:Henry Home, Lord Kames; Hugo Arnot; James Burnett, Lord Monboddo by John Kay.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: [[Lord Kames]], [[Hugo Arnot]] and Lord Monboddo, by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]]]]

He also elaborates on the advantages created by the adaptive change of primates to their environment and even to the evolving complexity of primate social structures.  In 1772 in a letter to James Harris, Monboddo articulated that his theory of language evolution (Harris 1772) was simply a part of the manner that man had advanced from the lower animals, a clear precedent of evolutionary thought. Furthermore, he established a detailed theory of how man adaptively acquired language to cope better with his environment and social needs. He argued that the development of language was linked to a procession of events: first developing use of tools, then social structures and finally language. This concept was quite striking for his era, because it departed from the classical religious thinking that man was created instantaneously and language revealed by God. In fact, Monboddo was deeply religious and pointed out that the creation events were probably simply allegories and did not dispute that the universe was created by God. Monboddo was a vigorous opponent of other scientific thinking that philosophically questioned the role of God (see Monboddo's prolific diatribes on Newton's theories).

As an agriculturist and horse-breeder, Monboddo was quite aware of the significance of selective breeding and even transferred this [[Reproduction|breeding]] theory to communications he had with [[James Boswell]] in Boswell's selection of a mate. Monboddo has stated in his own works that degenerative qualities can be inherited by successive generations and that by selective choice of mates, creatures can improve the next generation in a biological sense. This suggests that Monboddo understood the role of natural processes in evolution; [[artificial selection]] was the starting-point for many of the proto-evolutionary thinkers, and for Darwin himself.

Monboddo struggled with how to "get man from an animal"&lt;ref name=Cloyd/&gt; without divine intervention. This is typical of the kind of thinking which is called ''[[deist]]''. He developed an entire theory of language evolution around the Egyptian civilisation to assist in his understanding of how man descended from animals, since he explained the flowering of language upon the spinoff of the Egyptians imparting language skills to other cultures. Monboddo cast early humans as wild, solitary, [[herbivorous]] [[quadruped]]s. He believed that contemporary people suffered many diseases because they were removed from the environmental state of being unclothed and exposed to extreme swings in [[climate]].

Burnett wrote of numerous cultures (mostly based upon accounts of explorers); for example, he described  "insensibles" and "wood eaters" in ''Of the Origin and Progress of Language''.  He was fascinated by the nature of these peoples' language development and also how they fit into the evolutionary scheme.

Against all this, Monboddo's contribution to evolution is today regarded by historians of evolution as being notable.

Bowler acknowledges his argument that apes might represent the earliest form of humanity (Monboddo 1774), but continues:
:"He [Monboddo] regarded humans (including savages and apes) as quite distinct from the rest of the animal kingdom. The first suggestion that the human species was descended via the apes from the lower animals did not come until [[Lamarck]]'s ''Philosophie Zoologique'' of 1809."&lt;ref name="Bowler1989"/&gt;

[[Charles Dickens]] knew of Monboddo and wrote in his novel, [[Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit]] about ''"(...) the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys"''.&lt;ref name=Dickens /&gt;  This is significant because ''Martin Chuzzlewit'' was published decades before Darwin wrote his theory of evolution.&lt;ref name="Rosenhouse2006" /&gt;

The [[history of the theory of evolution]] is a relatively modern field of scholarship.

==Metaphysics==
In ''Antient Metaphysics'', Burnett claimed that man is gradually elevating himself from the animal condition to a state in which mind acts independently of the body. He was a strong supporter of Aristotle in his concepts of Prime Mover. Much effort was devoted to crediting [[Isaac Newton]] with brilliant discoveries in the Laws of Motion, while defending the power of the mind as outlined by Aristotle. His analysis was further complicated by his recurring need to assure that Newton did not obviate the presence of God.

==Nudism==

Monboddo was a pioneer in regard to many modern ideas and had already in the eighteenth century realized the value of "air-baths"&lt;ref name="Lichtenberg1845" /&gt;(the familiar term which he invented) to mental and physical health. In his writings Monboddo argued against clothes as unnatural and undesirable from every point of view for both mind and body. Monboddo "awaked every morning at four, and then for his health got up and walked in his room naked, with the window open, which he called taking an air bath." When [[nudism]] was first brought into fashion with much enthusiasm in Germany as [[Freikörperkultur]] early in the twentieth century Monboddo was regarded as a pioneer, and in 1913 a ''Monboddo Bund'' was established in Berlin,{{sfn|Wedemeyer-Kolwe|2004|p=204}} for the harmonious culture of body and mind.&lt;ref name="Ellis2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr-Gomm2012" /&gt;

==Eccentricity==
Burnett was widely known to be an eccentric.  Habitually he rode on horseback between [[Edinburgh]] and London instead of journeying by [[carriage]]. Another time after a decision went against him regarding the value of a horse, he refused to sit with the other judges and assumed a seat below the bench with the court clerks. When Burnett was visiting the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] in London in 1787, part of the floor of the [[courtroom]] started to collapse. People rushed out of the building but Burnett who, at the age of 71, was partially deaf and shortsighted, was the only one not to move. When he was later asked for a reason, he stated that he thought it was "an annual ceremony, with which, as an alien, he had nothing to do".

Burnett in his earlier years suggested that the [[orangutan]] was a form of man, although some analysts think that some of his presentation was designed to entice his critics into debate.
[[Image:Lord Monboddo02.jpg|thumb|Lord Monboddo, a caricature by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]]]]

The orangutan was at this time a generic term for all types of apes. The Swedish explorer whose evidence Burnett accepted was a naval officer who had viewed a group of monkeys and thought they were human. Burnett may simply have taken the view that it was reasonable for people to assume the things they do and the word of a naval officer trained to give accurate reports was a credible source. Burnett was indeed responsible for changing the classical definition of man as a creature of reason to a creature capable of achieving reason although he viewed this process as one slow and difficult to achieve.

At one time he said that humans must have all been born with tails, which were removed by midwives at birth. His contemporaries ridiculed his views, and by 1773 he had retracted this opinion (Pringle 1773). Some later commentators have seen him as anticipating [[evolution]]ary theory. He appeared to argue that animal [[species]] adapted and changed to survive, and his observations on the progression of primates to man amounted to some kind of concept of [[evolution]]. Burnett also examined [[feral children]] and was the only thinker of his day to accept them as human rather than monsters. He viewed in these children the ability to achieve reason. He identified the orangutan as human as his sources indicated it was capable of experiencing shame.

In 2015 the orangutan [[Sandra (orangutan)|Sandra]] was the first to legally be recognised  as a "non-human person", paving the way for apes and other animals to be recognised as having rights equal to humans.

==In popular culture==
In [[Thomas Love Peacock]]'s 1817 novel [[Melincourt (novel)|''Melincourt'']], an orangutan punningly named "Sir Oran Haut-Ton" becomes a candidate for British Parliament based on Monboddo's theories.

[[Charles Dickens]], in his novel ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'',&lt;ref name=Dickens /&gt; refers to "the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys".

In his 1981 [[dystopian]] novel ''[[Lanark (novel)|Lanark]]'', [[Alasdair Gray]] names the head of the mysterious Institute Lord Monboddo. He makes the connection explicit in a marginal note, adding that it is not a literal depiction.

Lord Monboddo's descendant, Jamie Burnett of Leys, has sponsored a stage work ''Monboddo – The Musical'' which is a biographical re-enactment of the life of his ancestor. It received a first run at Aberdeen Arts Centre in September 2010.

In her short story "The Monboddo Ape Boy", [[Lillian de la Torre]] depicted a slightly fictionalised Monboddo meeting [[Samuel Johnson]], and being presented with a supposed "wild boy".

A {{nihongo|'''karaoke [[Box (theatre)|box]]'''|カラオケボックス|karaoke bokkusu}} is a common type of [[karaoke]] establishment commonly found in [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]] and the [[United States]]. Karaoke boxes consist of multiple rooms containing karaoke equipment, usually rented out for time periods. A typical karaoke box establishment contains 10–20 (or more) such rooms as well as a main karaoke [[bar]] area in the front. Karaoke box establishments often sell refreshments.

The term karaoke box is primarily used in [[Japan]] and [[Hong Kong]]. Karaoke box establishments are commonly known as KTV (an abbreviation of karaoke television) in [[Taiwan]], [[China]], [[Cambodia]], [[Singapore]], and the [[United States]], ''videoke'' in the [[Philippines]], ''noraebang'' (노래방) in [[South Korea]] (literally meaning singing room), ''karaoke room'' in [[Vietnam]], and ''karaoke club'' in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sundaytimes.lk/020414/mirror/4.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common to simply abbreviate it as K in [[Hong Kong Cantonese]], often when used as a verb, for example 去K歌 (to go K songs) or 去唱K (to go sing K).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Legal issues==
KTV can also refer to a karaoke music video, a music video with karaoke lyrics and MMO audio track. Some karaoke music videos were sold to KTV establishments under exclusivity contracts, making some people use them to [[copyright infringement|copy karaoke music videos illegally]] and share them on the Internet. These are often found on the Internet in [[MPEG]] ([[VCD]]) or [[VOB]] ([[DVD]]) format with (KTV) appended to the filename.

'''Laramie''' was a brand of [[cigarettes]] extant in the [[United States]] from the 1930s into the 1950s. Later, the name was used for a cigarette rolling kit. Laramie is currently a brand name for cigarette papers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ryomagazine.com/filters.htm "Vera Cruz Filter Tubes], vol XII, No 3, winter 2012, ''Roll Your Own'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; and cigarette tubes ([[rolling paper]]s pre-formed into a tube, for use in home tobacco injector systems) marketed by [[HBI International]].

==In popular culture==
Laramie cigarettes are a popular fictional brand on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in reality they have been out of production since the 1950s. The red and white triangular packaging is meant to be a parody of the real-life [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarettes. In the show they [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] a child [[beauty pageant]] and have a [[corporation|corporate]] [[mascot]] named [[menthol cigarette|Menthol]] [[Moose]] (a [[parody]] of [[Joe Camel]]) who can be seen at [[parade]]s in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]].&lt;ref name="HarraldWatkins2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Harrald|author2=Fletcher Watkins|title=The Cigarette Book: The History and Culture of Smoking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNziEDAF5YQC&amp;pg=PA93|year=2010|publisher=Skyhorse Pub.|isbn=978-1-61608-073-0|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Turner|title=Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lm43EetfI8kC&amp;pg=PA199|date=28 May 2010|publisher=Random House of Canada|isbn=978-0-307-36609-2|pages=199–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertisements for Laramie cigarettes are shown as part of a tobacco lawsuit in ''[[The Practice]]'' (season one, episode four).

Laramie cigarettes also make an appearance in the computer game ''[[System Shock 2]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In the 23rd episode of the 2nd season of ''[[The X-Files]]'', Laramie Tobacco is mentioned as a missing person's former workplace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40700">The [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] (RSC) owns a number of significant artworks in its venue at [[Burlington House]] in London. The collection is composed of busts, paintings and other artefacts that were mainly acquired between the mid-19th and early 21st Centuries (the Chemical Society was founded in 1841 and merged with others to become the RSC in 1980). Most of the acquisitions were donations from past members and staff, although a few were purchased directly by the Society.

The marble bust representing the German chemist [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] is located on the ground floor. It was introduced to the Chemical Society in 1876 by Mr James Duncan:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anniversary Meeting|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|date=1876|volume=29|pages=629–630|doi=10.1039/js8762900617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In recording the gratitude of the Society to those Gentlemen, the name of another Fellow, Mr. James Duncan, must be included among the recipients of our thanks, for his gift of a very interesting and valuable bust of one of our most highly-esteemed Fellows and Past Presidents, Professor Hofmann, the presentation of which, so soon after the Society had the pleasure of welcoming Dr. Hofmann as Faraday Lecturer, has been peculiarly appropriate. It is to be hoped that this handsome gift of Mr. Duncan’s and the excellent photograph of the late Dr. Anderson, presented by his widow, will not long remain the only monumental records of this kind possessed by the Society, of eminent workers in chemical science, past and living.}}

The inscription at the back {{quote|Joh. Pfuhl fec. Berlin 1875}} certifies that this artwork was created by the German sculptor [[Johannes Pfuhl]] in Berlin in 1875.

Justus von Liebig's pupil and William Perkin's mentor, von Hofmann widely contributed to the development of the organic chemistry. He was a cofounder of the [[German Chemical Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=August Wlhelm von Hofmann|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/August-Wilhelm-von-Hofmann|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; and President of the Chemical Society between 1861 and 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings at the Meetings of the Chemical Society|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society of London|date=1862|volume=14|page=353|doi=10.1039/qj8621400347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2003 from the Chelminski Gallery, this veined white marble bust was originally commissioned in 1731 from the Italian sculptor [[Giovanni Battista Guelfi]] (1690–1736)&lt;ref name=Webb&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=M.I.|title=Giovanni Battista Guelfi: an Italian Sculptor working in England|journal=The Burlington Magazine|date=1955|volume=97|issue=626}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], a relative of Boyle's, for Burlington House, which was then the earl's residence in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giometti|first1=Cristiano|title=Giovanni Battista Guelfi: New Discoveries|journal=The Sculpture Journal|date=1999|volume=3|pages=26–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the main hall, this artefact was created in the 18th Century. Made of gunmetal raised on a cross-banded walnut and oak base (32&amp;nbsp;cm × 44&amp;nbsp;cm. × 25.5&amp;nbsp;cm), it bears a presentation plaque with the following inscription:

{{quote|This [[pump|airpump]] was made for [[Joseph Priestley|Dr Priestley]] by Mr Harrison the employer of Sir [[Josiah Mason]] when a young man. Presented by Josiah Martin Smith ESQ.}}

Samuel Harrison (1759–1833) was a split ring maker with a workshop in Lancaster Street, Birmingham.

Right next to the airpump stands, raised on an oak plinth, a plaster, full-length figure of Joseph Priestley holding in his hands mortar and pestle, signed and inscribed "Esher" and dated 1874. Another inscription confirms that the statue was presented in 1920 by Mrs Bedford McNeill, as stated in the ''Journal and Proceedings of the [[Institute of Chemists of Great Britain and Ireland]]'' of that year:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Journal and Proceedings|journal=Journal of the Proceedings of the Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1920|issue=44|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hope: The Chemist''==
This painting (oil on canvas, 127&amp;nbsp;cm × 158&amp;nbsp;cm), located in the waiting room of Burlington House, was bought from the Albemarle Gallery by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2008. It is part of [[Stuart Luke Gatherer]]'s ''Sins and Virtues'' collection, which illustrates the seven sins and seven virtues using modern-day professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stuart Luke Gatherer|url=http://artistaday.com/?p=14945|website=Artistaday}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is based on an earlier classic, ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' (1768) by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]], which was in turn inspired by Robert Boyle's experiment on the properties of air in the mid-17th Century:&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt;{{rp|32}} a bird is deprived of air before a diversified audience and the different reactions of the spectators prove that scientific curiosity overcomes the concern for the living creature.

The original series consisted of nine paintings and two of them were shown in the exhibition 'Seeing Red' at the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] from November 2001 to October 2002.

==Robert Boyle portrait==
[[File:Robert Boyle portrait shifted.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Boyle portrait – Burlington House]]

Another painting in the Council Room is the half-length portrait of Robert Boyle (oil on canvas 92&amp;nbsp;cm × 78.5&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name=Gorringes /&gt; The ''[[Journal and Proceedings of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland]]'' said about the work:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hon. Robert Boyle|journal=Journal and Proceedings of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1938|volume=62|issue=part I|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The portrait of the Honourable Robert Boyle, in the Library of the Institute, is attributed to [[Jonathan Richardson]], who left many portraits unsigned; this has been pronounced by several authorities as undoubtedly his work. The portrait bears the dates of Boyle’s birth and death (1626–1691) and was probably a posthumous portrait. Richardson was born in 1665; however, names and dates were often added to portraits long after they had been painted. The portrait resembles the engraving of a bust by Faber and bears a close likeness to Boyle’s sister, the Countess of Ranelagh, at whose house in London he lived and worked for many years. It has been objected that few of the nobility and gentlemen of the time of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I|James I]] were painted otherwise than in court dress. Portraits showing gentlemen in dressing gowns and velvet caps appeared more frequently about 1720, when Boyle had been dead nearly 30 years; but it may be suggested that Richardson preferred to represent him as a philosopher in his study. Towards the end of his life, Boyle lived very quietly in the country and did not frequent the court. The picture was purchased at a sale at [[Loudoun Castle]], Galston, Ayrshire, and acquired for the Institute, by private subscription, in 1931.}}

[[File:Mountjoy Prison.jpg|thumb|[[Mountjoy Prison]] where on October 31, 1973 three IRA members escaped in a hijacked helicopter.&lt;ref name="mountjoy"/&gt;]]
[[File:La-Sante-Prison-MCB.jpg|thumb|[[Prison de la Santé]] where on May 26, 1986 Michel Vaujour was flown out of the prison by his wife.&lt;ref name="lesante"/&gt;]]

A helicopter [[prison escape]] is made when an inmate escapes from a [[prison]] by means of a [[helicopter]]. This list includes prisoner escapes where a helicopter was used in an attempt to free prisoners from a place of internment, a prison or correctional facility.

One of the earliest instances of using a helicopter to escape a prison was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed "Man Fan", on August 19, 1971 from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;  Kaplan was a New York businessman who not only successfully escaped the prison but eventually escaped Mexico and went on to write a book about his experience, ''The 10-Second Jailbreak''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eliot Asinof| authorlink = | title = The 10-Second Jailbreak: The helicopter escape of Joel David Kaplan|edition= 1973|page= 268 | publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston; 1st edition| isbn= 0-03-001011-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France has had more recorded helicopter escape attempts than any other country, with at least 11.&lt;ref name="aiton_2005"/&gt; One of the most notable French jail breaks occurred in 1986, when the wife of bank robber Michel Vaujour studied for months to learn how to fly a helicopter.  Using her newly acquired skills, she rented a white helicopter and flew low over Paris to pluck her husband off the roof of his fortress prison. Vaujour was later seriously wounded in a shootout with police, and his pilot wife was arrested.&lt;ref name="lesante"/&gt;

The record for most helicopter escapes goes to convicted murderer [[Pascal Payet]], who has used helicopters to escape from prisons in 2001, 2003, and most recently 2007.&lt;ref name="Grasse"&gt;{{cite news | date = 14 July 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6899274.stm | title = French inmate in second breakout | publisher = BBC News| accessdate = May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another multiple helicopter escapee is [[Vasilis Paleokostas]] who on February 22, 2009 escaped for the second time from the [[Korydallos Prison|same prison]].&lt;ref name="korydallos"/&gt; Because of this, many prisons have taken applicable precautions, such as nets or cables strung over open prison courtyards.&lt;ref name="Blade_1988"&gt;{{cite news |ref=harv|title= 3 Escapes caught after copter chase|first= |last=AP |authorlink=Associated Press |author2= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19880712&amp;id=4VtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,2993901 |format= |newspaper= [[The Blade (Toledo)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date= Jul 12, 1988 |page= |pages=Cover and p.7 |at= |accessdate= June 8, 2014 |language= |quote= |archiveurl=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19880712&amp;id=4VtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,2993901 |archivedate=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan Fund, was named in a 1964 Congressional investigation as a conduit for [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] money to [[Latin America]]. In 1962 he was convicted of killing his New York business partner, Louis Melchior Vidal, Jr., in [[Mexico City]].  Kaplan always maintained his innocence and on August 19, 1971, a helicopter landed in the Santa Martha Acatitla prison yard where he made his escape accompanied by Carlos Antonio Contreras Castro, a [[Venezuela]]n counterfeiter. Both men were flown to the United States and then different planes flew Kaplan to [[California]] and Castro to [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;  The escape is told in a book, ''The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_book"/&gt; It also inspired the 1975 movie ''[[Breakout (1975 film)|Breakout]]'', which starred [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Robert Duvall]].

| Marina Paquet held a sawed off shotgun against the back of the head of a helicopter pilot. She demanded that he land in the Orsainville prison courtyard, where her boyfriend (awaiting extradition to California on a murder charge) was set to escape. The pilot, Brian Jenner, feigned a panic attack, put the helicopter through some rough maneuvers and was then able to convince Paquet, in the back seat of the Jet Ranger, to turn over her shotgun and her knife. Jenner then gave her the choice of any landing spot, except the prison. She chose to go back to the airport.

The pilot then explained, in great detail, exactly where they were and where they would be landing on arrival at the Quebec City airport. He added that the police would surely be aware by then, that she had hijacked the helicopter but would not yet be aware that she had given up her arms to the pilot. All the time Jenner was squeezing the transmit button on his cyclic stick and the tower was picking up all the details. The moment they touched down at the airport, the woman bailed from the helicopter but the police, who had been advised of the situation by the control tower, were hiding out all over the place and captured Paquet within seconds.

|The chartered helicopter&amp;nbsp;— carrying two armed passengers, a pilot and a technician&amp;nbsp;— first tried to rip off the chicken-wire fence surrounding Trikala prison with a hook dangling from a rope. But that didn't work, so a rope was lowered down to whisk away Panagiotis Vlastos. Another prisoner, an unnamed Albanian national also in the courtyard at the time, may also have been part of the escape plan.

At the same time, the armed passengers used AK47 assault rifles and Uzi submachine gun to fire on the prison guards.  One guard, who was inside a post, was slightly injured by shards of flying glass. He and others returned fire, injuring Vlastos, who had managed to climb into the helicopter, as well as the helicopter's technician. Vlastos fell from a height of about 3 meters (10 feet) into the courtyard, and the helicopter was eventually grounded in the parking lot.

Prison officials told TV stations Mega and NET that they recovered well over 500 bullets fired from the helicopter. The Ministry of Justice, in statements describing the escape attempt, added that the helicopter passengers also carried, but did not use, "improvised explosive devices."

|Pola Roupa&lt;br /&gt;Nikos Maziotis
|A helicopter pilot foiled an attempted hijack of his apparatus by an armed woman who authorities believe wanted to use it to help convicted terrorist Nikos Maziotis escape from Korydallos prison.  
In 2013, Maziotis was convicted in absentia to 50 years in prison for setting up the now-defunct Revolutionary Struggle terrorist group, simple complicity in attempted murder, and a series of attacks claimed by group. He had been on the run since 2012 and was arrested in July 2014.
According to the anti-terrorist squad, the helicopter was leased by a woman who has since been identified by the pilot as Maziotis’ wife, Pola Roupa, at the municipality of Ermionida, in the Argolis regional unit of the Peloponnese on Sunday, and was supposed to fly to the island of Kythnos after picking up six more passengers.
Describing the incident in an announcement, anti-terror police said that the helicopter was near Athens, when the woman pulled out a gun and told the pilot to redirect the aircraft towards the city. The pilot immediately tried to disarm the woman which caused him to lose control of the helicopter and start to lose altitude. During the struggle, the woman shot at him three times without injuring him. Instead, the bullets pierced the instruments. The pilot managed to land the helicopter at an uninhabited mountainous area near the town of Thiva. The woman immediately opened the door and ran away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helicopter pilot foils hijack attempt, part of an escape plan for convicted terrorist|url=http://www.amna.gr/english/article/12946/Helicopter-pilot-foils-hijack-attempt--part-of-an-escape-plan-for-convicted-terrorist/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
This article is about the [[phonology]] of the [[Lithuanian language]]. Lithuanian has a phonemic inventory consisting of eleven [[vowel]]s and 45 [[consonant]]s, including 22 pairs of consonants distinguished by the presence or absence of [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]].

All Lithuanian consonants except {{IPA|/j/}} have two variants: a non-[[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] one and a [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] one, represented by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols in the chart (i.e., {{IPA|/b/}}&amp;nbsp;– {{IPA|/bʲ/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}&amp;nbsp;– {{IPA|/dʲ/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}&amp;nbsp;– {{IPA|/ɡʲ/}}, and so on). The consonants {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/x/}}, {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and their palatalized variants are only found in [[loanword]]s. Consonants preceding the front vowels {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/æː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}}, as well as any palatalized consonant or {{IPA|/j/}} are always moderately palatalized (a feature Lithuanian has in common with the [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] languages but which is not present in the more closely related [[Latvian language|Latvian]]). Followed by back vowels {{IPA|/aː/}}, {{IPA|/ɐ/}}, {{IPA|/oː/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, {{IPA|/uː/}}, and {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, consonants can also be palatalized (causing some vowels to shift; see the [[#Vowels|Vowels section]] below); in such cases, the standard orthography inserts the letter ''i'' between the vowel and the preceding consonant  (which is not pronounced separately), e.g. ''noriu'' {{IPA|[ˈnôːrʲʊ]}}, ('I want'). Most of the non-palatalized and palatalized consonants form [[minimal pair]]s (like ''šuo'' {{IPA|[ʃuə]}}, 'dog' ~ ''šiuo'' {{IPA|[ɕuə]}}, 'with this one'), so they are independent [[phoneme]]s, rather than [[allophone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from ''[[Lituanus]]'' [http://www.lituanus.org/1982_1/82_1_02.htm Lituanus.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LLE&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambrazas|first=Vytautas|author2=Alexas Girdenis |author3=Kazys Morkūnas |title=Lietuvių kalbos enciklopedija|publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos inst|year=1999|location= Vilnius|pages=497–498|isbn=5-420-01433-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{IPA|/t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ, ʃ, ʒ/}} are laminal flat postalveolar {{IPA|[t͡ʃ˖, d͡ʒ˖, ʃ˖, ʒ˖]}}, i.e. they are pronounced without any palatalization at all.{{sfnp|Augustaitis|1964|pp=20–22}}&lt;ref&gt;The transcription {{IPA|[t͡ʃ˖, d͡ʒ˖, ʃ˖, ʒ˖]}} follows {{Harvcoltxt|Laver|1994|pp=251–252}}.

* Before {{IPA|/k, ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} is realized as velar {{IPAblink|ŋ}}. Likewise, before {{IPA|/kʲ, ɡʲ/}}, {{IPA|/nʲ/}} is realized as {{IPA|[ŋʲ]}}.{{sfnp|Ambrazas et al.|1997|p=40}}&lt;ref name=Girdenis_1&gt;Girdenis, Aleksas.''Teoriniai lietuvių fonologijos pagrindai'' (''The theoretical basics of the phonology of Lithuanian'', in Lithuanian), 2nd Edition,  Vilnius: Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos inst.,  2003. pp. 68–72. {{ISBN|5-420-01501-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is sometimes realized as {{IPAblink|ɦ}}. Since the palatalized variant is always velar {{IPA|[ɣʲ]}}, {{IPA|[ɣ]}} is preferred over {{IPA|[ɦ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pakerys. "Bendrinės lietuvių kalbos fonetika" Vilnius, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the case of the soft velar consonants {{IPA|/kʲ, ɡʲ, xʲ, ɣʲ/}} (as well as the {{IPA|[ŋʲ]}} allophone of {{IPA|/n/}}), the softness (palatalization) is realized as slight fronting of the place of articulation to [[post-palatal]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|k̟}}, {{IPA link|ɡ˖}}, {{IPA link|x̟}}, {{IPA link|ɣ˖}}, {{IPA link|ŋ˖}}]}}.{{sfnp|Mathiassen|1996|pp=22–23}}{{sfnp|Ambrazas et al.|1997|p=36}} However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Augustaitis|1964}}, the stops {{IPA|/kʲ, ɡʲ/}} are more strongly advanced, i.e. to palatal {{IPA|[{{IPA link|c}}, {{IPA link|ɟ}}]}}, rather than post-palatal {{IPA|[{{IPA link|k̟}}, {{IPA link|ɡ˖}}]}}.{{sfnp|Augustaitis|1964|pp=24–25}}
* [[Plosive]]s have [[no audible release]] before other plosives.

==Vowels==
Lithuanian has six long vowels and five short ones (not including the disputed {{IPA|/e/}}). Length has traditionally been considered the distinctive feature, though short vowels are also more centralized and long vowels more peripheral:

&lt;!--Does anyone claim that Lithuanian has *12* phonemic vowels?
However, at least one researcher suggests that a tense vs. lax distinction may be the actual distinguishing feature, or may be at least equally important as vowel length.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Girdenis, Aleksas.''Teoriniai lietuvių fonologijos pagrindai'' (''The theoretical basics of the phonology of Lithuanian'', in Lithuanian), 2nd Edition,  Vilnius: Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos inst.,  2003. pp. 222–232. ISBN 5-420-01501-3&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a hypothesis yields the chart below, where 'long' and 'short' have been preserved to parallel the terminology used above.

{| class="wikitable"
! rowspan=2|&amp;nbsp; !! colspan=2|Front !! colspan=2|Back
|-
! Long !! Short !! Long !! Short
|-
! High
| {{IPA|iː}}|| {{IPA|ɪ}} || {{IPA|uː}} || {{IPA|ʊ}}
|-
! Mid
| {{IPA|eː}} || {{IPA|ɛ}} || {{IPA|oː}} || {{IPA|ɔ}}
|-
! Low
| {{IPA|æː}} || {{IPA|a}} || {{IPA|ɐː}} || {{IPA|ʌ}}
|}
--&gt;
* {{IPA|/e, ɔ/}} are restricted to loanwords. Many speakers merge the former with {{IPA|/ɛ/}}.{{sfnp|Ambrazas et al.|1997|p=24}}
* {{IPA|/ɐ, aː/}} are phonetically central {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɐ}}, {{IPA link|äː}}]}}. Phonologically, they behave like back vowels.

In standard Lithuanian vowels {{IPA|[aː]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ]}} generally are not pronounced after any palatalized consonant (including {{IPA|[j]}}). In this position, they systematically shift to {{IPA|[æː]}} or {{IPA|[ɛː]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}} respectively: ''galia'' ('power') = ''gale'' ('in the end') {{IPA|[ɡɐˈlʲɛ]}}, ''gilią'' ('profound' singular accusative) = ''gilę'' ('acorn' singular accusative) {{IPA|[ˈɡʲɪlʲæː]}}.

On the other hand, in everyday language {{IPA|[ɛː]}} usually shifts to {{IPA|[æː]}} (or sometimes even {{IPA|[aː]}}) if the vowel precedes a non-palatalized consonant: ''jachtą,'' ('yacht' singular accusative), or ''retas,'' ('rare'), are often realized as {{IPA|[ˈjæːxtaː]}} and {{IPA|[ˈrʲæːtɐs]}} (or sometimes even {{IPA|[ˈjaːxtaː]}} and {{IPA|[ˈrʲaːtɐs]}}) instead of {{IPA|[ˈjɛːxtaː]}} and {{IPA|[ˈrʲɛːtɐs]}} as the following consonants {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} are not palatalized.&lt;ref&gt;Dabartinės lietuvių kalbos gramatika. Vilnius, 1997, page 23, §14(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon does not affect short vowels.

===Diphthongs===
Lithuanian is traditionally described as having nine [[diphthong]]s, ''ai'','' au'','' ei'','' eu'','' oi'','' ou'','' ui'','' ie'', and'' uo.'' However, some approaches (i.e., Schmalstieg 1982) treat them as vowel sequences rather than diphthongs; indeed, the longer component depends on the type of stress, whereas in diphthongs, the longer segment is fixed.

Lithuanian long stressed syllables can have either a rising or a falling tone. In specialized literature, they are marked with a tilde {{angbr|˜}} or an acute accent {{angbr|´}} respectively. The tone is especially clearly audible in diphthongs, since in the case of the rising tone, it makes the second element longer (e.g., ''aĩ'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɐɪ̯ˑ]}}), while the falling tone prolongs the first element (e.g., ''ái'' is pronounced {{IPA|[âˑɪ̯]}}) (for more detailed information, see [[Lithuanian accentuation]]). The full set is as follows:

==Pitch accent==
{{Main|Lithuanian accentuation}}
The Lithuanian prosodic system is characterized by free accent and distinctive quantity. Its accentuation is sometimes described as a simple [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] system, often called [[pitch accent]].&lt;ref name=tone&gt;''Phonetic invariance and phonological stability: Lithuanian pitch accents'' Grzegorz Dogil &amp; Gregor Möhler, 1998 [http://eprints.kfupm.edu.sa/57901/]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[lexical word]]s, one syllable will be tonically prominent. A [[heavy syllable]]—that is, a syllable containing a [[long vowel]], [[diphthong]], or a [[sonorant]] coda—may have one of two tones, ''falling tone'' (or ''acute tone'') or ''rising tone'' (or ''circumflex tone''). Light syllables (syllables with short vowels and optionally also [[obstruent]] codas) do not have the two-way contrast of heavy syllables.

Common Lithuanian lexicographical practice uses three diacritic marks to indicate word accent, i.e., the tone and quantity of the accented syllable. They are used in the following way:
* The first (or the only) segment of a heavy syllable with a falling tone is indicated with an acute accent mark (e.g., ''á'', ''ár''), unless the first element is ''i'' or ''u'' followed by a [[tautosyllabic]] resonant, in which case it is marked with a grave accent mark (e.g., ''ìr'', ''ùr'').
* The second (or the only) segment of a heavy syllable with a rising tone is indicated with a circumflex accent (e.g., ''ã'', ''ar̃'')
* Short accented syllables are indicated with a grave accent mark (e.g., ''ì'', ''ù'').

As said, Lithuanian has a ''free'' accent, which means that its position and type is not phonologically predictable and has to be learned by heart. This is the state of affairs inherited from [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language|Proto-Balto-Slavic]] and, to a lesser extent, from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]; Lithuanian circumflex and acute syllables directly reflect Proto-Balto-Slavic acute and circumflex tone opposition.

In a word-final position, the tonal distinction in heavy syllables is almost neutralized, with a few minimal pairs remaining such as ''šáuk,'' ('shoot!'), vs. ''šaũk,'' ('shout!)'. In other syllables, the two-way contrast can be illustrated with pairs such as: ''kóšė'' ('porridge') vs. ''kõšė'' ('it soured'); ''áušti'' ('to cool') vs. ''aũšti'' ('to dawn'); ''drímba'' ('lout') vs. ''drim̃ba'' ('it falls'); ''káltas'' ('chisel') vs. ''kal̃tas'' ('guilty'), ''týrė'' ('[he/she] explored') vs. ''tỹrė'' ('mush').

''Kóšė'' is perceived as having a falling pitch ({{IPA|/ˈkôːɕeː/}} or {{IPA|/ˈkóòɕeː/}}), and indeed acoustic measurement strongly supports this. However, while ''kõšė'' is perceived as having a rising pitch ({{IPA|[ˈkǒːɕeː]}} or {{IPA|[ˈkòóɕeː]}}), this is not supported acoustically; measurements do not find a consistent tone associated with such syllables that distinguish them from unaccented heavy syllables. The distinguishing feature appears to be a negative one, that they do not have a falling tone.&lt;ref name=tone/&gt;

If diphthongs (and truly long vowels) are treated as sequences of vowels, then a single stress mark is sufficient for transcription: ''áušta'' {{IPA|/ˈauʃta/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈâˑʊʃtɐ]}} ('it cools') vs. ''aũšta'' {{IPA|/aˈuʃta/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɐˈuˑʃtɐ]}} ('it dawns'); ''kóšė'' {{IPA|/ˈkooɕe/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈkôːɕeː]}} ('porridge') vs. ''kõšė'' {{IPA|/koˈoɕe/}} &gt; {{IPA|[koˈoˑɕeː]}} ('it soured').

The Lithuanian accentual system inherited another very important aspect from the Proto-Balto-Slavic period, and that is the [[Proto-Balto-Slavic#Balto-Slavic fixed and mobile paradigms|accentual mobility]]. Accents can alternate throughout the inflection of a word by both the syllable position and type. Parallels can be drawn with some modern Slavic languages, namely [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Accentual mobility is prominent in nominal stems, while verbal stems mostly demonstrate phonologically predictable patterns.

Lithuanian nominal stems are commonly divided into four accentual classes, usually referred to by their numbers:
* Accent paradigm 1: Fixed (columnar) accent on a non-[[desinence|desinential]] syllable. If the accent is on a pre-desinential syllable, it carries the acute tone.
* Accent paradigm 2: Alternation of accent on a short or circumflex pre-desinential syllable with desinential accentuation.
* Accent paradigm 3: Alternation of accent on a non-desinential syllable with desinential accentuation. If the accent is on a pre-desinential syllable, it carries the acute tone.
* Accent paradigm 4: Alternation of accent on short or circumflex pre-desinential syllable with desinential accentuation.

The previously described accentual system primarily applies to the Western [[Aukštaitian dialect]] on which the standard Lithuanian literary language is based. The speakers of the other group of Lithuanian dialects&amp;nbsp;– [[Samogitian dialect|Samogitian]]&amp;nbsp;– have a very different accentual system, and they do not adopt standard accentuation when speaking the standard idiom. Speakers of the major cities, such as [[Vilnius]], [[Kaunas]] and [[Klaipėda]], with mixed populations generally do not have intonational oppositions in spoken language, even when they speak the standard idiom.

==Change and variation==
The [[sound change|changes]] and variation in Lithuanian [[Indo-European sound laws#Consonants|phonetics]] include diachronic changes of a quality of a [[phoneme]], [[alternation (linguistics)|alternations]], dialectal variation, variation between corresponding sounds of individual inflectional [[morpheme]]s of the same [[grammatical category]], which is at the same time qualitative and quantitative, diachronic and synchronic.

*The diachronic qualitative phonemic changes include o {{IPA|/oː/}} ← ā (a narrowing of a more open vowel), uo ← ō turnings.
*Among examples of the variation between sounds of different inflectional [[morpheme]]s of a certain [[grammatical category]] there is historical shortening of a [[Lithuanian declension|declensional ending]] ''a'' in some positions: ''motina'' ('mother' nom. sg.-instr. sg.) &lt; *mātina &lt; *mātinā, *mātinās &gt; motinos (gen. sg.). Synchronous variation between shorter (more recent) and longer (more archaic) personal endings in [[Lithuanian grammar#The Verb|verbs]], depending on final position: keli'''u''' ('I am lifting something')'&amp;nbsp;– keli'''uo'''si ('I am getting up' reflexive); kel'''i''' ('you are lifting') &amp;nbsp;– kel'''{{notatypo|ie}}'''si ('you get up'); kelia'''me''' ('we are lifting) '&amp;nbsp;– kelia'''mė'''s ('we get up').
*Examples of [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] include variation between {{IPA|/d, t/}} and palatalized {{IPA|/d͡ʑ t͡ɕ/}} respectively: nom. sg. pa'''t'''-s 'myself; himself; itself' (''masculine gender''), gen. sg. pa'''t'''-ies, dat. sg. pa'''č'''-iam; jau'''č'''iu 'I feel', jau'''t'''i 'you feel'; gir'''dž'''iu 'I hear', gir'''d'''i 'you hear'. Variation between a lengthened, uttered in a falling, lengthened tone and a short ''a'' and ''e'' alike (only if these sounds end a syllable), variation between a long, uttered in a falling, lengthened tone and a short ''i'' at an ending of a word, depending on accentual position: v'''ã'''karas {{IPA|[ˈvaːkɐrɐs]}} ''nominative'' 'an evening', v'''a'''karè {{IPA|[vɐkɐˈrɛ]}} ''locative'' 'in the evening'; radinỹs {{IPA|[rɐdɪˈniːs]}} ''nom.'' 'a finding, a find', rãdinio {{IPA|[ˈraːdɪnʲoː]}} ''genitive'' (from ràsti {{IPA|[ˈrɐstɪ]}} 'to find'); pãtiekalas 'a dish, course', patiekalaĩ ''nom. plural.'' (from patiẽkti 'to serve (a dish)'); vèsti 'to lead; to marry' vedìmas (a noun for an action) vẽdamas (participle) 'who is being led; married'; baltinỹs 'cloth which is being whitened', baltìnis 'white; (dial.) white of the egg' (derivatives from baltas 'white').

Variation in sounds takes place in word formation. Some examples:

The examples in the table are given as an overview, the word formation comprises many words not given here, for example, any verb can have an adjective made by the same pattern: sverti&amp;nbsp;– svarus 'valid; ponderous'; svirti&amp;nbsp;– svarùs 'slopable'; vyti&amp;nbsp;– vajùs 'for whom it is characteristic to chase or to be chased'; pilti&amp;nbsp;– pilùs 'poury'; but for example visti&amp;nbsp;– vislùs 'prolific' (not visus, which could conflict with an adjective of a similar form visas 'all, entire'). Many verbs, besides a noun derivative with the ending -ìmas, can have different derivatives of the same meaning: pilti&amp;nbsp;– pylìmas, pylà, pỹlis (they mean the act of the verb: a pouring (of any non solid material)); the first two have meanings that look almost identical but are drawn apart from a direct link with the verb: pylimas 'a bank, an embankment', pylà 'pelting; spanking, whipping'; the word svõris 'a weight', for example, does not have the meaning of an act of weighing. There are also many other derivatives and patterns of derivation.

'''Ludmila Kuchar Foxlee''' was a social worker at the [[Ellis Island]] immigration station. Employed by the [[YWCA]] after [[World War I]], Foxlee spent time in [[Czechoslovakia]] to assist in rebuilding efforts before working at Ellis Island from 1920 to 1937. She became one of most well-known immigrant aid workers&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/elis/learn/historyculture/people_immigrant_aid_worker.htm|publisher=nps.gov|title=Immigrant Aid Worker - Ellis Island Part of Statue of Liberty National Monument (U.S. National Park Service)|accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her meticulous notes are currently stored at the Ellis Island archives.

== Early life ==
Foxlee was born in [[Bohemia]] in 1885. She emigrated to the [[United States]] with her family in 1890.

== Social work ==
Foxlee helped thousands of detained immigrants at Ellis Island. She served as a translator, as she was fluent in several languages in addition to her native Czech. Foxlee was interested in the folk dress and music of newcomers. She also assisted in the immigrants' [[cultural assimilation]] to U.S. society, at times giving women a "makeover" with Americanized clothing.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/a-cautionary-valentine-they-came-to-america-for-love-but-found-themselves-on-heartbreak-island-8495628.html|publisher=independent.co.uk|title=A cautionary Valentine: They came to America for love, but found themselves on Heartbreak Island &amp;#124; The Independent|accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Midnight Patrol: Adventures in the Dream Zone'''''  is a British American animated series produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] in conjunction with [[Entertainment Rights|Sleepy Kids PLC]] and is known outside the US as '''''Potsworth &amp; Co.'''''. In the United Kingdom (which is reflected in the theme song's lyrics in the British broadcast), the BBC felt that the suggestion of children being awake after midnight was inappropriate, thus the name was changed.

==History==
The series revolves around Potsworth, an [[English Springer Spaniel]], based upon a real-life springer spaniel called Potsworth, bought from the [[Battersea Dogs and Cats Home|Battersea Dogs Home]] by Martin and Vivien Schrager-Powell. The couple were somewhat disheartened with some of the children's programmes being made at the time, commenting that "Six-year-olds just aren't content to be fobbed off with 'Mr Wizard go pouf and nasty man go away'. Stories these days have to be believable, contain some logical process". In 1987, Martin started writing stories about Potsworth who lives in a city in America and four young children: Carter, Keiko, Rosie, and Nick.  The couple took the idea to [[Hanna-Barbera]] and suggested a 50-50 deal to turn the stories into a television series.&lt;ref name="managementtoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/409470/UK-Making-Tough-Tots---SLEEPY-KIDS/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH |title=UK: Making it Tough for Tots - SLEEPY KIDS. |publisher=Management Today |date=1992-06-01 |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First appearing on ''[[The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera]]'' on the 1st September [[1990 in television|1990]], ''Midnight Patrol: Adventures in the Dream Zone'' lasted only 13 episodes.  It was watched by 8.5 million in the US while 5.1 million watched the series on [[CBBC]] in Britain, making it the "second most popular children's show on British television after ''[[Neighbours]]''".&lt;ref name="managementtoday1"/&gt;

The "real" Potsworth became something of a celebrity when he featured extensively in the British media as part of the promotion campaign for the cartoon series when it first aired in the UK in 1990/91 television season.   A comic strip based on the show featured in the merged ''[[The Beezer|Beezer and Topper]]'' and, when that comic closed, the ''[[The Dandy|Dandy]]''.

The series' setting, "Dream Zone", was first used on  "Back to Next Saturday", the NBC Saturday Morning preview special for the 1985 season.

==Premise==
The series tells of four children and Potsworth the dog who live in the same neighborhood. When they go to sleep at night they turn up in the Dream Zone where, as the Midnight Patrol, they are appointed by the Grand Dozer to protect it from nightmares and other threats and are given their missions by the Snooze Patrol. Their main enemy is the Nightmare Prince.

Whilst they are in the Dream Zone, the five have special powers. Keiko has a flying [[skateboard]]; Carter can draw anything and then have it come to life; Nick is super-strong and is able to fly; his stuffed toy Murphy comes to life; whilst his cynical sister Rosie tags along. Potsworth himself acquires the power of speech which enables him to complain about the way he is treated in the real world, and make wry comments about the kids and their own attitudes and relationships. The cartoon Potsworth had a very "English" accent, even in the American version of the programmes, reflecting his real-life counterpart's British origins.

==Computer game==
An officially licensed computer game of the series, using its British title of ''Potsworth and Co'', was released in 1992 by Hi-Tec Software for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Atari ST]].

In this scrolling [[platform game]], the player took on the role of one of the characters in each themed level and had to collect various items and then reach the exit.

==Characters==
===Midnight Patrol===
The 5 Midnight Patrol members are the main stars of the show. Each one has his/her individual abilities.

* '''Potsworth''' - A sarcastic 10-year-old [[English Springer Spaniel]] who usually has a stern voice when he enters the Dream Zone.
* '''Nick''' - A 6-year-old boy who is a flying superhero when he's in the Dream Zone and is sometimes referred to as "Super Nick".
** '''Murphy''' - Nick's toy [[Brontosaurus]] who comes to life when he enters the Dream Zone.
* '''Rosie''' - Nick's 8-year old big sister. An annoying brat who gives the group a very hard time (in ways similar to [[Lucy van Pelt]] in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comics by Charles M. Schulz, Margaret Wade in the ''[[Dennis the Menace (U.S. comics)|Dennis the Menace]]'' comics by Hank Ketcham, Zoe in H-B's ''[[Fantastic Max]]'' cartoon series or [[Angelica Pickles]] in Nickelodeon's ''[[Rugrats]]'' cartoon series), though she still helps out in dangerous situations. She calls Nick by his full name "Nicholas" whenever she yells at him, which is quite often. She is the only member of the Midnight Patrol without a special ability.
* '''Keiko''' - A 9-year-old [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] girl who rides a flying skateboard. She is energetic and very optimistic and likes to be seen as the leader of the group.
* '''Carter''' - A 10-year old [[African Americans|African American]] boy who is an expert artist. In the Dream Zone his magic paintbrush can bring many things to life. He is Potsworth's owner.

===Other Dream Zone characters===
The Dream Zone has a number of inhabitants, the principals of which include:

* '''The Grand Dozer''' - King of the Dream Zone, he spends his time half-asleep on top of a pile of mattresses. He has to stay this way because if he were to be fully awake the Dream Zone will come to an end. He gives advice but in the form of riddles which can be a bit of a frustration.
* '''The Chief''' - A large but friendly woman who heads the local police and assigns the Midnight Patrol with their missions.
* '''Sebastian''' - The Grand Dozer's head butler. He is always anxious that his King is safe and asleep. A running gag of the series is that, whenever Sebastian claims the Grand Dozer is in a certain mood, the Grand Dozer would be shown sleeping, prompting Sebastian to state the Grand Dozer would be in that mood if he were awake.
* '''The Greystone Giant''' - A giant made of rock who lives in a cave filled with various objects which he supplies for people's dreams. Because there are so many dreamers he is always at work and never stops grumbling about it, though deep down he loves his job.

===Antagonists===
* '''The Nightmare Prince''' - The villain of the series. The Nightmare Prince is always coming up with ways of disrupting the Grand Dozer's sleep or other nasty schemes in order to allow nightmares to take over from dreams. He is the Midnight Patrol's main enemy, though he is such a bungling idiot that his plans can fail due to his own incompetence.
** '''Igor''' - One of the Nightmare Prince's dimwitted potato-shaped minions.
** '''Irving''' - One of the Nightmare Prince's dimwitted potato-shaped minions.
** '''Shorty''' - One of the Nightmare Prince's dimwitted potato-shaped minions.
* '''The Nightmare Prince's Mother''' - This [[unseen character]] is always phoning up to tell her son to get on with destroying happy dreams, and reproving him when things go wrong. The fact that the Prince has a large-sized telephone (as opposed to a [[mobile phone]]) literally up his sleeve means that she calls him almost all the time. Her constant yapping through the phone is reminiscent of the General from ''[[Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines]]''.

===Other villains===
* '''The Nosey Bird''' - A villain that talks creeky like [[Peter Lorre]] and only appears in ''The Nightmirror'' and ''Santanapped'' where he promises the Nightmare Prince not to tell anyone his secret. The Nightmare Prince was actually hoping he'd gossip.
* '''Count Bubba Bonebreaker''' - The nephew of the Nightmare Prince's Mother and the cousin of the Nightmare Prince. This villain was once in charge of nightmares when the Nightmare Prince's Mother demoted him to janitor.

The '''military-entertainment complex''' is a concept relating to the cooperation between the military and entertainment industries to their mutual benefit, especially in such fields as [[Filmmaking|cinema]],  [[multimedia]] and [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://one.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-004-the-military-entertainment-complex-a-new-facet-of-information-warfare The Military-Entertainment Complex: A New Facet of Information Warfare], The Fibreculture Journal, Issue 1 – 2003. Retrieved Apr 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/Lenoir-Lowood_TheatersOfWar.pdf Theaters of War: The Military-Entertainment Complex], Tim Lenoir and Henry Lowood, Stanford University, 2002.

Retrieved Apr 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept, the '''creative-industrial complex''', describes the collaborative relationships between creative, industry, and military institutions for political and economic gain. An example of this in practice is Japan's Manga Military,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan: The Manga Military|url = http://thediplomat.com/2016/01/japans-creative-industrial-complex/|website = The Diplomat|access-date = 2016-01-22|first = Matthew Brummer, The|last = Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the Self Defense Force uses  affective cultural resources to shape public perceptions of the country's military establishment.

The '''millennial whoop''' is a melodic pattern alternating between the fifth and third notes in a [[major scale]], typically starting on the fifth, in the rhythm of straight 8th-notes, and often using the "wa" and "oh" syllables.&lt;ref name="tp-20160820"/&gt; It has been used extensively in 2010s [[pop music]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2016/aug/30/millennial-whoop-pop-music|title=The Millennial Whoop: the melodic hook that’s taken over pop music |last=Haynes |first=Gavin |date=August 30, 2016 |website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/08/29/what-millennial-whoop-and-why-every-pop-song/89547506/ |title=What is the 'millennial whoop' and why is it in every pop song? |last=Bui |first=Hoai-Tran  |date=August 29, 2016 |website=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview ==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = In the slavishly playlisted, gnat's-attention-span world of daytime radio, the Whoop has become a signalling device, often cropping up bang on cue around the one-minute mark, saying: "Hey wait! Don't run away just yet!"
 |source = —Music blogger Patrick Metzger&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;
 |width  = 25%
}}
The term was coined by the musician Patrick Metzger, who described it in a blog entry on ''The Patterning'' in August 2016.&lt;ref name="tp-20160820"/&gt; He suggested that, while the millennial whoop gained popularity from the late 2000s to 2010s, it has probably always been around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartleet|first1=Larry|title=What Is The Millennial Whoop? Once You Hear This Virulent Pop Hook You Won’t Be Able To Unhear It|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/what-is-the-millennial-whoop-songs|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=NME|date=September 1, 2016|ref=bartleet}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier use can be heard in the 1983 song "[[Jungle Love (The Time song)|Jungle Love]]" by [[Morris Day and the Time]].&lt;ref name="qz"/&gt;

The 2017 song "Millennial Whoop" by American rock band [[The Pilgrims (band)|the Pilgrims]] was written as a response to the idea of older generations looking down upon the younger for using such tropes: the song makes use of the interval pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://countytracks.com/2017/06/the-best-vermont-music-of-2017-so-far/|title=The Best Vermont Music of 2017 (So Far) - County Tracks|date=2017-06-22|work=County Tracks|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawsuit ==
In 2013 songwriter [[Ally Burnett]] tried to sue Carly-Rae Jepsen and Owl City over their 2012 song "[[Good Time (Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen song)|Good Time]]", arguing similarities to her 2010 song "Ah, It's a Love Song" and its use of the Millennial whoop.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Jepsen settled out of court, but Owl City won.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

== Uses ==
One notable use of the millennial whoop is in the 1987 theme song by [[Mark Mueller]] for the American animated television series ''[[DuckTales]]'' which ran for a total of 100 episodes.&lt;ref name="ns-20171104"/&gt; It does not occur in some other language versions of the 1987 theme&lt;ref name="ns-20171104"/&gt; nor in the 2017 English version of the theme song.&lt;ref name="dxd-20170615"/&gt;

Songs where the millennial whoop appear include:
* "[[Jungle Love (The Time song)|Jungle Love]]" (1983, [[Morris Day and the Time]])&lt;ref name="qz"/&gt;
* "[[Tarzan Boy]]" (1985, [[Baltimora]])&lt;ref name="tp-20160820"/&gt; (The B-part of the ABAB-structured chorus)
* "[[In the Shadows (song)|In the Shadows]]" (2003, [[The Rasmus]])&lt;ref name="tp-20160820"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;
* "[[California Gurls]]" (2010, [[Katy Perry]])&lt;ref name="qz"/&gt;
* "[[Good Time (Owl City and Carly Rae Jepsen song)|Good Time]]" (2012, [[Carly Rae Jepsen]] and [[Owl City]])&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

== History ==
In Australia, Open Educational Practices (OEP) started around 1998, when some of the first open access initiatives were introduced and supported by the Australian government.&lt;ref&gt;Picasso, V., &amp; Phelan, L. (2014). The evolution of open access to research and data in Australian higher education. RUSC. ''Universities and Knowledge Society Journal'', 11(3), 122–133. doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.7238/rusc.v11i3.2076&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[Open Access movement|open access movement]] had a substantial boost due to a programme funded by the Australian government called “[[Backing Australia's Ability|Backing Australia’s Ability]]”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Shipp, J. (2006). Open access in Australia. In N. Jacobs (Ed.), ''Open access: key strategic, technical and economic aspects'' (pp. 169–174). London: Chandos Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; This programme was aimed broadly at promoting excellence in research, science and technology, but several initiatives attached to this programme played important roles in the progress of open access in Australia. They assisted in: raising awareness about open access; building research [[information infrastructure]], including university repositories of [[open data]], thesis and other digital objects; establishing [[metadata]] standards to improve access and discoverability of research information; and developing related guidelines.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Transformation of OEP Realised in Australia ==
Although the opportunities and benefits of OEP have been realised by the Australian government through investments in open access and by the [[TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|VET]] and schools sectors, it was only in 2010 — almost 10 years after the movement emerged in other parts of the world (i.e., the MIT [[OpenCourseWare Consortium]] in 2001) — that it started getting more popular in higher education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It was during this period that the Office for Learning and Teaching funded a two-year research project, which resulted in the report "Adoption, Use and Management of Open Educational Resources in Australia Higher Education".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bossu, C., Brown, M., &amp; Bull, D. (2014a). ''Adoption, use and management of Open Educational Resources to enhance teaching and learning in Australia''. Sydney: Australian Government O ce for Learning and Teaching. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.olt.gov.au/system/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/resources/CG10_1687_Bossu_ Report_2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main deliverables of this project was the “Feasibility Protocol for OER and OEP” (Bossu, Brown, &amp; Bull, 2014b), which is a set of guiding principles that prompts questions and raises issues to be considered by educational institutions wishing to experiment with OER and OEP. The protocol attempts to assist higher education leaders to make informed decisions about the adoption of OER and OEP at several levels within the institution, from management to individuals, including academics and students.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bossu, C., Brown, M., &amp; Bull, D. (2014b). ''Feasibility protocol for OER and OEP: A decision making tool for higher education''. Sydney: Australian Government O ce for Learning and Teaching. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.olt.gov.au/&lt;/nowiki&gt; system/ les/resources/CG10_1687_Bossu_Feasibility%20Protocol_2014. pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Feasibility Protocol addresses four topics: the opportunities that OER and OEP could bring to institutions and broader society; the challenges associated with OER and OEP adoption; considerations surrounding the institutions’ strategic directions for an effective adoption of OER and OEP; and policy recommendations for higher education institutions in Australia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another contribution of the two-year research project in helping the sector realise the opportunities of OER for higher education in Australia was the organisation of the first National Symposium on OER, held in August 2012 in Sydney. A range of stakeholders representing 21 national and international institutions (including higher educational institutions, VET and government bodies) attended the symposium. The symposium was a key dissemination strategy for this project, and a chance for the stakeholders to meet and discuss issues related to open education, opportunities for collaboration, and ways to together overcome some of these concerns.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Scope of Transformation of OEP in Australia ==
The scope of the transformation of OEP in Australia is best understood by looking at the main initiatives, programmes and activities categorised into five themes: collaboration; resources and infrastructure; open policies; learning and teaching; and research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Collaboration ===
Collaboration amongst institutions and countries is recognised as one of the opportunities of the transformative potential of open education.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of Learning. (2011). ''Guidelines for Open Educational Resources (OER) in higher education''. Vancouver: UNESCO/Commonwealth of Learning. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002136/213605e&lt;/nowiki&gt;. pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this collaboration is the [[OER Universitas|OERu]], which is a consortium of currently 39 international educational institution partners, spread across five continents. In Australia, six universities are part of this network: [[University of Canberra]], [[University of Southern Queensland]], [[University of Wollongong]], [[Charles Sturt University]], [[Curtin University]] and the [[University of Tasmania]]. The OERu’s vision is to make education accessible to everyone. Co-ordinated by the [[Open Education Resource Foundation|OER Foundation]], it is an independent, not-for-profit network that offers free online courses for students worldwide. It also provides affordable ways for learners to gain academic credit towards qualifications from recognised institutions.&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, R., Mackintosh, W., &amp; Taylor, J. (2013). Open Educational Resources university: An assessment and credit for students initiatives. In R. McGreal, W. Kinuthia, &amp; S. Marshall (Eds.), ''Open educational resources: Innovation, research and practice'' (pp. 47–59). Vancouver: Commonwealth of Learning and Athabasca University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Resources and infrastructure ===
Several Australian universities have invested in resource production and in the development and improvement of technological infrastructure. Examples of resource production are initiatives such as MOOCs. Following the international trend, a number of Australian universities have joined the major MOOC providers, including [[edX]], [[Coursera]] and the British [[FutureLearn]], while others have developed their own MOOCs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Norton, A., &amp; Cherastidtham, I. (2014). ''Mapping Australian higher education'', 2014–15. Grattan Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, more than 100 Australian MOOCs are on offer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mooc-list.com/countrys/australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These are mostly free online courses and are likely to approach learning and teaching more traditionally ([[Massive open online course#cMOOCs and xMOOCs|xMOOCs]]) instead of being truly open and adopting open pedagogies and open learning ecosystems (including [[Massive open online course#cMOOCs and xMOOCs|cMOOCs]]).&lt;ref&gt;James, R., &amp; Bossu, C. (2014). Conversations from south of the equator: Challenges and opportunities in OER across broader Oceania. RUSC. ''Universities and Knowledge Society Journal'', 11(3), 78–90. doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.7238/rusc&lt;/nowiki&gt;. v11i3.2220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, R., Bossu, C., &amp; Stagg, A. (2015). Toward an Open Empowered Learning Model of pedagogy in higher education. In M. Keppell, S. Reushle, &amp; A. Antonio (Eds.), ''Open learning and formal credentialing in higher education: Curriculum models and institutional policies''. Hershey: IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, only a few MOOCs have been developed with some open aspects. For instance, the content might be openly licensed, but the [[learning management system]] (LMS) where the courses are hosted is a proprietary system and requires learners to register. Some institutions are still investing in this space, but the initial hype about MOOCs seems to have faded to some extent in Australia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Open policies ===
Encouraged by recent OEP initiatives taking place nationally and internationally, some Australian universities have realised that they need to review and, as needed, further develop their related policies in order to enable innovation and maintain a competitive edge. According to Scott,&lt;ref&gt;Scott, B. (2014). ''Supporting OER engagement at Australian universities: An overview of the intellectual property rights, copyright and policy considerations for OER''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.olt.gov.au/system/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/resources/CG10_1687_ Bossu_OER%20engagement_2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[intellectual property]] policies are currently under review at several Australian universities. Other universities have encouraged the adoption of OEP through supporting documentation, such as university strategic plans and teaching performance reviews. An example of such a development is the Technology Enhanced Learning and Teaching White Paper 2014–2018, developed by the Tasmanian Institute of Learning and Teaching at the University of Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, N., Kregor, G., Williams, G., Padgett, L., Bossu, C., Warren, V., &amp; Osborne, J. (2013). ''Technology-enhanced learning and teaching White Paper 2014–2018''. Tasmanian Institute of Learning and Teaching (Trans.). Hobart: University of Tasmania.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning and teaching ===
Although it could be assumed that the examples above might all impact learning and teaching, there are some programmes specifically targeting learning and teaching for OEP. Most universities experimenting with OEP in Australia have some form of academic development activities to build internal capacity. These activities are in the form of workshops, webinars, one-on-one consultancies and online resources produced by the institutions or adopted/adapted from elsewhere. One example is the “[[Curriculum development|Curriculum Design]] for Open Education,” which is an open and online professional development micro-course focused on developing the capacity of academics to adopt OEP as the basis for innovative, engaging and agile [[Curriculum|curricula]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Research ===
Research in OEP has been conducted as part of some of the projects and initiatives in Australia. Postgraduate students in several institutions have also undertaken research, and could very well be the Australian OEP advocates and researchers of the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Piaroa''' are an [[indigenous people]] of the middle [[Orinoco River|Orinoco Basin]] in present-day [[Venezuela]], living in an area equivalent to the size of Belgium, roughly circumscribed by the Parguaza (north), the Ventuari (south-east), the Manapiare (north-east) and the right bank of the Orinoco (west). Their present-day population is of about 14,000 [http://www.ine.gov.ve (INE 2002)], with some 500 living on the left bank of the Orinoco River, in Colombia, in several [[Indian reservation|reservations]] between the Vichada (north) and the Guaviare (south).&lt;ref name="Salud Indígena en Venezuela"&gt;Freire &amp; Zent. 2007. "Los Piaroa", in [http://www.gea.org.ve/GEA-Venezuela/publicaciones.html Salud Indígena en Venezuela], vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The Piaroa, a term of unknown origin, are also known as De'arua (masters of the forest), Wothuha (knowledgeable people), also spelled Huǫttųją ([[Summer Institute of Linguistics|NTM]] spelling) and Wötʰïhä ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] spelling), and De'atʰïhä (people of the forest).&lt;ref name="Salud Indígena en Venezuela"/&gt;

==Society==
Seeing competition as spiritually evil and lauding cooperation, the Piaroa are both strongly [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and supportive of individual [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name="Graeber"&gt;Graeber, David. 2004 [http://ramshackleglory.com/paradigm14.pdf "Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology."]&lt;/ref&gt; The Piaroa are also strongly [[anti-authoritarian]] and opposed to the hoarding of resources, which they see as giving members the power to constrain their freedom.&lt;ref name="Graeber"/&gt; 

Despite sometimes being described as one of the world's most peaceful societies,&lt;ref name="Graeber"/&gt; modern anthropologists report that the relations of Piaroa with neighbouring tribes are actually "unfriendly, marked by physical or magical warfare".&lt;ref name="ivic.academia.edu"&gt;https://ivic.academia.edu/Zent/Papers/454553/The_Political_Ecology_of_Ethnic_Frontiers_and_Relations_among_the_Piaroa_of_the_Middle_Orinoco&lt;/ref&gt; Violent conflict erupted between the Piaroa and the wæñæpi of the Upper Suapure and Guaviarito regions, with both tribes fighting to control the clay pits of the Guanay valley. Clay from that valley is a valuable commodity, being the best clay for making pottery in the region. Constant warfare also exists between the Piaroa and Caribs, who invaded Piaroa territory from the east in search of captives.&lt;ref name="ivic.academia.edu"/&gt;

Anthropologist [[Joanna Overing]] also notes that [[social hierarchy]] is minimal, and that it would be difficult to say any form of male dominance exists, despite leaders being traditionally male.&lt;ref name="Graeber"/&gt; As a result, the Piaroa have been described by some anthropologists as a functioning [[anarchism|anarchist]] society.&lt;ref name=Graeber/&gt;

==Language==
The Piaroa speak Wötʰïhä tivene, or [[Piaroa language]], which belongs to the [[Salivan language]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Overing, J. 1988. "Los Wothuha," in Aborígenes de Venezuela, edited by J Lizot. Fundación La Salle.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14748">'''Quantum social science''' is an emerging field of interdisciplinary research which draws parallels between [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] and the [[social science|social sciences]]. Although there is no settled consensus on a single approach&lt;ref name="hone"&gt;{{cite web | last= Höne | first= K.E. |date=27 April 2017 |title= Quantum Social Science | website = Oxford Bibliographies |url= http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199743292/obo-9780199743292-0203.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt;, a unifying theme is that, while the social sciences have long modelled themselves on mechanistic science, they can learn much from quantum ideas such as [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] and [[quantum entanglement| entanglement]]. Some authors are motivated by [[quantum mind]] theories that the brain, and therefore human interactions, are literally based on quantum processes, while others are more interested in taking advantage of the quantum toolkit to simulate social behaviours which elude classical treatment. Quantum ideas have been particularly influential in psychology, but are starting to affect other areas such as [[international relations]] and [[diplomacy]] in what one 2018 paper called a “quantum turn in the social sciences.”&lt;ref name="freitas"&gt;{{cite journal | last= de Freitas | first= E. | last2=Sinclair | first2= N. | date=2018 |title= The Quantum Mind: Alternative Ways of Reasoning with Uncertainty |journal= Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=271-283}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== History ==

The idea that quantum physics might play an important role in living systems has long been considered by physicists. [[Niels Bohr]] for example believed that his principle of complementarity extended into both biology and psychology&lt;ref name="bohr"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Bohr | first= N. |date=1933 |title= Light and Life |journal= Nature |volume=131 |pages=421–423}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while [[Erwin Schrödinger]] wrote in his 1944 book [[What is Life?]] of a “quantum theory of biology” that saw genetic mutations in terms of quantum leaps. In his 1989 book [[The Emperor's New Mind]], [[Roger Penrose]] hypothesized that quantum mechanics plays an essential role in human consciousness. His 1994 follow-up book [[Shadows of the Mind]] speculated that these quantum processes take place in [[microtubule |microtubules]] inside neurons. 

Some physicists have also been willing to consider an even more direct connection between mind and quantum matter, in a quantum version of [[panpsychism]]. In his 1975 book &lt;i&gt;Disturbing the Universe&lt;/i&gt;, [[Freeman Dyson]] wrote that “mind is already inherent in every electron, and the processes of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the processes of choice between quantum states.”&lt;ref name="dyson"&gt;{{cite book |last= Dyson |first= F. |date= 1979 |title= Disturbing the Universe |publisher= Basic Books | pages=168–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bohm]]’s 1951 book &lt;i&gt;Quantum Theory&lt;/i&gt; included a chapter on “Analogies to Quantum Processes” where he considered applications including the understanding of thought processes&lt;ref name="bohm"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bohm |first= D. |date= 1951|title= Quantum Theory |publisher= Prentice Hall }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990 he published a paper named "A New theory of the relationship of mind and matter" which asserts that consciousness permeates all forms of matter.&lt;ref name="bohm2"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Bohm | first= D. | date= 1990 | title= A new theory of the relationship of mind and matter |journal= Philosophical Psychology |volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=271-286}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were popularised and extended by [[Danah Zohar]] in books including &lt;i&gt;The Quantum Self&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref name="zohar1"&gt;{{cite book |last= Zohar |first= D. |date= 1990|title= The Quantum Self: Human Nature and Consciousness Defined by the New Physics | publisher= William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (with Ian Marshall) &lt;i&gt;The Quantum Society&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;ref name="zohar2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Zohar |first1= D. |last2= Marshall |first2= I. |date= 1993|title= The Quantum Society: Mind, Physics, and a New Social Vision |publisher= Bloomsbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Barad]]’s 2007 book &lt;i&gt;Meeting the Universe Halfway&lt;/i&gt; took “Niels Bohr’s philosophy-physics” as a starting point to develop her theory of [[Karen Barad#Agential realism |agential realism]].&lt;ref name="barad"&gt;{{cite book |last= Barad |first= K. |date= 2007|title= Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning | page=24 |publisher= Duke University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in the 1990s, a separate approach to quantum social science was taken by a number of interdisciplinary researchers, working in what became known as [[quantum cognition]], who argued that quantum probability theory was better than classical probability theory at accounting for a range of cognitive effects of the sort studied in [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref name="aerts"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aerts | first= D. | last2=Aerts | first2= S. | date=1994 |title= Applications of quantum statistics in psychological studies of decision processes |journal= Foundations of Science |volume=1 |pages=85–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="khrennikov"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Khrennikov | first= A. | date=1999| title= Classical and Quantum Mechanics on Information Spaces with Applications to Cognitive, Psychological, Social, and Anomalous Phenomena |journal= Foundations of Physics |volume=29 | issue=7 | pages=1065–1098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="busemeyer"&gt;{{cite book |last= Busemeyer |first= J.R. | editor-last=Rudolph | editor-first=L. |date= 2013|chapter= Introduction to Quantum Probability for Social and Behavioural Scientists | pages=75-103 | title = Qualitative Mathematics for the Social Sciences: Mathematical Models for Research on Cultural Dynamics |publisher= Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others worked on developing “weak” or “generalised” versions of quantum theory which extended concepts such as complementarity and entanglement to the social domain.&lt;ref name="atmanspacher"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Atmanspacher | first= H. | last2= Römer | first2= H. |  last3= Walach | first3= H. | date=2002|title= Weak Quantum Theory: Complementarity and Entanglement in Physics and Beyond |journal= Foundations of Physics |volume=32 | issue=3 |pages=379–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walach"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Walach | first= H. | last2= von Stillfried | first2= N. | date=1994 |title= Generalised Quantum Theory: Basic Idea and General Intuition; A Background Story and Overview |journal= Axiomathes |volume=21 | issue=2 |pages=185–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2013 book &lt;i&gt;Quantum Social Science&lt;/i&gt;, Emmanuel Haven and Andrei Khrennikov developed mathematical formalisms for the application of quantum models to topics including psychology, economics, finance, and brain science.&lt;ref name="haven"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Haven |first1= E. |last2= Khrennikov |first2= A. |date= 2013 |title= Quantum Social Science |publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most researchers in areas such as [[quantum cognition]] view the quantum formalism solely as a mathematical toolbox, and do not assume that human cognition is physically based on quantum mechanics. Separately however, researchers in [[quantum biology]] have uncovered evidence of quantum effects being exploited in processes such as photosynthesis and avian navigation; and some authors, notably political scientist [[Alexander Wendt]], have argued that human beings are literally what he calls “walking wave functions”.&lt;ref name="wendt"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wendt |first= A. |date= 2015 |title= Quantum Mind and Social Science: Unifying Physical and Social Ontology |publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core ideas ==

While quantum social scientists are divided on the question of whether social processes are physically quantum in nature, or just happen to be amenable to a quantum approach, there are a number of common ideas, themes, and concerns. The most fundamental is that, since its inception, social science has been based on a classical worldview, which needs to be updated in accordance with the teachings of quantum physics. In particular, quantum theory disputes the key tenets or assumptions of [[materialism]], [[reductionism]], [[determinism]], and [[Mechanism (sociology)|mechanism]].&lt;ref name="wendtchapter"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wendt |first= A. | editor1-last= Guzzini | editor1-first=S. | editor2-last= Leander | editor2-first=A. |date= 2006|chapter= Social Theory as Cartesian Science: An Auto-Critique from a Quantum Perspective | pages=181-219 | title = Constructivism and International Relations: Alexander Wendt and his Critics |publisher= Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the notion of entanglement. In mechanistic or pre-quantum science, particles are seen as individual entities that interact only in a mechanistic sense. In quantum mechanics, particles such as electrons can become entangled so that a measurement on one instantly affects the state of the other. In quantum social science, people are similarly entangled, whether through shared institutions such as language, or (according to some interpretations) through actual physical processes.&lt;ref name="wendt"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An implication is that people are never completely separable, but are entangled elements of society.

Another example is the idea of wave function collapse. In standard interpretations of quantum physics, a particle is described by a [[wave function]], and attributes such as position or momentum are only discovered through a measurement procedure which collapses the wave function to one of a number of allowed states. In quantum social science, mental states are best described as potentialities that “collapse” only when a judgement or decision is made.&lt;ref name="busemeyerbruza"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Busemeyer |first1= J.R. |last2= Bruza |first2= P. |date= 2012 |title= Quantum Models of Cognition and Decision |publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; One consequence of wave function collapse in physics is that a measurement affects the system being studied, and therefore any future measurement. A corresponding phenomenon in social science is the so-called order effect, where responses to survey questions depends on the order in which they are asked.&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Wang | first= Z. | last2= Solloway | first2= T. |  last3= Shiffrin | first3= R.S.  | last4= Busemeyer | first4= J.R.  | date=2014|title= Context effects produced by question orders reveal quantum nature of human judgments |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 | issue=26 |pages=9431–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Ideas from quantum physics have long inspired thinkers in areas such as politics, diplomacy, and [[international relations]]. The journalist [[Flora Lewis]] spoke of the “Quantum Mechanics Of Politics” in 1975.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite web | last= Lewis | first= F. |date=6 November 1983 |title= The Quantum Mechanics Of Politics | website = New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/magazine/the-quantum-mechanics-of-politics.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1997 lecture on "Diplomacy in the Information Age", former US Secretary of State [[George P. Schultz]] credits the physicist [[Sidney Drell]] for coining the term "quantum diplomacy" to describe how diplomats need to account for uncertainty and the fact that “the process of observation itself is a cause of change.”&lt;ref name="shultz"&gt;{{cite web | last= Shultz | first= G.P. |date=30 January 1998 |title= Diplomacy, Wired | website = Hoover Digest |url= https://www.hoover.org/research/diplomacy-wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 paper, [[James Der Derian]] proposed quantum diplomacy as a way to understand the entanglements brought about by a globalized media and a multiplicity of actors operating at different levels.&lt;ref name="derderian"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Der Derian | first= J. | date=2011| title= Quantum Diplomacy, German-US Relations and the Psychogeography of Berlin |journal= The Hague Journal of Diplomacy |volume=6 | issue=3-4 | pages=373–392}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have been a theme of Der Derian’s annual Q2-Symposium since 2014. In a 2018 address to the [[Trilateral Commission]], Danah Zohar argued that a mechanistic worldview has led to problems from inequality to climate change, and that we need to shift to a quantum perspective which incorporates effects such as uncertainty and entanglement.&lt;ref name="zohartalk"&gt;{{cite web | last= Zohar | first= D. |date=16 November 2018|title= Talk at the David Rockefeller Fellows Lunch - 42nd European Meeting of the Trilateral Commission |url= https://soundcloud.com/user-918856622/talk-at-david-rockefeller-fellows-42nd-european-meeting-of-the-trilateral-commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wendt’s 2015 book &lt;i&gt;Quantum Mind and Social Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref name="wendt"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; does not focus on political science, it does discuss the applicability of quantum theory to social systems in general, and its publication led to a great deal of analysis and discussion on this topic.&lt;ref name="fuller"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Fuller | first= S. | date=2018| title= A quantum leap for social theory |journal= Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour |volume=48 | issue=2 | pages=177-182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arfikessler"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Arfi | first= B. | last2= Kessler | first2= O. | date=2018 |title= Forum Introduction: Social Theory Going Quantum-Theoretic?

== Realism ==

A topic of controversy is whether quantum science should be applied to social systems only in a metaphorical sense, or whether it should be taken as a physical description of those systems.&lt;ref name="arfi"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Arfi | first= B. | date=2018 |title= Challenges to a Quantum-Theoretic Social Theory |journal= Millennium: Journal of International Studies |volume= 47 |issue=1 |pages=99–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relates to a broader debate in the sciences about [[scientific realism]], which applies also to quantum physics.&lt;ref name="hone"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Quartering_demo.svg|thumb|200px|Example of the simplest case of quartering two coats of arms]]
[[Image:Stowe_Armorial.jpg|thumb|200px|The 719 quarterings of [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|George, Marquess of Buckingham]]]]
'''Quartering''' in  is a method of joining several different [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] together in one [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] by dividing the shield into equal parts and placing different coats of arms in each division.
[[File:SalisarmsTWO.jpg|thumb|Simple quartering, crudely drawn. De Salis quartered with Fane.]]
[[File:Flag of Maryland.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[flag of Maryland]] has a quartering of the coats of arms of the Calvert and Crossland families]] Typically, a quartering consists of a division into four equal parts, two above and two below (''party per cross''). An example is the Sovereign Arms of the [[United Kingdom]], as used outside [[Scotland]], which consists of four quarterings, displaying the Arms of [[England]], Scotland and [[Ireland]], with the coat for England repeated at the end. (In the royal arms as used in Scotland, the Scottish quartering appears in the first and fourth quarters and the English one second.)
[[File:Coat of arms of the European Union.svg|thumb|right|200px|The coats of arms of the 28 [[Member States of the European Union|Member States]] of the modern [[European Union]] hypothetically arranged as quarterings in a traditional union shield.]]
However, in most traditions there is no limit on the number of divisions allowed, and the records of the [[College of Arms]] include a shield of 323 quarterings for the family of [[Lloyd of Stockton]]. These 323 quarterings include numerous repeated [[attributed arms]] assigned to Welsh chieftains from the 9th century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Neubecker 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of a shield of many quarterings is the coat of arms of the Powys-Lybbe family, which contains 64 quarterings. Different rules apply in [[Scottish heraldry]], and may well apply in other jurisdictions like [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]].

The arms of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]] are arms of dominion, which join together the arms of the ex-kingdoms now part of her kingdom.  However, the vast majority of quarterly coats of arms display arms which are claimed by descent:  in other words, they join together coats of arms of the ancestors of the bearer of the arms.

Strict rules apply, both as to what arms may be displayed by way of quarterings, and the order in which they may be displayed.  Men and women are always entitled to display the arms of their paternal line but are not usually entitled to display by way of quartering the arms of families from whom there is descent only through a female line (for example, the arms of a mother or grandmother or great-grandmother).  An exception is made, however, if the female who breaks the male line of descent is a [[heraldic heiress]]—a woman who has no brothers, or whose brothers have died without issue.  Such a woman is entitled to transmit her father's arms to her own children, who add them as a quartering.  If her father was himself entitled to one or more quarterings, these will pass to his daughters' children as quarterings as well.  Quarterings are displayed in the order in which they are acquired by a family by marriage, starting with those acquired by the earliest marriage to bring in quarterings.  It is permissible to omit quarterings, but if a quartering was brought in by a later quartering, it is essential to show the whole chain of quarterings leading to the quartering displayed, or else to omit the chain altogether.

The larger the number of quarterings, the smaller the space available for each coat of arms, so that most families entitled to many quarterings make a selection of those they ordinarily use.  The [[Duke of Norfolk]], for example, uses only four quarterings, although he is entitled to many more. In Scotland in some cases the plain unquartered coat is the more prized, as entitlement to its use can indicate who is chief of the name and arms and holds the headship of a clan. For example, [[Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun|Flora Fraser, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy]] has arms as chief of [[Frasers of Philorth|Fraser]]—the plain coat of 'azure, three fraises argent'—and a 'private' quartered coat. The Powys-Lybbe family appear, likewise, to usually use only the quarterings of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] and Lybbe.  However these are not true quarterings as the arms were changed in 1907 to be an impartible design of the two arms; the personal arms are precisely this design, with no quarterings despite its appearance. (If this were a quartering the following would apply: when only two different coats of arms are shown, each one is repeated twice in order to fill up the minimum number of four quarterings on such a display.)  Prior to the 1907 change, the family did quarter their arms with Lybbe but with the Powys arms in the top left quarter as these were the family arms; the new design has Lybbe in the top left as Lybbe is the last part of the name.

The '''reef knot''', or '''square knot''', is an ancient and simple [[binding knot]] used to secure a rope or line around an object.  It is sometimes also referred to as a '''Hercules knot'''.   The [[knot]] is formed by tying a left-handed [[overhand knot]] and then a right-handed overhand knot, or vice versa.  A common [[mnemonic]] for this procedure is "right over left; left over right", which is often appended with the rhyming suffix "... makes a knot both tidy and tight".   Two consecutive overhands of the same [[handedness]] will make a [[granny knot]].  The [[working end]]s of the reef knot must emerge both at the top or both at the bottom, otherwise a [[thief knot]] results.

{{Quote|The reef knot or square knot consists of two [[overhand knot|half knots]], one left and one right, one being tied on top of the other, and either being tied first...The reef knot is unique in that it may be tied and tightened with both ends. It is universally used for parcels, rolls and bundles. At sea it is always employed in reefing and furling sails and stopping clothes for drying. But ''under no circumstances should it ever be tied as a bend'', for if tied with two ends of unequal size, or if one end is stiffer or smoother than the other, the knot is almost bound to spill. Except for its true purpose of binding it is a knot to be shunned.|''[[The Ashley Book of Knots]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Clifford W. (1944). ''The Ashley Book of Knots'', p.220. Doubleday. {{ISBN|0-385-04025-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the reef knot is often seen used for [[List of bend knots|tying two ropes together]], it is not recommended for this purpose because of the potential instability of the knot, and over-use has resulted in many deaths (see [[#Misuse as a bend|Misuse as a bend]]).

==Naming==
The reef knot is at least 4,000 years old. The name "reef knot" dates from at least 1794&lt;ref name="steel"&gt;{{citation|title=The Elements and Practice of Rigging and Seamanship|year=1794|place=London|publisher=David Steel|author=David Steel|url=http://www.maritime.org/doc/steel/index.htm|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; and originates from its common use to [[Reefing|reef]] sails,&lt;ref name="lever"&gt;{{Citation|last=Lever|first=Darcy|authorlink=Darcy Lever (author)|title=The Young Sea Officer's Sheet Anchor|year=1998|origyear=1819|edition=2nd|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, NY|page=83|ISBN=978-0-486-40220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aksday"&gt;{{citation|author=Cyrus Lawrence Day|title=The Art of Knotting and Splicing|edition=4th|location=Annapolis|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1986|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is to tie part of the [[sail]] down to decrease its effective surface area in strong [[wind]]s.  To release the knot a [[sailor]] could collapse it with a pull of one hand; the sail's weight would make the collapsed knot come apart.  It is specifically this behavior which makes the knot unsafe for connecting two ropes together.&lt;ref name="ashley258"&gt;{{citation |last=Ashley |first=Clifford W. |title=The Ashley Book of Knots |url= |accessdate= |origyear= |year= 1944 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=978-0-385-04025-9 |page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "square knot" is found in [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.|Dana's]] 1841 maritime compendium ''A Seaman's Friend'', which also gives "reef knot" as an alternative name.&lt;ref name="ashley220"&gt;Ashley, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seamans"&gt;{{citation|author=Richard Henry Dana, Jr.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VwBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q=Square%20knot|title=The Seaman's Friend: A Treatise on Practical Seamanship|edition=14th revised and corrected|place=Mineola, NY|publisher=Dover|origyear=1879|year=1997|page=49|isbn=0-486-29918-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''square knot'' is often used for the unslipped version of reef knot. ''Reef knot'' itself then is understood as the single slipped version, while the name '''[[shoelace knot]]''' is to indicate double slipped version. Sometimes the name '''bowtie''' also may be used to indicate a double slipped version, but tying a bowtie is usually performed on flat material, and involves a [[slip knot]] of one end holding a bight of the other end i.e. not really a double slipped reef knot. The name "Square knot" is also used for completely different other knots such as the mathematical concept of [[Square knot (mathematics)|square knot]], or [[friendship knot]]; this last one earns the name by being flat and drawing a square on one face (and a cross on the other face).

== Uses ==
The reef knot is used to tie the two ends of a single line together such that they will secure something, for example a bundle of objects, that is unlikely to move much.  In addition to being used by sailors for [[reefing]] and [[Furl (sailing)|furling]] sails, it is also one of the key knots of [[macrame]] textiles.&lt;ref name="ashley399"&gt;Ashley, pp. 399-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

The knot lies flat when made with cloth and has been used for tying [[bandage]]s for millennia.  As a binding knot it was known to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] as the [[Hercules]] knot (''Herakleotikon hamma'') and is still used extensively in medicine.&lt;ref name="hage"&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1007/s00268-007-9359-x|last=Hage|first=J.

T.|editor2-link=Henry Thomas Riley|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used since ancient times to tie [[belt (clothing)|belt]]s and [[sash]]es.  A modern use in this manner includes tying the [[Obi (sash)|obi]] (or belt) of a [[martial arts]] [[keikogi]].

With both ends tucked (slipped) it becomes a good way to tie [[shoelaces]], whilst the non-slipped version is useful for shoelaces that are excessively short.  It is appropriate for tying plastic garbage or trash bags, as the knot forms a handle when tied in two twisted edges of the bag.

The reef knot figures prominently in [[Scouting]] worldwide. It is included in the international membership badge&lt;ref name="scoutemblem"&gt;See [[:File:World Scout Emblem 1955.svg]] for an image of the emblem.&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[Square knot insignia|scouting awards]].&lt;ref name="squareawards"&gt;{{citation|title=Square Knots - Meaning and Placement|url=http://www.boyscouttrail.com/square-knots.asp|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Boy Scouts of America demonstrating the proper tying of the square knot is a requirement for all boys joining the program.&lt;ref name="bsareq"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/joining.aspx|title=Boy Scout Joining Requirements|author=[[Boy Scouts of America]]|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pioneering (Scouting)]], it is commonly used as a [[binding knot]] to finish off specialized [[lashing (ropework)]] and [[whipping knot]]s.&lt;ref name="Square Knot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scoutpioneering.com/2013/06/15/foolproof-way-to-always-tie-a-square-knot-right/ | title=Foolproof Way to ALWAYS Tie a Square Knot Right | work=www.scoutpioneering.com | accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is an insecure knot, unstable when jiggled, and is not suitable for supporting weight.

A [[Surgeon's knot|surgeon's variation]], used where a third hand is unavailable, is made with two or three twists of the ropes on bottom, and sometimes on top, instead of just one.

==Misuse as a bend==
[[Image:Capsizereefknot111.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|right|The reef knot can capsize (spill) when one of the free ends is pulled outward.]]
The reef knot's familiarity, ease of tying, and visually appealing symmetry conceal its weakness.  The [[International Guild of Knot Tyers]] warns that this knot should never be used to [[bend knot|bend]] two ropes together.&lt;ref name="igktwarn"&gt;{{citation|author=[[International Guild of Knot Tyers]]|title=Sea Cadet Knots|url=http://www.igkt.net/index.php/knotting-basics/38-sea-cadet-knots|accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proper bend knot, for instance a [[sheet bend]] or [[double fisherman's knot]], should be used instead.  Knotting authority [[Clifford Ashley]] claimed that misused reef knots have caused more deaths and injuries than all other knots combined.&lt;ref name="ashley18"&gt;Ashley, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, it is easily confused with the [[granny knot]], which is a very poor knot.

==Physical analysis==
An approximate physical analysis&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, J.H. and Keller, J. B., "Ropes in Equilibrium," SIAM J Appl. Math., 47 (1987), pp. 1185-1200&lt;/ref&gt; predicts that a reef knot will hold if &lt;math&gt;2\mu e^{\mu\pi} \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;, where μ is the relevant [[coefficient of friction]]. This inequality holds if &lt;math&gt;\mu \gtrsim 0.24&lt;/math&gt;. Experiments show that the critical value of μ is actually somewhat lower.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, "The physics of knots," http://www.lightandmatter.com/article/knots.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romanzo d'appendìce''' (Italian for [[Feuilleton]]) was a popular genre in [[literature]], which originated in [[England]] and [[France]], in the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th.

This literary genre is characterised by the existence of many and often recurring characters, and by many [[cliffhanger]]s at the end of a chapter, to ensure sales of the next episode. This is a clear case of form influencing [[Content (media and publishing)|content]]: these [[novel]]s were [[Serial (literature)|published in episodes]] in [[newspapers]] and could in a certain sense be compared to modern [[soap opera]]. [[Ponson du Terrail]], [[Eugene Sue]], [[Maurice Leblanc]], [[Gustave Le Rouge]] and [[Michel Zévaco]] were among the numerous authors which contributed to the genre.

[[Feuilleton]] is used in current language to indicate a quite improbable story.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2439">A '''singular term''' is a paradigmatic referring device in a language. Singular terms are of philosophical importance for [[philosophy of language|philosophers of language]], because they ''refer'' to things in the world, and the ability of words to refer calls for scrutiny.

==Overview==
Singular terms are defined as expressions that purport to denote or designate particular individual people, places, or other objects. They contrast with ''general terms'' (such as "car" or "chair") which can apply to more than one thing.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lycan]], ''Philosophy of Language'', 2nd edition, Routledge, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are various kinds of singular terms: proper names (eg. "Matthew"), definite descriptions (eg. "the second fisherman in the boat"), singular personal pronouns (eg. "she"), demonstrative pronouns (eg. "this"), etc.

Historically, various definitions for "singular term" have been offered:

# A term that tells us which individual is being talked about. ([[John Stuart Mill]], [[Arthur Prior]], [[P. F. Strawson]]) &lt;ref&gt;Strawson 1950, Prior 1976, Mill 1908&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is grammatically singular, i.e. a [[proper name]] (''proprium nomen''), a [[demonstrative pronoun]] (''pronomen demonstrativum'') or a demonstrative pronoun with a common name (''cum termino communi''). ([[William of Ockham]])&lt;ref&gt;Ockham, ''Summa Logicae''&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is inherently ''about'' the object to which it applies or [[Reference|refers]]. ([[Gottlob Frege]]) &lt;ref&gt;Frege 1892&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is true "in the same sense" of only one object. ([[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]])&lt;ref&gt;Peter of Spain 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soft infrastructure''' is all the services which are required to maintain the economic, health, and cultural and social standards of a population. It includes both physical assets such as highly specialised buildings and equipment, as well as non-physical assets, such as communication, the body of rules and regulations governing the various systems, the financing of these systems, the systems and organisations by which professionals are trained, advance in their careers by acquiring experience, and are disciplined if required by professional associations. It includes [[institution]]s such as the [[financial system]], the [[education system]], the [[health care system]], the system of government, and [[law enforcement]], and [[emergency services]]. 

The essence of soft infrastructure is the delivery of specialised services to people. Unlike much of the service sector of the economy, the delivery of those services depends on highly developed systems and large specialised facilities, fleets of specialised vehicles or institutions.&lt;ref name="opendb.net"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723233028/http://www.opendb.net/element/19099.php ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110703034727/http://129.3.20.41/eps/urb/papers/0506/0506002.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040504170851/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj11n2/cj11n2-4.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Symmachi–Nicomachi diptych''' is a book-size, [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] [[ivory]] [[diptych]] dating to the late fourth or early fifth century, whose panels depict scenes of ritual [[Polytheism|pagan]] religious practices. Both its style and its content reflect a short-lived [[Decline of Hellenistic polytheism|revival]] of traditional [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] and [[Classicism]] at a time when the Roman world was turning towards [[Christianity]] and rejecting the Classical tradition.

The diptych takes its name from the inscriptions "Nicomachorum" and "Symmachorum", in reference to two prominent [[Roman Senate]] families.

==Provenance==
[[File:Diptych Nicomachi-Symmachi collated (a).jpg|left|240px|thumb|Detail, with lost surface]]
The diptych remained intact until the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Weitzmann186"&gt;Weitzmann, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest description of the leaves dates to 1717, when an inventory of the monastery of [[Montier-en-Der Abbey|Montier-en-Der]] records them as doors on an early thirteenth century [[reliquary]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinney, 458.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Richard Delbrueck uncovered a mention of the panels in the abbot [[Adso of Montier-en-Der|Adso's]] tenth century biography of [[Bercharius]], who founded the monastery ca. 670. Adso wrote that his predecessor "visited Jerusalem and obtained very many sacred relics, and he brought back with him excellent tablets of ivory."&lt;ref&gt;Delbrueck's view and Adso quotation found in Kinney, 461.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the events of the [[French Revolution]] forced the closure of the monastery in 1790, the reliquary and its panels were temporarily lost. The Nicomachi wing was recovered in 1860 from a well, heavily damaged by fire, and the mostly intact Symmachi panel resurfaced in the hands of a collector not long after. They were subsequently acquired by the [[Musée de Cluny]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] respectively.

==Description==
[[File:Diptych Nicomachi-Symmachi collated (b).jpg|thumb|340px|Detail]]
The diptych was produced in [[Rome]] sometime between 388 and 401.&lt;ref name="Weitzmann186"/&gt; The Nicomachi panel measures {{convert|29.9|xx|12.6|cm}}, that of the Symmachi is {{cvt|29.8|xx|12.2|cm}}. Both wings depict female figures engaged in religious ritual before sacrificial altars. The Nicomachi tablet in Paris is the less well preserved of the pair, having been damaged in a fire. The ivory is fractured in several places, with some sections missing completely, together with [[Alto-relievo|high-relief]] areas such as the female figure's face, left hand and right arm. This figure stands before a round altar, holding two lit torches now partially missing. Cymbals hang from a pine tree overhead; both the tree and its hangings are attributes of the goddess [[Cybele]] and her consort [[Attis]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The Symmachi leaf in the London diptych has an [[ivy]]-crowned woman sprinkling incense over the flames of a square [[altar]], garlanded with [[oak]] wreaths. She is attended by a small figure holding a [[kantharos]] and a bowl of fruit. The oak garlands and overhead oak tree suggest the worship of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], while the ivy leaves recall the god [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref name="Weitzmann187"&gt;Weitzmann, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The female figures have been variously interpreted as priestesses&lt;ref name="Weitzmann187"/&gt; and as goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The panels are believed to celebrate the alliance through marriage of two senatorial families, the Symmachi and Nicomachi. The most likely candidates are the daughter of Senator [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] and Nicomachus Flavianus, the son of his colleague [[Virius Nicomachus Flavianus]], although it has also been suggested that the panels may instead commemorate the marriage of Symmachus' son, Q. Fabius Memmius Symmachus with the granddaughter of the aforementioned colleague.&lt;ref name="Weitzmann187"/&gt; Diptychs were often commissioned by leading Roman families to celebrate important events, most often the attainment of the [[Roman consul|consulship]].  The diptych form, at least originally, served as a pair of covers for wax writing tablets.

The work as a whole has been interpreted as a study in [[nostalgia]]. Just as the majority of the Roman world had rejected polytheism in favor of Christianity, so too it left behind the techniques of [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] that characterised the art of its forebears.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch''''' is a 1965 [[science fiction]] novel by US writer [[Philip K. Dick]]. It was nominated for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="WWE-1965"&gt;{{cite web | title=1965 Award Winners &amp; Nominees | work=Worlds Without End | url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1965 | accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel takes place some time in the 21st century. Under United Nations authority, humankind has colonized every [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet]] and moon in the [[solar system]]. Like many of Dick's novels, it utilizes an array of science fiction concepts, features several layers of reality and unreality and [[philosophy|philosophical]] ideas. It is one of Dick's first works to explore [[religion|religious]] themes. As the book explains, the 'three stigmata' are a mechanical arm, slotted eyes and metallic teeth, which represent alienation, blurred reality, and despair.

==Plot summary==
The story begins in a future world where global temperatures have risen so high that in most of the world it is unsafe to be outside without special cooling gear during daylight hours. In a desperate bid to preserve humanity and ease population burdens on Earth, the UN has initiated a "draft" for colonizing the nearby planets, where conditions are so horrific and primitive that the unwilling colonists have fallen prey to a form of escapism involving the use of an illegal drug (Can-D) in concert with "layouts." Layouts are physical props intended to simulate a sort of alternate reality where life is easier than either the grim existence of the colonists in their marginal off-world colonies, or even Earth, where global warming has progressed to the point that Antarctica is prime vacation resort territory. The illegal drug Can-D allows people to "share" their experience of the "Perky Pat" (the name of the main female character in the simulated world) layouts. This "sharing" has caused a pseudo-religious cult or series of cults to grow up around the layouts and the use of the drug.

Up to the point where the novel begins, New York City-based Perky Pat (or P.P.) Layouts, Inc., has held a monopoly on this product, as well as on the illegal trade in the drug Can-D which makes the shared hallucinations possible.

The novel opens shortly after Barney Mayerson, P.P. Layouts' top [[Precognition|precog]], has received a "draft notice" from the UN for involuntary resettlement as a colonist on [[Mars]]. Mayerson is sleeping with his assistant, Roni Fugate, but remains conflicted about the divorce, which he himself initiated, from his first wife Emily, a [[ceramic]] pot artist. Meanwhile, Emily's second husband tries to sell her pot designs to P.P. Layouts as possible accessories for the Perky Pat virtual worlds—but Barney, recognizing them as Emily's, rejects them out of spite.

Meanwhile, the UN rescues Palmer Eldritch's ship from a crash on [[Pluto]]. Leo Bulero, head of P.P. Layouts and an "evolved" human (meaning someone who has undergone expensive genetic treatments by a German "doctor" which are supposed to push the client "forward" on an evolutionary scale, and which result in gross physical, as well as mental, modifications), hears rumors that Eldritch discovered an alien hallucinogen in the Prox system with similar properties to Can-D, and that he plans to market it as "Chew-Z," with UN approval, on off-world colonies. However Chew-Z does not require the prop of the external layouts and seems to have certain undefined qualities that make the use of Chew-Z even more addictive than Can-D has been. This would effectively destroy P.P. Layouts. Bulero tries to contact Eldritch but he is quarantined at a UN hospital. Both Mayerson and Fugate have precognitions of reports that Bulero is going to be responsible for murdering Eldritch.

Under the guise of a reporter, Bulero travels to Eldritch's estate on the [[Moon]], where Eldritch holds a press conference. Bulero is kidnapped and forced to take Chew-Z intravenously. He enters a psychic netherworld over which both he and Eldritch seemingly have some control. After wrangling about business with Eldritch, Bulero travels to what appears to be Earth at some time in the not-too-distant future. Evolved humans identify him as a [[ghost]] and show him a monument to himself commemorating his role in the death of Eldritch, an "enemy of the Sol System."

Bulero returns to Earth and fires Mayerson because Mayerson was afraid to travel to the Moon to rescue him. Mayerson, in despair, accepts his UN conscription to Mars but Bulero recruits him as a double agent. Mayerson is to inject himself with a toxin after taking Chew-Z in a plot to deceive the UN into thinking Chew-Z is harmful and cause them to ban it.

On Mars, Mayerson buys some Chew-Z from Eldritch, who appears in [[holograph]]ic form. Mayerson tries to hallucinate a world where he is still with Emily but finds that he does not control his apparent hallucination. Like Bulero, he finds himself in the future. Mayerson arrives in New York two years hence where he speaks with Bulero, Fugate and his future self about the death of Palmer Eldritch.

He also encounters several manifestations of Eldritch, identifiable by their [[robot]]ic right hand, artificial eyes, and steel teeth. Eldritch offers to help Mayerson become whatever he wants, but is so controlling of the Chew-Z alternate reality that Mayerson ultimately decides he'd rather be dead than continue to be manipulated by Eldritch. When a despairing Mayerson chooses death, he finds himself apparently forced into Eldritch's body right at the point in the timeline where Bulero is ready to shoot a torpedo at Eldritch's ship. It appears that Eldritch's plan is to preserve his own life essence housed in Mayerson's body while allowing Mayerson himself to die in Eldritch's place. Eldritch, meanwhile, intends to live on in Mayerson's form and enjoy the simple if arduous life of a Martian colonist. Mayerson, stuck in Eldritch's body and mistaken for him, is indeed nearly killed by Bulero in the near future, but before the fatal shot can be fired he is awakened from his Chew-Z trance in the present by Bulero, who has just arrived on Mars.

Bulero is willing to take Mayerson back to Earth but refuses to after learning that Mayerson did not inject himself with the toxin. Mayerson is now confident that Bulero will kill Eldritch, so the sacrifice of taking the toxin in order to ruin Eldritch's business is unnecessary; but he does not try to convince Bulero of this. Later, Mayerson discusses his experience with a neo-Christian colonist and they conclude that either Eldritch became a god in the Prox system or some god-like being has taken his place. Mayerson is convinced some aspect of Eldritch is still inside him, and that as long as he refuses to take Chew-Z again, it is Eldritch who will actually be killed by Bulero in the near future; Mayerson is half-resigned, half-hopeful about taking on the life of a Martian colonist without reprieve. Mayerson considers the possibility of Eldritch being what humans have always thought of as a god, but inimical, or perhaps merely an inferior aspect of a bigger and better sort of god.

The novel has an ambiguous ending, with Bulero heading back toward Earth, and apparent proliferation of Eldritch's cyborg bodily '[[stigmata]]', which may mean that Bulero is still trapped in Eldritch's hallucinatory domain, or that Chew-Z is becoming increasingly popular among Terrans and Martian colonists.

==Reception==
[[Algis Budrys]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' described the novel as "an important, beautifully controlled, smoothly created book which will twist your mind if you give it the least chance to do so". He praised Dick's accomplishment, saying "the whole creation resonates to the touch of the only present science-fiction writer who could possibly have done it" and characterizes the result as "a witty, sometimes lighthearted, and always fascinating piece of fiction".&lt;ref name="budrys196508"&gt;{{Cite magazine

'''Thomas Higgins''' (27 November 1865 − 26 January 1906) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Irish Nationalism|nationalist]] politician, auctioneer and farmer, who as member of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] was posthumously declared elected [[Member of Parliament]] of  the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1906.

Higgins was born in [[Moylough]], the son of Martin Higgins, a shopkeeper, and Catherine Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details-civil/effac33792090 
|title=General Registrar's Office|last=|first=|date=|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was chairman of Tuam [[Board of Guardians]] and a member of [[Galway County Council]], was selected as the Irish Parliamentary Party candidate by the [[United Irish League]] (UIL) convention on 5 January 1906 to contest the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election]]. He had been President of the constituency branch of the UIL since 1900. 

Taken ill on the night of the election (25 January 1906), he died as the result of a [[heart attack]] in Guy's Hotel, [[Tuam]], at 1.30am the following morning (26 January 1906). 

As was widely expected, Higgins topped the poll at the election count, which was held later on the day of his death, beating the incumbent MP, [[John Philip Nolan]], who had stood as an [[Independent Nationalist]]. Higgins, who received 2,685 votes (Nolan took 1,064), was posthumously declared elected by the county sheriff, the returning officer.&lt;ref&gt;"Deceased Candidate Elected", ''Irish Independent'', 27 January 1906, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Times'', 27 January 1906, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The remarkable circumstances surrounding the election led the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' to comment that "candidates have died before the actual election, but we doubt if ever such a case as the present has occurred before, where a candidate has died after the poll has been taken and before the result has been declared".&lt;ref&gt;"Irish Election Sensation", ''Irish Independent'', 26 January 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This circumstance of a candidate winning a seat posthumously occurred again to [[Noel Skelton]] in 1935, and to Sir [[Edward Taswell Campbell]] and [[Leslie Pym]] in 1945; however, all of them were candidates for ''re-''election. Thomas Higgins is the only MP to be ''newly'' elected posthumously.

Higgins, who was married, was 40 when he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details-civil/725d7010938474|title=Civil Records of Births, Marriages and Deaths|last=General Register Office|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5531">A '''three-part lesson''' is an [[inquiry-based learning]] method used to teach mathematics in [[K–12 (education)|K–12]] schools.

The three-part lesson has been attributed to John A. Van de Walle, a mathematician at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].&lt;ref name="Van"&gt;{{cite web | last = Van de Walle | first = John A. | title = Reform Mathematics vs. The Basics: Understanding the Conflict and Dealing with It | publisher = Mathematically Sane | date = April 1, 2003 | url = http://mathematicallysane.com/reform-mathematics-vs-the-basics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John"&gt;{{cite web | title = John Van de Walle Biography | publisher = National Council of Teachers of Mathematics | url = http://www.nctm.org/resources/content.aspx?id=25082 | accessdate = September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
===Getting started phase (10 to 15 minutes)===
The purpose is to cognitively prepare students for the math lesson by having them think about a procedure, strategy or concept used in a prior lesson.  Teachers determine what specific previous learning they wish students to recall, based on outcomes desired for that particular lesson.&lt;ref name="Sketch"&gt;{{cite web | title = Sketch of a Three-Part Lesson | publisher = Ontario College of Teachers | date = March 2010 | url = http://professionallyspeaking.oct.ca/march_2010/features/lesson_study/three-part.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of the teacher is to "get students mentally prepared to work on the problem".&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;

[[Marian Small]], a proponent of a [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] approach to mathematical instruction, provides an example of an inquiry-based question from which a three-part lesson could be created: "one bus has 47 students in it; another has 38. How many students are on both buses?"&lt;ref name="small-2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Small | first = Marian | title = How Students Learn Math and What Math We Want Them to Learn | publisher = Cengage Learning | date = 2012 | url = http://www.nelsonbrain.com/content/9780176643461.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work phase (30 to 40 minutes)===
Students engage in solving math problems individually, in pairs, or in small groups, and "record the mathematical thinking they used to develop solutions".  Students then plan the strategies, methods, and concrete materials they will use to solve the problem.  The teacher will circulate and make observations about the ways students are interacting, and will note the mathematical language they are using as well as the mathematical models they are employing to solve the problem.  If a student is having difficulty, "the teacher might pose questions to provoke further thinking or have other students explain their plan for solving the problem".&lt;ref name="Sketch"/&gt;  Teachers are advised to be active listeners in this phase, and to take notes.  This is also a phase in which teachers can assess students.&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;  

===Consolidation and practice phase (10 to 15 minutes)===
In this final phase, the teacher oversees the sharing of solutions by students, and may employ other teaching techniques such as "math congress", "gallery walk", or "bansho".  If new methods and strategies were discovered by students during the work phase, the teacher will post these on the class's "strategy wall", or use them to develop an "anchor chart".&lt;ref name="Sketch"/&gt;  Teachers are not to evaluate students in this phase, but should be actively listening "to both good and not so good ideas".&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt; 

==Effectiveness==
Advocates of the three-part lesson state that students develop "independence and confidence by choosing the methods, strategies and concrete materials they will use, as well as ways to record their solutions".  They claim students learn to discern similarities and differences in the mathematics, and also that "through such rich mathematics classroom discourse, students develop and consolidate their understanding of the learning goal of the lesson in terms of making connections to prior knowledge and experiences and making generalizations".&lt;ref name="Sketch"/&gt;  Advocates also claim "students are more enthusiastic about the subject" when inquiry-based math instruction is used.&lt;ref name="Alphonso"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Alphonso | first1 = Caroline | last2 = Morrow | first2 =   Adrian | title = Ontario Teachers Need Better Math Training, Minister Says | publisher = Globe and Mail | date = August 28, 2013 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/ontario-testing-shows-dip-in-student-math-skills-for-fifth-year-in-a-row/article13996303/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of inquiry-based methods such as the three-part lesson state that students are not learning the basics such as multiplication tables.  In Ontario, Canada, where the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]]  has promoted the three-part lesson, the curriculum was changed in the late 1990s in favour of "problem solving based on open-ended investigations rather than memorization".  In that province, test scores in grades three and grade six math declined between 2009 and 2013, and "some contend that the math curriculum rather than teacher education is to blame for the lower scores because it places more emphasis on real-world concepts and applications than on rote learning".&lt;ref name="Alphonso"/&gt;

'''Urban acupuncture''' is a [[environmentalism|socio-environmental]] theory that combines contemporary [[urban design]] with [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese]] [[acupuncture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://adamparsonsdesignthesis.blogspot.com/2010/12/urban-acupuncture-marco-casagrande.html Parsons, Adam. (2010, December).

Sites are selected through analysis of aggregate social, economic and ecological factors, and are developed through a dialogue between designers and the community. Just as the practice of acupuncture is aimed at relieving stress in the human body, the goal of urban acupuncture is to relieve stress in the [[built environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ "Urban Acupuncture,"] ''Urban Applications,'' 2013. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} In Taipei, there was an urban acupuncture workshop that aimed to "produce small-scale but socially catalytic interventions" into the city's fabric.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.dk/books?id=QbY7on6asu8C&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=urban+acupuncture+casagrande&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gd8ozw3OLd&amp;sig=D0C58eXMpJuOZzsLtp6XftKyqnA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mZxxUcu4C8HRtQbIsICoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=urban%20acupuncture%20casagrande&amp;f=false Ruin Academy – Casagrande Lab.] In ''Architectural Theories of the Environment: Posthuman Territory,'' ed.

Casagrande views cities as complex energy organisms in which different overlapping layers of energy flows are determining the actions of the citizens as well as the development of the city. By mixing environmentalism and urban design Casagrande is developing methods of punctual manipulation of the urban energy flows in order to create an ecologically sustainable urban development towards the so-called 3rd Generation City (postindustrial city). The theory is developed in the [[Tamkang University]] of [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbandevelopmentbergen.blogspot.com/2010/04/interview-witm-m-casagrande-on-urban.html INTERVIEW WITH M. CASAGRANDE ON URBAN ACUPUNTURE]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – ''Laurits Elkjær, Bergen School of Architecture'' 4/2010{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} and at independent multidisciplinary research center [[Ruin Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/ruin-academy/docs/anarchist_gardener_issue_two_hk_special Anarchist Gardener Issue Two HK special 安那其建築園丁港深建築雙城雙年展特別版] – ''Nikita Wu, Ruin Academy'' 2/2012&lt;/ref&gt; With focus on environmentalism and urban design, Casagrande defines urban acupuncture as a design tool where punctual manipulations contribute to creating sustainable urban development, such as the community gardens and urban farms in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/65227327/ParticipativeDesign_Planning.pdf PARTICIPATIVE DESIGN &amp; PLANNING IN CONTEMPORARY URBAN PROJECTS] – '' Christina Rasmussen, Urban Planning &amp; Management, Aalborg University'' 6/2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This is an undergraduate thesis.|date=December 2016}}

Casagrande describes urban acupuncture as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[a] cross-over architectural manipulation of the collective sensuous intellect of a city. City is viewed as multi-dimensional sensitive energy-organism, a living environment. Urban acupuncture aims into a touch with this nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ "Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal,"] – Kyle Miller, MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sensitivity to understand the energy flows of the collective [[Qi|chi]] beneath the visual city and reacting on the hot-spots of this chi. Architecture is in the position to produce the acupuncture needles for the urban chi.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epifanio.eu/nr14/eng/ruin_academy.html "Ruin Academy,"] – Marco Casagrande, Epifanio 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''A weed will root into the smallest crack in the asphalt and eventually break the city.  Urban acupuncture is the weed and the acupuncture point is the crack. The possibility of the impact is total, connecting human nature as part of nature.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Casagrande utilized the tenets of acupuncture: treat the points of blockage and let relief ripple throughout the body. More immediate and sensitive to community needs than traditional institutional forms of large scale urban renewal interventions would not only respond to localized needs, but do so with a knowledge of how citywide systems operated and converged at that single node. Release pressure at strategic points, release pressure for the whole city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Urban Applications'' 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participatory planning==

Urban acupuncture bears some similarities to the [[New Urbanism|new urbanist]] concept of Tactical Urbanism. The idea focuses on local resources rather than capital-intensive municipal programs and promotes the idea of citizens installing and caring for interventions. These small changes, proponents claim, will boost community morale and catalyze revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newurbannetwork.com/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities 'Urban acupuncture' touted for cash-strapped cities] – ''David West, New Urban Network'' 7/2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016}} Boiled down to a simple statement, "urban acupuncture" means focusing on small, subtle, bottom-up interventions that harness and direct community energy in positive ways to heal urban blight and improve the cityscape.

He described in 2007:&lt;br /&gt;
"I believe that some medicinal "magic" can and should be applied to cities, as many are sick and some nearly terminal. As with the medicine needed in the interaction between doctor and patient, in urban planning it is also necessary to make the city react; to poke an area in such a way that it is able to help heal, improve, and create positive chain reactions. It is indispensable in revitalizing interventions to make the organism work in a different way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwanese architect and academic Ti-Nan Chi is looking with micro urbanism at the vulnerable and insignificant side of contemporary cities around the world identified as micro-zones, points for recovery in which micro-projects have been carefully proposed to involve the public on different levels, aiming to resolve conflicts among property owners, villagers, and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=16364 Chi Ti-Nan develops a project to preserve Hong Kong coastline Tai Long Sai Wan] – '' World Architecture News'' 4/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A loosely affiliated team of architects [[Wang Shu]], Marco Casagrande, [[Hsieh Ying-chun]] and [[Roan Ching-yueh]] (sometimes called WEAK!

==Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award==
The winner of the Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award (DBUAA) Cape Town 2012 is the neighbourhood project "Mothers Unite" demonstrating the power of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mothersunite.org.za/2012/04/deutsche-bank-urban-age-award-19-april-2012/ Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award – 19 April 2012] – '' Mothers Unite'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers Unite was founded in 2007 and provides a safe haven from the gangsterism, drugs and violence that are part and parcel of street and home life in the area. Built with donated shipping containers, the village is made up of a library, kitchen, office, sheltered area, playground and food garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.db.com/csr/en/social_investments/deutsche_bank_urban_age_award_2012_winner_announced.html Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award 2012 – winner announced] – '' Deutsche Bank Corporate Social Responsibility'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Edgar Pieterse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Durable urban change is often about carefully targeted micro interventions that can change the energies and dynamics of a surrounding neighbourhood. When one engages with the physical manifestations that the tenacity, blood, sweat, and tears of the protagonists of Mothers Unite and Masiphumelele Library (another of the eight finalists) have created, the power of urban acupuncture is apparent. These projects serve as reminders that through vision, commitment over the long haul, and principle-based partnerships, just about any problem can be confronted and addressed.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capetown2014.co.za/2012/04/mothers-unite-urban-acupuncture-for-an-urban-age/ Mothers Unite: Urban acupuncture for an urban age] – '' Cape Town 2014 Live Design.

==Urban ecological restoration==
In ecological restoration of industrial cities Urban Acupuncture can take form as spontaneous and often illegal urban farms and [[Community gardening|community gardens]] punctuating the more mechanical city and tuning it towards a more sustainable co-existence with the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-community-gardens-of-taipei/2010/12/04 Taipei Organic Acupuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, P2P Foundation'' 12/2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
Urban Acupuncture areas can receive, treat and [[recycle]] the waste from the surrounding city acting as eco-valleys within the urban fabric. In River Urbanism the Urban Acupuncture areas can include underground [[stormwater]] reservoirs and act as [[flood]] relief for the surrounding city as a [[sponge]] and they can act as [[Biofilter|biological filters]] purifying water originated from polluted rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecture.org/internal/content/download.asp?wdoc=urbanecopuncture-marcocasagrande.doc Urban Ecopuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, World Architecture'' 10/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Urban acupuncture is a point by point manipulation of the urban energy to create a sustainable town or city, which Marco Casagrande has dubbed '3rd Generation Cities'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainablecities.dk/en/city-projects/cases/amsterdam-urban-acupuncture-creates-new-life-in-the-suburbs Amsterdam: Urban Acupuncture creates new life in the suburbs] – ''Danish Architecture Centre, Sustainable Cities'' 6/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban acupuncture in art==

American artist [[Gordon Matta-Clark]] is credited with developing a system for identifying pockets of disrepair in the built environment—the first step in the framework of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
Artist [[Miru Kim]] explores industrial [[ruin]]s and structures making her look at the city as one living organism. She claims to feel not only the skin of the city, but also to penetrate the inner layers of its intestines and veins, which swarm with minuscule life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/zh-tw/miru_kim_s_underground_art.html Miru Kim] – ''TED Talks'' 2/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to a public [[environmental art]] work, Cicada, Casagrande explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Cicada is urban acupuncture for Taipei city penetrating the hard surfaces of industrial laziness in order to reach the original ground and get in touch with the collective Chi, the local knowledge that binds the people of [[Taipei basin]] with nature. The [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of Cicada is an accidental mediator between the modern man and reality. There is no other reality than nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/marco-casagrande-cicada-installation-taipei.html Could Cities Benefit from Small-Scale, Local "Urban Acupuncture" Projects Like This?] – Kimberley Mok ''Treehugeer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Environmental art as urban acupuncture is an artistic way of injecting a healthy dose of natural elements and human scale into the mechanized urban grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archetcetera.blogspot.com/2012/01/signs-of-life.html Signs of Life] – Phyllis Richardson ''Archetcetera'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Without a Clue''''' is a [[1988 in film|1988]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Thom Eberhardt]] and starring [[Michael Caine]] and [[Ben Kingsley]]. It's based on Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s characters from [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories, but uses them in comedic style, with addition of Doyle's struggling with Holmes' popularity.

==Plot==
[[Sherlock Holmes]] is a fictional character created by [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John Watson]] (Ben Kingsley) as the central character in a series of short stories published in ''[[The Strand Magazine]]''. Watson uses the character to enable him to solve crimes incognito, so as not to disrupt his career as a doctor during a period when he was applying for a post at an exclusive hospital; one in which the senior staff would frown on Watson's "hobby". Although he doesn't secure the job, Watson decides to satisfy public demand to see Holmes in person by hiring unemployed actor Reginald Kincaid (Michael Caine) to play the part of the fictional detective.

Continuing to investigate cases, now with Kincaid as "Holmes" by his side, Watson is the detective hidden behind the charade of the fictional Sherlock Holmes. Kincaid must rely on direction from Watson, memorizing the doctor's exacting, detailed instructions every step of the way.

After a major case at a museum, Kincaid oversteps his boundaries with Watson, who fires him. Watson wants to write the character off and tries to start a new series about "The Crime Doctor" with Watson himself being recognized as the great detective. The Strand's editor, Norman Greenhough ([[Peter Cook]]) is quite cold to the idea, as is everyone else.

With a new crime, Watson finds he is unable to get information on his own; only when he mentions "Holmes" does he get anywhere. As the crime becomes a major case, the British government seeks the aid of "Sherlock Holmes" and will accept no one else, including Watson's "Crime Doctor". The mystery involves the [[Bank of England]] £5 banknote printing plates that have been stolen, with the printing supervisor, Peter Giles, having gone missing on the night of the robbery. With the counterfeiting of these £5 notes, the collapse of the British Empire's economy would be inevitable.

[[Scotland Yard|Scotland Yard's]] [[Inspector Lestrade]] ([[Jeffrey Jones]]) is jealous of "Sherlock Holmes". He takes every opportunity to spy on "Holmes" and Watson and to steal their ideas. The path of clues leads them to Giles' daughter, Leslie ([[Lysette Anthony]]) and twelve-year-old street urchin, [[Wiggins (Sherlock Holmes character)|Wiggins]] ([[Matt Savage (musician)|Matthew Savage]]) the leader of the boys Watson pays to keep an eye on people, whom he calls the "[[Baker Street irregulars]]", in contrast to the "regular" [[London]] police force.

Watson and Kincaid discover that [[Professor Moriarty]] ([[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]]) is the mastermind behind the scheme. Watson is apparently killed, forcing Kincaid to solve the case on his own. Having tracked the villain to an abandoned theatre, Kincaid discovers that Watson is still alive and that the woman who they thought was Leslie is actually one of Moriarty's spies, while the real one is Giles' son and a [[transvestite]] and [[female impersonator]] who has a famous [[revue]] in Paris called "Les Femmes Faux". The two work together to free both Giles men and defeat Moriarty for good.

Watson has a new appreciation for Kincaid, who now publicly gives him a large share of the credit and the public is assured that the team of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson will continue their detective work.

==Production==
===Writing===
The film is one of several spoofs that have been made of the canonical Sherlock Holmes. This particular one has three notable features, courtesy of writers Gary Murphy and Larry Strawther, two devoted Sherlockians. Firstly the main characters have been reversed, with a bumbling Holmes and genius detective Watson replacing the usual bumbling Watson and genius detective Holmes. Secondly, in the film Watson tires of his fictional creation, Holmes, and tries unsuccessfully to terminate his role, but is forced to bring him back by popular demand. This mirrors the real-life situation of the author [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] (also a physician), who tired of his fictional creation Holmes and tried unsuccessfully to kill him off. Thirdly, the character of Norman Greenhough is inspired by [[Herbert Greenhough Smith]], the very real editor of ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', whose faith in the Holmes/Watson characters brought fame and fortune to both writer and [[periodical]].

==Reception==
The movie has received decent reviews from critics, and is frequently included in "top 10" lists of Sherlock films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/without_a_clue/ |title=Without A Clue|accessdate=17 March 2011|quote=|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the American critic, [[Roger Ebert]], gave the film two stars out of four:&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Roger Ebert]] |title=Without A Clue  |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19881021/REVIEWS/810210306/1023 |quote=|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=21 October 1988|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Without a Clue" begins with the premise that Sherlock Holmes never existed; that the man known as "Holmes" was, in fact, a third-rate actor named Reginald Kincaid, and he was hired by Dr. John Watson to play the role. This is an amusing premise, but it is not enough.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt;}}

'''Wordsworth McAndrew''' (1936 – 25 April 2008)&lt;ref&gt;Gary Girdhari, [http://www.guyanajournal.com/Wordsworth_McAndrew.html "The Passing of a Great Artist: Wordsworth McAndrew"], ''Guyana Journal'', May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; was a leading [[Guyana]] [[folklore|folklorist]], poet, and creative artist.

==Biography==
McAndrew was born in 1936 in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[British Guiana]], to Winslow Alexander McAndrew and Ivy McAndrew. His father was a schoolteacher, musician and catechist, who taught in rural Anglican schools. McAndrew was raised in Cummingsburg and, from the age of 12, in Newtown, Kitty. He attended "Teacher" Marshall Kindergarten School, Christ Church Primary School and [[Queen's College, Guyana|Queen's College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecaroh.com/bmp/articles/wordsworth_mcandrew.htm "Wordsworth McAndrew - A Guyanese National Treasure"], eCaroh Caribbean Emporium.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his work as a radio broadcaster during the 1960s and 1970s, he helped the Guyanese recognize and feel proud of their mythological and folkloric heritage. He studied and celebrated Guyanese language and culture, using all media available to explain and promote Guyanese cultural characteristics.

McAndrew died on 25 April 2008, at the East Orange Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2492&amp;dat=20080426&amp;id=UEZaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oSYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1767,8422776 "Wordsworth Mcandrew Dies At 72"], ''[[Stabroek News]]'', 26 April 2008, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Jersey]], where he had been living in self-imposed exile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litguyana.000space.com/index.php/poems/36-wordsworth-mcandrew "Wordsworth McAndrew"], Literature Guyana.&lt;/ref&gt;
