'''Arthur Leist''' (8 July 1852 – 22 March 1927) was a [[Germany|German]] writer, journalist and translator of [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] literature.

He was born and educated at [[Breslau]]. During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]], he got interested in the [[Caucasus]]. After his three visits to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] between 1884 and 1892, Leist decided to permanently settle in [[Tiflis]]. He regularly wrote on the history, ethnography and culture of Georgia, and translated many pieces of classic Georgian and Armenian literature. He compiled the first anthology of Georgian poetry in [[German language|German]] in 1887 and, with the help of the Georgian writer [[Ilia Chavchavadze]], published the complete German translation of the medieval Georgian epic poem ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]'' by [[Shota Rustaveli]] in 1889.  From 1906 to 1922, he edited ''[[Kaukasische Post]]'', the only newspaper of the [[Caucasus Germans|Caucasian German]] community. He died in Tiflis and was buried at the Didube Pantheon.

The '''Bandiagara Escarpment''' is an [[escarpment]] in the Dogon country of [[Mali]]. The [[sandstone]] cliff rises about 500 meters above the lower sandy flats to the south. It has a length of approximately 150 kilometers.

The area of the [[escarpment]] is inhabited today by the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] people. Before the Dogon, the escarpment was inhabited by the [[Tellem]] and Toloy peoples. Many structures remain from the Tellem. The Bandiagara Escarpment was listed in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] in 1989.

'''The Cliffs of Bandiagara''' are a sandstone chain ranging from south to northeast over 200&amp;nbsp;km and extending to the Grandamia [[massif]].  The end of the massif is marked by the [[Hombori Tondo]], Mali's highest peak at 1,115 meters. Because of its archaeological, ethnological and geological characteristics, the entire site is one of the most imposing in [[West Africa]].

==History==

The cave-dwelling Tellem, an ethnic group later pushed out by the arrival of the Dogons, used to live in the slopes of the cliff. The Tellem legacy is evident in the caves they carved into the cliffs so that they could bury their dead high up, far from the frequent flash floods of the area.

Dozens of villages are located along the cliff, such as Kani Bonzon. It was near this village that the Dogons arrived in the 14th century, and from there they spread over the plateau, the escarpment and the plains of the Seno-Gondo.

According to local [[oral history]], the Dogon were relatively undisturbed by French colonial powers due to natural tunnels weaving through the Bandiagara Escarpment. Only the Dogon knew of the tunnels, and were able to use them to ambush and repel aggressors.

==The Bandiagara Escarpment today==

Today, local guides escort tourist groups along the escarpment to visit Dogon villages. A series of trails runs along the cliffs, and hostels in each village provide food and lodging. The host villages receive income from the hostels and the tourist tax. Large increases in tourism to the area are expected, as a new highway is constructed, putting pressure on local, traditional cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Baxter, Joan|title=Mali: What Price Tourism?|date=16 April 2001|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1280076.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''[[The Independent]]'' reports that looting of ancient artifacts is widespread in the area, which is poorly policed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Smith, Alex Duval|title=Mali Plunders its Desert Heritage to Feed Demand for 'Primitive' Art|date=17 March 2001|work=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/mali-plunders-its-desert-heritage-to-feed-demand-forprimitive-art-687697.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To call attention to the issue of uncontrolled tourist visitation, the [[World Monuments Fund]] included the Bandiagara Escarpment in the [[2004 World Monuments Watch]]. In 2005, WMF provided a grant from [[American Express]] to the Mission Culturelle de Bandiagara for the development of a management plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/project/bandiagara-escarpment-cultural-landscape World Monuments Fund - Bandiagara Escarpment Cultural Landscape]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the protection of traditional buildings, the management plan calls for the regulation of new construction through the establishment of strict building guidelines, such as those that govern new development in historic districts around the world.

After the 2012 war in Mali, central areas of the country, including the Dogon Plateau and Bandiagara Escarpment, have become increasingly dangerous. Terrorist groups operate in the area, and violence between local ethnicities occurs on a daily basis. 

As of 2018 it is extremely inadvisable to travel to this area for tourism, and Malian security forces have been known to turn back those who attempt to do so. In March, 2018 an armed group attacked a hotel frequented by UN staff in the town of [[Bandiagara]] killing several people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/692312/mali-hotel-shooting-hotel-la-falaise-in-bandiagara-islamist-attack&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck''''' is a [[slapstick]] [[side-scrolling game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Core Design]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Virgin Interactive Entertainment]] in 1993 for the [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Sega Game Gear]], [[Sega Mega-CD]], [[Sega Master System]], [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]].

The story takes up a little while after the end of the [[Chuck Rock|first game]]. After Chuck Rock rescued his wife, Ophelia Rock, from the T-Rex bully Gary Gritter, Chuck and Ophelia had a son, named Chuck Junior. Chuck senior works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving [[automobile]]s out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him, leaving it up to Junior to rescue his father.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since the player controls Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a [[club (weapon)|club]] that gives his attacks further reach.

==Soundtrack==
''Chuck Rock II'' uses an [[acid jazz]] soundtrack.  The end credits thank various contemporary acid jazz bands, presumably listing them as influences. The in-game boss "Ozrics Tentacles" shares a name with psychedelic rock band [[Ozric Tentacles]].

==Reception==
''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' praised the Game Gear retaining all the features and technical merits of the Genesis version, making particular note of the huge levels, "lots of technique", and good animations, though they criticized that the control is too loose. They score it a 7 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Chuck Rock 2{{sic}}|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=54|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=January 1994|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gave the Sega CD version a 6.8 out of 10, commenting that this time the control is too stiff, but praising the opening cinema and the numerous bits of humor implemented in the level designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Chuck Rock 2{{sic}}|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=55|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=February 1994|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Around the time of the game's release, Core commissioned a comic strip in the long-running UK children's magazine ''[[Look-in]]'', centering on the day-to-day lives of Chuck, Ophelia and Junior. As a meta-referential joke, Chuck Jr owned a 'SteggaDrive' console, as a reference to the Genesis' European [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] name. A year later the magazine was closed (after almost 25 years), and the final strip saw Chuck being swept away from his boat, presumed dead but washing up on a tribal island and being revered as a God - as a comic touch, mourners at his 'funeral' included then-Prime-Minister [[John Major]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9015">On March 15, 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]] presented a speech to the United States Congress in which he extolled four basic consumer rights, later called the '''Consumer Bill of Rights'''. The United Nations through the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]] expanded these into eight rights, and thereafter [[Consumers International]] adopted these rights as a charter and started recognizing March 15 as World Consumer Rights Day.

==Background==
Before the mid-twentieth century, consumers had limited rights with regard to their interaction with products and commercial producers. Consumers had limited ground on which to defend themselves against faulty or defective products, or against misleading or deceptive advertising methods.

The [[consumer movement]] began to gather a following, pushing for increased rights and legal protection against malicious business practices. By the end of the 1950s, legal [[product liability]] had been established in which an aggrieved party need only prove injury by use of a product, rather than bearing the burden of proof of corporate negligence.

[[Helen Ewing Nelson]] was a drafter of the Consumer Bill of Rights and sought an outlet for distributing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-09-04/features/1995247035_1_helen-nelson-consumer-movement-consumer-rights |title=Pioneer fights on for consumer safety - Baltimore Sun |first=Rebecca |last=Smith |work=articles.baltimoresun.com |date=4 September 1995 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"&gt;{{Citation |last=Shearer |first=Julie |year=1977–1979 |title=Pat Brown - Friends and Campaigners |publisher=[[Regional Oral History Office]] |publication-place=[[Berkeley, California]] |page= |url=https://archive.org/stream/patbrownfriends00rfryrich/patbrownfriends00rfryrich_djvu.txt |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.consumer-action.org/press/articles/helen_nelson_1913_2005 |title=Helen Nelson (1913-2005) will be greatly missed by the consumer movement |first= |last= |publisher=[[Consumer Action]] |work=consumer-action.org |date=23 March 2005 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Kennedy's election campaign he made a promise to support consumers.&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"/&gt; After his election, [[Fred Dutton]], a colleague of Nelson's and a government officer who advised the president, asked for Nelson's suggestions on how the president could support consumers, and she sent him the Consumer Bill of Rights.&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"/&gt; Kennedy presented those rights in a speech to Congress on March 15, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=9108 |title=John F. Kennedy: Special Message to the Congress on Protecting the Consumer Interest. |first=John F. |last=Kennedy |authorlink=John F. Kennedy |work=presidency.ucsb.edu |date=March 15, 1962 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that speech he named four basic rights of consumers.

== Some of the Rights ==

===The right to safety===
The assertion of this right is aimed at the defense of consumers against injuries caused by products other than automobile vehicles, and implies that products should cause no harm to their users if such use is executed as prescribed. The right was further formalized in 1972 by the US federal government through the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC). This organization has jurisdiction over thousands of commercial products, and powers that allow it to establish performance standards and require product testing and warning labels.

===The right to be informed===
This right states that businesses should always provide consumers with enough appropriate information to make intelligent and informed product choices. Product information provided by a business should always be complete and truthful. Aiming to achieve protection against misleading information in the areas of financing, advertising, labeling, and packaging, the right to be informed is protected by several pieces of legislation passed between 1960 and 1980.

Some of the legislation which was made because of the assertion of this right include the following:
*[[Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (US)]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of business and finance|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/Gale|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0028660615|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-1552100067.html |edition=2.|last1=Lush |first1=Mary |last2=Hinton |first2=Val |editor=Burton S. Kalisk |chapter=Consumer Bill of Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wholesome Meat Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;
*[[Truth in Lending Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;
*[[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;

===The right to choose===
The right to free choice among product offerings states that consumers should have a variety of options provided by different companies from which to choose. The federal government has taken many steps to ensure the availability of a healthy environment open to competition through legislation including limits on concept ownership through [[Patent Law|patent law]], prevention of monopolistic business practices through [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust legislation]], and the outlaw of price cutting and [[Price gouging|gouging]].

===The right to be heard===
This right has the ability of consumers to voice complaints and concerns about a product in order to have the issue handled efficiently and responsively. While no federal agency is tasked with the specific duty of providing a forum for this interaction between consumer and producer, certain outlets exist to aid consumers if difficulty occurs in communication with an aggrieving party. State and federal [[Attorney General|attorneys general]] are equipped to aid their constituents in dealing with parties who have provided a product or service in a manner unsatisfactory to the consumer in violation of an applicable law. Also, the [[Better Business Bureau]] is a national [[non-governmental]] organization whose sole agenda is to provide political lobbies and action on behalf of aggrieved consumers.

==Expansion to eight rights==
In 1985, the concept of consumer rights was endorsed by the United Nations through the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]], which expands them to include eight basic rights.

===The right to satisfaction of basic needs===
This right demands that people have access to basic, essential goods and services: adequate food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, public utilities, water, and sanitation

===The right to redress===
The right to redress provides for consumers to receive a fair settlement of just claims, including compensation for misrepresentation, shoddy goods, or unsatisfactory services. For example, a consumer should be able to go to consumer court against mobile phone companies that put hidden charges on the bill that were not previously explained, or activate ringtones without the consumer's permission.

===The right to consumer education===
The right to consumer education states that consumers should be able to acquire knowledge and skills needed to make informed, confident choices about goods and services, while being aware of basic consumer rights and responsibilities and how to act on them.

===The right to a healthy environment===
This is the right to live and work in a work space or home that is non-threatening to the well-being of present and future generations.

==World Consumer Rights Day==
The [[NGO]] [[Consumers International]] adopted the eight rights and restated them as a charter.&lt;ref name="consumersinternational"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumersinternational.org/who-we-are/consumer-rights|title=Consumers International - Who we are - consumer rights|publisher=consumersinternational.org|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the organization began recognizing the date of Kennedy's speech, March 15, as World Consumer Rights Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-guest/jfk-consumer-rights_b_1347471.html |title=Jim Guest: Fighting for Consumer Rights, Fifty Years After Kennedy's Call |first=Jim |last=Guest |authorlink=James A. Guest |work=huffingtonpost.com |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom provisions==
As of May 2014, the UK Government has introduced proposed legislation before Parliament. The bill is the "Consumer Rights Bill", and it will consolidate and develop Unfair Contract Terms provisions and Consumer Protection provisions.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/areas/consumer_rights.htm|title=Consumer Rights - Law Commission|publisher=lawcommission.justice.gov.uk|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Databending''' (or '''data bending''') is the process of manipulating a [[media file]] of a certain [[File format|format]], using [[software]] designed to edit files of another format. Distortions in the medium typically occur as a result, and the process either falls under a broader category of, or is frequently employed in [[glitch art]].

==Process and techniques==
The term ''databending'' is derived from [[circuit bending]], in which objects such as children's toys, [[effects pedal]]s and electronic keyboards are deliberately [[short circuit]]ed by bending the [[circuit board]] to produce erratic and spontaneous sounds. Like circuit bending,&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; databending involves the (often unpredictable) alteration of its target's behavior. Databending achieves this alteration by manipulating the information within a media file of a certain format, using software designed to edit files of a different format; distortions in the medium typically occur as a result.&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt;  

Many techniques exist, including the use of [[hex editor]]s to manipulate certain components of a [[compression algorithm]], to comparatively simple methods.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; [[Michael Betancourt]] has posed a short set of instructions, included in the [[Signal Culture |''Signal Culture Cookbook,'']] that involves the direct manipulation of the digital file using a hexadecimal editing program. One such method involves the addition of audio effects through [[audio editing software]] to distort [[raw data]] interpretations of image files. Some effects produce optical analogues: adding an [[echo]] filter duplicated elements of a photo, and inversion contributed to the flipping over of an image. The similarities result from the waveforms corresponding with the layers of pixels in a [[Linear medium|linear fashion]], ordered from top to bottom.&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt; Another method, dubbed "the WordPad effect", uses the program [[WordPad]] to manipulate images through converting the raw data to the [[Rich Text Format]].&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;

===Categorization===
According to the artist Benjamin Berg, different techniques of the process can be grouped into three categories:&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;
* Incorrect editing: Files of a certain format are manipulated using software designed to edit files of a different format.
* Reinterpretation: Files are simply converted from one medium to another.
* Forced errors: Known [[software bug]]s are exploited to force the program to terminate, usually while writing a file.
The "WordPad effect" would fall under ''incorrect editing'', while ''reinterpretation'' contains a subcategory called ''sonification'', in which data other than audio is introduced simultaneously with musical audio data. The last technique is the hardest of the three to accomplish, often yielding highly unpredictable results.&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;

==Usage and reception==
[[File:NicolaiRasterNotonLive.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Alva Noto uses sonification in his music.]]
Databending is frequently employed in [[glitch art]],&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt; and is considered a sub-category of the genre.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; The ''sonification'' technique is commonly used by [[glitch music]]ians such as [[Alva Noto]].&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; Ahuja and Lu summarized the process through a quote by Adam Clark Estes of ''[[Gizmodo]]'' as "the internet's code-heavy version of graffiti."&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Estes2013"/&gt; Various groups on [[Flickr]] explore the effects of databending on imagery; an [[Internet bot]] named "GlitchBot" was created to scrape [[Creative Commons]]-licensed imagery and apply the process and upload the results.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; Users on [[Vimeo]] who deal explicitly with databending and glitch art in general exist, and a [[Chicago]]-based digital art project named GLI.TC/H was funded using [[Kickstarter]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Weber2011"/&gt;

'''Early Chinese cartography''' began in the 5th century BC during the [[Warring States period]] when [[Cartography|cartographer]]s started to make maps of the Earth's surface. Its scope extended beyond China's borders with the expansion of the [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Chinese Empire]] under the [[Han dynasty]]. It entered its golden age with the invention of the [[compass]] in the 11th century during the [[Song dynasty]], and reached its peak in the 15th century when the [[Ming dynasty]] admiral [[Zheng He]] went on [[Treasure voyages|a series of voyages]] to the [[South China Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]], and beyond.

== Legends of maps ==
{{History of science and technology in China}}
There is an ancient Chinese legend called ''He Bo Xian Tu'' (河伯獻圖), which roughly means "the River Deity presenting a map". During the mythical [[Xia dynasty]], a river deity gave [[Yu the Great]] a stone with a flood map etched on its surface. Yu the Great used the map to help him in taming the flood that threatened to destroy rural agriculture.

In general, the development of early Chinese cartography experienced three phrases: primitive map, classical map, and survey map. The primitive maps were simple maps, still steeped in myth and legend. It was not until the [[Han dynasty]] that classical maps began to emerge.

== Earliest reference to maps in historical texts ==
The earliest reference to a map in Chinese history can be found in Volume 86 of the historical text ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shi Ji''). This volume recorded an incident in 227 BC during the late [[Warring States period]] in which a map is mentioned. [[Crown Prince Dan]] of the [[Yan (state)|Yan state]] sent [[Jing Ke]] to assassinate the [[Qin Shi Huang|King]] of the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]], so as to prevent Qin from conquering Yan. Jing Ke pretended to be an emissary from Yan, and said he wanted to present the King of Qin with a map of Dukang, a fertile region in Yan which would be ceded to Qin in exchange for peace between the two states. The map, which was rolled up and held in a case, had a poison-coated dagger hidden in it.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 534"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 534.&lt;/ref&gt; As Jing Ke was showing the King the map, he slowly unrolled the map until the dagger was revealed, and then seized it and tried to stab the King. The King managed to escape unharmed and Jing Ke was killed in his failed assassination attempt. From then on, maps are frequently mentioned in Chinese historical texts.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 535"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 535.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qin dynasty maps ==
[[File:Fangmatan paper map.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Fragment of the paper map from Fangmatan Tomb 5]]

In 1986, seven maps were found in Tomb 1, dating to the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] of the [[Warring States period]], at [[Fangmatan]] in [[Gansu|Gansu Province]]. The maps were drawn in black ink on four rectangular pieces of pine wood, 26.7&amp;nbsp;cm in length and between 15 and 18.1&amp;nbsp;cm in width, and depict the tributary river systems of the [[Jialing River]] in [[Sichuan|Sichuan Province]]. The areas covered by the seven maps overlap, but in total they cover 107 × 68&amp;nbsp;km in area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hsu | first=Hsin-mei Agnes | chapter=Structured Perceptions of Real and Imagined Landscapes in Early China | editor1-last=Raaflaub | editor1-first=Kurt A. | editor2-last=Talbert | editor2-first=Richard J.

In addition to the seven maps on wooden blocks found at Tomb 1 of Fangmatan, a fragment of a paper map (5.6 × 2.6&amp;nbsp;cm) was found on the chest of the occupant of Tomb 5 of Fangmatan in 1986. This tomb is dated to the early [[Han dynasty#Western Han|Western Han dynasty]], so the map dates to the early 2nd century BC. The map shows topographic features such as mountains, waterways and roads, and is believed to cover the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] of the Warring States period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Yi | first1=Xumei | last2=Liu | first2=Xiuwen | chapter=The calligraphy and printing cultural heritage of Gansu — the development of the engraved printing process and papermaking: an archaeological approach | editor1-last=Allen | editor1-first=Susan M. | editor2-last=Lin | editor2-first=Zuzao | editor3-last=Cheng | editor3-first=Xiaolan |display-editors = 3 | editor4-last=Bos | editor4-first=Jan | title=The History and Cultural Heritage of Chinese Calligraphy, Printing and Library Work | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | year=2010 | isbn=9783598441790 | page=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Behr | first=Wolfgang | chapter=Placed into the Right Position — Etymological Notes in ''Tu'' and Congeners | editor1-last=Bray | editor1-first=Francesca | editor2-last=Dorofeeva-Lichtmann | editor2-first=Vera | editor3-last=Métailié | editor3-first=Georges | title=Graphics and Text in the Production of Technical Knowledge in China: The Warp and the Weft | publisher=Brill | year=2007 | isbn=9789004160637 | page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Han dynasty maps ==
[[File:Mawangdui Topographic Map.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Silk map from [[Mawangdui]], dating back to circa 168 BC.]]
Concrete evidence of the existence of maps in ancient China dates back to the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD). The three silk maps found at the [[Mawangdui]] tumulus in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan|Hunan Province]] are traced back to the 2nd century BC. The three maps are a topographic map of the Changsha region, a military map of southern Changsha, and a prefecture map.

Research on the three maps indicates that the Chinese had acquired cartography skills in the Han dynasty. Although the military map does not contain names, a legend, scales, or any form of explanatory text, it shows modern Hunan, [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces, as well as the boundary between the Han Empire and [[Nanyue|Nanyue Kingdom]], covering the area from 111°E to 112°30′E, and from 23°N to 26°N. The scale of the map is approximately 1:180000.

At the time of their discovery, these three silk maps were the oldest to be found in China. However, they were superseded in 1986 after [[Qin dynasty]] maps dating back to the 4th century BC were found in [[Fangmatan]], [[Tianshui]], [[Gansu|Gansu Province]].

== Yuan and Ming dynasty maps ==
Throughout the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1271–1368) and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) dynasties, Chinese cartography did not experience any significant developments. However, traditional cartography skills became more refined, and different types of maps starting appearing. The new types of maps include national maps showing mountains and cities, land defence maps, coastal defence maps, river maps for flood control, and nautical charts for maritime navigation. These maps exhibited characteristics such as greater focus on the accuracy of rivers and mountains, greater use of mathematics in cartography, and the use of administrative divisions to demarcate boundaries.

In 1579, [[Luo Hongxian]] published the ''Guang Yu Tu'' (廣與圖) atlas, which includes more than 40 maps, a grid system, and a systematic way of representing major geographical features such as mountains, rivers, roads and borders. The ''Guang Yu Tu'' incorporates the discoveries of admiral [[Zheng He]]'s [[Treasure voyages|15th century voyages]] along the coasts of China, Southeast Asia, India, and East Africa.

Among Ming dynasty maps, Zheng He's map, also known as [[Mao Kun map]], was the most influential nautical chart. Between 1405 and 1433, the Ming government sponsored Zheng He to go on a series of seven naval expeditions to places in the South China Sea, Indian Ocean, and beyond. Thus, Zheng He's map was the important in the history of Chinese cartography and a specific one for maritime navigation. It also exhibited some special characteristics in terms of how its contents are presented:
* For map readers' convenience, the map is continuously splicing from the starting point of Zheng He's voyages to the ending point.
* Geographical features were drawn based on the map reader's orientation, such that map readers can find their position in the shortest time possible.
* Landmarks used in maps for maritime navigation, such as reefs, ports and islands, are included.

Chinese traditional cartography skills became more developed and advanced in the late Ming dynasty under the influence of new ideas of technology and studies of natural science, which were introduced from the West to China.

[[File:Da-ming-hun-yi-tu.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The ''Da Ming Hun Yi Tu'', dating from about 1390, is in multicolour. The horizontal scale is 1:820000 and the vertical scale is 1:1060000.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}]]

The ''Great Ming Amalgamated Map'' or ''Da Ming Hun Yi Tu'' ({{zh|c=大明混一圖|p=dàmíng hùn yī tú}}; [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: ''dai ming gurun-i uherilehe nirugan'') is a world map created in China. It was painted in colour on stiff silk and 386 x 456&amp;nbsp;cm in size.&lt;ref&gt;(Wang et al. 1994:51)&lt;/ref&gt; The original text was written in [[Classical Chinese]], but [[Manchu language|Manchu]] labels were later superimposed on them. It is one of the oldest surviving world maps from East Asia although the exact date of creation remains unknown. It depicts the general form of the [[Old World]], placing China in the center and stretching northward to Mongolia, southward to Java, eastward to central Japan, and westward to Africa and Europe. The Earth's curvature affects even the scale of the Chinese section of the map. The horizontal scale is 1:820000 while the vertical scale is 1:1,060,000.&lt;ref&gt;(Wang et al. 1994:51-52)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of colour is particularly effective within China itself, including elegant touches like the ochre tint of the [[Yellow River]].

The [[Selden Map of China]], which dates from the early 17th century and shows a series of precisely plotted maritime routes, has provoked a reassessment of the global significance of Ming cartography.

== Qing dynasty survey maps ==
The [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) realised that Chinese maps were not accurate enough and required scientific methods for mapping, so he sponsored a national wide geodesy and mapping programme based on astronomical observation and triangulation measurements. The map, which is called ''Huang Yu Quan Lan Tu'', took over 10 years to complete from 1708. It was also the first on-the-spot survey map. It had 41 framings based on provincial boundaries and has the following characteristics:
* Use of pseudo-cylindrical projection and latitude and longitude cartography methods
* Simultaneous of the Chinese and Manchu languages. Boundaries were defined in Manchu, while inland contents were defined in Chinese.
* Inclusion of a survey map of Taiwan for the first time

Apart from cartography, the unification of scale measurement and the field measurement of meridian of earth contributed to the development of cartography in the Qing dynasty and helped to significantly improve the quality of maps.

'''Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum''' is thought to be the first [[museum]] by some historians, although this is speculative. It dates to circa 530 BCE.&lt;ref name="anzovin"&gt;Anzovin, item # 1824, p. 69 ''The first museum known to historians (circa 530 BCE) was that of Ennigaldi-Nanna, the daughter of Nabu-na'id (Nabonidus), the last king to Babylonia.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Casey"&gt;Casey, p. "Public Museum" ''Around 530 B.C.E. in Ur, an educational museum containing a collection of labeled antiquities was founded by Ennigaldi-Nanna the, daughter of Nabonidus, the last king of Babylonia.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Harvey"&gt;Harvey, p. 20 ''Princess Ennigaldi-Nanna, collected antiques from the southern regions of Mesopotamia, which she stored in a temple at Ur – the first known museum in the world. ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Leon"&gt;Leon, pp. 36–37 ''...the first known museum...''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[curator]] was [[Ennigaldi ("Ennigaldi-Nanna")|Princess Ennigaldi]], the daughter of [[Nabonidus]], the [[List of Kings of Babylon|last king]] of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;McIntosch, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It was located in the state of [[Ur]], located in the modern-day [[Dhi Qar Governorate]] of [[Iraq]], roughly {{convert|150|m|ft|}} southeast of the famous [[Ziggurat of Ur]].&lt;ref Name="Woolley"&gt;Woolley, ''Ur of the Chaldees'' pp. 252–259&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
When [[archaeologist]]s excavated certain parts of the palace and temple complex at Ur they determined that the dozens of artifacts, neatly
arranged side by side, whose ages varied by centuries, were actually museum pieces - since they came with what was finally determined to be "museum labels". These consisted of clay cylinder drums with labels in three different languages.&lt;ref Name="Leon"/&gt;
Ennigalbi's father Nabonidus, an [[antiquarian]] and antique restorer, taught her to appreciate ancient artifacts.&lt;ref Name="Harvey"/&gt; Her father is known as the first serious [[archeologist]] and influenced Ennigaldi to create her educational antiquity museum.&lt;ref name="anzovin"/&gt;

The [[Ur#Archaeology|palace grounds]] that included the museum were at the ancient building referred to as E-Gig-Par, which also had her living quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, ''Excavations at Ur...'', p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; The palace grounds also included the palace subsidiary buildings.&lt;ref Name="Leon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HarperCollins, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Nash12"&gt;Nash, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
When archaeologist [[Leonard Woolley]] excavated the ruins of the museum, its contents were discovered to be labeled, using tablets and clay drums.&lt;ref Name="Britannica481"&gt;Britannica, Volume 2 p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] had been originally excavated by Nabonidus, Ennigald's father, and were from the 20th century BCE. Some artifacts had been collected previously by [[Nebuchadnezzar]].&lt;ref Name="Nash12"/&gt; Some are thought to have been excavated by Ennigald herself. The items were many centuries old already in Ennigald's time and came from the southern regions of Mesopotamia.&lt;ref Name="Harvey"/&gt;

Ennigald stored the artifacts in a temple next to the palace where she lived.&lt;ref Name="Harvey"/&gt; She used the museum pieces to explain the history of the area and to interpret material aspects of her dynasty's heritage.&lt;ref Name="Britannica481"/&gt;

The "[[museum label]]s" (the oldest such known to historians) for the items found in the museum were clay cylinders with descriptive text in three different languages.&lt;ref Name="Woolley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/bct/bct12.htm THE EXCAVATIONS AT UR OF THE CHALDEES]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Some of these artifacts were:

* A [[kudurru]], Kassite boundary marker (carved with a snake and emblems of various gods).
* Part of a statue of King [[Shulgi]]
* A clay cone that had been part of a building at [[Larsa]].&lt;ref Name="Casey"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">The '''exhaustion of intellectual property rights''' constitutes one of the limits of [[intellectual property]] (IP) rights. Once a given product has been sold under the authorization of the IP owner, the reselling, rental, lending and other third party commercial uses of IP-protected goods in domestic and international markets is governed by the principle.&lt;ref name=wipo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/ip_business/export/international_exhaustion.htm|title=International Exhaustion and Parallel Importation|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a product covered by an IP right, such as by a [[patent]] right, has been sold by the IP right owner or by others with the consent of the owner, the IP right is said to be exhausted. It can no longer be exercised by the owner.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This limitation is also referred to as the '''exhaustion doctrine''' or '''first sale doctrine'''.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; For example, if an inventor obtains a patent on a new kind of umbrella, the inventor (or anyone else to whom he sells his patent) can legally prohibit other companies from making and selling this kind of umbrella, but can not prohibit customers who have bought this umbrella from the patent owner from reselling the umbrella to third parties. There is a "fairly broad consensus" throughout the world "that this applies at least within the context of the domestic market".&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This is the concept of "national exhaustion". However, "[t]here is less consensus as to what extent the sale of an IP protected product abroad can exhaust the IP rights over this product in the context of domestic law."&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This is the concept of "regional exhaustion" or "international exhaustion". The rules and legal implications of the exhaustion largely differ depending on the country of importation, i.e. the national jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt;

The legal concept of international exhaustion is much more controversial, and is recognized in some countries but not in others. The importation, in a country that recognizes the concept of international exhaustion, of a product sold in a foreign country with the authorization of the IP right owner cannot be prevented by the IP right owner.&lt;ref&gt;The United States Supreme Court adopted the doctrine of international exhaustion in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' for US copyright law, and in that decision explained the general rationale for the doctrine under [[common law]] principles of property rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS), an international agreement administered by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), does not address the issue of exhaustion of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 TRIPS: "For the purposes of dispute settlement under this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 nothing in this Agreement shall be used to address the issue of the exhaustion of intellectual property rights."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fire dancer.JPG|thumb|300px|A Hawaiian fire knife dancer]]

The '''fire knife''' is a traditional [[Samoan culture|Samoan cultural]] implement that is used in ceremonial dances.  It was originally composed of a [[machete]] wrapped in towels on both ends with a portion of the blade exposed in the middle.   Tribal performers of fire knife dancing (or ''Siva Afi'' or even "Ailao Afi" as it is called in Samoa) dance while twirling the knife and doing other acrobatic stunts.  The towels are set afire during the dances thus explaining the name.

== History ==

The Siva Afi was originally performed with the Nifo Oti ( Samoan war club ) which is very dangerous as the steel of the Nifo oti heats up and burns  . The modern fire knife dance has its roots in the ancient Samoan exhibition called "ailao" – the flashy demonstration of a Samoan warrior's battle prowess through artful twirling, throwing and catching, and dancing with a war club. The 'ailao could be performed with any warclub, and some colonial accounts confirm that women also performed 'ailao at the head of ceremonial processions, especially daughters of high chiefs. During night dances torches were often twirled and swung about by dancers, although a warclub was the usual implement used for 'ailao. Before the introduction of metals, the most common clubs that were wielded and displayed in the 'ailao fashion were elaborately carved heirloom clubs called "anava". These 'anava were frequently carved with serrated edges and jagged "teeth" which characterized the unique Samoan weapon called the "nifo'oti".

When European and American whalers and traders began commercial ventures in Samoa, they introduced the natives to the long-handled blubber knife and the hooked [[cane knife]]. The characteristic metal hook of these tools was readily incorporated into the Samoan wooden nifo'oti, which bears the unique hooked element whether carved from wood or forged from steel. One common claim is that the word "nifo'oti" means "tooth of death", but this is not linguistically accurate as Samoan syntax places the modifier after the subject; according to Samoan grammar the term "nifo'oti" would actually mean "dead tooth", hardly as intimidating as the former translation. One more linguistic issue remains to be worked out in regards to 'oti (with the initial glottal stop) and "oti" (without the glottal stop). When pronounced with the glottal stop, the word 'oti does not mean "death" at all; as a verb, 'oti means "to cut" as in 'otiulu ("hair cut") or as a noun it refers to the domestic goat. Therefore, the most probable derivation of the term "nifo'oti" stems from the resemblance of the weapon's hook to the curved horn ("nifo) of a goat ('oti), or from the serrated teeth ("nifo") that formed the weapon's cutting edge ('oti).

=== The Expulsion of The Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki (King of Tonga) &amp; The Birth of [[Malietoa]] (King of Samoa): ===

Ancient Samoan Legend speaks of hundreds of warriors whom would practice ailao with the ends of their weapons on fire the Nifo Oti ( Samoan war club )as part of their training. The warriors became very skilled and began to use and add many skillful maneuvers and spinning tricks to their ailao fire training, eventually becoming highly skilled combatants. Samoan warriors were called upon to dance and entertain the Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki during a birthday celebration for the King of Tonga.  The Tongans had ruled parts of Samoa Upolu and Savai'i but were not able to conquer the Eastern Samoan Islands namely Manu'a (American Samoa) and Manono whose warriors famously held off Tongan and Fijian invasions on numerous occasions. The Manu'a warriors were renown throughout Eastern Polynesia for their strength and ferocity.  

For approximately 200 years the Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki established a long-term residence at Safotu, Savai'i, Samoa.  The location for the Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki's birthday Festivities was a beautiful famous stretch of beach in Aleipata a region on the Eastern side of Upolu.  The Samoan warriors arrived to prepare their entertainment for Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki, the [[Samoans]] buried weapons nifo oti, in the sand all around the beach area, as they plied the Tongans with "bush gin".  Then they utilized their nifo oti, which has remained the same design for the last millennia, as those favored when the Samoans were actually head hunters, and the nifo-oti beheaded the victim while the hook carried the trophy.  Of course this way of life had long since been abandoned but the nifo-oti were still extremely lethal.  

As the Festivities and party progressed, and more "bush gin" was consumed, as night set in the Samoan warriors "performed" for the king.  They had wrapped both ends of their nifo-oti with dry palm sennit which was then dipped into the fires to create a blaze on one end of the knife.  They danced and pointed out the locations of the buried weapons, to other Samoan warriors who waited, in small paopaos (canoes) offshore. The warriors then stormed the beach, recovered the weapons and set them ablaze as they proceeded to drive the Tongans in a bloody battle all the way across the island, from east to the western most point of Upolu, where the Tongans whom were not killed, eventually boarded boats and left Samoa for good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malietoa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The young man Tavita Vaoifi revived the Samoan ailao Siva Afi dance, to eventually bring it home to Samoa.  He had won a scholarship from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  This was while WWII was being fought in part, in his beloved South Pacific.  When he was able to come to America he went to school, worked, and danced.  After he read this information, in his spare time, he researched anything that he could find about his homeland.  This story stuck him deeply, because he had never heard of this from his elders.  He was determined to incorporate this treasure into his island dance routine.  After many cuts, burns, and narrow escapes he was able to perfect this dance to the point where he performed it nightly at clubs and shows throughout, not only the San Francisco area but the entire country.

Fire was added to the knife in 1946 by a Samoan knife dancer named [[Freddie Letuli]], later to become Paramount Chief Letuli Olo Misilagi.
Letuli was performing in San Francisco and noticed a Hindu [[Fire eating|Fire eater]] and a little girl with lighted batons. The fire eater loaned him some fuel, he wrapped some towels around his knife, and the fire knife dance was born.

Although today many commercial performers perform the dance with short staffs or unbladed knives, this is not authentic fire knife dance and is unacceptable in the Samoas except for training purposes. The knives used by performers in [[American Samoa]] are still made of machetes, although they are often dulled for younger dancers.

== Competition ==

Traditional competitions were hotly contested.  Their exhibitionists would almost rather die than seek medical care for injuries incurred while performing.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Today, modern competitions are held annually at the [[Polynesian Cultural Center]] to name the World Fireknife Champion.  The competition began in 1992 and is always held during the third week of May.  In 2007, the championships were expanded to welcome competitors in a duet category and a women's category. In 2010 the event expanded to four nights including a two-night, three-person final competition.

Champions by year are:
* 2017: Falaniko Penesa (Samoa)
* 2016: Mikaele Oloa (Waialua, Hawaii)
* 2015: Joseph Cadousteau (Papeete, Tahiti)
* 2014: Viavia Tiumalu,Jr. (Orlando,Florida)

* 1995: Ifi Soo (Maui, Hawaii)
* 1994: Ifi Soo (Maui, Hawaii)
* 1993: Tauasa Sielu Avea (Laie, Hawaii)

== Modern use ==

The Samoan Siva Afi has become an integral part of any Polynesian Luau or show. Many other Polynesian Islands have implemented the Siva Afi into their own Island shows especially in the Islands of Tahiti, Hawai'i, Cook Islands Fiji and Tonga. Because of the close familial Tribal ties with the aforementioned Islands and the Samoa Islands, the fire knife dance has almost become homogenized as part of those Islands own culture.
In the mid 20th century, the ancient traditions were commercialized and westernized.  Over time the performing implement has changed.  The wooden handle gradually lengthened and the blade got shorter.  Eventually, the exposed portion was part of the handle.  Some of the moves performed in shows now are more modern and flashy than traditional battle preparations.  As such, they are often performed at accelerated speeds.  It is probable that the danger of sharpened blades and the demand for multiple daily shows by top performers has caused the sharpened blade to disappear entirely from commercial performances.  Now, when one travels to [[Hawaii]], it is quite common to see commercial '''Fire Knife Dancing''' performed with wooden or aluminum poles wrapped in towels.  These performances are often part of [[Luau]] festivities or [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] shows that include [[Poi (juggling)|Poi Ball]] performances.

[[File:Momia guanche MNA.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Guanche mummy of Madrid|Guanche mummy]] at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]] in [[Madrid, Spain]].]]
'''Guanche mummies''' are the [[mummy|intentionally desiccated]] remains of members of the indigenous [[Guanches|Guanche]] people of the [[Canary Islands]]. The Guanche [[Mummy|mummies]] were made during the eras prior to Spanish settlement of the area in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Deem/&gt; The methods of [[embalming]] are similar to those that were used by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, though fewer mummies remain from the Guanche due to looting and desecration.

==Archaeological record==
[[File:Momia guanche museo santa cruz 27-07.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Mummy of San Andrés]] in the [[Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre]].]]
[[Mummification]] on the Canary Islands during the Guanche period remained confined to [[Tenerife]], [[Gran Canaria]], [[La Gomera]], and [[El Hierro]]. The most well-preserved, and therefore the most thoroughly-studied, mummies were found on Tenerife.&lt;ref name=Cockburn/&gt;

In 1933, the Guanche [[necropolis]] of [[Uchova]] was discovered in the municipality of [[San Miguel de Abona]] in southern Tenerife. It is estimated that it contained between 60 and 74 mummies before the cemetery was almost completely looted.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Un estudio recuerda el expolio de la mayor necrópolis guanche jamás hallada|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/epa/article/ALeqM5js8mukVnZJz1rSsQmaz2vQN8Evcg?hl=es|publisher=European Pressphoto Agency|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical examination of the Guanche mummies of Tenerife found that they were quite tall. On average, the males stood 1.70 m and the females were 1.57 m in height. They were also generally of robust constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodríguez-Martín|first1=C.|title=Guanche mummies of Tenerife (Canary Islands): conservation and scientific studies in the CRONOS Project|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=3709165652|page=183|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=27wJCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest mummified remains of the Canary Islands are from the 3rd century AD and were found on Tenerife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Las momias guanches más antiguas de Canarias se conservan en Tenerife |url=https://www.canarias7.es/hemeroteca/las_momias_guanches_mas_antiguas_de_canarias_se_conservan_en_tenerife-OACSN263962 |work=Canarias7 |publisher=Informaciones Canarias, S.A. |date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical record==
[[Medieval Spanish]] explorers arriving in the islands during the 14th century reported the Guanche buried individuals of low [[social status]] in sandy graves, while [[upper class]] members were mummified and laid to rest in secluded caves.&lt;ref name=Horne&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horne|first=Patrick|author2=Robert Ireland|title=Moss and a Guanche Mummy: An Unusual Utilization|journal=The Bryologist|year=1991|volume=94|issue=4|page=407|jstor=3243832|publisher=American Bryological and Lichenological Society|doi=10.2307/3243832}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these [[mortuary]] caves may have held up to 1,000 mummies, however, many of these have disappeared with only 20 complete mummies left on the islands.&lt;ref name=Horne/&gt; The loss of such a large amount of mummies is generally attributed to the popularity of [[mummia]], a pharmaceutical substance created out of pulverized mummies.&lt;ref name=Deem/&gt;

The Guanche had groups of males and females, working as mummification specialists, who would carry out the process according to the gender of the decedent. The Guanche culture considered these individuals unclean due to the nature of their work.&lt;ref name=Cockburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Cockburn|first=Aidan|title=Mummies, Disease and Ancient Cultures|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=University Press, Cambridge, UK|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8KZHa5vHOS0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=Guanche+mummies&amp;ots=FgOg1AkJVL&amp;sig=L1eMoKaaUgRv1GFFLrbT-_pwof8#v=onepage&amp;q=Guanche%20mummies&amp;f=false|edition=Second |author2=Eve Cockburn |author3=Theodore A. Reyman|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mummification process==
While early explorers reported various traditions associated with Guanche mummification, there are three methods identified in modern times through scientific analysis: [[disembowelment|evisceration]], [[Preservative|preservation]], and stuffing. These methods have been used in various different combinations depending on the era in which the mummy was created.&lt;ref name=Cockburn/&gt;

In 1876, Dr. Don [[Gregorio Chil y Naranjo]] discovered several incisions in some mummies that he speculated may have been used to remove the internal organs.&lt;ref name=Cockburn/&gt; [[Don Brothwell]]'s work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a [[pathological]] examination of a Guanche mummy.&lt;ref name=Horne/&gt; The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated, then the [[abdominal]] and [[thoracic]] cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the bark of a [[Pinus canariensis|pine tree]]. Some sort of packing was also applied [[subcutaneously]], but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.&lt;ref name=Deem&gt;{{cite web|last=Deem|first=James|title=Guanche Mummies|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/guanche.htm|work=James M Deem's Mummy Tombs|accessdate=10 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031043012/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/guanche.htm|archivedate=31 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Horne/&gt;

An examination conducted by Patrick Horne in 1991 of a mummy held at the [[Redpath Museum]] at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada revealed [[moss]] had been used to stuff the empty abdominal cavity.  In addition to the moss, there were several other types of local plant that had been preserved inside the body as packing.&lt;ref name=Horne/&gt;

Preservation of the outer parts of the body was normally achieved through a combination of resins and animal skin wrappings. The resins were prepared with a mixture of [[mineral]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[fat]]s. These were spread across the body prior to allowing it to dry, either in the sun or through smoking. Finally, the deceased was wrapped in animal skins and laid to rest. The number of animal skins used in wrapping corresponded with the individual’s social status, with kings being wrapped with up to 15 skins.&lt;ref name=Cockburn/&gt;

The '''Gypsy Lore Society''' was founded in Great Britain in 1888 to unite persons interested in the history and lore of [[Names of the Romani people#Gypsy|Gypsies]] and rovers and to establish closer contacts among scholars studying aspects of such cultures. [[David MacRitchie]] was one of its founders and he worked with [[Francis Hindes Groome]] until 1892 to produce its  quarterly journal.  From 1892, the organisation was dormant until its revival in 1907, when MacRitchie became its president.

Another early member of the society was Sir [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]], who wrote  from [[Trieste]] in 1888: {{cquote|1=We [The Gypsy Lore Society] must advance slowly and depend for success upon our work pleasing the public. Of course, all of us must do our best to secure new members, and by [[Christmas]] I hope that we shall find ourselves on the right road. Mr. Pincherle writes to me hopefully about his practical studies of Gypsy life in Trieste. As regards [[Orientalism]] in [[England]] generally I simply despair of it. Every year the study is more wanted and we do less. It is the same with [[anthropology]], so cultivated in [[France]], so stolidly neglected in England. I am perfectly ashamed of our wretched "Institution" in [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]] when compared with the palace in [[Paris]]. However, this must come to an end some day.&lt;ref&gt; The Life of Sir Richard Burton, by Thomas Wright, 155. The Gypsy, August 1888. https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/chapter33.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since 1989 it has been headquartered in the [[United States]]. Its goals include promotion of the study of Roma, Gypsies and Travelers. Gypsy Lore Society publications include journal ROMANI STUDIES continuing Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society and Newsletter of the Gypsy Lore Society. The biannual journal, ''Romani Studies,'' concerned with disseminating accurate information aimed at increasing understanding of these cultures in their diverse forms. The ''Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society'' appeared in four series, starting in July 1888. The Society's archives are held at the [[University of Liverpool]].

Among the Gypsy and Traveler cultures represented include those traditionally known as [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Sinti]], Calé, [[Romnichel]]s, Ludar, [[Irish Travellers]], [[Scottish Travellers]] and others.

The Society also sponsors programs and conferences. The North American chapter of the Society established the [http://www.gypsyloresociety.org/weybright-archives Victor Weybright Archives of Gypsy Studies] in 1978, specializing in recent scholarly work on Gypsy, Traveler and related studies, for the benefit of researchers and students.

In religious and magical practice, '''insufflation''' and '''[[exsufflation]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Insufflation (from [[Latin]] word elements meaning "a blowing on") and exsufflation ("a blowing out") often cannot be distinguished in usage, and so are considered together in this article.&lt;/ref&gt; are ritual acts of blowing, breathing, hissing, or puffing that signify variously expulsion or renunciation of evil or of the [[devil]] (the Evil One), or infilling or blessing with good (especially, in religious use, with the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] or [[Divine grace|grace of God]]).

In historical Christian practice, such blowing appears most prominently in the [[liturgy]], and is connected almost exclusively with [[baptism]] and other ceremonies of [[Christian]] [[initiation]], achieving its greatest popularity during periods in which such ceremonies were given a prophylactic or [[exorcism|exorcistic]] significance, and were viewed as essential to the defeat of the devil or to the removal of the taint of [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Franz Josef Dölger]], Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufrituel, Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Altertums 3 (Paderborn, 1909), chap. 7 "Die Exsufflatio" (pp. 118-130); Edmond Martène, De antiquis ecclesiae ritibus libri tres (Venice, 1763), I.1.viii-xiv ("Ritus instituendi catechumeni"); Rudolf Suntrup, Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Gebärden und Bewegungen in lateinischen und deutschen Auslegungen des 9. bis 13. Jahrhunderts (Munich, 1978), pp. 307-310; and Henry A. Kelly, The Devil at Baptism: Ritual, Theology, and Drama (Ithaca, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual blowing occurs in the liturgies of [[catechumenate]] and [[baptism]] from a very [[Early Christianity|early period]] and survives into the modern [[Roman Catholic]], [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Maronite]], and [[Coptic Orthodox|Coptic]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;Alongside Martène and Suntrup (cited above), convenient collections of illustrative material include W. G. Henderson, ed., Manuale et Processionale ad usum insignis Ecclesiae Eboracensis, Surtees Society Publications 63 (Durham, 1875 for 1874), especially Appendix III "Ordines Baptismi" [cited below as York Manual]; Joseph Aloysius Assemanus, Codex liturgicus ecclesiae universae, I: De Catechumenis and II: De Baptismo (Rome, 1749; reprinted Paris and Leipzig, 1902); J.

Finn, Early Christian Baptism and the Catechumenate: Italy, North Africa, and Egypt (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic liturgy post-[[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] (the so-called ''novus ordo'' 1969) has largely done away with insufflation, except in a special rite for the consecration of [[chrism]] on [[Maundy Thursday]].&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Cross, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., rev. by F. L. Cross and E. A. Livingstone (Oxford, 1998), ''s.v.'' "insufflation," p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant liturgies typically abandoned it very early on. The [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Catholic liturgy]] retained both an insufflation of the baptismal water and (like the present-day Orthodox and Maronite rites)&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., 840. For the Maronite rite, derived from the ancient Syriac liturgy, see Mysteries of Initiation, Baptism, Confirmation, Communion according to the Maronite Antiochene Church, (Washington, DC, 1987); summarized by Bryan D. Spinks, Early and Medieval Rituals and Theologies of Baptism..., (Aldershot, Hants., 2006), 89-91.&lt;/ref&gt; an exsufflation of the candidate for baptism, right up to the 1960s:

  &lt;blockquote&gt;[THE INSUFFLATION] ''He breathes thrice upon the waters in the form of a cross, saying:'' Do You with Your mouth bless these pure waters: that besides their natural virtue of cleansing the body, they may also be effectual for purifying the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Andrew Daily Missal..., by Dom Gaspar Lefebvre (Bruges [Belgium]: Biblica, 1962), 492 [liturgy for the Easter vigil].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;THE EXSUFFLATION. ''The priest breathes three times on the child in the form of a cross, saying:'' Go out of him...you [[unclean spirit]] and give place to the Holy Spirit, the [[Paraclete]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Andrew Missal (Bruges, 1962), 1768 [ceremonies of baptism].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Insufflation vs. exsufflation==

From an early period, the act had two distinct but not always distinguishable meanings: it signified on the one hand the derisive repudiation or exorcism of the devil; and, on the other, purification and consecration by and inspiration with the Holy Spirit. The former is technically "exsufflation" ("blowing out") and the latter "insufflation" ("blowing in"), but ancient and medieval texts (followed by modern scholarship) make no consistent distinction in usage. For example, the texts use not only Latin ''insufflare'' ('blow in') and ''exsufflare'' ('blow out'), or their Greek or [[vernacular]] equivalents, but also the simplex ''sufflare'' ('blow'), ''halare'' ('breathe'), ''inspirare'', ''exspirare'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;P. Pashini, ''et al.,'' ed., Enciclopedia Cattolica (Florence, 1949-1954), ''s.v.'' "insufflazione," pp. 55-56. Compare Neale, The Ancient Liturgies of the Gallican Church..., p. 266, note m; Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, p. 256; Kelly, The Devil at Baptism, p. 235. Döger, Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufrituel, p. 130 similarly distinguishes between exsufflation and "halation"; and Suntrup, Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Gebärden, p. 307 warns that the distinction is a hard one to maintain. The Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, ''s.v. insufflation'' (accessed 14 Jan 2007) similarly says that "the distinction between insufflation and exsufflation has not always been preserved." And the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., p. 839, is content to give both inspirational ("to symbolize the influence of the Holy Spirit") and exorcistic ("the expulsion of evil spirits") meanings under the single heading of "insufflation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical is the 8th-century ''Libellus de mysterio baptismatis'' of [[Magnus of Sens]], one of a number of responses to a questionnaire about baptism circulated by [[Charlemagne]]. In discussing insufflation as a means of exorcising catechumens, Magnus combines a variety of mostly exsufflation-like functions≈

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Those who are to be baptised are insufflated by the priest of God, so that the Prince of Sinners [i.e. the devil] may be put to flight from out of them, and that entry for the Lord [[Christ]] might be prepared, and that by his insufflation they might be made worthy to receive the Holy Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Patrologia Latina, 102:982D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This double role appears as early as [[Cyril of Jerusalem]]'s 4th-century ''Mystagogic Catacheses''; as Edward Yarnold notes, "Cyril attributes both negative and positive effects [to insufflation]. … The rite of breathing on the [baptismal] candidate has the negative effect of blowing away the devil (exsufflation) and the positive effect of breathing in grace (insufflation)."&lt;ref&gt;Cyril of Jerusalem, by Edward J. Yarnold (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early period===

What might neutrally be called "sufflation" is found in some of the earliest liturgies dealing with the protracted process of initiation known as the "[[catechumenate]]," which saw its heyday in the 4th and 5th centuries. The earliest extant liturgical use is possibly that of the ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'' attributed to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], from the 3rd or 4th century, and therefore contemporary with Cyril in the east:&lt;ref&gt;The date is controversial. The text is usually connected with practice in Rome and dated in its earliest form to the early 3rd century. But the surviving text is fragmentary, many portions surviving only in much later versions in several different languages. Chapter 20, the relevant chapter, is perhaps from the 4th century (see Maxwell E. Johnson, The Rites of Christian Initiation: Their Evolution and Interpretation (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999), 78-81). For the standard reconstruction of the text, see Bernard Botte, La "Tradition Apostolique," 42-45 (chapter 20). Whitaker, Documents, p. 4, reprints the translation of Gregory Dix, The Treatise on the Apostolic Tradition, p. 32 (sect. xx.8). Botte renders the Coptic original of the sufflation passage as "exsufflet," though Kelly (Devil at Baptism, p. 87) points out that the significance of the gesture is uncertain. Geoffrey Cumming gives the more neutral translation "breathe on": Hippolytus: A Text for Students (Bramcote, Notts, 1976), p. 18, as reproduced more fully below.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who are to be baptized should … be gathered in one place. … And [the bishop] should lay his hands on them and exorcize all alien spirits, that they may flee out of them and ever return into them. And when he has finished exorcizing them, '''he shall breathe on their faces;''' and when he has signed their foreheads, ears, and noses, he shall raise them up.&lt;ref&gt;Cuming's translation, reprinted by Maxwell Johnson, Rites of Christian Initiation, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Distribution, geographical and functional===

The practice entered the baptismal liturgy proper only as the catechumenate, rendered vestigial by the growth of routine [[infant baptism]], was absorbed into the rite of baptism. Both exsufflation and insufflation are well established by the time of [[Augustine]] and in later centuries are found widely. By the Western [[high Middle Ages]] of the 12th century, sufflation was geographically widespread, and had been applied not only to sufflating catechumens and [[wikt:baptizand|baptizands]],&lt;ref&gt;Nearly universally. E.g. (1) in Egypt: Canons of Hippolytus, Canon 19 (or §110), trans. Riedel 211, Achelis 93, Whitaker 88; Horner's translations of the Ethiopic, Arabic, and Sahidic versions may be found on pp. 152, 252, and 316. (2) In western Syria: Cyril, Procatechesis, cap. 9, ed. F. L. Cross, St. Cyril of Jerusalem's Lectures on the Christian Sacraments: The "Procatechesis" and the "Five Mystical Dialogues" (London, 1951), 5-6, trans. 45 = Patrologia Graeca 33:347-50 (translated also by E. H. Gifford, Catechetical Lectures, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series (N.Y., 1894), 3); and the ''[[Testamentum Domini nostri Jesu Christi]]'', ed. and trans. Ignatius Ephraem II Rahmani (Mainz, 1899), 125, 127 (rpt. by Quasten, Monumenta, 5:266-67. (3) In Spain: Isidore, De ecclesiasticis officiis II.xxi.3, ed. C. M. Lawson, CCSL 113 (1989), 96/21 (Patrologia Latina 83:815A; trans. Whitaker, 117); the Spanish rites in general are discussed by Kelly, 234-36 and 244-52. (4) In northern Italy: see Kelly, 232-34 and 236-38; Whitaker, 143; and Cyrille Lambot, ed., North Italian Services of the Eleventh Century, [[Henry Bradshaw Society]] 67 (London, 1931 for 1928), 5, 6, 16. (5) In the Byzantine and other eastern rites: see, e.g., Lodi, 1303 (§2925) and Whitaker, 74; the eastern rites are treated extensively by Kelly, 136-200. (6) In Roman North Africa: Augustine is the most important witness; cp. also Quodvultdeus, De Symbolo III.1.3, ed. R. Braun, CCSL 60 (1976), 349 (Patrologia Latina 40:661).&lt;/ref&gt; but also to exorcism of readmitted [[heresy|heretics]]&lt;!-- (or lapsed Catholics regarded by Donatists as heretics) --&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;Council of Constantinople (A.D. 381), Canon VII, ed. N. P. Tanner, Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils [based on the text of G. Alberigo, ''et al.''] (London, 1990) 1:35: "We exorcize them by breathing thrice their faces and ears." This canon is evidently a 5th-century addition: see Kelly 144, Tanner 1:22 note 8. &lt;!-- Augustines' anti-Donatist works --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to admission of adult converts to the catechumenate;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the Gelasian Sacramentary, ed.

Quasten, Monumenta, 6:281; trans. Whitaker, 57. In Ephraem Syrus, In secundum adventum domini, cited by Kelly, 135 note 30. And in the Byzantine rite (see Whitaker, 70, 77). For Western sources, see further below.&lt;/ref&gt; to consecration and/or exorcism of the [[baptismal font]] and water;&lt;ref&gt;Very commonly, e.g. in the Byzantine rite (Whitaker, 80); the (Milanese) Ambrosian Manual (Whitaker, 138, 145); other North Italian rites (Lambot, 33); the Liber Ordinum (ed. Férotin, 29; trans. Whitaker, 118); the Missale Gothicum; the Gregorian Sacramentary (''Hadrianum''); the Ordo Romanus L; and in the Sarum Missal (ed. J. Wickham Legg (Oxford: Clarendon, 1916; rpt. 1969), 129) and other English texts (see below).&lt;/ref&gt; to consecration or exorcism of [[Ash Wednesday|ashes]];&lt;ref&gt;In the Ambrosian Manual (Kelly, 228) and in Beroldus (12th century Milan; trans. in Whitaker, 149).&lt;/ref&gt; and to the consecration of the chrism or holy oil.&lt;ref&gt;In the Byzantine rite (Whitaker, 81); in the Ethiopic rite (A. Salles, trans., Trois antiques rituels du baptême, [[Sources Chrétiennes]] 59 (Paris, 1958), 50); in several Ordines Romani (e.g., Ordo XXIV 18, Ordo XXVII 31, Ordo XXVIII 22, all ed. Michel Andrieu, Les Ordines Romani du Haut Moyen Âge, vol. 3, Spicilegium Sacrum Lovaniense, Études et Documents, fasc. 24 (Louvain, 1951), 291, 354, 396; also in the ''Ordo'' quoted by Amalarius, Liber Officialis, I.xii.27-8, ed. Jean-Michel Hanssens, Amalarii Episcopi Opera Liturgica Omnia, vol. 2, Studi e testi 139 (Vatican City, 1948), 75-76; and in the nine 12th-century English pontificals printed as Appendix 3.1 to the Bainbridge Pontifical (W. G. Henderson, ed., Liber Pontificalis Chr. Bainbridge Archiepiscopi Eboracensis, Surtees Society Publications 61 (Durham, 1875 for 1873), 254, 256).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===

Most of these variations persist in one branch or another of the hybrid [[Pontificale Romano-Germanicum|Romano-Germanic]] rite that can be traced from 5th-century Rome through the western Middle Ages to the [[Council of Trent]], and beyond that into modern ([[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]]) Roman Catholicism. As the 'national' rites such as the [[Ambrosian Rite|Ambrosian tradition]] in [[northern Italy]] and the Spanish [[Mozarabic rite]] faded away or were absorbed into international practice, it was this hybrid Roman-Gallican standard that came to dominate western [[Christendom]], including [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[medieval England]], from the time of Charlemagne, and partly through his doing, through the high and late Middle Ages and into the modern period. Roman practice around the year 500 is reflected in a letter by a somewhat mysterious [[John the Deacon (Church of Rome)|John the Deacon]] to a correspondent named Senarius. The letter discusses the exsufflation of catechumens at length.&lt;ref&gt;John the Deacon, Epistola ad Senarium,  ed. [[A. Wilmart]], "Analecta Reginensia (Vat. Reg. Lat. 69)," Studi e testi 59 (1933), 172; trans. Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stowe Missal]], Irish in origin but largely [[Gallican Rite|Gallican]] in form, contains a prebaptismal sufflation of unclear significance.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Warren, Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic Church (Oxford, 1881; rpt. with introduction by Jane Stevenson, Woodbridge, Suffolk, 1987), 209; The Stowe Missal, ed. George F. Warner, Henry Bradshaw Society 32 (London, 1915), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The other Gallican rites are largely devoid of sufflation, though the so-called [[Gallican rite#Missale Gothicum|Missale Gothicum]] contains a triple exsufflation of baptismal water,&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Gallican Liturgies, 97; or L. C. Mohlberg, ed., Missale Gothicum, Rerum Ecclesiasticarum Documenta, Series Maior, Fontes 5 (Rome, 1961), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and a prebaptismal insufflation of catechumens is found in the hybrid [[Celtic Rite#The Bobbio Missal|Bobbio Missal]]&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Gallican Liturgies, 266&lt;/ref&gt; and the 10th-century [[Fulda]] [[sacramentary]], alongside the more common baptismal exsufflation.&lt;ref&gt;Fulda Sacramentary, 332 (§2631) and 343 (§2679-80).&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th-century North-Italian baptismal ritual in the [[Ambrosian Library]] MS. T.27.Sup. makes heavy use of the practice, requiring both insufflation and triple exsufflation of the baptismal candidates ''in modum crucis'', and insufflation of the font as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lambot, North Italian Services, 5, 11, 16, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Hadrianum" version of the Gregorian Sacramentary, sent to Charlemagne from Rome and augmented probably by [[Benedict of Aniane]], contains an insufflation of the baptismal font,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Deshusses, Le Sacramentaire Grégorien, vol. 1, Spicilegium Friburgense 16 (Fribourg, 1971), 188; the rubric here is reconstructed by Deshusses from a wide variety of variants. On the attribution of the Hadrianum supplement to Benedict, see Deshusses, 1:63-7 and vol. 3, Spicilegium Friburgense 28 (Fribourg, 1982), 66-75, as well as his earlier article "Le 'Supplément' au sacramentaire grégorien: Alcuin ou S. Benoît d'Aniane?" Archiv für Liturgiewissenschaft 9.1 (1965): 48-71.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the mid-10th-century ''Ordo Romanus L'',&lt;ref&gt;Ordo L, xxxix.50; Michel Andrieu, ed., Les Ordines Romani du Haut Moyen Age, vol. 5, Spicilegium Sacrum Lovaniense, Études et Documents, fasc. 29 (Louvain, 1961), 281.&lt;/ref&gt; the basis of the later Roman pontifical. ''Ordo Romanus L'' also contains a triple exsufflation of the candidates for baptism, immediately preceding the baptism itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ordo L, xx.5; Andrieu, 5:131. This section was probably also originally found in Ordo XI according to Andrieu (2:376).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the numerous [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] expositions of baptism treat sufflation to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean-Paul Bouhot, "Explications du rituel baptismal à l'époque carolingienne," Revue des études augustiniennes 24 (1978): 278-301; and Susan A. Keefe, "Carolingian Baptismal Expositions: A Handlist of Tracts and MSS," in Carolingian Essays, ed. Uta-Renate Blumenthal (Washington, DC, 1983), 169-238.&lt;/ref&gt; One anonymous 9th-century catechism is unusual in distinguishing explicitly between the exsufflation of catechumens and the insufflation of baptismal water,&lt;ref&gt;[[André Wilmart]], "Une catéchèse baptismale du IX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle," Revue Bénédictine 57 (1947): 199 (Keefe, "Expositions," text 50).&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the [[tract (literature)|tract]]s and [[florilegium|florilegia]], when they treat both, do so without referring one to the other; most confine themselves to exsufflation and are usually content to quote extracts from authorities, especially [[Isidore]] and [[Alcuin]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in Keefe's texts 34/6 and 3: Jean-Paul Bouhot, "Alcuin et le 'De Catechizandis Rudibus,'" Recherches Augustiniennes 15 (1980): 224; and Wilmart, Analecta, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly popular was Isidore's lapidary remark in the Etymologies to the effect that it is not the human being ("God's creature") that is exsufflated, but the Prince of Sinners to whom that person is subjected by being born in sin,&lt;ref&gt;''Sciendum est quod non creatura Dei in infantibus exorcizatur aut exufflatur, sed ille sub quo sunt omnes qui cum peccato nascuntur; est enim princeps peccatorum''. Etymologiarum,VI.xix.56; ed. W. M. Lindsay (Oxford, 1911).&lt;/ref&gt; a remark that echoed [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s arguments against the [[Pelagians]] to the effect that it was not the human infant (God's image) that was attacked in sufflation, but the infant's possessor, the devil. Particularly influential was Alcuin's brief treatment of the subject, the so-called ''Primo paganus'', which in turn depended heavily on John the Deacon.&lt;ref&gt;Alcuin's comments are contained in two genuine letters (numbers 134, to Odwin, and 137, to monks in the south of France), ed. Ernst Dümmler, Epistolae Karolini Aevi, 2, MGH Epistolae 4 (Berlin, 1895), 202 and 214; and in a third letter of dubious authenticity, ostensibly to Charlemagne, ed. Patrologia Latina 98:938B. The three letters are nearly verbatim identical in their description of exsufflation: ''Primo paganus catechumenus fit, accedens ad baptismum; ut renuntiet maligno spiritui et omnibus eius pompis. Exsufflatur etiam; ut, fugato diabolo, Christo Deo nostro paretur introitus'' (MGH, 214, = Keefe text 9, Bouhot, 280-82.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Primo paganus'' formed the basis of Charlemagne's famous circular questionnaire on baptism, part of his effort to harmonize liturgical practice across his empire; and many of the seventeen extant direct or indirect responses to the questionnaire echo Alcuin, making the process a little circular and the texts a little repetitious.&lt;ref&gt;For the various replies, see Wilmart, 154; Bouhot, 286-93; and Keefe, ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; The burden of Alcuin's remarks, in fact, appears above in the quotation from the ''Libellus'' of Magnus of Sens, one of the respondents.&lt;ref&gt;The Libellus of Magnus of Sens is Keefe's text 15 (Bouhot, 287).&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire assumed that exsufflation of or on the part of the candidate for baptism was generally practiced — it merely asks what meaning is attached to the practice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Concerning the renunciation of Satan and all his works and pomps, what is the renunciation? and what are the works of the devil and his pomps? why is he breathed upon? (''cur exsufflatur?'') why is he exorcised?"&lt;ref&gt;See J. D. C. Fisher, Christian Initiation: Baptism in the Medieval West (London, 1965), 59. The text (Keefe's text 14; Bouhot, 286) is readily available in Dorothy Bethurum's edition of the Homilies of Wulfstan (Oxford, 1957), 302-3, and less readily in Jean Michel Hanssens, Amalarii...opera 1, Studi e test 138 (1948), 235-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of the respondents answered that it was so that, with the devil sent fleeing, the entry of the Holy Spirit might be prepared for.

====In England====

On the other side of the Channel, in Anglo-Saxon England, sufflation is mentioned in Bishop [[Wulfstan (died 1023)|Wulfstan]]'s collection of Carolingian baptismal expositions, the ''Incipit de baptisma'', and in the two vernacular ([[Old English]]) [[homily|homilies]] based on it, the ''Quando volueris'' and the ''Sermo de baptismate''. The ''Incipit de baptisma'' reads: "On his face let the sign of the cross be made by exsufflation, so that, the devil having been put to flight, entry for our Lord Christ might be prepared."&lt;ref&gt;''In cuius … facie a sacerdote per exsufflationem signum crucis sit, ut effugeto diabolo, Cristo Domino nostro preparetur introitus''.

For the parallel passages in the vernacular homilies, see Homily VIIIb (p. 172, ll. 14-22) and Homily VIIIc (pp. 176-7, ll. 29-35). Wulfstan's collection draws on a variety of Carolingian sources, but in this passage quotes almost verbatim the De Ordine Baptismi of Theodulf of Orleans (yet another Alcuin-derivative reply to Charlemagne; Keefe text 16), ed. in Patrologia Latina 105:225B.&lt;/ref&gt; Among English liturgical texts proper, the 10th-century Leofric Pontifical (and Sacramentary) dictates an insufflation of baptizands, a triple insufflation of the baptismal water, and an 'exhalation' of holy oil.&lt;ref&gt;F.

This text may, however, originate on the Continent: see H. M. J. Bantin, Two Anglo-Saxon Pontificals, Henry Bradshaw Society 104 (London, 1989), xxiii-xxv. The contemporary, and genuinely English, Egbert Pontifical, from York, lacks mention of sufflation.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, the ''Salisbury Pontifical'' (BL [[Cotton MS Tiberius]] C.1) and the ''Pontifical'' of [[Thomas of Canterbury]] require insufflation of the font; the ''Missal'' of [[Robert of Jumièges]] (Canterbury) has an erased [[rubric]] where it may have done likewise, as well as having an illegible rubric where it probably directed the exsufflation of catechumens, and retaining the old ''ordo ad caticuminum ex pagano faciendum,'' complete with its sufflation ceremony; and an English ''Ordo Romanus'' (BL Cotton MS Vitellius E.12) contains a triple exsufflation of baptizands.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Henderson, ed., York Manual, 144, 136, 133, 142; H. A. Wilson, ed., The Missal of Robert of Jumiège, Henry Bradshaw Society 11 (London, 1896), 93, 98, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Various 12th-century texts include signing and triple exsufflation of the holy oil (Sarum), triple exsufflation of baptizands (the Ely, Magdalene, and Winton Pontificals), and insufflation of the font ''in modum crucis'' (Ely and Magdalene, followed by most later texts).&lt;ref&gt;See the Bainbridge Pontifical, appendix 3, 254; York Manual, 147, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Such are the origins of the late medieval sufflation rites, which were in turn retained in regularized form in post-Tridentine Catholicism.

===Sufflation in Protestantism===

Sufflation did not last long in any of the churches arising from the magisterial or radical reformations. [[Martin Luther]]'s first attempt at a baptismal liturgy, the Tauffbuchlin (Taufbüchlein) of 1523 (reprinted 1524 and 1525) did retain many ceremonies from the late Medieval ritual as it was known in Germany, including a triple exsufflation of baptizands. But in an epilogue, Luther listed this ceremony among the [[adiaphora]] — i.e., the inessential features that added nothing to the meaning of the sacrament:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The least importance attaches to these external things, namely '''breathing under the eyes,''' signing with the cross, placing salt in the mouth, putting spittle and clay on the ears and nose, anointing with oil the breast and shoulders, and signing the top of the head with chrism, vesting in the christening robe, and giving a burning candle into the hand, and whatever else … men have added to embellish baptism. For … they are not the kind of devices that the devil shuns."&lt;ref&gt;Luther's Works 53:103, Weimar Ausgabe 12:48; cited in Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lutheran Strasbourg ''Taufbüchlein'' of June 1524, composed by [[Diobald Schwartz]], assistant to Cathedral preacher [[Martin Zell]], on the basis of the medieval rite used in Strasbourg combined with elements of Luther's 1523 rite, also retains baptismal exsufflation;&lt;ref&gt;Text in F. Hubert, Die Strassburger liturgischen Ordnungen in Zeitalter der Reformation (Göttingen: Vandenhoek und Ruprecht, 1900), 25ff.; transl. in Fisher, Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period, 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt; so does [[Andreas Osiander]] in Nuremberg, in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Christian Initiation, 18. The dependence of Schwartz and Osiander on Luther appears from their use of his distinctive rubric "breathe ''under the eyes''" — not found in the medieval rites.&lt;/ref&gt;

But thereafter the practice vanished from [[Lutheranism]], and indeed from Protestantism generally. Luther's revised edition of 1526 and its successors omit exsufflation altogether, as do the Luther-influenced early reformed rites of England ([[Thomas Cranmer]]'s Prayer Book of 1549) and Sweden (the Manual of [[Olavus Petri]]), despite the former's conservative basis in the medieval Sarum ritual and the latter's strong interest in exorcism as an essential part of the baptismal ritual.&lt;ref&gt;For a handy comparison, see The Manual of Olavus Petri, 1529, ed. Eric E. Yelverton (London: SPCK, 1953), p. [110].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly in the Swiss Reformation (the Zwinglian/Reformed tradition), only the very earliest rites retain sufflation, namely the ceremony published by Leo Jud, pastor of St. Peter's in Zurich, in the same year (1523) as Luther's first baptismal manual.&lt;ref&gt;English translation in Fisher, Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period, 126ff.; discussed briefly in Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 31, and fully in H. O. Old, The Shaping of the Reformed Baptismal Rite in the Sixteenth Century (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufflation in Protestant-Roman Catholic debate===

Though sufflation does not appear in Protestant practice, it definitely appears in Protestant [[polemic]], where it is usually treated as an un-Scriptural and superstitious (i.e., in the Protestant view, a typically Roman Catholic) practice, and even one reeking of enchantment or witchcraft. It appears as such, for example in the work of [[Henry More]] (the 'Cambridge Platonist') on evil. His argument essentially reverses that of Augustine. Augustine had said to the Pelagians (to paraphrase): "you see that we exorcize and exsufflate infants before baptising them; therefore they must be tainted with sin and possessed by the devil since birth." More replies, in effect, "Infants cannot be devil-possessed sinners; therefore, ceremonial exorcism and exsufflation is presumptuous, frightening, and ridiculous," in a word "the most gross and fundamental Superstitions, that look like Magick or Sorcery":
   
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The conjuring the Devil also out of the Infant that is to be baptized would seem a frightful thing to the Infant himself, if he understood in what an ill plight the Priest supposes him, while he makes three Exsufflations upon his face, and uses an Exorcistical form for the ejecting of the foul Fiend. … And it is much if something might not appear affrightful to the Women in this approaching darkness. For though it be a gay thing for the Priest to be thought to have so much power over the [[Styx|Stygian]] Fiend, as to Exorcize him out of the Infant; yet it may be a sad consideration with some melancholick women laden with Superstition, to think they are never brought to bed, but they are delivered of a Devil and Child at once."&lt;ref&gt;Henry More, A Modest Enquiry into the Mystery of Iniquity (London, 1664), 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sufflation appears in Roman Catholic anti-Protestant polemic, as well. The relative antiquity of the practice, and its strong endorsement by the Protestants' favorite [[Church Father|Father]], Augustine, made it a natural element in Catholic arguments that contrasted the Protestant with the ancient and Apostolic church. A true church, according to Roman Catholic apologists, would be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A Church that held the exorcismes exsufflations and renunciations, which are made in baptisme, for sacred Ceremonies, and of Apostolicall tradition.... A Church which in the Ceremonies of baptisme, vsed oyle, salte, waxe, lights, exorcismes, the signe of the Cross, the word Epheta and other thinges that accompanie it; to testifie ... by exorcismes, that baptisme puts vs out of the Diuells possession.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Davy Du Perron, The reply of the most illustrious Cardinall of Perron, to the ansvveare of the most excellent King of Great Britaine (Douay. 1630) 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was argued on the grounds that some of these ceremonies were demonstrably ancient, and all of them might be.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sundry Ceremonies vsed in baptisme, and other Sacraments, as Exorcismes, Exsufflations, Christening, and the like mentioned by S. Augustine and by diuers other ancient Fathers ..., these being practised by the Primitiue Church (which is graunted to be the true Church) and compared to the customes of Protestants, and vs, in our Churches, will easily disclose, which of the two, they or we, do more imitate, or impugne the true Church of antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Humphrey Leech]]; [[Robert Persons]], Dutifull and respective considerations vpon foure seuerall heads of proofe and triall in matters of religion  ... By a late minister &amp; preacher in England (Saint-Omer, 1609), 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To which a Protestant reply was that sufflation was not ancient ''enough'', and could not be proved to be apostolic:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was plain then there was no clear Tradition  in the Question, possibly there might be a custome in some Churches postnate to the times of the Apostles, but nothing that was obligatory, no Tradition Apostolicall. But this was a suppletory device ready at hand when ever they needed it; and  S. Austin confuted the Pelagians, in the Question of Original sinne, by the custome of exorcisme and insufflation, which S. Austin said came from the Apostles by Tradition, which yet was then, and is now so impossible to be prov'd, that he that shall affirm it, shall gaine only the reputation of a bold man and a confident."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Taylor, Treatises of 1. The liberty of prophesying, 2. Prayer ex tempore, 3. Episcopacie : together with a sermon preached at Oxon.... (London, 1648), 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sufflation was judged by Protestant critics to be irrational, mysterious, and obscure, an increasingly important factor by the close of the 17th century and the dawn of [[the Enlightenment]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mystery prevail'd very little in the first Hundred or Century of Years after Christ; but in the second and third, it began to establish it self by Ceremonies. To Baptism were then added the tasting of Milk and  Honey,  Anointing, the Sign of the Cross, a white Garment, &amp;amp;c. ... But in later times there was no end of Lights, Exorcisms, Exsufflations, and many other Extravagancies of Jewish, or Heathen Original ... for there is nothing like these in the Writings of the Apostles, but they are all plainly contain'd in the Books of the Gentiles, and was the Substance of their Worship."&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, Christianity Not Mysterious, Or, A Treatise Shewing that there is Nothing in The Gospel Contrary to Reason, nor Above it and that no Christian Doctrine can be Properly Call'd a Mystery (London, 1696), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was said to be a human invention, imposed by the arbitrary whim of a tyrannical prelate against the primitive Gospel freedom of the church:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Some bishop] ... taking it into his head that there ought to be a trine-immersion in baptism; another the signation of the cross; another an unction with oil; another milk and honey, and imposition of hands immediately after it; another insufflation or breathing upon the person's face to exorcise the Devil... Thus, I say, that inundation of abominable corruptions, which at present overwhelms both the Greek and Romish Churches, gradually came in at this very breech which you are now zealously maintaining, namely, the Bishop's Power to decree rites and ceremonies in the Church."&lt;ref&gt;[[Micaiah Towgood]], A dissent from the Church of England fully justified, 5th ed. (London, 1779),&lt;!-- ECCO id no. CW3321486367--&gt; p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
To all of which, Roman Catholic apologists replied that insufflation was not only ancient and Apostolic, but had been practiced by Christ himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When he [Christ] had said this he breathed upon them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Ghost...." When the Pastors of our Church use the Insufflation or Breathing upon any, for the like mystical Signification, you cry aloud, Superstition, Superstition, an apish mimical action, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;James Mumford, The Catholic scripturist, or the plea of the Roman Catholics, 4th ed. (London(?), 1767),&lt;!-- ECCO doc number CW3320627310--&gt; p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Prospects===

Though liturgical sufflation is almost gone, at least from the Western churches, its revival is not inconceivable. Liturgical renewal movements always seem to look to the 'classic' catechumenate of the 4th and 5th centuries for inspiration.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Insufflation has indeed been re-introduced into the Catholic "new catechumenate." But many ceremonies dating from that or the medieval period have been re-imported even into Protestant rites during the last couple of decades.  Perhaps even more likely is a revival in the context of the growth of the [[Roman Catholicism in Africa|Roman Catholic Church in Africa]] and [[Roman Catholicism in Asia|in Asia]], where locally and culturally meaningful ceremonies have often revolutionized practice, and where the exorcistic function of baptism has taken on a new vitality. For example, a pure insufflation is apparently practiced in the [[Philippine Independent Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jagger, Christian Initiation 1552-1969... (London, 1970), 292. This is basically a Roman rite with some Anglican-like features.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spinks mentions a pre-baptismal ceremony used by the [[Christian Workers' Fellowship]] of [[Roman Catholicism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], in which the candidates are struck with a cane and their faces are breathed upon.&lt;ref&gt;Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 203, citing Francis Wickremesinghe, "An Asian Inculturation of the Baptismal Liturgy," in David R. Holeton, ed., Growing in Newness of Life (Toronto: Anglican Book Centre, 1993), 213-217.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the latter represents a revival of historical sufflation, or a wholly new ceremony derived from local custom.

==Significance and associations==

There were at least three kinds of association that particularly influenced how liturgical sufflation came to be understood: [[Biblical]] antecedents; liturgical setting; and extra-liturgical (cultural) analogs.

===Biblical antecedents===

Three Biblical passages recur repeatedly with reference to insufflation narrowly defined, all of them referring to some kind of life-giving divine breath. The first and most commonly cited is {{bibleverse||Genesis|2:7}} (echoed by {{bibleverse||Wisdom|15:11}} and {{bibleverse||Job|33:4}}), in which God first creates man and then breathes into him the breath of life, in order to give him (as the passage was later interpreted) a human soul.&lt;ref&gt;"His life is of less worth than clay, because he failed to know the one who formed him and inspired him with an active soul and breathed into him a living spirit [Vulg. 'insufflavit ei spiritum vitalem']" Wisdom 15:10-11 (RSV); "The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life" Job 33:4 (RSV). Cp. Psalm 33:6.&lt;/ref&gt; The second passage, {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|37:9}}, reinterprets the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] passage prophetically, in foreseeing God resurrecting the dead bones of exiled [[Israelites|Israel]] by means of his life-giving breath.&lt;ref&gt;"Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain [Vulg. 'insuffla super interfectos istos'], that they may live.... And the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet" Ezekiel 37:9-10 (RSV).&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, in {{bibleverse||John|20:22}}, Christ is represented as conveying the [[Paraclete]] to his disciples, and so initiating the commissioned church, by breathing on them, here too, very possibly, with implicit reference to the original creation.&lt;ref&gt;"He breathed [on them?] [Vulg. ''insufflavit''] and said to them, 'receive the Holy Spirit'" John 20:22 (RSV).&lt;/ref&gt; The two passages were connected explicitly in later Christian exegesis: the same breath that created man re-created him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Insufflation] signifies, To blow into, Gen. 2. 7. This sheweth mans soul not to be of the earth, as his body was, but of nothing, by the insufflation of God, and so differing from the spirit of beasts, Eccl. 3. 21. This word is used also, when Christ to make men new creatures, inspired his Apostles with the holy Ghost, Joh. 20. 21."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Wilson (lexicographer)|Thomas Wilson]], ed. John Bagwell, ''A complete Christian dictionary wherein the significations and several acceptations of all the words mentioned in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are fully opened, expressed, explained ...'' (London, 1661) p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Lord God, saith the Text, formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his Nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living Soul. His Body made of Earth, but his Soul the Breath of God. … We must not understand it grosly; for so Breath is not attributable unto God, who is a simple and perfect Spirit; but … as a figurative expression of God's communicating unto Man that inward Principle, whereby he lives and acts, not only in common with, but in a degree above other Animals. … The Learned P. Fagius takes notice of three things in the Text of Moses, which do conclude the Immortality of the Soul of Man. I. ''Insufflatio illa Dei:'' This Inspiration from God spoken of: For he that breaths into another, contributes unto him ''aliquid de suo'' somewhat of his own: And therefore, saith he, when our B. Saviour would communicate his Spirit to his Disciples, he did it with Insufflation, breathing on them, thereby to signifie, ''se Divinum &amp; de suo quiddam illis contribuere'' [i.e., that he was himself divine and was infusing something of his own into them]."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Camfield, A theological discourse of angels and their ministries wherein their existence, nature, number, order and offices are modestly treated of … . (London, 1678) 184-185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The associations with creation, rebirth, initiation, and revivification created by these passages of  Scripture suited insufflation for a role in baptism as it has been most commonly regarded: as figuring the waters of creation (over which the Spirit brooded); as figuring the womb of rebirth; and as figuring (in [[Saint Paul]]'s metaphor) the tomb, into which the Christian joins Christ in descending, and from which the Christian likewise joins Christ in ascending, dead to the old life but made alive again in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 6:3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also Biblical antecedents for exsufflation, properly speaking, that is, exorcistic blowing, especially the numerous [[Old Testament]] passages in which "the breath of God" is the vehicle or symbol not of life but of death and destruction — an expression of the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]]: "by the breath of God they perish / and by the blast of his anger they are consumed" (Job 4:9, RSV).&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Isaiah 11:4 ("with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked").&lt;/ref&gt; The same power is attributed metaphorically to Christ: "The lawless one will be revealed, and the Lord [[Jesus]] will slay him with the breath of his mouth" (2 Thessalonians 2:8, RSV). Even less obvious passages could be associated with liturgical exsufflation. [[Jesse of Amiens]], for example, interprets Psalm 34 (Vulg. 35):5 as descriptive of the fate of exsufflated devils: ""Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them on!"&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 34:5 (RSV) (Vulg. 35:5); Jesse of Amiens, Patrologia Latina 105:786D.&lt;/ref&gt; And the [[apocrypha]]l [[Acts of Thomas]] describes a baptismal ceremony which, though it does not explicitly contain a breathing ceremony, may imply one, "Let the gift come by which, breathing upon thine enemies, thou didst make them draw back and fall headlong, and let it dwell in this oil, over which we name thy holy name."&lt;ref&gt;Acts of Thomas, §157; trans. in New Testament Apocrypha, ed. Edgar Hennecke; rev. by Wilhelm Schneemelcher; trans. R. McL. Wilson (Cambridge, 1992), 2:401. The Biblical allusion is apparently to John 18.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

God's breath can be fiery, consuming all it touches: "I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath" (Ezekiel 21:31, RSV).&lt;ref&gt;Vulg. "In igne furoris mei sufflabo in te." Cp. the fiery brimstone breath of God in Isaiah 30:33.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the interpretations of exsufflation may reflect this. Cyril of Jerusalem, for example, when he discusses exsufflation in his [[catechetical]] sermons, interprets the liturgical practice in terms of fire:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The breathing of the saints and the invocation of the name of God, like fiercest flame, scorch and drive out evil spirits."&lt;ref&gt;Catechesis XX.3, Patrologia Graeca 33:1079/80; trans. Gifford, 147. In the pre-catechetical lectures he seems to combine the fire of God's wrath and the Biblical motif of the refiner's fire (Malachi 3:2, 1 Peter 1:7, Revelation 3:18): "as the goldsmith..., as it were breathing on the gold which is hid in the hollow of the forge, stimulates the flame it acts upon and so obtains what he is seeking; so also exorcizers..., setting the soul on fire in the crucible of the body, make the evil spirit flee." Procatechesis §9; ed. F. L. Cross, 5-6 (Patrologia Graeca 33:347/8-349/350); trans. Cross, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fire remains a theme in later liturgical exorcisms, for devils, as [[Nicetas of Remesiana|Nicetas]] is reported to have said, "are purged by exorcisms as by fire":&lt;ref&gt;Nicetas quoted in Bouhot, De catechizandis rudibus, 225 (§67).&lt;/ref&gt; "we come against you, devil, with spiritual words and fiery speech; we ignite the hiding places in which you are concealed."&lt;ref&gt;Liber Ordinum, ed. Férotin, 75; trans. in Kelly, 248 (cp. 237-37). Cp. Lambot, North Italian Services, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical context===

More importantly, perhaps, fire is physically and symbolically associated with sufflation because of the traditional placement of baptism within the [[Paschal vigil]] — a setting heavy with symbolism of light and fire: the blessing of the Paschal candle, the lighting of the "new fire," and the singing of the ''[[Exultet]]'' and the ''[[Lumen Christi]].'' The intimate connection between divine breath and divine fire appears in its most visually arresting form during the [[benediction]] of the font, in which, according to most orders, the candle is dipped in the font while the priest declares the power of the Holy Spirit to have descended into the water: the sufflation of the font in most cases directly precedes or accompanies the immersion of the candle.&lt;ref&gt;Amalarius, Liber Officialis, I.xxv.2 (ed. Hanssens, 2:134-5) and I.xxvi (2:136-8); the Gellone Sacramentary, ed. Dumas, 99 (§704d); many manuscripts of the Hadrianum (ed. Deshusses 1:188, §374e); Ordo Romanus L xxxix.50 (ed. Andrieu 5:280-1); the Missal of Robert of Jumiège, 98-9; the York Manual, 15, 136*, 144*, 149*, 153*; Suntrup, 417-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Their close association can again be illustrated from Wulfstan's baptismal homilies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By the breath that the priest breathes into the font when he blesses it, the devil is straightway driven out from it. And when the priest dips the consecrated candle in the water, then that water forthwith becomes imbued with the Holy Ghost."&lt;ref&gt;Wulfstan, Homily VIIIb (ed. Bethurum, p. 173, ll. 39-43); cp. Homily VIIIa (p. 170, ll. 36-40) and Homily VIIIc (p. 179, ll. 73-6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar considerations bind sufflation closely to imagery of light and darkness, specifically of the movement of the baptizand from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light (a very common theme), and to the sign of the cross (a very common action), among others that could be mentioned. John the Deacon uses light-dark imagery to explain exsufflation in exorcism as a transition:

  &lt;blockquote&gt;The exsufflated person is exorcised so that ... having been delivered from the power of darkness, he might be translated into the kingdom ... of God.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmart, 172; thence also in many of the Carolingian expositions, e.g. in Keefe's tet 32, ed. Friedrich Stegmüller, "Bischof Angilmodus über die Taufe...," Römische Quartalschrift für Christliche Altertumskunde und Kirchengeschichte 52 (1957): 20; and text 25, the tract by Archbishop Liedrad of Lyons, Patrologia Latina 99:856D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
So also Augustine ("The church exsufflates and exorcises [infants] that the power of darkness might be cast out from them"&lt;ref&gt;Contra Julianum (opus imperf.) 1.50, ed. Michaela Zelzer, [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 85/1 (Vienna, 1974), 43 (Patrologia Latina 45:1073) Cp. 3.182, CSEL 85/1, 482 (PL 45:1323); the Contra Julianum 1.4.14 (PL 44:649), 1.5.19 (PL 44:653), 3.3.8 (PL 44:705), 3.5.11 (PL 44:707-8), and 6.5.11 (PL 44:828-9); and the Ennarationes in Psalmos 76.4, ed. E. Dekkers and J. Fraipont, CCSL 39 (1956), 1055.&lt;/ref&gt;), and Isidore ("The power of the devil is ... exsufflated in them, so that ... being delivered from the power of darkness, [they] might be translated unto the kingdom of their Lord"&lt;ref&gt;De ecclesiastics officiis, II.xxi.3, ed. C. M. Lawson,  CCSL 113 (1989), 96/20-24 (PL 83:815A), and thence into various Carolingian texts, e.g. the Pseudo-Maxentius Collectanea (= Keefe text 37), PL 106:54C.&lt;/ref&gt;).

And as regards signation (the sign of the cross), in Western texts from as early as the [[Gelasian Sacramentary]], the one gesture almost always precedes (or precedes and follows) the other,&lt;ref&gt;Mohlberg, Sacramentarium Gelasianum 93 (§598) ("exsufflas in faciem eius et facis ei crucem in fronte"); the same doublet is applied to the baptismal water in the Gellone Sacramentary, ed. A. Dumas, Liber Sacramentorum Gellonensis, CCSL 159 (1981), 335 (§2317-18) and 346 (§2379), and in the North Italian rituals, ed. Lambot, 33. Signing precedes and follows in the Missale Gothicum, ed. Neale, 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; and their significance is often complementary if not identical. In [[Raban Maur]]'s discussion of the baptismal liturgy, for example, the exsufflation is said to expel the devil, the signing to keep him from coming back.&lt;ref&gt;Alois Knöpfler, ed., Rabani Mauri de institutione clericorum, Veröffentlichungen aus dem kirchen-historischen Seminar München 5 (Munich, 1900), I.xxvii, p. 48 (PL 107:311D-12A).&lt;/ref&gt; The two signs are frequently combined, the blowing done in the form of a cross, e.g. in the [[Syriac Chritianity|Syriac Rite]] described by [[James of Edessa]],&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, Documents, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; in the modern Coptic rite,&lt;ref&gt;Lodi, 1557&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 9th-century ''Ordo Romanus XXXI'',&lt;ref&gt;Andrieu, 3:502, §80 ("Anhelet in modum cruce").&lt;/ref&gt; in Wulfstan's Anglo-Saxon homilies and their [[Continental Europe|Continental]] sources,&lt;ref&gt;Wulfstan, Homilies (ed.

==Extra-liturgical (hagiographic and magical) use==

===Patristic period===

There are hints in some of the Church Fathers that Christians had a habit of breathing (or hissing) at evil spirits as a recognized act of revulsion or repulsion, even apart from the ceremonies of the church. [[Tertullian]] is perhaps the best witness. He seems to be talking about an extra-liturgical casting out of demons by means of exsufflation and signing when he declares that gods rejected by Christians are driven from the bodies of men "by our touch and by our breath," and are thus "carried away by the thought and vision of the fire [of judgment]."&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Apologeticus, 23.15-16, ed. Henricus Hoppe, CSEL 69 (1939), 67; trans. by [[A. Souter]], Apology (Cambridge, 1917), 82/83. Cp. De Anima, 1.5, ed. J. W. Ph. Borleffs, CCSL 2 (1954), 782.&lt;/ref&gt; He is talking about an ordinary gesture of aversion when he asks a Christian incense-dealer (regarded as hypocritical because he sells incense for [[polytheism|polytheistic]] altars), "with what mouth, I ask, will he spit and blow before the fuming altars for which he himself provided? with what constancy will he [thus] exorcise his foster children?"&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, De idolatria XI.7, ed. and tr. [[J. H. Waszink]] and J. C. M. Van Winden, Vigiliae Christianae Supplements 1 (Leiden, 1987), 42-5 (commentary, 210); also ed. J. W. Ph. Borleffs, CCSL 2 (1954), 111; trans. S. Thelwall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, 3:68.&lt;/ref&gt; And his remarks to his wife about the dangers of mixed marriage suggest that exsufflation was a distinctively Christian practice:{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;!--see talk--&gt; "[If you marry again, to a non-Christian,] shall you escape notice when you sign your bed or your body? when you blow away some impurity? When even by night you rise to pray?"&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Ad uxorem suam II.v.3, ed. and trans. Claude Munier, Tertullien: "A son Epouse," Sources Chrétiennes 273 (Paris, 1980), 138 (CCSL 1 (1954), 389; PL 1:1296); trans. Thelwall, Ante-Nicene Fathers 4:46.&lt;/ref&gt;

If such a custom did exist, it would clarify certain remarks by other Fathers, which might otherwise seem merely metaphorical. [[Eusebius]], for example, says of the saints that they were men "who though they only breathed and spoke, were able to scatter the counsels of evil demons."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' VII.x.4, ed. Eduard Schwartz, Eusebius Werke 2.2, Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte, 9 (Leipzig, 1908), 650 (Patrologia Graeca 20:659/60); trans. Arthur C. McGiffert, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, 1:298.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] describes the right response to [[Gnostic]] doctrine as "reviling" (καταφυσησαντας; literally ''exsufflantes'').&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' 1.16.3, ed. A. Rousseau and Louis Doutreleau, Contre les Hérésies 1, Sources Chrétiennes 263 (Paris, 1978), 262-3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], speaking of resisting temptation, not of baptism, says that "the mere breathing of the exorcist becomes as a fire to that unseen foe."&lt;ref&gt;Catechesis 16.19, Patrologia Graeca 33:945/6A-B; trans. Gifford, Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, 7:120.&lt;/ref&gt; And Augustine's remarks about blowing on [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|images of the emperor]] suggest that the significance of the gesture was well enough established to be actionable: "Of the great crime of [[Law of majestas|lese majesty]] ... is he held guilty, according to the laws of this world, who blows upon an image ... of the emperor."&lt;ref&gt;Contra Julianum, opus imperf. 3.199, CSEL 85/1:498 (PL 45:1333).&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as [[Bede]], we may suspect that "exsufflate" in the sense of "revile" or "cast off" may be a living metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Historia ecclesiastica, in Charles Plummer, ed., Baedae opera historica (Oxford, 1896), 1:2231 and 1:7; cp. 2:226n.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hagiography==

The extremely influential ''Life of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]]'' by [[Sulpicius Severus]] seems to have set in motion a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] tradition in which saints cast out demons or repel tempting devils by blowing at them.&lt;ref&gt;Vita Sancti Martini, ed. Carl Halm, CSEL 1.206-7 (cp. the Old English version in [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric]], Lives of the Saints, ed. W. W. Skeat, EETS 76 (1890), 292-3 (II.xxxi.42)).&lt;/ref&gt; Of Saint [[Pachomius]], for example, it is said that "defending his brow with the sign of the cross, he blew upon [the demon] and immediately he fled … ; blowing upon him, he said, 'depart from me, devil.'"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in a note to Benedict of Aniane's Concordia regularum, PL 103:1020C-D.&lt;/ref&gt; And of [[Saint Goswin]] that "a demon stood before Saint Goswin saying 'surely you see that I am Christ …' and … therefore Saint Goswin exsufflated vigorously, saying 'depart foe …,' and immediately … the devil vanished."&lt;ref&gt;Anecdota ex codicibus hagiographicis Iohannis Gielemans canonici regularis in rubea valle prope Bruxelles, ed. Hagiographi Bollandiani (Brussels, 1895), 23 (Sanctilogium 9.2).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyprian and Justina|Saint Justina]] is reported to have similarly unmasked a series of increasingly subtle and powerful demons, finally melting the prince of demons himself: "blowing upon the devil, she immediately melted him like wax and … felt herself freed from all temptation."&lt;ref&gt;Th. Graese, ed., Jacobi Voragine Legenda Aurea …, 3rd ed. (Vratislaviae, 1890), cap. cxlii (p. 634; cp. 633).&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Saint Felix]] is said to have destroyed [[Cult image|idols]] and uprooted [[sacred tree]]s by like means.&lt;ref&gt;Graesse, ed., Legenda Aurea, cap. cxxvi (p.575) and cap. xix (102-3).&lt;/ref&gt;

The breath of the saints was credited with healing, as well as exorcistic, powers from an early period. [[Gregory of Nyssa]] says of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]] ('Gregory the magician') that he needed to resort to "no finicking  and laborious" magic, but "there sufficed, for both the casting out of demons and the healing of bodily ailments, the breath of his mouth."&lt;ref&gt;PG 46:943/4A.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar powers are attributed to the Irish saints: kindling lamps, curing dumbness.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Plummer, ed., Vitae Sanctorum Hiberniae (Oxford, 1910), 1:clxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme, too, persists in later hagiographic and quasi-hagiographic texts, appearing, for example in the ''Estoire del saint graal'' as the agency by which a madman is miraculously restored. Among English texts, Felix's ''Life of [[Saint Guthlac]]'' relates that in order to give relief to a boy afflicted by madness, he "washed him in the water of the sacred font and, breathing into his face the breath of healing [or 'spirit of salvation'], drove away from him all the power of the evil spirit,"&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Colgrave, ed. and trans., Felix's Life of Saint Guthlac (Cambridge, 1956), 130/31.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the difficulty of distinguishing healing from exorcism in an era in which madness was attributed to demonic possession. The miracle that Bishop John performed, according to [[Bede]], on behalf of [[Herebald]], is another example, since it involved a sufflation that was seemingly exorcistic, catechetical, and curative simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, Historia ecclesiastica 5.6 (Plummer, 291; see also B. Colgrave and R. A. B. Myonrs, Bede's Ecclesastical History (Oxford, 1969), 468 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magic and folk medicine==

[[Tertullian]] remarked to his wife about Christian practices: "will you not seem to be doing magic?" in the eyes of a non-believer.&lt;ref&gt;Ad uxorem II.v.3 (ed. Munier, 138). For additional references to blowing in ancient magic, see Waszink's and Van Winden's notes to Tertullian's De idolatria, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Celsus]] (according to [[Origen]]) reports the use of exsufflation by Egyptian magicians.&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' 1.68, ed. Marcel Borret, Origène: "Contre Celse," 1, Sources Chrétiennes 132 (Paris, 1967), 266 (PG 11:787/788A).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plotinus]] seems to attack its use by Roman ones.&lt;ref&gt;Plotinus, Enneads, II.ix.14, ed. and trans. [[A. H. Armstrong]], Loeb Classical Library, vol. 2 (Cambridge, Mass., 1966), pp. 278/9.&lt;/ref&gt; One of [[Lucian]]'s tall tales mentions a Chaldean pest-control sorcerer who causes toads and snakes to vanish by blowing on them.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Macleod, ed., Luciani opera, vol. 2 (Oxford, 1974), 182; trans. in "The Liar," The Works of Lucian of Samosata, trans. H. W. and F. G. Fowler, vol. 3 (Oxford, 1905), 236.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is possible to see Jesus himself as a supernatural healer (Christ Jesus the son of God), in many popular events of [[the holy Bible]], in which he is constantly healing many blind, lame, crippled, lepers, maimed, and even causing his own resurrection, just to name a few. In one instance Jesus used his spit to heal the eyes of a blind man who was born blind, caused by his parents sins;&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of John, KJV text, John 9:1-9:11.&lt;/ref&gt;
. However, regarding magic, in Syria, where ceremonial breathing became formalized as part of the rite of visitation of the sick. [[Ephraem Syrus]] advises that "if medicine fails you when you are sick, the 'visitors' will help, will pray for health, and one of them will breathe in your mouth, the other will sign you [with the sign of the cross]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Döger, Exorzismus, 125n.&lt;/ref&gt;

If it was either originally Christian (citation needed), Catholic or from the pagan practices, almost similar methods of healing have been reported, continuing until modern times: in Westphalia, the healing of a wound by triple signing and triple cruciform sufflation, or by exsufflation accompanied by a rhyming charm; and in Holland the alleviation of toothache by similar means.&lt;ref&gt;Dölger, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Drechsler, "Illnesses were blown away by the breath. If a child had bumped himself, one would blow three times on the place and it would 'fly away.'"&lt;ref&gt;Paul Drechsler, Sitte, Brauch, und Volksglaube im Schlesien, vol. 2 (Leipzig, 1906), 280. Cp. 298 and chapter 14, ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; Burns, and conditions that in some fashion resemble burns, such as fevers, boils, sore throats and rashes, are naturally the most common objects of blowing among modern folk-remedies,&lt;ref&gt;See HddA, i, ''s.v.'' "Blasen," cols. 1357-58. See also from the Puckett collections nos. 6943, 8329, and 8401 (alleviation of a burn); 2750, 2889, 2890, 10566, and 2898 (thrush and sore mouth); and 9277 and 9279 (erysipelas): Popular Beliefs and Superstitions: A Compendium of American Folklore from the...Collection of Newbell Niles Puckett, ed. Wayland D. Hand, Anna Casetta, and Sondra B. Thiederman, 3 vols. (Boston, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; for example the Shetland cure that requires blowing on a burn three times while reciting the charm "Here come I to cure a burnt sore. / If the dead knew what the living endure, / The burnt sore would burn no more."&lt;ref&gt;[[T. F. Thiselton-Dyer]], ''English Folklore'', 2nd rev. ed. (London, 1880), 170.&lt;/ref&gt; But everything from jaundice, convulsions, and colic to bad luck and evil spells can apparently be alleviated by a bit of blowing.&lt;ref&gt;HddA, ''loc. cit.''; cp. also the Puckett collection, nos. 23714, 23956, 23957, 9215, 25571, 19545, 9563, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolters points out that exorcistic blowing was still (in 1935) found in the custom of blowing over bread that is about to be eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Wolters cites Drechsler 2:15, a passage that describes how to avert the bad luck of biting into a piece of bread already bitten.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Syrian blows over his child to avert the evil eye. Some still&lt;br/&gt;blow three times over a strange spoon before using it, and in Alaska the medicine&lt;br/&gt;man blows into the nose and mouth of a patient to drive out the daemon of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier F. M. G. Wolters, Notes on Antique Folklore on the basis of Pliny's "Natural History" Bk. XXVIII.22-29 (Amsterdam, 1935), 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
Finally, in one American example of superstition clearly derived from liturgical use, it is said that if at the baptism of a baby one turns at the door and blows three times, one can successfully prevent the devil from ever coming between the baby and the altar.&lt;ref&gt;Puckett Collection, no. 3294 (reported from Cleveland, Ohio, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lake Kenozero.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Kenozero]] at Kenozersky National Park]]

'''Kenozersky National Park''' ({{lang-ru|Кенозерский национальный парк}}) is a [[national park]] in the north of [[Russia]], located in [[Kargopolsky District|Kargopolsky]] and [[Plesetsky District]]s of [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]]. It was established December&amp;nbsp;28, 1991. Since 2004, the National Park has the status of the [[UNESCO]] [[Biosphere Reserve]].

== History ==

Kenozero was always a remote area. In the 19th century, the area was divided between [[Pudozhsky Uyezd]] (west) and [[Kargopolsky Uyezd]] (east) of the [[Olonets Governorate]]. In [[Soviet Union]], after a number of administrative changes, the area ended up in the Arkhangelsk Oblast. In 1950s—1980s, as everywhere in Russian North, the area suffered severely from depopulation, in particular, all villages between [[Lake Lyokshmozero]] and [[Lake Kenozero]] were deserted.

In 1991, the decision was taken to create a National Park in the area. All historical monuments were transferred to the park administration, and some of them have been restored. December&amp;nbsp;28, 1991 the park was officially created. The staff of the park at the time of creation was 7 persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenozero.ru/o-parke/1991-god.html|title=1991 год|publisher=ФГУ НП «Кенозерский»|language=Russian|accessdate=13 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325162039/http://www.kenozero.ru/o-parke/1991-god.html|archivedate=25 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 it was increased to 35 persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenozero.ru/o-parke/1992-god.html|title=1992 год|publisher=ФГУ НП «Кенозерский»|language=Russian|accessdate=13 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325162054/http://www.kenozero.ru/o-parke/1992-god.html|archivedate=25 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1993 to 153.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenozero.ru/o-parke/1993-god.html|title=1993 год|publisher=ФГУ НП «Кенозерский»|language=Russian|accessdate=13 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325162123/http://www.kenozero.ru/o-parke/1993-god.html|archivedate=25 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the park became a [[UNESCO]] [[Biosphere Reserve]].

== Location and geography ==

Kenozersky National Park occupies the south-western part of [[Plesetsky District]] and the north-western part of [[Kargopolsky District]] of the [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]], at the border with the [[Republic of Karelia]]. The northern part of the Park is centered at the [[Lake Kenozero]], one of the biggest lakes of the region. The headquarters of the Park are located in the village of [[Vershinino, Arkhangelst Oblast|Vershinino]], on the northern shore of the lake. The Lake Kenozero is the source of the [[Kena River]], a major left tributary of the [[Onega River|Onega]]. The upper course of the Kena is located in the park, as well as the [[Pocha River]], the major tributary of the Lake Kenozero, its source, [[Lake Pochozero]], and the lower course of the main tributary of the Lake Pochozero, the [[Undosha River]].

The southern part contains [[Lake Lyokshmozero]] and the upper course of the [[Lyokshma River]], a tributary of [[Lake Lacha]]. Lakes Lyokshmozero and Kenozero are separated by a number of lesser lakes, including Lake Naglimozero and Lake Vilno.

Some areas along the Karelian border drain into the basin of the [[Vodla River|Vodla]], and eventually to the [[Baltic Sea]]. Thus, the park contains the portion of the divide between the basins of Atlantic and Arctic oceans.

== Tourism ==

The park contains natural as well as cultural monuments, and is also oriented at [[ecotourism]]. A number of trails have been opened in the park.

There are several wooden architecture monuments. One of them is [[Porzhensky Pogost]] in the western part of the park, which is the ensemble of St. George church with the bell-tower (both from the 18th century) surrounded by the wooden wall with gates and towers (1789). The villages adjacent to Porzhensky Pogost have been deserted, and there is no road heading to it, so that the Pogost is only accessible via a pedestrian trail.

There are two roads into the park. In the southern part, south of [[Lake Lyokshmozero]], there is an unpaved road connecting [[Kargopol]] and [[Pudozh]]. Another road in the northern part of the park branches off from the ''Onezhsky Trakt'', connecting Kargopol via [[Plesetsk]] to [[Yemetsk]]. This road runs to the village on Pershlakhta on [[Lake Kenozero]] and then connects to the other villages on and around Lake Kenozero.

'''Kiowa''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aɪ|.|ə|w|ə}} or '''Cáuijògà/Cáuijò:gyà''' (″language of the Cáuigù (Kiowa)″) is a [[Tanoan language]] spoken by the [[Kiowa|Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma]] in primarily [[Caddo County|Caddo]], [[Kiowa County, Oklahoma|Kiowa]], and [[Comanche County, Oklahoma|Comanche]] counties. The Kiowa tribal center is located in [[Carnegie, Oklahoma|Carnegie]]. Like most North American languages, Kiowa is an [[endangered language]].

== Origins ==
Although Kiowa is most closely related to the other Tanoan languages of the Pueblos, the earliest historic location of its speakers is western Montana around 1700. Prior to the historic record, oral histories, archaeology, and linguistics suggest that pre-Kiowa was the northernmost dialect of Proto-Kiowa-Tanoan, spoken at Basketmaker II Era sites. Around AD 450, they migrated northward through the territory of the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Anasazi]] and Great Basin, occupying the eastern [[Fremont culture]] region of the Colorado Plateau until sometime before 1300. Speakers then drifted northward to the northwestern Plains, arriving no later than the mid-16th century in the [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] area where the Kiowa were first encountered. The Kiowa then later migrated to the Black Hills and the southern Plains, where the language was recorded in historic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meadows|first=William C.|date=2016-07-01|title=New Data on Kiowa Protohistoric Origins|url=http://ethnohistory.dukejournals.org/content/63/3/541|journal=Ethnohistory|language=en|volume=63|issue=3|pages=541–570|doi=10.1215/00141801-3496827|issn=0014-1801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==

Colorado College anthropologist Laurel Watkins noted in 1984 based on [[Parker McKenzie]]'s estimates that only about 400 people (mostly over the age of 50) could speak Kiowa and that only rarely were children learning language. A more recent figure from McKenzie is 300 adult speakers of "varying degrees of fluency" reported by Mithun (1999) out of a 12,242 Kiowa tribal membership (US Census 2000).

The Intertribal Wordpath Society, a nonprofit group dedicated to preserving native languages of Oklahoma, estimates the maximum number of fluent Kiowa speakers as of 2006 to be 400.&lt;ref&gt;Anderton, Alice, Phd. [http://www.ahalenia.com/iws/status.html "Status of Indian Languages in Oklahoma."] ''Intertribal Wordpath Society.'' (retrieved 24 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 newspaper article estimated 100 fluent speakers.&lt;ref name="normantranscript413"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO classifies Kiowa as 'severely endangered.' It claims the language had only 20 mother-tongue speakers in 2007, along with 80 second language speakers, most of whom were between the ages of 45 and 60.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

==Classes and revitalization efforts==
The Kiowa Tribe offers weekly language classes at the Jacobson House, a non-profit Native American center in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. Dane Poolaw and Carol Williams teach the language using Parker McKenzie's method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kiowatribe.org/archives/1047 "Kiowa Language Class."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114232146/http://www.kiowatribe.org/archives/1047 |date=2011-11-14 }} ''Kiowa Tribe.'' 16 May 2011 (retrieved 26 Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Tulsa]], the [[University of Oklahoma]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], and the [[University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma]] in [[Chickasha, Oklahoma|Chickasha]] offer Kiowa language classes.

Kiowa hymns are sung at Mount Scott Kiowa United Methodist Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Alecia Gonzales (Kiowa-Apache, 1926–2011), who taught at USAO, created a Kiowa teaching grammar called ''Thaum khoiye tdoen gyah: beginning Kiowa language''.

Kiowa distinguishes six vowel qualities, with three distinctive levels of height and a front-back contrast. All six vowels may be [[Long vowel|long]] or [[Short vowel|short]], [[Oral vowel|oral]] or [[Nasal vowel|nasal]]. Four of the vowels occur as [[diphthong]]s with a high front off-glide of the form ''vowel'' + {{IPA|/j/}}.

There are 24 vowels:

Contrasts among the consonants are easily demonstrated with an abundance of minimal and near-minimal pairs. There is no contrast between the presence of an initial [[glottal stop]] and its absence.

The ejective and aspirated stops are articulated forcefully. The unaspirated voiceless stops are tense, while the voiced stops are lax.

The voiceless alveolar fricative {{IPA|/s/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ʃ]}} before {{IPA|/j/}}

|}

The lateral {{IPA|/l/}} is realized as {{IPA|[l]}} in syllable-initial position, as lightly affricated {{IPA|[ɫ]}} in syllable-final position, and slightly devoiced in utterance-final position. It occurs seldom in word-initial position.

{| class="wikitable"

|-align=center
|gúldɔ|| {{IPA|[ɡúɫdɔ]}}|| 'be red, painted'
|-align=center
|sál|| {{IPA|[sáɫ]}} || 'be hot'
|}

The dental resonants {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} are palatalized before {{IPA|/i/}}.

{| class="wikitable"
|-align=center
|tʰàlí|| {{IPA|[tʰàlʲí]}}|| 'boy'
|-align=center
|bõnî|| {{IPA|[bõʷnʲî]}}|| 'see'
|}

All consonants may begin a syllable but {{IPA|/l/}} may not occur word-initially outside of loan-words ({IPA|/la.yãn/} 'lion'). The only consonants which may terminate a syllable are {{IPA|/p, t, m, n, l, j/}}.

Certain sequences of consonant and vowel do not occur: dental and alveolar obstruents preceding {{IPA|/i/}} (*{{IPA|tʼi, tʰi, ti, di, si, zi}}); velars and {{IPA|/j/}} preceding {{IPA|/e/}} (*{{IPA|kʼe, kʰe, ke, ɡe, je}}).  These sequences do occur if they are the result of contraction:  {{IPA|/hègɔ èm hâ/ [hègèm hâ]}} 'then he got up'

The glide {{IPA|/j/}} automatically occurs between all velars and {{IPA|/a/}}, except if they are together as the result of a conjunction ({{IPA|/hègɔ á bõ:/ [hègá bõ:]}} 'then he saw them'), or in loanwords ({{IPA|[kánò]}} 'American' &gt;Sp. ''Ameri'''cano''''').

Nasalization of voiced stops operates automatically only within the domain of the pronominal prefixes: voiced stops become the corresponding nasals either preceding or following a nasal. The velar nasal that is derived from {{IPA|/ɡ/}} is deleted; there is no {{IPA|/ŋ/}} in Kiowa.

Underlying {{IPA|//ia//}} surfaces in alternating forms as {{IPA|/ja/}} following velars, as {{IPA|/a/}} following labials and as {{IPA|/iː/}} if accompanied by falling tone.

Obstruents are devoiced in two environments: in syllable-final position and following a voiceless obstruent. Voiced stops are devoiced in syllable-final position without exception. In effect, the rule applies only to {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} since velars are prohibited in final position.

The palatal glide {{IPA|/j/}} spreads across the laryngeals {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}}, yielding a glide onset, a brief moment of coarticulation and a glide release. The laryngeals {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}} are variably deleted between sonorants, which also applies across a word boundary.

== Orthography ==

Kiowa orthography was developed by native speaker [[Parker McKenzie]], who had worked with [[John Peabody Harrington|J. P. Harrington]] and later with other linguists. The development of the orthography is detailed in Meadows &amp; McKenzie (2001). The tables below show each [[orthography|orthographic]] symbol used in the Kiowa [[writing system]] and its corresponding phonetic value (written IPA).

The mid-back vowel {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is indicated by a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angbr|au}}. The four diphthongs indicate the offglide {{IPA|/j/}} with the letter {{angbr|i}} following the main vowel. Nasal vowels are indicated by underlining the vowel letter: nasal ''o'' is thus {{angbr|o&amp;#x0332;}}. Long vowels are indicated with [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] diacritics: long ''o'' is thus {{angbr|ō}}. Short vowels are unmarked. Tone is indicated with diacritics. The [[acute accent]] {{angbr|´}} represents high tone, the [[grave accent]] {{angbr|`}} indicates low tone, and the [[circumflex]] {{angbr|ˆ}} indicates falling tone, exemplified on the vowel ''o'' as {{angbr|ó}} (high), {{angbr|ò}} (low), {{angbr|ô}} (falling). Since long vowels also have tones, the vowel symbols can have both a macron and a tone diacritic above the macron: {{angbr|ṓ}} (long high), {{angbr|ṑ}} (long low), {{angbr|ō̂}} (long falling).

The palatal glide {{IPA|[j]}} that is pronounced after velar consonants {{angbr|g, c, k, q}} (which are phonetically {{IPA|/ɡ, k, kʰ, kʼ/}}, respectively) is not normally written.&lt;ref&gt;This glide is written in Harrington's vocabulary.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, a few exceptions where {{IPA|[ɡ]}} is not followed by a {{IPA|[j]}} glide, in which case an [[apostrophe]] {{angbr|’}} is written after the ''g'' as {{angbr|g’}}. Thus, there is, for example, {{angbr|ga}} which is pronounced {{IPA|[ɡja]}} and {{angbr|g’a}} which is pronounced {{IPA|[ɡa]}}. The [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is also not written as it is often deleted and its presence is predictable. A final convention is that pronominal prefixes are written as separate words instead of being attached to verbs.

Like many scripts of India, such as [[Devanagari]], the Kiowa alphabet is ordered according to mostly phonetic principles. The alphabetical order is shown in the tables above: Vowels first, then consonants, reading down the columns, left column then right.

== Morphology ==

{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

=== Nouns ===

==== Number inflection ====

Kiowa, like other Tanoan languages, is characterized by an inverse [[Grammatical number|number]] system. Kiowa has four noun classes. Class I nouns are inherently singular/dual, Class II nouns are inherently dual/plural, Class III nouns are inherently dual, and Class IV nouns are mass or noncount nouns. If the number of a noun is different from its class's inherent value, the noun takes the suffix ''-gau'' (or a variant).

{| border="2" cellpadding="5" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; line-height: 1.2em; border-collapse: collapse; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid;"
|-
! class !! singular !! dual !! plural
|-
! I
| – || – ||| -gau
|-
! II
| -gau || –  || –
|-
! III
| -gau || – || -gau
|-
! IV
| (n/a) || (n/a) || (n/a)
|}

Mithun (1999:445) gives as an example ''chē̂&amp;#x0332;'' "horse/two horses" (Class I) made plural with the addition of ''-gau'': ''chē̂&amp;#x0332;gau'' "horses". On the other hand, the Class II noun ''tṓ&amp;#x0332;sè'' "bones/two bones" is made singular by suffixing ''-gau'': ''tṓ&amp;#x0332;sègau'' "bone."

=== Verbs ===

Kiowa verbs consist of verb stems that can be preceded by prefixes, followed by suffixes, and [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporate]] other lexical stems into the verb complex. Kiowa verbs have a complex [[active–stative]] [[pronominal]] system expressed via prefixes, which can be followed by incorporated nouns, verbs, or adverbs. Following the main verb stem are suffixes that indicate tense/aspect and mode. A final group of suffixes that pertain to clausal relations can follow the tense-aspect-modal suffixes. These syntactic suffixes include [[relativizer]]s, [[subordinating conjunction]]s, and [[switch-reference]] indicators. A skeletal representation of the Kiowa verb structure can be represented as the following:

:{| style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.1em;" cellpadding="3"
! pronominal&lt;br /&gt;prefix
! -
| '''incorporated elements'''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(adverb + noun + verb)&lt;/small&gt;
! -
! VERB STEM
! -
! tense/aspect-modal&lt;br /&gt;suffixes
! -
! syntactic&lt;br /&gt;suffixes
|}

The pronominal prefixes and tense/aspect-modal suffixes are [[inflectional]] and required to be present on every verb.

==== Pronominal inflection ====

Kiowa verb stems are inflected with prefixes that indicate:

# [[grammatical person]]
# grammatical number
# [[Thematic relation|semantic roles]] of [[animate]] participants

All these of the categories are indicated for only the ''primary'' animate participant. If there is also a second participant (such as in transitive sentences), the number of the second participant is also indicated. A participant is primary in the following cases:

* A volitional [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] participant (i.e. the doer of the action who also has control over the action) is primary if it is the only participant in the clause.
* In two-participant volitional agent/non-agent clauses:
*# The non-agent participant is primary when
*#* the non-agent is not in the first person singular or third person singular AND
*#* the volitional agent is singular
*# The volitional agent participant is primary when
*#* the non-agent is in the first person singular or third person singular AND
*#* the volitional agent is non-singular

The term ''non-agent'' here refers to semantic roles including involitional agents, [[Patient (grammar)|patients]], beneficiaries, recipients, experiencers, and possessors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7725">This is a list of openly lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans (LGBT) people who have been the head of government of a country or a subnational division, such as a state, a province or a territory. To date, there have  been five openly LGBT people who have served as a national head of government, holding office in [[Iceland]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Serbia]].

Note that this list only includes politicians who were [[coming out|out]] as LGBT during part or all of their term in office. Politicians who were [[closeted]] while in office, and either came out as gay after their retirement or were outed only after their deaths, are not included.

The '''Lizza di Piastreta''', also known as '''Monorotaia di Piastreta''' ("Piastreta Monorail"), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Industrial railway|industrial]] [[monorail]] serving the [[Quarry|marble quarry]] of '''Piastreta''', in the [[Apuan Alps]], and linking it to '''Renara''', in the municipal territory of [[Massa]], [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.alpiapuane.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=202:la-lizza-di-piastreta&amp;catid=16:escursioni&amp;Itemid=28 Article on alpiapuane.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The monorail was projected in 1922 by the [[England|English]] engineer [[Charles Denham (engineer)|Charles Denham]], owner of the quarry of Piastreta.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; The line, used to carry the [[marble]] from the quarry to the valley, consisted of a single rail on wooden sleepers, on which a motorized tractor hauled a sled load. The system of the sleds was already used, for the transport of marble, also in other ''[[Via di lizza|vie di lizza]]'' (i.e. "routes of contention"),&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.appennino.tv/lappennino-e-la-storia/item/418-vie-di-lizza-sulle-alpi-apuane Vie di Lizza on the Apuan Alps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221235606/http://www.appennino.tv/lappennino-e-la-storia/item/418-vie-di-lizza-sulle-alpi-apuane |date=2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on other trials used for the ''[[lizzatura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.lanazione.it/massa_carrara/cronaca/2013/08/07/931371-lizzatura.shtml Article about the ''Lizzatura''] (''[[La Nazione]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only plant of its kind to be built, and the track was realized in the workshops of [[Sesto San Giovanni]], near [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.archeominerario.it/documenti/elenco_siti_beni_parco.PDF List of possible heritage sites in the Apuan Alps National Park (see page 5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 the course was shortened to Pianel Soprano, closing the route to Renara. Reopene in 1962, the line was active until 1975, when a road for [[truck]]s was opened.

The line is still intact, except for some portions disappeared due to erosion. The line, also named ''Lizza della Monorotaia'' or ''Monorotaia Denham'',&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.paesiapuani.it/monte%20sella%20da%20renara%20via%20monorotaia.htm Article on paesiapuani.it]&lt;/ref&gt; is part of a route of [[industrial archaeology]] and, since 2003, like many lizzas in the basin of Massa, it is included in the Archaeological Park of the Apuan Alps.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

==Route==
The monorail starts in the quarries of Piastreta (1,580&amp;nbsp;m), below the [[Sella (mount)|Sella]] mountain, and reaches Renara (310&amp;nbsp;m),&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.profiliapuani.altervista.org/itinerari/2renara_sella.htm Article on "profili apuani" website]&lt;/ref&gt; a zone near the village of [[Gronda (Massa)|Gronda]], 9&amp;nbsp;km far from [[Massa]]. From an altitude of 995 m begins its descent through a channel called "Fosso del Chiasso", where the slope reaches 90% until the end of the trail at the hill of load. In this section the rail is flanked by a staircase of 2,500 steps that allowed the miners to reach the caves.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

The '''Museo de la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público''' is an [[art museum]] located in the [[Centro (Mexico City)|historic center]] of [[Mexico City]].  It is housed in what was the Palacio del Arzobispado (Palace of the Archbishopric), built in 1530 under Friar Juan de Zumárraga on the base of the destroyed pyramid dedicated to the Aztec god [[Tezcatlipoca]]. It remained the archbishphoric until 1867 when the Finance Ministry Accountancy Department was established there.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galindo |first=Carmen|authorlink= |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Publicaciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=62–64 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern museum houses an exhibit dedicated to this god as well as a large art collection.&lt;ref name="geocities"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://es.geocities.com/ciudaddelaesperanza/SHCP.html |title= Museo de la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público.

==History==
The building was the colonial archbishop's palace and contains two stone-columned courtyards.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt;  In 1530, Friar Juan de Zumárraga became the first [[archbishop]] of [[New Spain]], which at that time included most of the Americas and the [[Philippines]]. He decided to place the [[Episcopal see|see]] in two houses near where the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|cathedral]] would later be built. After initial adaptation, two structures were added: one to cast bells and the other served as a prison. The structure continued to be modified until 1771 when it attained the appearance still seen today. The complex is topped by a [[cornice]] on with inverted  arches are combined with [[merlon]]s. Two [[estipite]] columns flank the bay of the portal, through which the highest ecclesiastical authorities of colonial times once passed.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; Remnants of the pyramid of Tezcatlipoca can be seen on the ground floor.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt; This is because of a restoration project concluded in 1997. Along with restoring the colonial building, two excavations were carried out to expose details of the pre-Hispanic structures.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

Imprisoned here was one of the first conspirators for [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican Independence]], Francisco Primo de Verdad y Ramos, who died here in 1808.&lt;ref name="GTM"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Turistica de Mexico – Distrito Federal Centro 3 |last= Bueno de Ariztegui (ed) |first=Patricia |year=1984 |publisher=Promexa |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-34-0319-0 |page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It features works done by Mexicans and foreigners living in Mexico, many of whom donated the works here in lieu of paying their taxes,&lt;ref name="SCHP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apartados.hacienda.gob.mx/cultura/apartados/museo/index.html |title= Museo de la SHCP/Palacio de Arzobispado |accessdate= 2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a program initiated in 1957 as part of an initiative to stimulate artistic activity in Mexico for Mexico. The program's foremost promoter was artist [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].&lt;ref name="Museos"/&gt;

However, the idea did not really take off until the 1970s when Jaime Saldívar, [[Inés Amor]], [[Gilberto Aceves Navarro]] repromoted Siquieros' idea, gaining backing from president [[Luis Echeverría Álvarez]] in 1975. The revived project has enjoyed enthusiastic support from contemporary artists such as [[Luis López Loza]], [[Roberto Doniz]], [[Luis Nishizawa]], [[Ángela Gurría]], [[Roger von Gunten]], [[Francisco Corzas]], [[Feliciano Béjar]], [[Francisco Capdevilla]], [[Fernando Castro Pacheco]], [[Arnaldo Coen]], [[José Luis Cuevas]], [[José Chávez Morado]] and [[Arnold Belkin]], among others, many of whom still make donations to the museum's collection. Because of this, the museum has been able to assemble exhibits of works by individuals such as [[Rodolfo Morales]], [[Rafael Coronel]], [[Manuel Felguérez]] and [[Vicente Rojo Almazán|Vicente Rojo]].&lt;ref name="Museos"/&gt; The museum also hosts temporary exhibits, mostly of contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Lonely"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39361">'''Museum integrated pest management''' is the practice of monitoring  and managing [[Pest (organism)|pest]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] information with [[pest control]] methods to prevent pest damage to [[Collection (artwork)|collections]] and [[cultural heritage]]. Preserving cultural heritage is the ultimate goal for most museum collection personnel. Museum pests come in many different forms: insects, mites, rodents, bats, birds, and fungi&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe"&gt;{{cite web|last=Monroe|first=Retz|title=Integrated Preventative Pest Management|url=http://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ippm-pest-control-paper.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two most common types are insects and fungi.&lt;ref name="(American Museum of natural History, IPM)"&gt;{{cite web|last=American Museum of natural History|title=(American Museum of natural History, IPM)|url=http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/8/integrated-pest-management|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely recommended that every museum have some form of pest control in place and monitoring system to protect their collection and that museums review their storage and museum facilities to determine how to best control and prevent pest infestations while utilizing an Integrated Pest Management plan.

==Integrated Pest Management components==
Museum IPM is a sub specialty of [[Integrated pest management]] that focuses specifically on the application in museums and cultural institutions. The primary difference between IPM and Museum IPM is that in the context of a museum, the main focus is placed on the protection of [[Collection (artwork)|collections]] from pests.

Integrated Pest Management is a ‘holistic’ approach to controlling pests” that seeks to understand what pests are attracted to, their habits, and life cycles.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State"&gt;{{cite web|last=Missouri Secretary of State|title=Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/localrecs/conservation/notes/pestmanagement.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this program is to identify what types of pests are located in the building, establish the museum's short- and long-term goals for their IPM program, and build a consensus amongst the staff.&lt;ref name="11 steps process"&gt;{{cite web|last=national parks|title=11 steps process|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/Documents/11StepIPMCard111406FrontBack.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should “consult experts if necessary and choose the most appropriate and safe control methods for (the) eradication” of the pests.&lt;ref name="NPS - Harpers Ferry Center"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Parks|title=NPS - Harpers Ferry Center|url=http://www.nps.gov/hfc/products/cons/con-faq2.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important not to panic and rush to rash decisions if a few pests are discovered. A museum should be thoughtful and plan out of their steps before taking any action.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)"&gt;{{cite web|last=national parks|title=(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated Pest Management requires the museum to allocate time and energy for the implementation and monitoring the progress of their program. An IPM program “will require the coordinated effort of all staff members to properly implement, and may initially be more expensive than traditional pest management”.&lt;ref name="(Smithsonian- Integrated Pest Management check list)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smithsonian|title=(Smithsonian- Integrated Pest Management check list)|url=http://www.si.edu/mci/downloads/articles/pests9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
The implementation of integrated pest management should be done in steps. To begin, a museum should review a floor plan of the building and determine all “doors, windows, water and heat sources, and drains”, as well as all furniture and other objects within the museum.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; The museum can place traps that have been numbered and dated throughout the building using the floor plan as a guide of potential problem areas. The location of the traps should be documented and marked on the floor plan. Once the traps are in place, they should be monitored. Detailed notes should be made on the finding in the traps, which pests are being trapped, how they are accessing the museum, and what do these trapped pests look for in a food source. After the first few months, the trap placement should be refined to insure the best outcome.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

===Isolation and quarantine of any infested cultural objects===
Before any new items or objects enter the collection storage area, the contents should be inspected for any signs of insect activity.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; If an object is found, or even thought to be infested, it should be immediately isolated and put into quarantine. The museum should next look to identify the pest and determine what type of harm the pests can cause.&lt;ref name="NPS - Harpers Ferry Center" /&gt; Infested objects should be place into sealed plastic bags before moving them into the collection area. It is important to secure the object and make sure that no other eggs or larvae fall from the object and possibly spread the infestation.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; The objects around the quarantined object should also be examined to determine the extent of the infestation.

===Monitoring and Inspection===
The museum must monitor all of their pest management programs to ensure they are effective. Routine monitoring will provide information about the points of entry, amount of insects, where they reside in the building, and what they are feeding on.&lt;ref name="(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management"&gt;{{cite web|last=(Northeast document conservation|title=(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this information, a museum will be able to identify the damaged areas and what pests are infesting the museum. The staff should be careful in the placement of these traps to ensure that they do not come into contact with objects from the collection.&lt;ref name="(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management"&gt;{{cite web|last=(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|title=(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management}}&lt;/ref&gt; When traps are placed in a new location in the building they should be checked within the first 48 hours. This will help confirm where the problem areas are located and if adjustments need to be made to the trap locations. The next step should be weekly and then monthly inspections. Once the pests have been identified and the best location confirmed, then the traps should be changed every two months, or sooner if they are full or have lost their stickiness.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management"&gt;{{cite web|last=Northeast document conservation center|title=Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the staff conducts their insect monitoring, the staff member “should use a bright flashlight during inspections, looking for live adults and larvae and the presence of shed larval skins or feces”.&lt;ref name="http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Parks|title=IPM manual|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for the museum staff to continually review all components of the pest management program and determine if adjustments are needed.

===Identification and documentation===
A key component in Integrated Pest Management for museums is the ability to identify the pests causing issues so the museum staff can establish a plan of attack to remove the pest from the building. Traps can be used to identify the pests, the extent of infestation, and determine the source of the infestation.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; All of the identification information on the pests should be documented to keep track of the pests, points of entry, and potential damage the pest may cause. Having these “records of inspection results...will help identify seasonal risk factors and areas with a high frequency of problems”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Parks Services|title=National Parks Services-IPM manual|url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should review the data and ask “can we simply remove the pest? are eggs present? what is the least damaging approach to treatment?”.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; Once a museum have this information written down and confirmed by all those involved in the program, a treatment strategy can be planned and implemented.

===Treatment action===
* '''Traps''': Traps are an important part of Integrated Pest Management and they come in different shapes, sizes, and odors.&lt;ref name="AIC 41st"&gt;{{cite web|last=AIC|title=AIC - Integrated Pest Management|url=http://www.conservators-converse.org/2013/06/41st-annual-meeting-workshop-integrated-pest-management-for-collections/|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traps will help to identify the museums pest problem, and should be periodically emptied as the dead pests will attract and be food for other pests.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; Before any treatment action is executed, it is important to consult the curator, the conservator, and review any history on the object affected.
* '''Sticky traps''': The most common traps are sticky traps or glue boards. These traps should be placed in high risk areas and will provide the museum’s staff insight into the pests that are infesting the building and “can be used to give information on the pest, an indication of their number and seasonal cycles and where they congregate … (the best place these trap are) … in corners, near doors, vents, fireplaces and other potential entry points for insects”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; Sticky traps should be inspected weekly and all findings clearly reported.
* '''Pheromone traps''': Pheromone traps have natural scents that attract a target pest group. These traps can serve as an effective warning system, and are typically also deployed with/as sticky traps. Currently pheromone traps are only available for “[[webbing clothes moth]]s, [[drug store beetle]]s, [[cigarette beetle]]s, and the [[German cockroach]], but more are being developed”.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;
* '''Light traps''': Light Traps emit ultraviolet light to attract moths and flies. Most insects are drawn towards light, but these traps should not be used on their own.&lt;ref name="(Northeast document conservation center) Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; Other traps, usually sticky traps, should be installed near light traps to help encourage and trap more pests.
* '''Chemical control of museum pests''': Pesticides should only be used as a last resort as “pesticides used in museum pest control are generally some of the same products used for household or other structural pest control”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; These chemicals can be damaging to the health to the staff and to anyone else that visits the building. Chemicals “can cause acute symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and breathing difficulty”.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; Chemicals can also cause damage to the museum’s collection such as metal corrosion, deterioration of proteins (fur, feather, leather, and wool), deterioration of paper, stiffening/softening of plastic and change the pigments.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; Pesticides will do notthing to prevent the infestation, they only kill the pests after the fact, once the damage has already been done. Museum objects should avoid direct treatment, however, if the object requires pesticides to remove pests it should be fumigated. All fumigation should be performed by a professional.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

==Common museum pests==
There are many different type of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] that can affect a museum and its collection. It will be important for the museum staff to identify the pests, as well as understand how they will act and what they will feed on. Insects will cause damage not only through their feeding habits but their tracks, tunnel and nesting habits may also cause damage. Most damage will occur when the insect is in its larva stage – when most of the feeding takes place – though some insects like booklice will continue to damage objects past the larva stage.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; Rodents can cause further damage through the increased risk of fire when they gnaw on wires.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

===[[Insects]]===
* '''Fabric pests''': There are two groups of Fabric pests that are common in museums: carpet beetles and clothes moths. These pest eat proteins like [[wool]], [[fur]], [[feathers]], dead animals and [[horn (anatomy)|horns]].&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt; These pests are known to burrow into materials such as storage bins or little used drawers.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
* '''Wood pests''': The most common wood pests are the wood boring beetle and the dry wood termites. These pest are known to attack and damage objects made of wood and often go undetected on the surface as they burrow into the wood.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;
* '''Stored product pests''': The most common stored product pests or pantry pests are the cigarette beetle and the drugstore beetle. These pests are known to infest “[[seeds]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[Food grain|grain]]s, [[spices]], [[dried fruits]], and [[vegetables]]," items which many museums include.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
* '''Moisture pests''': Moisture can be damaging not only to the building but also to the objects in the collection that “may attract a number of moisture-loving pests that can do additional damage”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; [[Mold]] is damaging on its own but it also attracts pests like [[Psocoptera]] to feed on the objects that are affected by mold. It is important for museums to keep their facilities and collection areas free from any dampness and immediately deal with leaks or possible water damage.
* '''General pests''': General pests are any household pests that enter into a building through [[window]]s, [[door]]s, cracks, and any other entrance to the museum. These pest include [[cockroaches]], [[rodents]], [[silverfish]], and [[ants]] and will cause damage to the museum and their objects. The most common damage occurs from the [[nest]]ing and feeding behaviors.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

===Rodents===
It will become apparent if your museum has a rodent infestation as the pests leave behind droppings and gnaw marks. [[Rodents]] will breed rapidly and begin shredding and nest in objects they come into contact with. It is important to note that rodents “will not discriminate between valuable objects, packing or rubbish”.&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives"&gt;{{cite web|last=David Pinniger &amp; Peter Winsor|title=Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives|url=http://formacaompr.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/ipm_guide-pestes.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to never use rodent bait, because “poisoned  rodents often crawl away and die in unreachable areas such as between walls and under furniture, and their carcasses provide food for other pests”.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; Traps should be used to remove rodents from the museum in a more humane manner that will prevent the rodents from attracting more pests or causing larger problems.

===Birds===
[[Birds]] can cause damage to the exterior of the museum when they roost or nest on “windowsills, ledger, and other architectural features”.&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives" /&gt; Bird droppings can cause staining and damage to the building and any fabric attached to the building. Museum staff will also need to be careful when they are around birds and items infested by birds as they can “pose a health hazard to humans … as (they) carry [[parasites]] and [[disease]]”.&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives" /&gt; Bird droppings can also be tracked into the museum and collection space, and by working to remove the birds from entrances, the tracking of the droppings can be controlled.

===Bats===
[[Bat]]s can cause damage and mess with their droppings.

|-
| Black Carpet Beetle||[[Attagenus unicolor]]||[[File:Attagenus unicolor.jpg|thumb|Attagenus unicolor]]
The black carpet beetle is similar to the common carpet beetle. This type of beetle attacks animal products like, feathers, furs, leather, silk, bone and hides and is known to hide along furniture.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
|-
| Book Lice or [[Psocids]]||Liposcelis sp.||[[File:Psocoptera.jpg|thumb|Psocoptera]]
Psocids or book lice infest object that are damp and/or moldy. The book lice feeds on the [[mold]] that can be found on “dried plants, insect collections, [[manuscripts]], cardboard boxes”, and the paper and starchy glues found in books.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;  
|-
| Casemaking Clothes Moth||[[Tinea pellionella]] (Linnaeus)||[[File:Tinea.pellionella.mounted.jpg|thumb|Tinea.pellionella.mounted]]
The Casemaking Clothes Moth has blurred dark spots on their wings. These moths avoid light as they prefer dark areas, such as storage rooms and closets, and "tend to live in corners or in folds of fabric”.&lt;ref name="CLOTHES MOTHS"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Kentucky Entomology|title=CLOTHES MOTHS|url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef609.asp|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casemaking Clothes Moths are known to eat stored wool, [[hair]], [[fur]], [[silk]], [[felt]], and [[feathers]].&lt;ref name="CLOTHES MOTHS"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Kentucky Entomology|title=CLOTHES MOTHS|url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef609.asp|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Cigarette beetle||[[Lasioderma serricorne]] (Fabricius)||[[File:Drugstore beetle 03.jpg|thumb|Drugstore beetle 03]]
The cigarette beetle is a stored product pest and gets its name from the [[tobacco]] it can be found living within. The beetles are attracted to dried plants and [[books]] in the collection.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
|-
| [[Drugstore Beetle]]||Stegobium paniceum (Linnaeus)||[[File:Stegobium paniceum bl.jpg|thumb|Stegobium paniceum bl]]
The drugstore beetle feeds on books and paper products within the museum collection, including a variety of foods and spices.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
|-
| [[Furniture Beetle]]||Anobium punctatum (DeGeer)||[[File:Anobium.punctatum.jpg|thumb|Anobium.punctatum]]
The Furniture beetle are similar to the common carpet beetle and the two can be easily mistaken for one another. These beetles eat a number of common materials found in a museum, including [[Turtle shell|tortoise shell]], [[fur]], [[feathers]], [[silk]], [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], [[wool]] and [[furniture]].&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;
|-
| [[German Cockroach]]||Blattella germanica (Linnaeus)||[[File:German cockroach.jpg|thumb|German cockroach]]
The [[German cockroach]] can cause damage to objects in a museum's collection by “spitting brown fluid called attar…(this) … can get stuck on artifacts and is very bad to get out”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; It is important to identify if your infestation includes young cockroaches as this means you have an infestation and nesting. If these pests have wings and legs this could be a sign that you also have [[mice]]. If this is the case, you should not use rodent bait to deal with the mice, as cockroaches are attracted to the rodent bait; it “is loaded with [[anti-coagulants]], a blood thinner which have no effect on insects …(and) … will only aggravate the roach situation”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt;
|-
| [[Larder Beetle]]||Dermestes lardarius (Linnaeus)||[[File:Klannebille topp.jpg|thumb|Klannebille topp]]
The [[larder beetle]]  are winged insects with coarse yellow hairs and usually have dark spots along their back. These beetles are known to lay eggs on other dead insects, then the larvae eats the dead insects.&lt;ref name="Larder beetle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Penn State University|title=Larder beetle|url=http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/larder-beetle|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larder Beetles are known to damage the [[furs]], [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and feather objects in the museum's collection.
|-
| [[Silverfish]]||Lepisma saccharina (Linnaeus)||[[File:LepismaSaccharina.jpg|thumb]]
[[Silverfish]] are [[nocturnal]] insects that enjoy “cool and moist conditions”.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; These insects feed on the [[starch]] from paper and wallpaper, as well as feed on dead insect parts.

==Pest prevention==
There are a number of steps that a museum can put in place to help to prevent pests within their buildings. It is important to inspect any item that is coming in the storage area such as a new accessions or loans. Museums should maintain good housekeeping and restrict food in the museum to help prevent pests in the first place. It is important for the museum to keep the environments in exhibition galleries and the collection storage areas stable with low, controlled [[humidity]] and [[temperature]].
 
A museum may also install sweeps and gaskets on exterior [[door]]s, [[Window screen|screens]] on all [[Drain (plumbing)|drains]] and [[window]]s, while also [[caulking]] all cracks in the building. Museums can make their facilities less attractive to pest by removing any plants growing near the building, cleaning the [[Rain gutter|gutter]]s, using [[sodium vapor]] lighting, minimizing [[dust]], vacuuming the floors, and eliminating clutter.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

===Routes of entry===
Pest will always find a way into your building, so it is important to determine how pests are entering your building. The location of the building should be taken into account as every "building has their own [[ecosystem]] based on their location and other historic factors".&lt;ref name="(American Museum of natural History, IPM)" /&gt; It is important to secure the exterior of the building. It does not matter how many pests you trap and kill; if there is a way for more to enter your building you will never completely remove all pests from the building. All of the cracks and holes in the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] should be sealed and repaired. All exterior trash receptacles should be placed away from the building, and plants should be at least a foot away from the building.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; Having [[grass]] growing against the building gives insects another way into the building and a place to hide and tunnel under the foundation.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt;

* Windows

All windows should be tightly sealed. Weatherstripping can be placed around the windows to insure that the window is tightly sealed.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt;

* Doors

All doors should be checked and confirmed that they are firmly on their hinges and brush sweepers are installed.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; Brush sweepers are highly effective against pests, especially rodents.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; Having sticky traps placed around the sides of doors may prevent pests and monitor what types of pests can be entering the museum.

===Storage condition===
Collection storage areas are especially at risk from pests as they can be darker, tight spaces that often go undisturbed for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; If these tight spaces are left undisturbed and unmonitored for months or years at a time, they will provide  an atmosphere for pests to nest in high quantities. All collection areas should be fully cleaned at least twice a year with regular inspections once a month.

===Water sources===
Insects and other pests are attracted to [[water]] and damp areas. Common sources of water within the building are water pipes that can be found running throughout the building for restrooms, kitchens, water fountains, custodial closets, and climate control equipment.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; Water can also be found standing on the [[roof]] or in [[basement]]. If there are any unused [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s or drains, they should be screened or sealed off to not house unwanted guests.

===Lights===
It is important to reduce the attractiveness of the building to pests, and one of the ways that this can be achieved is through the lighting. A museum should use light shields, curtains, and keep windows closed to minimize the attractiveness of entering the building.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; Any “lighting affixed to the building should be made with sodium vapor and not mercury” and should have a yellowish tint.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; [[Sodium vapor]] repels insects, and installing these lights outside of the building can help reduce the pests.

===Housekeeping===
One of the most important compotes of preventing pests is having good housekeeping skills. The building should be regularly vacuumed, mopped, and dusted, and food debris should be removed. When the museum is vacuumed, the edge tool around the furniture and baseboards should be used as pests tend to hide in these locations.&lt;ref name="Retz Monroe" /&gt; The collection storage area should be kept clean and free of clutter. Every six months the entire collection storage area should be cleaned, and every month a visual inspection should be conducted throughout the space.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt;

===Temperature and humidity===
Pests can be controlled and growth even slowed when the humidity and temperature is controlled. Humidity should be kept below a maximum of 50%.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt; In some cases the pest infestation can be directly related to the humidity and temperature within the building. The optimum temperature should around 68&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref name="Emergency Management 3.10 Integrated Pest Management" /&gt;

===Screens, caulking, and filters===
Museum can use screens, filters, and caulking to prevent the entry of pests. Screens should be placed over windows and drains. Filters should be used on all of the air vents and replaced on a regular basis. Caulk can be used to seal cracks and holes in the walls, floors, and round pipes.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

=== Food sources===
Pests can find many sources of food within a museum; “pests are normally wild creatures but they are opportunistic and if material is available that resembles their preferred natural food or nesting, they will readily adapt and possibly thrive."&lt;ref name="Museums, Libraries, Archives-Integrated pest management: A guide for museums, libraries and archives" /&gt; Food sources can range from human food, to plants and trash. Human food should be consumed in restricted area and have any food put away quickly after use. Plants can come in many forms, including potted plants, cut flowers, and dying plants. Trash should also be collected and removed from the building daily.

==Pest removal==
* Heat 
Treating an object with heat is a method used to disinfect objects by either an oven or a commercial kiln. When the internal temperature reaches “130°F for three hours it will kill any insect”; however, this kind of heat can damage veneer, damage finish of specimens, warp lumber, or melt glues.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

* Freezing 
Freezing an object is one of the best ways to disinfect and to destroy pests. This process should be done in a controlled freezer that can reach temperatures below 0&amp;nbsp;°F. “Books, mammal, ethnographic materials and bird collections have been successfully frozen for insect control,” though freezing is not always the best option for certain objects such as certain [[wood]]s, [[bone]], lacquers, some painted surfaces, and [[leather]].&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt; Before an object is frozen for one to two weeks, it should be wrapped tightly in plastic or in a plastic bag.

* Vacuuming 
Vacuuming an infested object can remove pests. It is important to ensure that the “materials are not fragile or deteriorated" if they are to be vacuumed.&lt;ref name="Missouri Secretary of State" /&gt; Vacuuming should remove all of the hatched pest, but some eggs may remain as they can be microscopic. After the object has been vacuumed, it should be placed in a plastic bag isolating the object. During the isolation, the objects should be monitored to make sure that no pests remain on the object, and after the pests life cycle is completed the cleaning process may needed to be repeated.&lt;ref name="(NPS museum handbook: chapter 5 Biological infestation)" /&gt;

* Microwave 
Microwaving an infested object is still an experimental technique but has been known to “kill cockroach, silverfish, and psocids inside books … the average infested book is microwaved on high for 20-30 seconds”.&lt;ref name="National Parks Services-IPM manual" /&gt;

'''Nationality''' is a legal relationship between an individual person and a [[sovereign state|state]].&lt;ref name="Vonk2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vonk|first=Olivier|title=Dual Nationality in the European Union: A Study on Changing Norms in Public and Private International Law and in the Municipal Laws of Four EU Member States|date=March 19, 2012|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-04-22720-2|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the state. What these rights and duties are varies from state to state.&lt;ref name="Weis1979"&gt;Weis, Paul. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSLGDXqXeegC&amp;pg=PA29 Nationality and Statelessness in International Law]''. BRILL; 1979 [cited 19 August 2012]. {{ISBN|9789028603295}}. p. 29–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Customary international law|custom]] and international conventions, it is the right of each state to determine who its nationals are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eudo-citizenship.eu/InternationalDB/docs/Convention%20on%20certain%20questions%20relating%20to%20the%20conflict%20of%20nationality%20laws%20FULL%20TEXT.pdf Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226230108/http://eudo-citizenship.eu/InternationalDB/docs/Convention%20on%20certain%20questions%20relating%20to%20the%20conflict%20of%20nationality%20laws%20FULL%20TEXT.pdf |date=2014-12-26 }}. The Hague, 12 April 1930. Full text. Article 1, "It is for each State to determine under its own law who are its nationals...".&lt;/ref&gt; Such determinations are part of [[nationality law]]. In some cases, determinations of nationality are also governed by [[public international law]]—for example, by [[Treaty|treaties]] on [[statelessness]] and the [[European Convention on Nationality]].

Nationality differs technically and legally from [[citizenship]], which is a different legal relationship between a person and a country. The noun ''national'' can include both citizens and non-citizens. The most common distinguishing feature of citizenship is that citizens have the right to participate in the [[Politics|political]] life of the state, such as by [[voting]] or [[Candidate|standing for election]]. However, in most modern countries all nationals are citizens of the state, and full citizens are always nationals of the state.&lt;ref name="Vonk2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;

In older texts, the word ''nationality'' rather than ''ethnicity'', often used to refer to an [[ethnic group]] (a group of people who share a common ethnic identity, language, culture, descent, history, and so forth). This older meaning of ''nationality'' is not defined by political borders or [[passport]] ownership and includes nations that lack an [[sovereign state|independent state]] (such as the [[Aramean people|Arameans]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[English people|English]], [[Basques]], [[Catalans]], [[Kurds]], [[Kabyle people|Kabyles]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Berbers]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Kashmiris]],
[[Palestinians]], [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]], [[Tamils]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Inuit]], [[Copts]], [[Māori people|Māori]], [[Sikhs]], [[Wakhi people|Wakhi]] and [[Székelys]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Individuals may also be considered nationals of groups with [[autonomous administrative division|autonomous status]] that [[devolution|have ceded some power]] to a larger government.

== International law ==
In international law, nationality is the status or relationship that gives a nation the right to protect a person from other nations.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  Diplomatic and [[consular protection]] are dependent upon this relationship between the person and the state.&lt;ref name="Kadelbach"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadelbach |first1=Stefan |editor1-last=Ehlers|editor1-first=Dirk |title=European Fundamental Rights and Freedoms |chapter=Part V: Citizenship Rights in Europe |date=2007|publisher=De Gruyter Recht |location=Berlin|isbn=9783110971965|pages=547–548|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHep8q-OxboC&amp;pg=PA547}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person's status as being the national of a country is used to resolve the [[conflict of laws]].&lt;ref name="Bast" /&gt;

Nationality is also the status that allows a nation to grant rights to the subject and to impose obligations upon the subject.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  In most cases, no rights or obligations are automatically attached to this status, although the status is a necessary precondition for any rights and obligations created by the state.&lt;ref name=Bast&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= von Bogdandy|editor1-first=Armin|editor2-last=Bast|editor2-first=Jürgen |title=Principles of European Constitutional Law.|date=2009|publisher=Hart Pub.|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847315502|pages=449–451|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the broad limits imposed by few treaties and international law, states may freely define who their nationals are and are not.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  However, since the [[Nottebohm case|''Nottebohm'' case]], other states are only required to respect their claim to protect an alleged national if the nationality is based on a true social bond.&lt;ref name=Kadelbach /&gt;  In the case of dual nationality, states may determine the most effective nationality for a person, to determine which state's laws are most relevant.&lt;ref name="Bast" /&gt;  There are also limits on removing a person's status as a national. Article 15 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "Everyone has the right to a nationality," and "No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality."

== National law ==
Nationals normally have the [[right of return|right to enter or return]] to the country they belong to. [[Passports]] are issued to nationals of a state, rather than only to citizens, because the passport is the travel document used to enter the country. However, nationals may not have the [[right of abode]] (the right to live permanently) in the countries that grant them passports.

==Nationality versus citizenship==
Conceptually, [[citizenship]] is focused on the internal political life of the state and nationality is a matter of international dealings.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"&gt;Turner, Bryan S; Isin, Engin F. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gtiZqLcJYZEC&amp;pg=PA278 Handbook of Citizenship Studies]''. SAGE; 2003-01-29. {{ISBN|9780761968580}}. p. 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the concept of full citizenship encompasses not only active political rights, but full [[civil rights]] and [[social rights]].&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;  Nationality is a [[necessary and sufficient condition|necessary but not sufficient condition]] to exercise full political rights within a state or other [[polity]].&lt;ref name="Vonk2012" /&gt;  Nationality is required for full citizenship, and some people have no nationality in international law. A person who is denied full citizenship or nationality is commonly called a stateless person.

Historically, the most significant difference between a national and a citizen is that the citizen has the right to vote for elected officials, and to be elected.&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;  This distinction between full citizenship and other, lesser relationships goes back to antiquity. Until the 19th and 20th centuries, it was typical for only a small percentage of people who belonged to a city or state to be full citizens. In the past, most people were excluded from citizenship on the basis of gender, socioeconomic class, ethnicity, religion, and other factors. However, they held a legal relationship with their government akin to the modern concept of nationality.&lt;ref name="Kadelbach" /&gt;

[[United States nationality law]] defines some persons born in U.S. outlying possessions as U.S. nationals but not citizens. [[British nationality law]] defines six classes of British national, among which "British citizen" is one class (having the [[right of abode]] in the United Kingdom, along with some "British subjects"). Similarly, in the [[Republic of China]], commonly known as [[Taiwan]], the status of [[national without household registration]] applies to people who have [[Republic of China nationality law|Republic of China nationality]], but do not have an automatic entitlement to enter or reside in the [[Taiwan Area]], and do not qualify for civic rights and duties there. Under the nationality laws of [[Mexican nationality law|Mexico]], [[Colombian nationality law|Colombia]], and some other Latin American countries, nationals do not become citizens until they turn 18.

==Nationality versus ethnicity==
{{Main|Ethnic nationalism}}

Nationality is sometimes used simply as an alternative word for [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] or national origin, just as some people assume that citizenship and nationality are identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Oommen, T. K. |title=Citizenship, nationality, and ethnicity: reconciling competing identities |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1997 |page=6 |isbn=0-7456-1620-8 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, the [[cognate]] word for ''nationality'' in local language may be understood as a synonym of ethnicity or as an identifier of cultural and family-based self-determination, rather than on relations with a state or current government. For example, some [[Kurds]] say that they have Kurdish nationality, even though there is no Kurdish [[sovereign state]] at this time in history.

[[File:Russian birth certificate of Michael Lucas.JPG|thumb|A Soviet birth certificate, in which the ''nacional'nost' '' of both parents (here both [[Jews|Jewish]]) was recorded. These records were subsequently used to determine the ethnicity of the child, as specified in his internal passport.]]
In the context of former [[Soviet Union]] and former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], "nationality" is often used as translation of the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''nacional'nost' '' and [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''narodnost'', which were the terms used in those countries for [[ethnic group]]s and local affiliations within the member states of the [[federation]]. In the Soviet Union, more than 100 such groups were formally recognized. Membership in these groups was identified on Soviet [[internal passport]]s, and recorded in [[census]]es in both the USSR and Yugoslavia. In the early years of the Soviet Union's existence, ethnicity was usually determined by the person's native language, and sometimes through religion or cultural factors, such as clothing.&lt;ref name="Slezkine"&gt;Slezkine, Yuri (Summer 1994)  "The USSR as a Communal Apartment, or How a Socialist State Promoted Ethnic Particularism" ''Slavic Review'' Vol. 53, No. 2, pp. 414-452&lt;/ref&gt;  Children born after the revolution were categorized according to their parents' recorded ethnicities. Many of these ethnic groups are still recognized by modern [[Russia]] and other countries.

Similarly, the term ''[[List of ethnic groups in China|nationalities of China]]'' refers to ethnic and cultural groups in China. Spain is one nation, made up of [[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities]], which are not politically recognized as nations (state), but can be considered smaller nations within the Spanish nation. Spanish law recognises the autonomous communities of [[Andalusia]], [[Aragon]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] as "[[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities]]" (''nacionalidades'').

==Nationality versus national identity==
[[National identity]] is a person's subjective sense of belonging to one state or to one nation. A person may be a national of a state, in the sense of being its citizen, without subjectively or emotionally feeling a part of that state, for example many migrants in Europe often identify with their ancestral and/or religious background rather than with the state of which they are citizens. Conversely, a person may feel that he belongs to one state without having any legal relationship to it. For example, children who were brought to the U.S. illegally when quite young and grow up there with little contact with their native country and its culture often have a national identity of feeling American, despite legally being nationals of a different country.

==Dual nationality==
[[Multiple citizenship|Dual nationality]] is when a single person has a formal relationship with two separate, sovereign states.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"/&gt;  This might occur, for example, if a person's parents are nationals of separate countries, and the mother's country claims all offspring of the mother's as their own nationals, but the father's country claims all offspring of the father's.

Nationality, with its historical origins in allegiance to a sovereign monarch, was seen originally as a permanent, inherent, unchangeable condition, and later, when a change of allegiance was permitted, as a strictly exclusive relationship, so that becoming a national of one state required rejecting the previous state.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"/&gt;

Dual nationality was considered a problem that caused conflict between states and sometimes imposed mutually exclusive requirements on affected people, such as simultaneously serving in two countries' military forces. Through the middle of the 20th century, many international agreements were focused on reducing the possibility of dual nationality. Since then, many accords recognizing and regulating dual nationality have been formed.&lt;ref name="TurnerIsin2003"/&gt;

==Statelessness==
[[Statelessness]] is the condition in which an individual has no formal or protective relationship with any state. This might occur, for example, if a person's parents are nationals of separate countries, and the mother's country rejects all offspring of mothers married to foreign fathers, but the father's country rejects all offspring born to foreign mothers. Although this person may have an emotional national identity, he or she may not legally be the national of any state.

Another stateless situation arises when a person holds a travel document (passport) which recognizes the bearer as having the nationality of a "state" which is not internationally recognized, has no entry in the International Organization for Standardization's country list, is not a member of the United Nations, etc.  In the current era, persons native to Taiwan who hold Republic of China passports are one example.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|quote=The Republic of China passport carried by native Taiwanese people clearly indicates the bearer's nationality as 'Republic of China.' Under international standards however, such a nationality designation does not exist. This is explained as follows.  ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes are three-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166-1, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to represent countries, territories, etc. These three-letter abbreviations have been formally adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as the official designation(s) of a 'recognized nationality' for use in manufacturing machine-readable passports, carried by travelers in order to deal with entry/exit procedures at customs authorities in all nations/territories of the world.  According to these three-letter ISO country codes adopted by ICAO, the 'Republic of China' is not a recognized nationality in the international community, and thus there is no 'ROC' entry.

'''Neo-Bonapartism''' or '''neo-Bounapartism''' is a political ideology focusing around a strong leader, who is often a hero to the people, and upholds - or at least seems to uphold - the ideals of the people. With [[Bonapartism]] specifically referring to the case of [[Napoleon I of France]], the term neo-Bonapartism first came to use with the rise of [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon III]]. However, this is not a true example of what neo-Bonapartism has come to symbolize.  [[Edgar Raoul-Duval|M. Raoul Duval]] is given as example in contemporary France in a 1901 book.&lt;ref Name="Hanotaux"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Hanotaux  | first = Gabriel   | title = Contemporary France  | publisher = Books for Libraries Press   | date = 1907  | location =     | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VLgNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA460&amp;dq=%22Neo-Bonapartism%22+-wikipedia&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1#PPA460,M1  | doi =  | id =| page = 460  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neo-Bonapartism can also be used to specifically refer to movements after Napoleon I, but it need not be confined to such. The best example of Bonapartism may be [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman dictator|dictator]]s from the [[Roman Republic|Republican Period]], like [[Julius Caesar]], who attempted to quash the power of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and advance the rights and welfare of the people.

Neo-Bonapartist philosophy is characterized by the leader. It is believed that a strong and capable leader is necessary for the ideals the Bonapartists support - be they [[political left|left]] or [[political right|right]], moderate or radical. The leader is usually a great hero of the people - in most historical cases being military in nature - who brings about reforms in their name. This philosophy by itself has never been popular, and thus is almost always used in conjunction with others. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Neo-Bonapartists are often similar to [[enlightened despot]]s, who use their absolute power to advance [[liberalism]], freedoms, and social welfare, though in many cases of supposed neo-Bonapartism the exact opposite is achieved; giving rise to bastard movements more like traditional dictatorships. [[Nationalism]] is also often a component of neo-Bonapartism, though not a necessary one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14125">'''New adult''' ('''NA''') '''fiction''', also rendered as '''new-adult fiction''', is a developing genre of fiction with protagonists in the 18–30 age bracket.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, Sandra L. (2008). Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives. pp. 111, 119–126.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Martin's Press]] first coined the term in 2009, when they held a special call for "...fiction similar to YA that can be published and marketed as adult—a sort of an 'older YA' or 'new adult'".&lt;ref name="GC1"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Martin's New Adult Contest|url=http://sjaejones.com/blog/2009/st-martins-new-adult-contest|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New adult fiction tends to focus on issues such as leaving home, developing sexuality, and negotiating education and career choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Would you read novels aimed at 'new adults'?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/10/new-adult-fiction|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=London|first=Briony|last=Chappell|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre has gained popularity rapidly over the last few years, particularly through books by self-published bestselling authors like Jennifer L. Armentrout, Cora Carmack, [[Colleen Hoover]], and Jamie McGuire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Adult fiction is the hot new category in books|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/04/15/new-adult-genre-is-the-hottest-category-in-book-publishing/2022707/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=19 May 2013|first1=Deirdre|last1=Donahue|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Alexander Interview Part 3|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/karl-alexander-interview-part-3|publisher=FearNet|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre was originally faced criticism, as some viewed it as a marketing scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New Adult' Fiction Is Now an Official Literary Genre Because Marketers Want Us to Buy Things|url=http://jezebel.com/5960942/new-adult-fiction-is-now-an-official-literary-genre-because-marketers-want-you-to-buy-things|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others claimed the readership was not there to publish the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Adult: Needless Marketing-Speak Or Valued Subgenre?|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, others claimed that the term was necessary; a publicist for [[HarperCollins]] described it as "a convenient label because it allows parents and bookstores and interested readers to know what is inside".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beyond Wizards and Vampires, to Sex|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/books/young-adult-authors-add-steaminess-to-their-tales.html?_r=1&amp;|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=19 May 2013|first=Leslie|last=Kaufman|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of books in the new adult genre include Sarah J. Maas' ''A Court of Thorns and Roses'' and ''Throne of Glass'', Jennifer L. Armentrout's ''Wait For You'', Jamie McGuire's ''Beautiful Disaster'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New Adult' books growing up|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20130420/THINGSTODO07/304200030/-New-Adult-books-growing-up|publisher=Lansing State Journal|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colleen Hoover's ''Slammed'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut Fiction on Bestseller Lists|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/emerging-adult-book-genre-puts-smut-fiction-bestseller/story?id=18550587#.UZhSmKLFVqw|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cora Carmack's ''Losing It'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are your teens ready for New Adult fiction?|url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/17501716-423/are-your-teens-ready-for-new-adult-fiction.html|publisher=Sun Times|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Ryan (novelist)|Kendall Ryan]]'s ''The Impact of You''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://happyeverafter.usatoday.com/2013/06/09/kendall-ryan-the-impact-of-you-new-adult/|title=Sexy-romance author Kendall Ryan gives New Adult a try|date=2013-06-09|website=Happy Ever After|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
This category is intended to be marketed to [[Adolescence|post-adolescents]] and [[Young adult (psychology)|young-adults]] ages 18 to 30. This age group is considered to be the lucrative "cross-over" category of young-adult titles that appeal to both the young-adult market and to an adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beckett, Sandra L. |title=Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives|pages= 111, 119–126|date= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers of young-adult fiction now favor this category as it encompasses a far broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sjaejones.com/blog/2009/postadolescent-or-new-adult-fiction/ |title=Postadolescent or 'New Adult' Fiction |author= JJ |date=10 November 2009 |work= Publishing, Reviews |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief features that distinguish the new-adult fiction category from [[young adult fiction]] are the perspective of the young protagonist and the scope of the protagonist's life experience. Perspective is gained as childhood innocence fades and life experience is gained, which brings insight. It is this insight which is lacking in traditional young-adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/books/survey-shows-publishing-expanded-since-2008.html |title=Publishing Gives Hints of Revival, Data Show |first=Julie |last=Bosman |date= August 9, 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2012 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other main differences are characters' ages and the settings. YA does not usually include characters over age 18 or in college, but these characters are featured in new adult books. New adult can best be described as the age category after young adult.

==Themes and issues==
New adult literature touches upon many themes and issues to reach the readership that falls in between the categories of young adult and adult fiction.

Many themes covered in young adult fiction such as identity, sexuality, depression, suicide, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, familial struggles, bullying&lt;ref&gt;[[young adult fiction]]&lt;/ref&gt; are also covered in new adult fiction, but the various issues that are dealt with in the category hold it separate. Some common examples of issues include first jobs, starting college, wedding engagements and marriage, starting new families, friendships post-high school, military enlistment, financial independence, living away from home for the first time, empowerment, loss of innocence, and fear of failure.

This category focuses heavily on life after an individual has become of legal age, and how one deals with the new beginnings of adulthood. Commonly, these themes and issues have been seen taking place post-high school in popular new adult fiction titles, but there are exceptions.

==Genre==
Like the fiction categories of young adult and adult, new adult fiction can combine with all genres and subgenres. [[Science fiction]], [[urban fiction]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Paranormal fiction|paranormal]], [[dystopia]], etc. are some examples.

==Controversies==

===Publishing industry===
Many agents and large publishing houses have yet to recognize the category due to various issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishingcrawl.com/2013/01/30/new-adult-passing-trend-or-legitimate-genre/|title=New Adult- Passing Trend or Legitimate Genre?|date=30 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some view the category as a marketing scheme, while others claim the readership is not there to publish the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html|title=New Adult: Needless Marketing-Speak Or Valued Subgenre?|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, authors have turned to self-publishing as a means to get their books out into the market.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/04/15/new-adult-genre-is-the-hottest-category-in-book-publishing/2022707/ | work=USA Today | first1=Deirdre | last1=Donahue | title=New Adult fiction is the hot new category in books | date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of these authors has led to many independent publishing houses and agents opening up to the category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/2012/11/29/with-new-digital-imprints-random-house-taps-self-published-authors/|title=With new digital imprints, Random House taps self-published authors|first=Laura|last=Owen|date=29 November 2012|website=paidcontent.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers are now publishing these books with many of the bestsellers having deals with large publishers.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

===Sex===
In 2012, new adult fiction saw a rise in the romance subgenre of contemporary when self-published titles such as ''Slammed'' by [[Colleen Hoover]], ''Easy'' by Tamarra Webber, and ''[[Beautiful Disaster (novel)|Beautiful Disaster]]'' by [[Jamie McGuire (author)|Jamie McGuire]] got picked up by major publishing houses. Some believe&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/books/young-adult-authors-add-steaminess-to-their-tales.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Leslie | last=Kaufman | title=Young-Adult Authors Are Creating a Steamy New Genre | date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this jump in response to the category came from the release of the popular erotic novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'', which featured a heroine in college.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Since new adult fiction tackles issues such as sex and sexuality and many of the categories' successful titles deal with those same issues the category itself and the single issue of sex have been stated as synonymous,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; and even been called over-sexualized versions of young adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/emerging-adult-book-genre-puts-smut-fiction-bestseller/story?id=18550587|title=Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut on Top|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=23 February 2013|website=ABC News|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both readers and authors of the category combat the claim by stating that the category deals with the exploration of a character's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/new-adult-its-not-about-the-sex-but-dont-be-afraid-of-the-sex-either/|title=New Adult: It’s not about the sex (but don’t be afraid of the sex either)|date=25 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that sex is not ubiquitous in new adult titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ebscohost.com/novelist/novelist-special/what-is-new-adult-fiction-anyway|title=What is New Adult Fiction, Anyway? - NoveList - EBSCOhost|website=www.ebscohost.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 to present==

Major aims of the society include:

*To bring together individuals interested in the practice, promotion and advancement of archaeology, particularly in the province of Ontario.
*To encourage and assist every effort, both individual and collective, which tends to foster, elevate and advance archaeology in the fields of learning and culture.
*To discourage illegal archaeological investigation and excavation.
*To facilitate the exchange of ideas and information, and to encourage co-operation among all those interested in the study of archaeology.
*To publish archaeological literature and site reports.*To stimulate the interest of the general public in archaeology.

'''Origomu'''  is a movement originated in [[New York City]] by [[Chile]]an artist [[Tatiana Pagés]] in 2009. It is the practice of recycling plastic waste into wearable art. Origomu or オリゴム comes from the Japanese ori, meaning “folding”, and gomu, meaning “rubber”.&lt;ref name="Listín Diario"&gt;http://www.listindiario.com/las-sociales/2010/8/7/153823/Cambia-el-mundo-con-tus-propias-manos&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SOMAMAG"&gt;http://somamagazine.com/origomu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldschmiede Zeitung"&gt;http://www.gz-online.de/cgi-bin/adframe/design/article.html?ADFRAME_MCMS_ID=3286&amp;id=1305739720149392501128313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Heraldo"&gt;http://www.elheraldo.hn/content/view/full/401572&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The technique has been taught in workshops at [[Pratt Institute]] in [[New York City]], making necklaces using six-pack rings as chief material. Origomu is based in connecting art and fashion with environmental awareness. The technique has also been taught in workshops for low-income women.&lt;ref name="Listín Diario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldschmiede Zeitung"/&gt;

Origomu necklaces has since been displayed at the Eco-Fashion exhibit at The Museum of FIT, the [[Cirque Du Soleil]] Ecological Tent in [[Montreal]], Canada, the country of [[Ecuador]] and the Punta Cana Foundation in [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="Listín Diario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miami.com"&gt;http://www.miami.com/el-arte-y-la-moda-del-origomu&lt;/ref&gt;

Origomu organized an international design contest. Creations from 25 countries were submitted and design and fashion experts chose the most innovative pieces. There was a first round of 8 finalists, out of these, three winners.&lt;ref name="Goldschmiede Zeitung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miami.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Origomu Website"&gt;http://www.origomu.com&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2011, the movement had collected over 200,000 plastic six-pack rings, resulting in more than 500 Origomu designs. Over 305 designers have created Origomu pieces from countries such as Mexico, India, [[Portugal]], New Zealand, United States, [[Ecuador]], [[Chile]], Belgium and Switzerland, among others.&lt;ref name="Origomu Website"&gt;http://www.origomu.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Playing Gods''''' is a [[satire|satirical]] [[board game]] released in late 2008. Two to five players each represent a different [[deity|god]], and compete with each other to take over the world. This is done by spreading [[Religious belief|believers]], [[Religious conversion|converting]] the followers of other gods, or killing them off with [[Act of God|Acts of God]]. The game premiered at the 2009 New York Toy Fair.

==Concept and gameplay==
''Playing Gods'' combines literate satire and social commentary with the carefree fun of the [[Old Testament]]. Players can pit [[Christian]]s against [[Muslim]]s and [[Hindu]]s against [[Jews]], or be the mascot, a machine-gun-toting [[Buddha]]. Players may choose to be any god from Jesus to Buddha, from [[Cthulhu]] to [[Zeus]], from the Cult of [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]] to the [[Almighty Dollar]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playinggods.com&lt;/ref&gt;

''Playing Gods'' is basically an area control game, like ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]''. The board is a map of the world, and each continent contains a [[Holy City]] that is home of one of the world’s religions. Circling the globe is an outer ring where the god pawns move around the board. They do not actually move onto the map of the Earth, they stay above in the heavens, gathering power through [[Divine retribution|Wrath]] and Conversion cards. Wrath cards (also called "kill cards") are used to bring down natural disasters (plagues, locusts, avalanches, floods, and other Acts of Gods) on other gods' followers. Conversion cards are used to convert other gods' followers to your beliefs (promising them things like [[Afterlife]], Prosperity, and [[Miracle]]s).

Typical card content includes: "Bring down the plague: Kill two [[sect]]s,"  "Your preacher is found with a prostitute, lose one sect," and "Another god's follower challenges you to prove you exist; you fry him with lightning in front of a crowd. Gain one sect." The game is won when one god converts or kills off all the other gods' followers.

==Gods represented in the game==
Figures from the world’s five [[Major religious groups|major religions]] are included in the game: Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism. A sticker sheet is provided with the game to allow for other gods and religions, including [[Scientology]] (represented by [[Tom Cruise]] with a [[UFO]] over his head), [[Zeus]], Jehovah’s Witnesses, beer, the Cult of [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]], the [[Almighty Dollar]], [[war]], [[J. R. "Bob" Dobbs]] (of the [[Church of the Subgenius]]), the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]], [[death]], [[Satan]], [[television]], the [[Goddess]], [[atheism]], the [[Magic 8 Ball]], [[McWorld]] (American consumerism), and others. Players are encouraged to create their own gods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playinggods.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Playing Gods Instruction Sheet |date= 2008 |publisher= Balls Out Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==

The game was introduced in September 2008 at [[Dragon*Con]], the annual fantasy and science fiction convention in Atlanta. The game is produced by an independent company called Balls Out Entertainment, which, according to its Web site, "is an undisputed world leader in edgy fun, satirical entertainment, and pompous hyperbole. Formed just recently yet dating back to Caesar, Balls Out Entertainment is at once both new and improved."

According to the game’s creator, [[Ben Radford]], the game was partly inspired by a British game called ''[[War on Terror (game)|War on Terror: The Board Game]]''.  The concept for "the world's first satirical board game of religious warfare" was inspired by his realization that "many of the world's worst conflicts are rooted in religion. Lots of people believe that God is on their side, and as long as God is on your side, any actions you take are justified... I realized, 'This is ridiculous, all these people killing each other because their neighbor down the road prays to a different god.'" Radford said. "I wanted to address this religious violence from a satirical angle, as I'd never seen it done before."{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Reception==

The public’s reaction to ''Playing Gods'' has been generally positive. Australia's Synergy Magazine reported ''Playing Gods'' has “some of the nicest pawns I have ever seen in a board game... has great game play and comes with a smart, cynical and satirical tone. The Wrath and Conversion cards are amusing but also make you think about the inherent violence in religion and superstition… Playing Gods is blasphemy with style and offers a great board game with a good dose of insight and a great load of fun!”.&lt;ref&gt;Synergy Magazine / Australia (Vol. 1 No. 4, pp. 56-57)&lt;/ref&gt; Other players have praised the game as "one of the coolest and most important things to happen to parlor games",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zombie Bacon|first=|title=In Gods We Trust|url=http://zombiebacon.wordpress.com/2009/01/02/in-gods-we-trust/|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “awesome, and damned funny.. it’s [[Candyland]] for people who want the express train to hell”.&lt;ref&gt;http://drakesflames.blogspot.com/2008/11/board-game-review-playing-gods.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Users of the boardgaming community [[BoardGameGeek]] have praised the humor in the game, but given it a poor average rating&lt;ref&gt;http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37175/playing-gods-the-board-game-of-divine-domination&lt;/ref&gt; due to its boring gameplay and lack of meaningful decisions.&lt;ref&gt;http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/372753/this-game-is-boring&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's main theme—gods killing off each other’s believers in religious warfare—has caused some controversy. The game comes with six pawns, including ones depicting Jesus swinging a cross as a weapon and the Buddha firing a machine gun. Several stores have refused to carry the game because of its potential to offend religious people.&lt;ref&gt;http://playinggods.com/whereNOTtobuy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[USA Today]] polled its readers about the controversy "Does Playing Gods go too far?" The results were split down the middle, with 48% saying it went too far, and 50% saying it didn’t go far enough. [[Carl Raschke]], professor of religious studies at [[University of Denver]], stated that the game's perspective "has no basis in historical reality and doesn't actually represent any religion. It just appeals to people who hate religion to begin with—the hip subculture of militant popular atheists... . It sounds too stupid to go far."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-11-17-playing-gods-game_N.htm|title='Playing Gods' satirizes religious violence|author=Cathy Lynn Grossman |publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3522">The '''projection principle''' is a stipulation proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] as part of the phrase structure component of [[Generative grammar|generative-transformational grammar]]. The projection principle is used in the derivation of phrases under the auspices of the [[principles and parameters]] theory.  

==Details==
Under the projection principle, the properties of lexical items must be preserved while generating the phrase structure of a sentence. The principle, as formulated by Chomsky in ''Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use'' (1986), states that "lexical structure must be represented categorically at every syntactic level" (Chomsky 1986: 84).

Chomsky further defined the projection principle as "representations at each level of syntax(MF, D, S) are projected from the lexicon in that they observe the subcategorisation properties of lexical items." For example, the verb ''strangle'', apart from the subject, has an obligatory argument, its object, which must appear in the sentence. The following [[subcategorization frame]] for the verb ''strangle'' specifies its properties; the underlined gap for the location of the verb is followed by the noun phrase (NP): 

:''strangle'' Verb, [__ NP]

It is out of this frame that a sentence like the following can be generated:

:''Fabio strangled Prince Jamal.''

A sentence without the object, in violation of the verb's subcategorization frame and the projection principle, would be ill-formed:

:''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Fabio strangled.''

Before the projection principle was proposed, phrase structures were generated in separation from the properties of lexical entries. These were hypothesized to enter the slots in pre-generated structures waiting to be filled by the lexical material. According to more recent theories, phrase structures are not generated by phrase structure rules, but are "projected" from the lexical entries. The projection principle therefore obviates the need for phrase structure rules in the generative component.

In 1982, [[Noam Chomsky]] proposed the [[extended projection principle]] as an addendum to the projection principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locality of Selection ==
[[Locality (linguistics)|Locality]] of Selection states that properties of lexical items must be satisfied locally within their domain (Sportiche 2014: 147). The local domain is characterized by being the smallest XP with a subject (WP).

In a local domain there are three main levels. The head (X) of the local domain is at the bottom which projects up to and X bar level (X') and then to the phrasal level (XP). Each head can select for a complement. The X bar level can select for a specifier and the XP level can select for an adjunct. This makes up the basic structure of a local domain. 

== Extended Projection Principle ==
The Extended Projection Principle (EPP) is satisfied when the highest Tense Phrase contains a subject (Sportiche 2014: 215).

'''''Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum''''' (full title: '''''Prima pars Promptuarii iconum insigniorum à seculo hominum, subiectis eorum vitis, per compendium ex probatissimis autoribus desumptis''''') &lt;small&gt;({{Pronunciation|Promptuarii Iconum Insiniorum.ogg}})&lt;/small&gt; is an [[iconography]] book by [[Guillaume Rouillé]]. It was published in [[Lyon]], France, in 1553. The work includes portraits designed as [[medal]]s, and brief biographies of many notable figures. Although Julian Sharman, author of ''The library of Mary Queen of Scots'', judges the work to be "not one of much numismatic interest",&lt;ref&gt;Sharman, p.

"Promptuarii Iconum insigniorum a Seculo Hominum, with 950 fine woodcut medallion portraits (many English)."&lt;/ref&gt; The images begin with [[Adam and Eve]].

'''Religion in the United States''' is characterized by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices. Various religious faiths have flourished within the United States. A majority of Americans report that [[religion]] plays a very important role in their lives, a proportion unique among [[developed country|developed countries]].&lt;ref name=pewreligion&gt;{{cite web |title = Among Wealthy Nations U.S. Stands Alone in its Embrace of Religion | work= Pew Global Attitudes Project |url= http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=167 |accessdate= 2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Does this still hold after so many years?|?=yes|date=July 2018}}

Historically, the [[United States]] has always been marked by [[religious pluralism]] and [[religious diversity|diversity]], beginning with various [[Native American religion|native beliefs]] of the pre-colonial time. In colonial times, [[Anglicans]], [[Catholics]] and [[mainline Protestants]], as well as [[Jews]], arrived from [[Europe]]. [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] has been present since the [[Russian Alaska|Russian colonization of Alaska]]. Various [[English dissenters|dissenting Protestants]], who left the [[Church of England]], greatly diversified the religious landscape. The [[Great Awakenings]] gave birth to multiple [[Evangelicalism in the United States|evangelical Protestant]] denominations; membership in [[Methodist]] and [[Baptist]] churches increased drastically in the [[Second Great Awakening]]. In the 18th century, [[deism]] found support among [[American upper class]]es and thinkers. The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], splitting from the Church of England, came into being in the [[American Revolution]]. New Protestant branches like [[Adventism]] emerged; [[Restorationists]] and other Christians like the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Church of Christ, Scientist]], as well as [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Universalist]] communities all spread in the 19th century. [[Pentecostalism]] emerged in the early 20th century as a result of the [[Azusa Street Revival]]. [[Scientology]] emerged in the 1950s. [[Unitarian Universalism]] resulted from the merge of Unitarian and Universalist churches in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the religious share of Christians has decreased due to secularization, while [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], and other religions have spread. [[Protestantism]], historically dominant, ceased to be the religious category of the majority in the early 2010s.

Christianity is the largest religion in the [[United States]] with the various [[Protestantism|Protestant Churches]] having the most adherents. In 2016, Christians represent 73.7% of the total population, 48.9% identifying as [[Protestants]], 23.0% as [[Catholics]], and 1.8% as [[Mormons]], and are followed by people having [[Irreligion|no religion]] with 18.2% of the total population.&lt;ref name="Gallup2016religion"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/200186/five-key-findings-religion.aspx|title=Five Key Findings on Religion in the U.S.|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judaism]] is the second-largest religion in the U.S., practised by 2.1% of the population, followed by [[Islam]] with 0.8%. [[Mississippi]] is the [[List of U.S. states by religiosity|most religious state]] in the country, with 63% of its adult population described as very religious, saying that religion is important to them and attending religious services almost every week, while [[New Hampshire]], with only 20% of its adult population described as very religious, is the least religious state.&lt;ref name="Newport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/189038/new-hampshire-least-religious-state.aspx|title=New Hampshire Now Least Religious State in U.S.|last=Newport|first=Frank|date=2016-02-04|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most religious region of the United States is [[American Samoa]] (99.3% religious).&lt;ref name="AmericanSamoa1"&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aq.html CIA World Factbook.

Schultz, and Paul Harvey, "Everywhere and Nowhere: Recent Trends in American Religious History and Historiography", ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', March 2010, Vol. 78 Issue 1, pp. 129–162&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion within a community of like-minded people: the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English [[Puritan]]s (Congregationalists), Pennsylvania by British [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], Maryland by English [[Catholic Church in the United Kingdom|Catholics]], and Virginia by English [[Anglicans]]. Despite these, and as a result of intervening religious strife and preference in England&lt;ref&gt;See: [[English Civil War]], [[Glorious Revolution]], [[Restoration (England)]] and [[Nonconformist]]s&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Plantation Act 1740]] would set official policy for new immigrants coming to [[British America]] until the [[American Revolution]].

The text of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the country's [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." It guarantees the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|free exercise]] of religion while also preventing the government from establishing a [[state religion]].  However, the states were not bound by the provision and as late as the 1830s Massachusetts provided tax money to local Congregational churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David E.

President John Adams and a unanimous Senate endorsed the [[Treaty of Tripoli]] in 1797 that stated: "the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion."&lt;ref&gt;The treaty [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/bar1796t.asp is online]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2002 survey by the [[Pew Research Center]], nearly 6 in 10 Americans said that religion plays an important role in their lives, compared to 33% in Great Britain, 27% in Italy, 21% in Germany, 12% in Japan, and 11% in France. The survey report stated that the results showed America having a greater similarity to developing nations (where higher percentages say that religion plays an important role) than to other wealthy nations, where religion plays a minor role.&lt;ref name=pewreligion/&gt;

==Freedom of religion==
[[File:Large Broadside on the Maryland Toleration Act.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Maryland Toleration Act]] secured religious liberty in the English [[colony of Maryland]]. Similar laws were passed in the [[Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], [[Connecticut]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. These laws stood in direct contrast with the [[Puritan]] theocratic rule in the [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]] colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Encylclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/place/Massachusetts-Bay-Colony&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The United States federal government was the first national government to have no official state-endorsed religion.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 10 ("For the first time in recorded history, they designed a government with no established religion at all.")&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, some states had established religions in some form until the 1830s.

Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise, thus protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination from government interference. The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals, but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, George M. 1990. ''Religion and American Culture.'' Orlando: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mainline Protestant denominations====
[[File:First_Congregational_Church,_Cheshire_CT.jpg|thumb|A [[Congregational church]] in [[Cheshire, Connecticut]]]]
Historians agree that members of mainline Protestant denominations have played leadership roles in many aspects of American life, including politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They founded most of the country's leading institutes of [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=mainline2000&gt;McKinney, William. "Mainline Protestantism 2000."

====Christian settlers====
Beginning around 1600 European settlers introduced [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Puritans]] religion, as well as [[Baptist]], Presbyterian, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]], and [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A religious history of the American people'' (1976) pp. 121-59 .&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salt Lake Temple, Utah - Sept 2004-2.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Salt Lake Temple]] in Salt Lake City, Utah]]

Beginning in the 16th century, the Spanish (and later the French and English) introduced [[Catholicism]]. From the 19th century to the present, Catholics moved to the US in large numbers due to immigration of [[Italian American|Italians]], Hispanics, [[Portuguese American|Portuguese]], [[French American|French]], [[Polish American|Polish]], [[Irish Americans|Irish]], Highland Scots, Dutch, Flemish, [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], [[German Americans|Germans]], [[Lebanese American|Lebanese]] ([[Maronite]]), and other ethnic groups.

During the 19th century, two main branches of [[Eastern Christianity]] also arrived to America. [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] was brought to America by [[Greek Americans|Greek]], [[Russian Americans|Russian]], [[Ukrainian Americans|Ukrainian]], [[Serbian Americans|Serbian]], and other immigrant groups, mainly from [[Eastern Europe]]. In the same time, several immigrant groups from the [[Middle East]], mainly [[Armenian Americans|Armenians]], [[Coptic Americans|Copts]] and [[Syriac Americans|Syriacs]], brought [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] to America.{{sfn|FitzGerald|2007|p=269-279}}&lt;ref&gt;Alexei D. Krindatch, ed., ''Atlas of American Orthodox Christian Churches'' (Holy Cross Orthodox Press, 2011) [http://www.coptics.info/Books/AtlasAmericanOrthodoxChurchesSample.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] in Washington, D.C., is the largest Catholic church in the US.]]

Several Christian groups were founded in America during the [[Great Awakening]]s. Interdenominational [[evangelicalism]] and [[Pentecostalism]] emerged; new Protestant denominations such as [[Adventism]]; non-denominational movements such as the [[Restoration Movement]] (which over time separated into the [[Churches of Christ]], the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]], and the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]); [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (called "Bible Students" in the latter part of the 19th century); and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormonism]]).

The strength of various sects varies greatly in different regions of the country, with rural parts of the South having many evangelicals but very few Catholics (except [[Louisiana]] and the [[Gulf Coast]], and from among the [[Hispanic]] community, both of which consist mainly of Catholics), while urbanized areas of the north Atlantic states and [[Great Lakes]], as well as many industrial and mining towns, are heavily Catholic, though still quite mixed, especially due to the heavily Protestant African-American communities. In 1990, nearly 72% of the population of [[Utah]] was Mormon, as well as 26% of neighboring [[Idaho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_lds.html |title= Largest Latter-day Saint Communities (Mormon/Church of Jesus Christ Statistics) |date= 2005-04-12 |publisher= adherents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheranism is most prominent in the [[Upper Midwest]], with [[North Dakota]] having the highest percentage of Lutherans (35% according to a 2001 survey).&lt;ref name="religious survey"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm |title= American Religious Identification Survey |work= Exhibit 15 |publisher= The Graduate Center, City University of New York |accessdate= 2006-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews have been present in what is now the US since the 17th century, and specifically allowed since the British colonial [[Plantation Act 1740]]. Although small Western European communities initially developed and grew, large-scale immigration did not take place until the late 19th century, largely as a result of persecutions in parts of [[Eastern Europe]]. The Jewish community in the United States is composed predominantly of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] whose ancestors emigrated from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. There are, however, small numbers of older (and some recently arrived) communities of [[Sephardi Jews]] with roots tracing back to 15th century [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] (Spain, Portugal, and North Africa). There are also [[Mizrahi Jews]] (from the Middle East, [[Caucasus|Caucasia]] and [[Central Asia]]), as well as much smaller numbers of [[Ethiopian Jews]], [[Indian Jews]], [[Kaifeng Jews]] and others from various smaller [[Jewish ethnic divisions]]. Approximately 25% of the Jewish American population lives in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Jewish Community Study of New York |publisher= United Jewish Appeal-Federation of New York |year= 2002 |url= http://www.ujafedny.org/atf/cf/%7BAD848866-09C4-482C-9277-51A5D9CD6246%7D/JCommStudyIntro.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2008-03-22 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614001800/http://www.ujafedny.org/atf/cf/%7BAD848866-09C4-482C-9277-51A5D9CD6246%7D/JCommStudyIntro.pdf |archivedate= June 14, 2007 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center report on American Judaism released in October 2013 revealed that 22% of Jewish Americans say they have "no religion" and the majority of respondents do not see religion as the primary constituent of Jewish identity. 62% believe Jewish identity is based primarily in ancestry and culture, only 15% in religion.

Among the 4.3&amp;nbsp;million American Jews described as "strongly connected" to Judaism, over 80% have some sort of active engagement with Judaism, ranging from attendance at daily prayer services on one end of the spectrum to attending [[Passover Seder]]s or lighting [[Hanukkah]] candles on the other. The survey also discovered that Jews in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwest]] are generally more observant than Jews in the [[Southern United States|South]] or [[Western United States|West]]. Reflecting a trend also observed among other religious groups, Jews in the [[Northwestern United States]] are typically the least observant of tradition.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[File:Lightmatter Hsi Lai Temple 4.jpg|thumb|[[Hsi Lai Temple]] ("Coming West Temple"), a [[Buddhist]] [[monastery]] in [[Hacienda Heights, California]], near Los Angeles]]

[[Buddhism]] entered the US during the 19th century with the arrival of the first immigrants from [[East Asia]]. The first Buddhist temple was established in [[San Francisco]] in 1853 by [[Chinese Americans]].

During the late 19th century Buddhist missionaries from [[Japan]] travelled to the US. During the same time period, US intellectuals started to take interest in Buddhism.

[[File:Ballard Kadampa Buddhist Temple 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temple in [[Seattle, Washington]]]]

The first prominent US citizen to publicly convert to Buddhism was [[Henry Steel Olcott]] in 1880 who is still honored in [[Sri Lanka]] for these efforts. An event that contributed to the strengthening of Buddhism in the US was the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in 1893, which was attended by many Buddhist delegates sent from India, China, Japan, [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

The early 20th century was characterized by a continuation of tendencies that had their roots in the 19th century. The second half, by contrast, saw the emergence of new approaches, and the move of Buddhism into the mainstream and making itself a mass and social religious phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utne.com/Mind-Body/Buddhism-Fastest-Growing-American-Religion-Stigma.aspx| title=Bad Buddhist Vibes| work=Utne| accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520213012| title=The Faces of Buddhism in America| work=[[University of California Press]]| accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 survey directed by Dr. Ariela Keysar for the [[City University of New York]] indicated that, amongst the more than 100 categories of response, "no religious identification" had the greatest increase in population in both absolute and percentage terms. This category included [[atheist]]s, [[agnostic]]s, [[humanism|humanist]]s, and others with no stated religious preferences. Figures are up from 14.3&amp;nbsp;million in 1990 to 34.2&amp;nbsp;million in 2008, representing an increase from 8% of the total population in 1990 to 15% in 2008.&lt;ref name=ARIS2008/&gt; A nationwide [[Pew Research]] study published in 2008 put the figure of unaffiliated persons at 16.1%,&lt;ref name=pewstudy /&gt; while another Pew study published in 2012 was described as placing the proportion at about 20% overall and roughly 33% for the 18–29-year-old demographic.&lt;ref name=phillips2013&gt;{{cite news |title=Some Church Folk Ask: 'What Would Jesus Brew?' |first=Erica E. |last=Phillips |first2=Ben |last2=Kesling |type=paper |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=9–10 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 nationwide poll, [[University of Minnesota]] researchers found that despite an increasing acceptance of religious diversity, atheists were generally distrusted by other Americans, who trusted them less than Muslims, recent immigrants and other minority groups in "sharing their vision of American society". They also associated atheists with undesirable attributes such as amorality, criminal behavior, rampant materialism and cultural elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.asanet.org/press/20060503.cfm |title= Atheists Are Distrusted |date= May 3, 2006 |accessdate= 2010-02-16 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100613173056/http://asanet.org/press/20060503.cfm |archivedate= June 13, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1786422&amp;page=1 |title= Who's Counting: Distrusting Atheists |date= April 2, 2006 |accessdate= 2010-02-16 |first= John Allen |last= Paulos |publisher= ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same study also reported that "The researchers also found acceptance or rejection of atheists is related not only to personal religiosity, but also to one's exposure to diversity, education and political orientation – with more educated, East and West Coast Americans more accepting of atheists than their Midwestern counterparts."&lt;ref name="UMN News"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www1.umn.edu/news/news-releases/2006/UR_RELEASE_MIG_2816.html |title= Atheists identified as America's most distrusted minority, according to new U of M study |publisher= UMN News |accessdate= 2006-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some surveys have indicated that doubts about the existence of the divine were growing quickly among Americans under 30.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/12/pew-survey-doubt-of-god-growing-quickly-among-millennials/ |title=Pew survey: Doubt of God growing quickly among millennials |publisher=Religion.blogs.cnn.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 2012, American atheists sponsored the [[Reason Rally]] in Washington, D.C., followed by the American Atheist Convention in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. Organizers called the estimated crowd of 8,000–10,000 the largest-ever US gathering of atheists in one place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/24/atheist-rally_n_1377443.html |title=Atheists Rally on National Mall |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2012-03-24|accessdate=2012-12-29 |first=Paul |last=Raushenbush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deism====
In the United States, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophy]] (which itself was heavily inspired by [[Deism|deist ideals]]) played a major role in creating the principle of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]], expressed in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s letters and included in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American Founding Fathers, or Framers of the Constitution]], who were especially noted for being influenced by such philosophy of deism include Thomas Jefferson, [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Cornelius Harnett]], [[Gouverneur Morris]], and [[Hugh Williamson]]. Their political speeches show distinct deistic influence. Other notable Founding Fathers may have been more directly deist. These include [[Thomas Paine]], [[James Madison]], possibly [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[Ethan Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethanallenhomestead.org/history/oracle.htm#excerpts |title=Excerpts from Allen's ''Reason The Only Oracle Of Man'' |publisher=Ethan Allen Homestead Museum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502050943/http://www.ethanallenhomestead.org/HISTORY/oracle.htm#excerpts |archivedate=May 2, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belief in the existence of a god====
Various polls have been conducted to determine Americans' actual beliefs regarding a god:
* In 2014 the Pew Research Center's Religious Landscape Study showed 63% of Americans believed in God and were "absolutely certain" in their view, while the figure rose to 89% including those who were agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/belief-in-god/|title=Religious Landscape Study -  Pew Research Center|date=2015-05-11|access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2012 WIN-Gallup International poll showed that 5% of Americans considered themselves "convinced" atheists, which was a fivefold increase from the last time the survey was taken in 2005, and 5% said they did not know or else did not respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf|title=Religiosity and Atheism|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-12-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906165952/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/richeditor/filemanager/Global_INDEX_of_Religiosity_and_Atheism_PR__6.pdf|archivedate=September 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2012 Pew Research Center survey found that doubts about the existence of a god had grown among younger Americans, with 68% telling Pew they never doubt God's existence, a 15-point drop in five years. In 2007, 83% of American millennials said they never doubted God's existence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/12/pew-survey-doubt-of-god-growing-quickly-among-millennials/|title=Pew Survey: Doubt of God Growing Quickly among Millennials|date=2012-06-12|publisher=CNN|author=Merica, Dan|accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2011 Gallup poll found 92% of Americans said yes to the basic question "Do you believe in God?", while 7% said no and 1% had no opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147887/americans-continue-believe-god.aspx|title=More Than 9 in 10 Americans Continue to Believe in God|date=|publisher=Gallup.com|accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2010 Gallup poll found 80% of Americans believe in a god, 12% believe in a universal spirit, 6% don't believe in either, 1% chose "other", and 1% had no opinion. 80% is a decrease from the 1940s, when Gallup first asked this question.
* A late 2009 online Harris poll of 2,303 U.S. adults (18 and older)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris_Poll_2009_12_15.pdf|title=What People Do and Do Not Believe in|date=2009-12-15|work=Harris Interactive|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that "82% of adult Americans believe in God", the same number as in two earlier polls in 2005 and 2007. Another 9% said they did not believe in God, and 9% said that they were not sure. It further concluded, "Large majorities also believe in miracles (76%), heaven (75%), that Jesus is God or the Son of God (73%), in angels (72%), the survival of the soul after death (71%), and in the resurrection of Jesus (70%). Less than half (45%) of adults believe in Darwin's theory of [[evolution]] but this is more than the 40% who believe in [[creationism]]..... Many people consider themselves Christians without necessarily believing in some of the key beliefs of Christianity. However, this is not true of [[born-again Christian]]s. In addition to their religious beliefs, large minorities of adults, including many Christians, have "[[pagan]]" or pre-Christian beliefs such as a belief in ghosts, [[astrology]], witches and [[reincarnation]].... Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in the Harris Interactive panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated."
* A 2008 survey of 1,000 people concluded that, based on their stated beliefs rather than their religious identification, 69.5% of Americans believe in a personal God, roughly 12.3% of Americans are [[atheist]] or [[agnostic]], and another 12.1% are deistic (believing in a higher power/non-personal God, but no personal God).&lt;ref name="ARIS2008" /&gt;
* Mark Chaves, a [[Duke University]] professor of sociology, religion and divinity, found that 92% of Americans believed in God in 2008, but that significantly fewer Americans have great confidence in their religious leaders than a generation ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.duke.edu/2011/08/chaves|title=according to Mark Chaves|date=2011-08-16|publisher=Today.duke.edu|author=Eric Ferreri|accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to a 2008 ARIS survey, belief in God varies considerably by region. The lowest rate is in the West with 59% reporting a belief in God, and the highest rate is in the South at 86%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/109108/Belief-God-Far-Lower-Western-US.aspx|title=Belief in God Far Lower in Western U.S.|date=2008-07-28|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization]]|author=Newport, Frank|accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual but not religious===
{{main article|Spiritual but not religious}}

"Spiritual but not religious" (SBNR) is self-identified stance of spirituality that takes issue with organized religion as the sole or most valuable means of furthering spiritual growth. Spirituality places an emphasis upon the wellbeing of the "mind-body-spirit,"&lt;ref&gt;Heelas, Spiritualities of Life, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; so holistic activities such as tai chi, reiki, and yoga are common within the SBNR movement.&lt;ref&gt;Heelas, Spiritualities of Life, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to religion, spirituality has often been associated with the interior life of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Carette and King, Selling Spirituality, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

One fifth of the US public and a third of adults under the age of 30 are reportedly unaffiliated with any religion, however they identify as being spiritual in some way. Of these religiously unaffiliated Americans, 37% classify themselves as spiritual but not religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Cary|last2=Smith|first2=Greg|title="Nones" on the Rise: One-in-Five Adults Have No Religious Affiliation|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/10/NonesOnTheRise-full.pdf|website=pewforum.org|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neopaganism===
{{Main article|Contemporary Paganism}}
Neopaganism in the United States is represented by widely different [[List of Neopagan movements|movements and organizations]]. The largest Neopagan religion is [[Wicca]], followed by [[Neo-Druidism]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jane Davy, ''Introduction to Pagan Studies'', p. 151 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Guiley, ''The Encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy'', p. 84 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Other neopagan movements include [[Germanic Neopaganism]], [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]], [[Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism]], and [[Semitic neopaganism]].

====Druidry====
According to the [[Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture#American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS)|American Religious Identification Survey]] (ARIS), there are approximately 30,000 [[druid]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Trinity ARIS 2008; [http://prog.trincoll.edu/ISSSC/DataArchive/Access.asp Trinity ARIS 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625210111/http://prog.trincoll.edu/ISSSC/DataArchive/Access.asp |date=June 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Druidism arrived in North America first in the form of fraternal Druidic organizations in the nineteenth century, and orders such as the Ancient Order of Druids in America were founded as distinct American groups as early as 1912. In 1963, the [[Reformed Druids of North America]] (RDNA) was founded by students at [[Carleton College]], [[Northfield, Minnesota]]. They adopted elements of Neopaganism into their practices, for instance celebrating the festivals of the [[Wheel of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl06|Adler 2006]]. pp. 337–339.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wicca====
Wicca advanced in North America in the 1960s by [[Raymond Buckland]], an expatriate Briton who visited Gardner's Isle of Man coven to gain initiation.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Buckland, ''Scottish Witchcraft: The history &amp; magick of the Picts'', p. 246 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal Eclectic Wicca]] was popularized in 1969 for a diverse membership drawing from both [[Dianic Wicca|Dianic]] and [[British Traditional Wicca|British Traditional]] Wiccan backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Wyrmstar, Tamryn | title=Silver Chalice Ancestry | publisher=Tamryn's Abode http://www.angelfire.com/rant/ingwitch/sca.html | url=http://www.angelfire.com/rant/ingwitch/sca.html | accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nordic Paganism'''

Nordic Paganism is the umbrella term for polytheistic followers of the Proto-Norse period religions involving the Nordic pantheon of gods. This pantheon includes: the [[Æsir]]; [[Odin]],[[Thor]], [[Loki]], [[Sif]], [[Heimdallr]], [[Baldr]], and [[Týr]] to name a few, and the [[Vanir]]; [[Freyja]], [[Freyr]], [[Njörðr]], [[Nerthus]], and others. The followers of Nordic Paganism include Odinists, Tyrists, Lokians, Asatru, and practitioners of ''[[Seiðr]],'' among other varying followers. Nordic Pagans follow the teachings of the [[Hávamál]]. This old text, along with the [[Prose Edda]] and [[Poetic Edda]], gives the basis for Norse mythology, stories, legends, and beliefs.

In popular culture, Norse mythology is well known. Fairy tale creatures, such as Elves, Dwarves, Giants, and Trolls all come from Norse mythology. These can be seen in famous works such as J.R.R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings''. This is one of the earlier works to bring Norse concepts to life. Comic book producer ''Marvel Comics'' has taken a different approach, making Thor a modern superhero, and Loki a villain. These comics have spawned several movies and toys. Norse Mythology and the Scandinavian-Germanic lifestyle were looked at more in-depth than ever before with the popular TV series ''Vikings.'' Though not perfect on accuracy, it is very close to how these people would have lived and worshiped in the 1st and 2nd centuries.

There is also a more negative light to Nordic Paganism's popularity. Many white supremacy groups, including the Aryan Brotherhood, Sons of Odin, and the Nazis all used Nordic symbols and express Norse teachings in a skewed manner to support their beliefs that White Men are the superior race and gender of the world. Nazis famously used the symbol [[Sowilō]], for their SS pins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Nazi symbolism|date=2018-10-22|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nazi_symbolism&amp;oldid=865230490|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their use of symbols such as these were originally tied to [[Guido von List]]. The Aryan Brotherhood&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/aryan-brotherhood|title=Aryan Brotherhood|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soldiers of Odin&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Soldiers of Odin|date=2018-10-24|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Soldiers_of_Odin&amp;oldid=865441146|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; use the Hammer of Thor ([[Mjölnir]]) and the symbol [[Odal (rune)]], which they use to represent Odin, to mark themselves as part of the gang. This has led to many prisons banning the wearing of Mjölnir by inmates due to their gang affiliation.

===New Thought Movement===
[[File:Church of the Holy City.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Church of the Holy City in [[Washington, D.C.]] is tied to the [[The New Church (Swedenborgian)|New Church]].]]
{{Main article|New Thought}}
A group of churches which started in the 1830s in the United States is known under the banner of "[[New Thought]]". These churches share a [[Spirituality|spiritual]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] predisposition and understanding of the [[Bible]] and were strongly influenced by the [[Transcendentalist]] movement, particularly the work of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Another antecedent of this movement was [[Swedenborgianism]], founded on the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;William James, [https://archive.is/20120707202152/http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JamVari.sgm&amp;images=images/modeg&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=all "The Varieties of Religious Experience"]. pp. 92–93. New York 1929&lt;/ref&gt; The New Thought concept was named by [[Emma Curtis Hopkins]] ("teacher of teachers") after Hopkins broke off from [[Mary Baker Eddy]]'s [[Church of Christ, Scientist]]. The movement had been previously known as the Mental Sciences or the Christian Sciences. The three major branches are [[Religious Science]], [[Unity Church]] and [[Divine Science]].

===Unitarian Universalism===

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] guarantees both the free practice of religion and the non-establishment of religion by the federal government (later court decisions have extended that prohibition to the states).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] was modified in 1954 to add the phrase "under God", in order to distinguish itself from the [[state atheism]] espoused by the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Texas Review of Law and Politics"&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn= 503622 |title= The Pledge of Allegiance and the Limited State |author= Thomas Berg |journal= [[Texas Review of Law and Politics]], Vol. 8, Fall 2003 |quote= The inclusion of "under God" in the Pledge, the report says, "would serve to deny the atheistic and materialistic conceptions of communism with its attendant subservience of the individual".}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott A.

So in 1954, Congress passed a law that inserted the phrase "under God" into the Pledge of Allegiance. |accessdate= 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ann W. Duncan, Steven L.

Various [[President of the United States|American presidents]] have often stated the importance of religion. On February 20, 1955, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] stated that "Recognition of the Supreme Being is the first, the most basic, expression of Americanism."&lt;ref name="John Micklethwait, Adrian Wooldridge"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QwtWtGw5B9kC&amp;pg=PT82&amp;dq=American+Legion+Back+to+God#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Legion%20Back%20to%20God&amp;f=false |title= God Is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World |author= [[John Micklethwait]], [[Adrian Wooldridge]] |publisher= [[Penguin Books]] |quote= "Recognition of the Supreme Being is the first, the most basic, expression of Americanism," he declared in a speech launching the American Legion's "Back to God" campaign in 1955.

===2016 Public Religion Research Institute data===
In 2016, a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute estimated that 69% of the Americans are Christians, with 45% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered [[Protestant]], and 20% professing [[Catholic]] beliefs. The same study says that other non-Christian religions (including [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]]) collectively make up about 7% of the population.&lt;ref name="AVA2017" /&gt;{{Pie chart

===Attendance===
[[File:Weekly religious service attendance by US State gradient (2014).svg|thumb|350px|Church, synagogue, or mosque attendance by state (2014)]]

A 2013 survey reported that 31% of Americans attend [[place of worship|religious services]] at least weekly. It was conducted by the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] with a [[margin of error]] of 2.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Kaleem| first1=Jaweed| title=Americans Exaggerate How Much They Go To Religious Services, According To Study | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/17/religious-attendance-exaggeration-survey_n_5344535.html| accessdate=May 31, 2014| work=The Huffington Post| date=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, an online [[Harris Poll]] (they stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to [[sampling error]]s, [[Non-response bias|non-response]], etc.; 2,010 U.S. adults were surveyed)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NEWS/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1130 |title=Harris Interactive survey |publisher=Harrisinteractive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 26% of those surveyed attended religious services "every week or more often", 9% went "once or twice a month", 21% went "a few times a year", 3% went "once a year", 22% went "less than once a year", and 18% never attend religious services.

In a 2009 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup International]] survey, 41.6%&lt;ref name=Gallup2009&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/125999/mississippians-go-church-most-vermonters-least.aspx |title=Mississippians Go to Church the Most; Vermonters, Least |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of American citizens said that they attended a church, synagogue, or mosque once a week or almost every week. This percentage is higher than other surveyed Western countries.&lt;ref name=bbc20070403&gt;{{cite news |title= 'One in 10' attends church weekly |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6520463.stm |publisher= BBC News |date= April 3, 2007 |accessdate= 2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?docid=2250&amp;track=82083 NCLS releases latest estimates of church attendance], National Church Life Survey, media release, February 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church attendance]] varies considerably by state and region.

In August 2010, 67% of Americans said religion was losing influence, compared with 59% who said this in 2006. Majorities of white evangelical Protestants (79%), white mainline Protestants (67%), black Protestants (56%), Catholics (71%), and the religiously unaffiliated (62%) all agreed that religion was losing influence on American life; 53% of the total public said this was a bad thing, while just 10% see it as a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewresearch.org/databank/dailynumber/?NumberID=1079|publisher=Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|title=Religion Losing Influence in America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians frequently discuss their religion when campaigning, and [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalists]] and black Protestants are highly politically active. However, to keep their status as [[tax-exempt organization]]s they must not officially endorse a candidate. Historically Catholics were heavily [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] before the 1970s, while mainline Protestants comprised the core of the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. Those patterns have faded away—Catholics, for example, now split about 50–50. However, white evangelicals since 1980 have made up a solidly Republican group that favors conservative candidates. Secular voters are increasingly Democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=174 |title=Religion and the 2006 Elections |publisher=Pew Forum |date=2006-12-01 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three presidential candidates for major parties have been Catholics, all for the Democratic party:
* [[Alfred E. Smith]] in [[United States presidential election, 1928|presidential election of 1928]] was subjected to anti-Catholic rhetoric, which seriously hurt him in the Baptist areas of the South and Lutheran areas of the Midwest, but he did well in the Catholic urban strongholds of the Northeast.
* [[John F. Kennedy]] secured the Democratic presidential nomination in 1960. In the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 election]], Kennedy faced accusations that as a Catholic president he would do as the Pope would tell him to do, a charge that Kennedy refuted in a famous address to Protestant ministers.
* [[John Kerry]], a Catholic, won the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]] religion was hardly an issue, and most Catholics voted for his Protestant opponent [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5297138/ |title=Exit poll - Decision 2004- NBCNews.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Biden]] is the first Catholic vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/politicaljunkie/2009/01/the_first_catholic_vice_presid.html|title=The First Catholic Vice President?|date=9 January 2009|work=NPR.org|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Lieberman]] was the first major presidential candidate that was Jewish, on the [[Al Gore|Gore]]–Lieberman [[United States presidential election, 2000|campaign of 2000]] (although [[John Kerry]] and [[Barry Goldwater]] both had Jewish ancestry, they were practicing Christians). [[Bernie Sanders]] ran against [[Hillary Clinton]] in the Democratic primary of 2016. He was the first major Jewish candidate to compete in the presidential primary process. However, Sanders noted during the campaign that he does not actively practice any religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bernie-sanders-finally-answers-the-god-question/2016/01/26/83429390-bfb0-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html|title=Why Bernie Sanders doesn’t participate in organized religion|date=27 January 2016|work=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Keith Ellison]] of [[Minnesota]] became the first Muslim elected to Congress; when [[Quran oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress|re-enacting his swearing-in for photos]], he used the copy of the [[Qur'an]] once owned by Thomas Jefferson.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Isikoff, "I'm a Sunni Muslim", [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16474497/site/newsweek/page/0/ ''Newsweek'' Jan. 4, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Carson]] is the second Muslim to serve in Congress. 

A Gallup poll released in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/26611/Some-Americans-Reluctant-Vote-Mormon-72YearOld-Presidential-Candidates.aspx |title= Some Americans Reluctant to Vote for Mormon, 72-Year-Old Presidential Candidates. Strong support for black, women, Catholic candidates |publisher= Gallup News Service |author= Jeffrey M. Jones |accessdate= 2007-12-25 |date= 2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that 53% of Americans would refuse to vote for an [[atheist]] as president, up from 48% in 1987 and 1999. But then the number started to drop again and reached record low 43% in 2012 and 40% in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/155285/atheists-muslims-bias-presidential-candidates.aspx |title= Atheists, Muslims See Most Bias as Presidential Candidates |publisher= Gallup News Service |author = Jeffrey M.

[[Mitt Romney]], the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, is [[Mormon]] and a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. He is the former governor of the state of [[Massachusetts]], and his father [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] was the governor of the state of [[Michigan]]. The Romneys were involved in Mormonism in their states and in the state of [[Utah]].

On January 3, 2013, [[Tulsi Gabbard]] became the first [[Hindu]] member of Congress, using a copy of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] while swearing-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaleem|first1=Jaweed|title=Tulsi Gabbard, First Hindu In Congress, Uses Bhagavad Gita At Swearing-In|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/04/tulsi-gabbard-hindu-bhagavad-gita-swearing-in_n_2410078.html|publisher=HuffPost|accessdate=October 17, 2017|date=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010 ARDA data ==

The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (ARDA) surveyed congregations for their memberships. Churches were asked for their membership numbers. Adjustments were made for those congregations that did not respond and for religious groups that reported only adult membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/rcms_notes.asp |title= ARDA Sources for Religious Congregations &amp; Membership Data |publisher= [[Association of Religion Data Archives|ARDA]] |year= 2000 |accessdate= 2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ARDA estimates that most of the churches not responding were black Protestant congregations. Significant difference in results from other databases include the lower representation of adherents of 1) all kinds (62.7%), 2) Christians (59.9%), 3) Protestants (less than 36%); and the greater number of unaffiliated (37.3%).

==ARIS findings regarding self-identification==&lt;!---[[American Religious Identification Survey]] redirects here ---&gt;
The United States government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the [[Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture#American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS)|American Religious Identification Survey]] (ARIS) of 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone [[statistical survey|survey]] of 54,461 American residential households in the [[contiguous United States]]. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.

Adult respondents were asked the [[open-ended question]], "What is your religion, if any?" Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was "Protestant" or "Christian" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.

'''Religious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008'''&lt;ref name=ARIS2008 /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of "no religion" than any other group.

'''Highlights:'''&lt;ref name=ARIS2008 /&gt;
# The ARIS 2008 survey was carried out during February–November 2008 and collected answers from 54,461 respondents who were questioned in English or Spanish.
# The American population self-identifies as predominantly Christian, but Americans are slowly becoming less Christian.
#* 86% of American adults identified as Christians in 1990 and 76% in 2008.
#* The historic mainline churches and denominations have experienced the steepest declines, while the non-denominational Christian identity has been trending upward, particularly since 2001.
#* The challenge to Christianity in the U.S. does not come from other religions but rather from a rejection of all forms of organized religion.
# 34% of American adults considered themselves "Born Again or Evangelical Christians" in 2008.
# The U.S. population continues to show signs of becoming less religious, with one out of every seven Americans failing to indicate a religious identity in 2008.
#* The "Nones" (no stated religious preference, atheist, or agnostic) continue to grow, though at a much slower pace than in the 1990s, from 8.2% in 1990, to 14.1% in 2001, to 15.0% in 2008.
#* Asian Americans are substantially more likely to indicate no religious identity than other racial or ethnic groups.
# One sign of the lack of attachment of Americans to religion is that 27% do not expect a religious funeral at their death.
# Based on their stated beliefs rather than their religious identification in 2008, 70% of Americans believe in a personal God, roughly 12% of Americans are atheist (no God) or agnostic (unknowable or unsure), and another 12% are deistic (a higher power but no personal God).
# America's religious geography has been transformed since 1990. Religious switching along with Hispanic immigration has significantly changed the religious profile of some states and regions. Between 1990 and 2008, the Catholic population proportion of the New England states fell from 50% to 36% and in New York fell from 44% to 37%, while it rose in California from 29% to 37% and in Texas from 23% to 32%.
# Overall the 1990–2008 ARIS time series shows that changes in religious self-identification in the first decade of the 21st century have been moderate in comparison to the 1990s, which was a period of significant shifts in the religious composition of the United States.

==Ethnicity==
The table below shows the religious affiliations among the [[ethnic]]ities in the United States, according to the [[Pew Forum]] 2014 survey.&lt;ref name="pew2014" /&gt; People of [[African American|Black]] ethnicity were most likely to be part of a formal religion, with 85% percent being Christians. Protestant denominations make up the majority of the Christians in the ethnicities.

'''Saint Lucian Creole French(Kwéyòl)[kwejɔl]''', known locally as '''Patwa''', is a [[French-based creole languages|French-based creole]], which is the generally spoken language in [[Saint Lucia]]. 

==History==
It is a subvariety of [[Antillean Creole]], which is spoken in other islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and is very closely related to the varieties spoken in [[Martinique]], [[Dominica]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Grenada]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The intelligibility rate with speakers of other varieties of Antillean Creole is almost 100%. Its syntactic, grammatical and lexical features are virtually identical to that of Martinican Creole, but like its Dominican counterpart, it includes more English loanwords than the Martinican variety.

Like the other [[Caribbean]] Creoles, Saint Lucian French Creole combines a syntax of African and Carib origin with a vocabulary derived primarily from French.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In addition, many expressions reflect the presence of an [[English Creole]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] influences in the language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} It is not considered to be mutually intelligible with Standard French, but it is intelligible with the other French creoles of the Lesser Antilles. It is related to [[Haitian Creole]], which has a number of distinctive features, but both are still mutually intelligible.

It is still widely spoken in Saint Lucia, but the actual number of speakers appear to have declined in the past decades. In the mid-19th century it was exported to Panama, where it is now moribund.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

==Orthography==
The Kwéyol writing system contains 24 letters, representing 32 phonemes. This writing system used in St.Lucia and Dominica differs slightly from that used in Guadeloupe and Martinique.                                                                                                                                                                                                              The letters Q and X are not used and the letter R only appears in English loan words. The letters C and U never appear alone and are always part of the digraphs Ch and Ou. 

'''&lt;big&gt;Digraphs&lt;/big&gt;'''

These are combinations of letters which represent one sound. 

An En On represent the three nasal vowels /ã/, /ẽ/, /õ/  respectively.

Ch Dj Ng Tj represent the consonants /[[Voiceless postalveolar fricative|ʃ]]/, /[[Voiced palato-alveolar affricate|d͡ʒ]]/, /[[Velar nasal|ŋ]]/, /[[Voiceless palato-alveolar affricate|t͡ʃ]]/.

Ou represents the vowel /[[Close back rounded vowel|u/]].

2. Slu Creole lacks the uvular r /ʁ/ present in other varieties of Antillean Creole such as Guadeloupean Creole. Where this sound would occur Slu Creole instead uses /w/; Marie /maˈʁi/ (Guadeloupean), /maˈwi/ (St.Lucian).

[[File:SAND Maurice Masques et bouffons 07.jpg|200px|thumb|Scaramuccia in 1860]]

'''Scaramouche''' (from Italian '''''scaramuccia''''', literally "little skirmisher"), also known as '''scaramouch''', is a [[stock character|stock]] clown character of the [[commedia dell'arte]] (comic theatrical arts of [[Italian literature]]). The role combined characteristics of the ''[[Zanni]]'' (servant) and the ''[[Il Capitano|Capitano]]'' (masked henchman). Usually attired in black Spanish dress and [[burlesque|burlesquing]] a [[Don (honorific)|Don]], he was often beaten by [[Harlequin]] for his boasting and cowardice.

==History==
Although [[Tiberio Fiorillo]] (1608–1694) was not the first to play the role, he greatly developed and popularized it. He removed the mask, used white powder on his face, and employed grimaces. He had a small beard, long mustache, and wore a predominantly black costume with a white ruff. In France he became known as scaramouche.&lt;ref&gt;Hartnoll 1983, pp. 282 ("Fiorillo, Tiberio"), 735 ("Scaramuccia").&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pietro Paolini - Portrait of Tiberio Fiorilli as Scaramouche.jpg|thumb|300px|''Portrait of Tiberio Fiorilli as Scaramouche'' by [[Pietro Paolini]]]]
In the 19th century the English actor [[Joseph Grimaldi]] and his son [[J. S. Grimaldi]] made numerous appearances as Scaramouche.

==Character==
Scaramouche entertains the audience by his "grimaces and affected language". Salvator Rosa says that [[Coviello]] (like Scaramouche) is "sly, adroit, supple, and conceited". In Molière's ''[[Le Bourgeois gentilhomme|The Bourgeois Gentleman]]'', Coviello disguises his master as a Turk and pretends to speak Turkish. Both Scaramouche and Coviello can be clever or stupid—as the actor sees fit to portray him.

==In puppetry==
Scaramouche is one of the great characters in the [[Punch and Judy]] puppet shows (a performative art with roots in [[commedia dell'arte]]). In some scenarios, he is the owner of The Dog, another stock character. During performances, Punch frequently strikes Scaramouche, causing his head to come off his shoulders. Because of this, the term ''scaramouche'' has become associated with a class of puppets with extendable necks.

==Scaramouche in popular culture==

* ''Scaramouche Jones'' (2002) is a [[One-person show|solo '''play''']] by Justin Butcher, which was premiered in its full form by [[Pete Postlethwaite]]. In this 100-minute [[monologue]] an aging clown recounts, at the turn of the millennium, the [[picaresque]] story of his life, from his early childhood in Trinidad at the start of the 20th century, the son of a gypsy prostitute and an Englishman, through his harsh misadventures in the slave trade and in wartime Poland, where as a gravedigger he found his vocation as a clown while striving to keep children amused by [[parody]]ing their imminent slaughter.&lt;ref name=Knapper-2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Knapper|first=Stephen|editor=Robb, David |title=Clowns, Fools and Picaros: Popular Forms in Theatre, Fiction and Film| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAqeFGf_WDEC&amp;pg=PA127 |year=2007 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn=90-420-2340-6| pages=127, 135–138| chapter=Scaramouche: The Mask and the Millenium}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In the opening chapter of the book ''[[Phule's Company]]'' by [[Robert Asprin]], the main character Willard Phule uses Scaramouche as his '''alias'''. ("Scaramouche?"

* Inspired by "Bohemian Rhapsody", Scaramouche is the '''name''' of the lead female role in the [[jukebox musical]] ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]''.
* In [[Arthur Ransome]]'s children's novel ''[[Swallowdale]]'' (1931) the mother of the Amazon Pirates, Nancy and Peggy, '''calls''' them scaramouches in the chapter "The Race".
* In the 2017 revival of the animated series ''[[Samurai Jack]]'', Jack encounters a robotic assassin '''named''' Scaramouche (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]] in an imitation of [[Sammy Davis Jr.]]), who behaves flamboyantly and loses his head in a manner not dissimilar from the stock character of his namesake.
* Former Secretary of State and US Senator for Massachusetts, John Kerry, owned a '''yacht''' called "Scaramouche".&lt;ref name="John Kerrys Yacht"&gt;{{cite news |last= Mortman |first=Howard |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5130922/ns/politics-howard_mortman/t/gas-hog-boat-doesnt-fit-kerrys-image/ |title=Gas-hog boat doesn't fit Kerry's image |work=[[NBC News]] |date=2004-06-04 |accessdate=2018-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Security, Territory, Population''''' is a part of [[Foucault's lectures at the Collège de France|a lecture series]] given by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] at the [[Collège de France]] between 1977 and 1978 and published posthumously based on audio recordings. In it, Foucault examines the notion of [[biopolitics]] as a new technology of power over populations that is distinct from punitive disciplinary systems, by tracing the history of [[governmentality]], from the first centuries of the Christian era to the emergence of the modern nation state. These lectures illustrate a radical turning point in Foucault's work in which a shift to the problematic of the government of self and others occurred.

== Territory ==
Foucault tries to trace the 'government of things' in relation to modern society, starting with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] ''[[The Prince]]'' and its reception&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 87-114 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Machiavellian literature wanted to replace the ability of the prince to hold on to his principality with something entirely new: an art of government.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 92-109 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault then notices that this art of government was internal to society itself, not external, this type of self-government was practiced rit throughout European society; such as Italy, Germany, France, etc. which was seized upon by the modern nation state from which it took up as its central practices. This is from as early as the 16th century which in due course enabled the elimination of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] prince as a transcendental, singularity figure of Machiavelli's prince.

All of society was enmeshed within this process including the prince (ruler) himself, thus a century later government became political and collaborative with economy (modern [[political science]] as its 'rational' spokesman) and its partnership with [[political economy]]. Foucault further notices that political economy had a new tool called statistics founded by the [[Physiocrats]] economists&lt;ref&gt;Foucault makes mention the infamous group for this 'scientific state apparatus' the [[Physiocrats]] ''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 33-49 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault mentions an important figure from this period which, according to Foucault was highly influential a Physiocrat economist [[Louis Paul Abeille]] Security, Territory, Population p. 30 pp. 50-52; see notes n. 1 p. 50, n. 17, p. 52 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (another term for scientific government) and it is with [[François Quesnay]] that this process can be found the very notion of economic government. So, according to a text quoted by Foucault written by [[Guillaume de La Perrière]] "government is the right disposition of things arranged so as to lead a suitable end."&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 96 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Political means the institutions that are governing the rest of society; government covered by legal institutions which gives both the political electorate, political executive and political legitimacy,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 135-161 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 142-149 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault traces this practice to the ancient Greek text from the [[Pythagoreans]] known as ''nomas'' (meaning the law) and according to this text the shepherd is the lawmaker, he directs the flock, indicates the right direction and says how the sheep must mate to have good offspring.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 137-140 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault then reads into [[Robert Castel]]'s work; ''The Psychiatric Order'', an essential read according to Foucault, where the techniques were finally finalised during the 18th century of this absolute global project which was directed towards the whole of society.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 117-119 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 10-14 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Which was public hygiene and a whole battery of other techniques were used concerning the education of children, assistance to the poor, and through the psychiatric order, the institution of workers tutelage was coordinated through psychiatric practices. These technologies of power, Foucault claims, were introduced into the 18th century emerging prison system which migrated into the modern surveillance society through the infamous system that [[Jeremy Bentham]] tried to introduce, the [[Panopticon]];&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 117, p. 131; see notes 7 and 8 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the modern internal and external surveillance system that modern society inhabits 'self watch' and 'self government'.

Accomplishing the unintended axiomatic affect of unaccountability, while the full focal point of a ruler is often presented unchallenged to the populace as a system of unimaginable alterations, self-perpetuating and self regularity (among those who inhabit the system), where clearly defined roles are defined and repeated right throughout the system(through norms).&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 11-13 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The system can readjust itself to whatever is thrown at it (an internal firewall integral to the system where the dangerous individual can be spotted and isolated at will). This was accomplished, according to Foucault, (rather paradoxically) from power relations elsewhere from other institutions in order to analyse them from the point of view of other technologies to free them elsewhere to form new systematic institutions as new knowledge objects. Foucault traces this original practice to government practices of the Middle Ages, where the term government meant an entirely different definition as modern society knows it. For example, 'enough wheat to govern Paris for two years', this covers a wide semantic view, it also refers to control of one's body, soul and behaviour, conduct, diet, the care given to an individual. Which Foucault very often refers to as 'governmentality', self conduct or self-government. Foucault traces this tactic back through history to the east (Mediterranean East, Egypt, Assyrian Empire, Babylonian etc.) which was specific to those societies. In Foucault own words this very aspect of Foucault's own work is still a work in progress, and is not a finalised research. However, Foucault situates this type of pastoral power squarely onto the new founded Christian Church where an organized religion ruled an entire society politically for 1500 years. And what was produced or outcome of all this turbulence was constant battles of supremacy for this type of pastoral power, government over men and their souls.

The Church rapidly colonized this type of new power between 11th and 18th century, and according to Foucault, the church laid claim to the daily government of men in their real lives on the grounds of their salvation and no example of this exist anywhere in history of societies.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 191-226 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 227-253 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 232-253 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Foucault research goes on to show that all the religious struggles from this period were fundamentally struggles over who would actually have the right to govern men, and to govern men in their daily lives they were practically struggles over who had the right to this power. Foucault then derives from this that from the 11th to the 18th century all the struggles of religion (wars of religion) were fundamentally struggles over who would actually have the right to govern men, and to govern men in their daily lives and in details and materiality of their existence; they were struggles over who has this power, from whom it derives, how it is exercised, the margin of autonomy for each, the qualification of those who exercise it, the limits of their jurisdiction, what recourse is possible against them, and what control is exercised over each. The [[Protestant Reformation]] traversed this relationship of pastorate power and what resulted from the reformation, although an historical event, was a formidable reinforcement of the pastorate system of religious power (political power in modern societies).

This type of religious power (pastoral power) was simply a reorganization of pastoral power from within, but, however, this type of reorganization of pastoral power encroached on the sovereigns (ruler) political power at the same time, it was not a smooth transition as is often portrayed. This led to a succession of tumultuous upheavals and revolts over this period, 11th-18th century; [[Norman Conquest]], [[English Civil War]], [[The Anarchy]], [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Crusades]], [[Peasants' Revolt]], [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]], [[popular revolt in late medieval Europe]]. All of which are well attested too, Foucault refers to these revolts as revolts against conduct, the most radical of which were the Protestant reformation. Foucault then concludes that this political process can be traced to the general context of resistances, revolts and great insurrections of conduct (Peasants' Revolt of 1524-1526 for example).

== Raison d'État (reason of State) ==
Foucault concludes that these insurrections of conduct push started the transition of the pastoral of souls to the political government of men and the revolts, insurrections of conduct and resistances should be seen in this context. The new economic and consequently the political relations which the old feudal structures were unable to manage and lacked any effective framework, with which they were unable to cope. Foucault notices that the pastorate community were swamped with everyday life of individuals where it took charge of a whole series of questions and problem concerning material life, property, education of children. This led to an re-emergence of philosophy as the answer to the fundamental question of everyday life, in relation to others, in relation to those in authority, to the sovereign, or the feudal lord, and in order to direct one's mind as well, and to direct it in the right direction, to its salvation, certainly, but also to the truth.

Philosophy took over from this period; on the religious function of how to conduct oneself as a result of taking a form that was not specially religious or ecclesiastical. With the advent of the 16th century western society enter the age of forms of conducting, directing, and government. Foucault then considers these great upheavals of [[Medieval Europe]] as nothing else but the translation of the continuum from god to men, political institutions and the political order. Which was broken by all the upheaval that Europe had suffered. This produced a series of conflicts among those who tried to define sovereignty (not political sovereignty as we know it) but the art of government, ''principia naturae'' (reason of government) which brought in the political philosophy doctrine, known as [[raison d'État]] (reason of state).&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 1-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 16th century, Western society begins to define itself as territorial and expansionary with means of security as its primary focus.

Foucault reads into this that the philosophy of raison d'État having found its way into Europe through the [[Peace of Westphalia]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-310 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; (known as the [[Balance of power (international relations)|Balance of power]] in modern thought);&lt;ref&gt;Foucault mentions the term as it was known then, Balance of Europe; however, the word 'Europe' was an entirely new concept in 17th century Europe, it had no basis nor meaning to thinkers of political thought from this period but the term balance of Europe and whose chief political architect and origin of the term can be found in the works of [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. The other 'scientific' proponent of the idea of balance of Europe can be found in the works of none other than mathematician [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] "What is the balance of Europe?It is the idea of a political-military physics in which variable antagonistic forces are exercised in terms of random violent clashes of some with others, of some against others. The balance of Europe is not a problem of statics, but of dynamics." ''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 297-310 p. 308, notes 14, 16 for Guicciardini 2007&lt;/ref&gt; this can be found in the works of Italian political philosopher [[Giovanni Botero]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 237-240 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; where Botero concluded that the state is a firm domination over peoples and to keep hold of its preservation one was expected to have knowledge of the appropriate means for founding preserving, and expanding such a domination.

This political philosophy of raison d'État was made as the chief political philosophy (with its accompanied rationality) in mainland Europe. Foucault's analysis of raison d'État (here [[Bogislaw Philipp von Chemnitz]] son of [[Martin von Chemnitz]]) writing under the pseudonym ''[[Hippolithus a Lapide]]'' first starts to query the first uses of the doctrine of raison d'État at the Treaty of Westphalia, where among the diplomatic community the doctrine starts to become popular for discussion&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 240-248, pp. 250-252, notes, 24-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;) offers interesting conclusions of this new type of power the transition of the government of souls to the government of men. This first takes place between 13th century and the 18th century, from the 16th century the subject starts to appear of an idea of perpetual peace taken from the Middle Ages idea. Which primarily belonged to the church, from the 16th century therefore, exists the idea of a 'balance of power', with few exceptions, this idea became problematic, it started or rather had to included the populace.

The solution to this problematic situation was the inclusion, within the philosophy of raison d'État, the incorporation of the populace which the machinery of the state had to govern. The government of men as Foucault refers to it, directly from the pastorate community to the transfer to the political community. Foucault then further shows that raison d'État was not much concerned with legality (as we know the term) but with political necessity; politics is concerned with necessity and if necessary politics must become violent lending to [[coup d'état]]; this means that it is obliged to sacrifice, to sever, cause harm, and it is led to be unjust and murderous. This produced a whole series of problematic solutions to this problem, of which the population became of primary concern, coup d'état&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 260-267 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 277-278 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; politics isn't the practice as we know it today. Under the auspices of the [[Renaissance]] was not primarily concerned with legitimacy, but survival of the state.

Foucault then tries to show only when the problem of population and security starts taking effect amongst the different practices that the consideration of population becomes a worry. Foucault then notices a point of departure pointing out the idea of sedition and revolt starts to enter texts, but 'the people' proved elusive to define all around Europe, and never entered popular discussion, at first point of juncture was the privileged titled nobles appointed and rewarded through the honours system created by the monarch and sanctioned through the legal system of the day; the entire [[Nobility]] knight's, barons, dukes, earl's and their rivals began to become seen and known as 'the people'.&lt;ref&gt;"The people were too hard for the King in property; and then in arms too hard for him. We must either lay the foundation in property, or else it will not stand. Property, generally, is now with the people; the government, therefore, must be there." ''Thomas Burton Diary Volume 3'' pp. 146-148, note 36 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"All government is built upon propriety, else the poor must rule it. All nations are so. Let us therefore consider things before persons. Government is built upon propriety, therefore lands, leases, or goods, should be represented, rather than the people."Quoted from Captain Baynes in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in ''Thomas Burton Diary Volume 3'' pp. 146-148, note 36 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;A certain Mr. Neville refers to the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] brought in by [[Henry VIII]] and parliament by the authority and power given to the monarch of the day by the [[Act of Supremacy]] passed by parliament under Henry VIII which brought the first ensemble apparatus of what would later become known as the Welfare state 350 years later Quoted From ''Thomas Burton Diary Of Parliamentary Debate Volume 3 '' pp. 132-134 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I wonder what is the necessity for this previous vote. We are returned to the law of nature. It is said in the Bill the people have all acknowledged him. I thought the people had been only here. Either he is so, or he is not so. If so, there is no necessity for this House declaring him so. If not, there is need of some consideration. The Bill makes it hereditary. Where it speaks of successor, it mentions nothing of the Petition and Advice. It is fit you should be satisfied whether he be so. It should be made out. It makes him Supreme Magistrate, and gives him as great a power as ever King of England had. I would know what the words mean, if it give him not the executive and legislative power as fully as any King. Consider whether you do not put yourselves out of a capacity of recalling your liberties, by this step. First, you settle a monarch; one estate before the other two" Quoted from Captain Baynes Baynes refers to the 'people' in terms only limited to those 'elected' "that out of the 658 members sent to the House, only 171 were sent by the people. In 1794, "the majority of the House of Commons," for England and Wales, was computed to be "chosen by less than eight thousand, out of eight millions" which comprises less than 00.001% of the 'people' to the House of commons; see note 38 taken from ''Thomas Burton Diary Of Parliamentary Debate Volume 3'' pp. 145-150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
Foucault considers the breakthrough of "this governmental reasoning" of the population as a substantial event in Western history and society comparable to the [[scientific revolution]] of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-286 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Where a substantial transfer of techniques and technologies were transferred from the sovereign individual (the monarch) to a new modified apparatus known as the [[Disciplinary institutions]], of the 18th century and its scientific representatives [[Carceral archipelago]], ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (all in the space of 80 years Foucault's notices) which culminated into a new version known as [[nation state]]s. This change took place in the 16th century and continued right through into the 19th century. Foucault then gives examples of this procedure through the system known as ''[[raison d'État]]'', from this analytical view of the state by [[Claude Fleury]],&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 323-324 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 331, notes 31, 32, 34, 38 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; war, raising finance, justice; there must be an abundance of men (large scale phenomena of population).

It is not the absolute number of the population that counts, but its relationship with the set composition of forces: the size of the territory, natural resources, wealth, commercial activities and so on. From Fleury's point of view, according to Foucault, the more there are of men, the stronger the state and the prince will be. So, according to Fleury, it is not expanse of land (expansion of the territory) that contributes greatness of the state but fertility and the number of men. Foucault then introduces into his [[Ontogenetic]] and, [[Phylogenetic]] investigations the concept of '[[police]]' (see also [[miasma theory of disease]]); not the police of the [[criminal justice system]] as we know it today, but as concept known at that time as urbanisation of the territory and administrative concern; which means making the kingdom, the entire territory into a large industrious town. Foucault then considers how [[Mercantilism]] played a big role in this new context of European balance of power; these are the mercantilist requirements: every country should try to have the largest possible population, second; the entire population be eligible for working and be able to be put to work, third; wages given to the population be as low as possible, fourth; the cost price of goods at the lowest price as possible. Police according to Foucault consists of a sovereign exercise of royal power over individuals who are therefore subjects.

The actual police is the direct governmentality of the sovereign who rules through raison d'État. What Foucault means by the governmentality of the sovereign is the mind of the police runs through all of the populations, collective consciousness therefore, reducing criminality not its complete elimination, for political and economic reasons (see ''[[Discipline and Punish]]''), not through fear, but the knowledge of the police as a system with its own structural objective as laws, judicial, legislative operating as a microcosm of the societal body, which ultimately represents the sovereigns will. Initially, however, this was not the sole intention of the police as we know it where Foucault introduces the original founder of the system now known to us as the police, [[Nicolas Delamare|Nicolas Delamare (1639-1723)]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Delamare 1639-1723 Delamare served as Superintendent at Chatelet from 1673 to 1710 under the lieutenancy of La Reynie this is Foucault's only mention of La Reynie in his lectures for more information on Delamare see ''Security, Territory, Population'' the following notes p. 53 n. 26, pp. 359-360 n. 1-9 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (Foucault doesn’t mention the real founder of the police [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]]).

Foucault concentrates on how the police became an integral feature and intermingled with population, tracing the system on its foundation on how this is arranged around the composition of forces which the whole Western system of the balance of power, raison E’tat was organised and arranged around. This system consisted of an organised scientifically trained professional army,(as opposed to a private army organised around the service of the king) incorporated within this military system is [[Thantopolitics]]([[Political power]] used through the military system for the purposes of warfare by other means) for the purposes of the slaughtering of millions of people if necessary,on an industrial scale,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-310 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 299, pp. 304-306, p. 307, notes 9-19 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a system of legitimacy, comprising the sovereign, not the sovereign as a singular ruler but as an organised superstructure institution(modern government) comprising societal state functions, [[Political sovereignty]] which guaranteed the sovereign's legitimacy, judiciary, legislator, [[Parliamentary]] system; political power, political executive, political elite, and a political communication system while not offered any considerable attention by some Social scientist and historians nevertheless,these techniques do indeed exist,where it is admitted as such by those actual professional technicians(one such technique used is known professionally as the [[Sabido method]] pioneered by [[Miguel Sabido]] derived from the field of [[entertainment-education]])and the political arm of this technique simply known as [[Demagogue]] who are involved in the operation of these techniques of deception and persuasion and a whole group of professional manipulators are needed which is primarily aimed at the entire worldwide television audience and political community.&lt;ref&gt;"Since The Arrival of mass communication,a particular kind of image making has grown into a central feature of the political processes of Western democracies.The book will argue that a core feature of mass democratic politics is ''hype making''.Just as magicians smoke-and mirrors-to distract their audidences and conjure up illusions so too does the political machine and its media staffers.In today's Western democracies,television is the primary(but not exclusive)vehicle for this smoke-and-mirrors show.This show involves four sets of players:politicians-as-performers;the spin industry;media workers(journalists,presenters/hosts and researchers);and their audiencies. A fifth set of players are policy makers-but they tend to remain back stage;shielded from as much scrutiny as possible by the smoke and mirriors show.A core aim of this book is to unravel the symbiotic relationships between journalists,and spin doctors and politicians within contemporary televisualized politics.The book will argue that Demagoguery has become a core feature 20th century Western politics,with politics now characterized by a range of demagogic arts geared to steering mass public opinion.These demagogic arts will be described and analyzed." Eric Louwe ''The Media and Political Process'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David O Poindexter]] ''Out Of The Darkness Of Centuries:A 45 Year Odyssey To Discover The Use Of Mass Media For Human Betterment'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Halisbury Laws Of England Volume 34 Parliament 4th Edition 1984''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Indeed, techniques of deception have undergone enormous improvements since Orwell's time. Many of these techniques were developed in connection with the advertising and marketing of commercial products and services, and then adapted to politics. Their distinguishing feature is that they can be bought for money. More recently, cognitive science has helped to make the techniques of deception even more effective, giving rise to political professionals who concentrate only on "getting results"

These professionals take pride in their accomplishments, and may even enjoy the respect of an American public that admires success no matter how it is achieved. That fact casts doubt on Karl Popper's concept of an open society, which is based on the recognition that, while perfect knowledge is unattainable, we can gain a better understanding of reality by engaging in critical thinking.

Popper failed to recognise that in democratic politics, gathering public support takes precedence over the pursuit of truth. In other areas, such as science and industry, the impulse to impose one's views on the world encounters the resistance of external reality. But in politics the electorate's perception of reality can be easily manipulated. As a result, political discourse, even in democratic societies, does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of reality.

The reason democratic politics leads to manipulation is that politicians do not aspire to tell the truth. They want to win elections, and the best way to do that is to skew reality to their own benefit."

And finally, the final piece in the jigsaw puzzle; the western political system of [[consent of the governed]]. This system at least gives the rationale of why it was necessary to have on board a widely disparate atomized populace; and its use, through the not widely known and little understood function of the [[Royal Prerogative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/royal-prerogative.pdf|format=PDF|title=Review of the Executive Royal Prerogative Powers 2010|publisher=Justice.gov.uk|accessdate=29 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091111115352/http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/royal-prerogative.pdf|archivedate=11 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/422/422.pdf |format=PDF|title=Taming the Prerogative: Strengthening Ministerial Accountability to Parliament 2004|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault doesn't use the phrase [[Royal Prerogative]] but uses the term 'Royal power' ''The Birth Of Biopolitics'' pp. 7-9, p. 37 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of which can be traced back to the Middle Ages from where the western system of political power gets its central idea, from the point of view and simple justification of consent of the governed, legitimacy and political power. This legitimacy, which is exercised through the use of Parliamentary democracy(see also [[Greek government debt crisis]], [[National unity government]], [[European sovereign debt crisis]]), was essential to the western system of political power and modern government;"The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government","The people" identifies the entire body of the citizens of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes'" or "Popular sovereignty or the sovereignty of the people is the political principle that the legitimacy of the state is created by the will or consent of its people, who are the source of all political power".

All of this Foucault calls the political technology of biopower. This had to have the entire population on board in terms of ‘the police’, which had an entirely different meaning from what we know it today by tracing the concept back through time from the 15th century and 16th century usage, previous thinkers meant the term as a community association governed by a public authority and political power with accountability to a public authority. By quoting [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi]] “of laws and regulations that concern the interior of a state and which endeavors to strengthen and increase the power of this state and make good use of its forces".&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 314-315 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population''; see note 8 pp. 329-330 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

What Foucault reveals is that the original police had a different function as we know it today; for example one of their primary function was to administer the state in the guise of statisticians, allocating resources, supervision of grain in times of crisis, ensuring circulation of goods and men, secure the development of the state's forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 311-332 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This was so successful this then led to an extension of the franchising out in the form of recruitment of the then [[University]] system. This bought in the next generation of administrators for the new ‘nation state’ system. This bought in two types of police; administrators who formed the [[Polizeiwissenschaft]]; the science of police or the science of government of the state, the other type would become known as what we know and associate the term today [[criminal justice system]], [[Law enforcement]], [[Forensic science]] and the modern uniformed police [[Polizeistaat]] police state, translated into English as policing of the state.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 318-319 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 330; see note 14 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally from Germany, this system spread right throughout Europe from the middle of the 17th century and most crucially, this Polizeiwissenschaft grow a substantial bibliography of this system ‘science of police’ by the 19th century. Foucault's research shows that some 4000 different pamphlets and articles had emerged from 1520-1850 under the titles of “science of police in the broad sense” and “science of the police in the strict sense”.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 318 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population p. 330; see note 11 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as [[Cameral]] science(the new modern [[Public administration]]). The future administrators for the future modern nation state system with many functions; such as [[bureaucrats]], [[civil servants]], [[Think tanks]], [[public policy]] makers, [[economists]] all from the university system.

== Obedience ==
For Foucault obedience was a vital mechanism of salvation of the government, not in the form of blind loyalty, but in the form of political salvation of the state(see [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|Oath of Allegiance]] for example). This led to political theorists of the day juxtaposing theories concerning state, government, body politics, and political power; these theorists dare not call these laws divine or God-made law, but instead refer to them as 'philosophical'. As in [[Gabriel Naudé]],&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population p. 252, note 40 2007&lt;/ref&gt; an agent of Richelieu's, where he refers to the salvation of the state "The coup d'état does not comply with natural, universal noble and philosophical, it complies with an artificial, particular, political justice concerning the necessity of the state&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population pp. 260-261, p. 263, pp. 280-281, notes 20-21, 24-25, 26 2007&lt;/ref&gt;". For Foucault, politics is not above this process which it cannot be afforded, therefore, is not something that has to fall within a remit of legality or a system of laws. Politics, according to Foucault's use of the term, is concerned with necessity, necessity of the state which puts to an end to all privileges in order to make itself obeyed by everyone. So you do not have government connected with legality, but raison d'État connected with necessity.

Foucault then touches briefly on the theatrical practice of raison d'État and its prevalence over legitimacy. Which would be rather ironical as this is the main problem of theatrical practice in politics, which was in reality the practice of raison d'État. The theatre where this is played out in the form of dramatization and a constant mode of manifestation of the state and the sovereign as the holder of state power. Thus, for Foucault analysis this contrasts differently with and in opposition to traditional ceremonies of royalty which from anointment to coronation up to the entry into towns or major cities or iconic, famous funerals of infamous monarchs, this marked the religious association of the sovereign, or at least the sovereign's alliance with the character and association with religious power and theology. This, Foucault notices was [[William Shakespeare]]'s main intention where the political representation (modern representation of this is media visual representation of political power, political consultants, image makers (media consultants), and 'power politics' and its constant fixation with voting and leading political personalities) of the sovereign [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] for example was a part of historical drama, although based on real people and events, but for all intents and purposes was political representation in the form of plots, intrigues, disgraces, preferences, exclusions, good guys and bad guys and political exiles, where the theatre represents the state itself.

Foucault now turns his attention to obedience and the population and why this was a problem among political theorists of the times. He then produces [[Francis Bacon]]'s text "Of Seditions and Troubles". In this essay Bacon gives a complete description on the physics of sedition, sedition and the precautions to be taken against it, and of government of the 'people'. This became a worry for Bacon and other political theorists; the first signs of sedition were circulation of libels, pamphlets and discourse against the state and those who govern. Second, Bacon notices the reversal of values or evaluations which puts the existence at risk. Weakness in the chain of command. Foucault reads into Bacon the theory of revolt of the people and there are two categories of individuals within the state, the common people (very often referred in text as [[Peasants]], the [[People]], the [[Common people]], the poor, or at times [[Vagabond (person)|Vagabond]] vagrants) and the nobility, what differentiates the common people and the nobility is their unshared interest.

They do not have any common interest between the two groups in Bacon's view the common people are too slow to engage in revolt and sedition. But if the common people and the nobility ever unite and become one unit they represent a threat to the sovereign's rule. A slow people and a weak nobility (because of their small number) mean that sedition can be prevented and discontents stopped from contaminating each other. Bacon then views the process of the danger of sedition where you can either buy the nobility or you can execute them.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 267-275 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of the common people becomes a different matter, they are not easily bought. So Bacon himself offers a whole series of measures and reforms that should be implemented, reducing the rate of interest, avoiding excessively large estates, increased wages, promoting external trade increasing the value of raw materials through work, and assuring provisions of transport to foreign countries.

While the differences between Bacon and Machiavelli appear subtle, it was 250 years later that the political model of reforms changed, why? Foucault was not much interested into the notion of reform as 'cure', but what was behind the underlying mechanism that was driving the system of reform ensuring reforms become a permanent feature of 'failure'. Foucault begins to trace through this development through the political model of reform and one crucial development was the economy, a politics of economic calculation with Mercantilism and for Foucault this was not just a theory but was above all else a political practice. The invention of the political campaign which Foucault traces back through its original modern founder, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who according to Foucault actually invented the modern political campaign by means of lampoons and pamphlets and more importantly, invented those professional manipulators of opinion who were called at the time ''[[publiciste]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 283, notes 59, 60 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, for Foucault raison d'État must always act on the collective consciousness of the population, not only to impose some true or false belief on them, as when, for example, sovereigns want to create belief in their own legitimacy or in illegitimacy of their rivals, but in such away that the collective opinion can be modified along with their behaviour as economic and political subjects. The main function of public opinion is to produce a politics of believable truth within raison d'État.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 272-283. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious example of all this is that propaganda, in its political sense has a twofold objective: 1, The main function of public opinion is to produce an emergence, alliance between political propaganda and a belief system of politics of truth within collective consciousness, a version of political continuity within raison d’Etat, this practice of political reform, while ensuring that the essential features of the system remain intact, gets passed on to future generations ensuring failure.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 272-283.(2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 2, The other main political purposes of propaganda is to make sure that the chaos of modern living becomes accepted as the norm therefore, rendering whole swathes of society useless (through cultural practices), in its objectives to do anything about it. You can do something about it, but only within the rules of a political tool, even within the confines of political buffoons who appear to have no hold or control of the system that they are in charge of.

This political tool is soiled and rigged against those who use it and cannot be used for practical change but its power comes from those who gives comfort to those who use it in the hope of a false belief of change can happen leaving the practicalities of the system as ‘real’ events. This, Foucault notices produced two consensus correlations namely; birth of economists, birth of the ‘’publicistes’’ known as economy and public opinion the two correlative elements of field of reality that is emerging as the direct correlate of government.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 163-185 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 191-226 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Salvation ==
[[Mercantilism]], according to Foucault, was the first rationalization of the exercise of power as a practice of government; it is the first time that a knowledge of the state can be employed as tactics for the state, namely statistics. Foucault begins to chart through this historical, political reasoning behind the doctrine [[raison d'État]] (reason of state). The time of the Middle Ages where the idea existed of an indefinite permanent character of political power and government. This perpetual discourse, the idea of progress in men's knowledge about themselves and towards others, however, one thing was internally missing from this analysis, namely the notion of population. Foucault traces the conceptual discourse of the populace back to the Middle Ages definition of the pastorate which to the Middle Ages mind meant salvation, obedience and truth. First of all the discourse of raison d'État and salvation; Foucault manages to trace conceptually the system of salvation through the 17th century usage of coup d'état politics. Foucault notices that entire treatise were devoted to the very notion of coup d'état, for example a text written in 1639 by [[Gabriel Naudé]], entitled ''Considerations sur les coups d'etat'' and writing in 1631 Foucault sites [[Jean Sirmond]] ''Le Coup d’Estat de Louis XIII''.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 280-281, notes 19, 20, 24, 26 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bang-Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War''''' is a 2000 autobiographical styled text about the [[Bang-Bang Club]], a group of four South African photographers active within the townships of [[South Africa]] during the [[apartheid]] period, particularly between 1990 and 1994. The journalists were [[Kevin Carter]], [[Greg Marinovich]], [[Ken Oosterbroek]], and [[João Silva (photographer)|João Silva]]. The book was co-authored by two of the journalists, [[Greg Marinovich]] and [[João Silva (photographer)|João Silva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldpressphoto.org/people/joao-silva|title=The Bang-Bang Club, a factual account of news photographers in South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the years between 1990 and 1994 the fight from apartheid to democracy in South Africa was extremely  violent.  About the members of the Bang Bang Club was much written at this time and later too.  But the stories painted  a picture "of a group of hard-living men wo worked, played and hung out together pretty much all of the time", how Greg Marinovich wrote in the preface of the book. The next sentence started with the words: "Let us set the record straight: …" In 1997 started Marinovich and Joao Silva to write the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Marinovich|first1= Greg|author-link1= Greg Marinovich|last2= Silva|first2= João|author-link2= João Silva (photographer)|date= 20 September 2000|title= The Bang-Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War|url= https://books.google.se/books?id=_6cyzX7DzYkC&amp;dq|chapter=Preface|location= New York, N.Y.|publisher= Basic Books|isbn= 0-465-04413-1|id= {{LIBRIS|4962156}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the acknowledgments were mentioned the many ''Impimpi'' – informants who contributed to the book. ''Impimpi'' is a Zulu word and in the glossary of the book it is translated as "spy". These 45 people, the parents of Kevin Carter also, helped Marinovich and Silva to write the book "straight". [[Judith Matloff]], also listed under ''impimpi'', wrote in an article: "But the reporters and photographers stationed in South Africa at the time were also compassionate human beings who exposed themselves to danger because they wanted to record history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cjr.org/review/bang_bang_off_target.php|first=Judith|last=Matloff|title=Bang Bang Off Target| publisher=Columbia Journalism Review, CJR|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other witnesses or impimpi for the book from that era include: [[James Nachtwey]], [[Peter Magubane]], [[Ken Oosterbroek#Death|Brian Mkhize]], [[Gilles Peress]], [[Jo%C3%A3o Silva (photographer)#Personal life| Vivian Silva]], and more.

The book was first published in January 2000 by William Heinemann, London, UK and then by Basic Books, New York. It was translated into Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and  2015 into German. It is published in 19 Editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/263261-the-bang-bang-club-snapshots-from-a-hidden-war|title=The Bang-Bang Club Snapshots From a Hidden War published in 19 Editions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Book review ==
Niranjan Karnik&lt;ref name=karnik&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/niranjan-s-karnik-md-phd-fapa|title=Niranjan Karnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the review for H-SAfrica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/10670/reviews/10938/karnik-marinovich-and-silva-bang-bang-club-snapshots-hidden-war|first=Niranjan|last=Karnik|title=Review of Marinovich, Greg; Silva, Joao, The Bang Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War, H-SAfrica, H-Net Reviews, June 2003. The Personal and Professional Price of Journalism|publisher=H-Net: Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of his review Niranjan Karnik wrote: "I have several concerns about the future of this profession".&lt;ref name="karnik"/&gt; He expressed that conflict journalist need a "debriefing" after the experience in a conflict or war zone "akin to what the International Committee of the Red Cross requires of its fieldworkers". The usefulness of the book is for him: "Its overall value is not as much in its use as source of history, but in how it openly exposes the way journalists suffer in the course of their work, and the heavy ethical and moral questions they face on an daily basis."

Karnik wrote that "Students of the media and aspiring journalists will find special value and significance in this book, for its unsparing and often graphic portrayal of events in South Africa."

The moral and ethical questions are central themes in the book. Karnik discuss the themes in the example of the [[The vulture and the little girl|noted photograph]] by Kevin Carter.

{{Cquote|Carter, for example, won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for a photograph of a starving child that he took in south sudan in 1993. The famous photograph shows a small, emaciated girl curled over in exhaustion while a vulture sits a short distance away on the ground next to her. The photograph became the cover image for many humanitarian groups in their fundraising appeals. It also raised ethical questions about the limits that journalists will go to get an image.}}

Karnik explains that the book "lacks the academic and critical analysis", which he is used to write as an author and which he reads in his profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Niranjan_Karnik|title=Author Karnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; But newertheless he wrote that the book: "as a perspective into the dynamics of wartime reporting it is valuable".

== Film adaptation ==
In 2010, the Canadian director [[Steven Silver (film director)|Steven Silver]] released a [[film adaptation]] of the book as a full-feature film also entitled ''[[The Bang Bang Club (film)|The Bang Bang Club]]''.

'''''The Other America''''' ({{ISBN|0-684-82678-X}}) is [[Michael Harrington]]'s best known and likely most influential book. He was an American democratic socialist, writer, political activist, political theorist, professor of political science, radio commentator, and founding member of the [[Democratic Socialists of America]]. He believed that American Socialists could support certain [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidates, including candidates for President.

==Synopsis==
The book was a study of [[poverty in the United States]], published in 1962 by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]. It found a small but emerging audience in an America that was developing a greater self-awareness after the struggles of [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s two terms as President from 1953–1961 had temporarily upended the [[New Deal Coalition]], begun by [[Franklin Roosevelt]], which was revived, at least in spirit, by the election of [[John Kennedy]], in 1960.

==Reception==
A widely read review, "Our Invisible Poor," in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' by [[Dwight Macdonald]] brought the book to the attention of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. ''The Other America'' argued that up to 25% of the nation was living in poverty. Many (such as historian [[Maurice Isserman]]&lt;ref name="WoPMH" /&gt;) believe that this book is responsible for President Lyndon B. Johnson's "[[War on Poverty]]." The [[Penguin Books]] paperback editions have sold over one million copies.&lt;ref name="WoPMH"/&gt; The ''Boston Globe'' editorialized that [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], food stamps and expanded social security benefits were traceable to Harrington’s ideas. With the book's acceptance, many believe Harrington became the pre-eminent spokesman for [[democratic socialism]] in America. By 1980, Harrington considered a run for President himself, though he threw his support to Democratic candidates instead.&lt;ref name="WoPMH"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary film==

The 1999 [[documentary film]] ''Michael Harrington and Today's Other America: Corporate Power and Inequality'' captured the essence of Harrington’s ideas through the use of archival footage and interviews with his colleagues and opponents. Over thirty interviews were filmed, including: 
* [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]
* [[Gloria Steinem]]
* [[William F. Buckley]]
* [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]]
* as well as ordinary people who struggle to make a living, or are dependent on social services.

The documentary included a brief history of socialism in America, and raised questions concerning 
* the merits and relevance of [[Trade union|unions]] today
* the problems of [[migrant workers]], [[farmer]]s, and [[big business]]
* and the American [[health care system]].

|ShortSummary=Time Team come to Binchester with a particular interest in uncovering a ''[[vicus]]'', a civilian settlement supporting the Roman fort of [[Vinovia]].

John's spectacular geophysics indicates not only a possible Roman temple or [[mausoleum]], but also a second, earlier fort. Together with cremation burials, it all forces the team to rethink their priorities.

|ShortSummary=Harold's Field has long been rumoured as a site where [[Harold Godwinson]], later to become King Harold, built a hunting lodge in 1065 after defeating the Welsh. The site is a [[scheduled monument]], protected from excavation; but a local petition has succeeded in persuading [[Cadw]] to allow digging. So Time Team have been invited in to do their stuff. While Stewart believes there are signs of medieval occupation, any finds from an earlier, Saxon period would be a first for this area of Wales. The team are joined by historians Sam Newton and Jeremy Knight, local pottery expert Steve Clarke, and maritime archaeologist Nigel Nayling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">'''Traditional transmission''' (also called '''cultural transmission''') is a design feature of [[language]] that the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Charles F. Hockett]] developed to distinguish the features of human language from those of [[animal communication]]. He discovered thirteen features that all human languages have. Animals might communicate with some of the thirteen basic design features of language but never with all of them. Traditional transmission is exemplified by the fact that language is learned in [[social group]]s. Although there is disagreement about how much linguistic capability humans are born with, it is known that the only way that humans learn language and refine its use as they grow is in social settings.
