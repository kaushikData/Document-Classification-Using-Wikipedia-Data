'''AguaClara''' is an engineering based project team within [[Cornell University|Cornell University's]] Civil and Environmental Engineering Department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cee.cornell.edu|title=Welcome to CEE - School of Civil and Environmental Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; that designs sustainable water treatment plants using [[Open design|open source technology]]. The programs' aims are to "improve drinking water quality through innovative research, knowledge transfer, [[open source]] engineering and design of sustainable, replicable water treatment systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/About+Us |title=AguaClara's About page}}&lt;/ref&gt; AguaClara plants are unique among municipal-scale facilities in that they have no electrical or complex mechanical components and instead operate through hydraulic processes driven by gravity.

The AguaClara program provides undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to enhance their education through hands-on experience working on projects with real applications. In 2012, the [[National Academy of Engineering]] showcased AguaClara as one of the 29 engineering program at US colleges that effectively incorporates real world experiences in their curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.cornell.edu/news/index.cfm?news_id=63286|title=AguaClara featured in NAE Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AguaClara is partnered with Agua para el Pueblo (Water for People), a NGO working in [[Honduras]] who manages the construction and technical support for AguaClara plants.

==History==
AguaClara was formed in 2005 by [[Cornell University]] professor Monroe Weber-Shirk, who volunteered in Central American refugee camps during the 1980s. Weber-Shirk used the connections he developed through his volunteer work to partner with Jacabo Nuñez, the director of Agua para el Pueblo to find the answer to a crucial question: What can we do to treat the dirty water that we are providing  to rural communities?

In 2005, he founded the AguaClara program to address the need for sustainable municipal scale water treatment in resource poor communities. The first AguaClara plant was built in 2006 in Ojojona to serve a population of 2000 people. Currently, there are 8 AguaClara designed plants throughout Honduras serving over 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aguaclara.cornell.edu/projects |title=AguaClara completed plants |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218085509/http://aguaclara.cornell.edu/projects/ |archivedate=February 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design tool==
AguaClara has developed an automated design tool that allows interested parties to input basic design parameters such as flow rate into a simple [[Client–server model|frontend]] and receive customized designs via email in five minutes or less. The user frontend communicates with the AguaClara server to populate [[MathCad]] scripts that calculate design parameters for input into [[AutoCAD]] scripts, which produce the final design. The design algorithms can be continuously improved and any changes will be immediately implemented the next time a design is requested.&lt;ref name="Download Design Tool on AguaClara website"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/Download+Design+Tool | title=Link to download design tool from AguaClara website | accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AguaClara design tool applies an [[economy of scale]] to water treatment design, in that there are almost no marginal costs to produce an additional design. This is significant considering that the [[World Health Organization]] estimates the global unmet demand for improved water at approximately 844 million people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wssinfo.org/data-estimates/introduction/|title=WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program|accessdate=May 15, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514090407/http://www.wssinfo.org/data-estimates/introduction/|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 100 million using surface water sources that would be viable for treatment with AguaClara technology. From the AguaClara website:

{{quote|Thus 125 million people need AguaClara water treatment plants. If we further assume that our goal is to meet this demand in 10 years and that there are an average of 12,000 people per water treatment plant, we obtain an estimate of 1000 plants per year! This estimate does not include population growth or the need to replace aging infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/AGUACLARA/AguaClara+and+Sustainability | title=AguaClara and Sustainability|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Plants==
AguaClara designs gravity-powered water treatment plants that require no electricity and are constructed by its [[AguaClara#Sponsors|implementation partners]]. The plants use hydraulic flocculators and high-flow vertical-flow sedimentation tanks to remove turbidity from surface waters.

'''La 34''', or "La treinta y quatro," once a numbered plantation run by [[United Fruit]], is the first site of an AguaClara plant.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/ESW.Honduras.ws.html Students' project in Honduras brought clean water to rural village]", Cornell University News Service, July 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction on the La 34 plant began in December 2004 and was inaugurated in August 2005.  The plant serves a population of 2000 with a design flow of 285 LPM.

'''Marcala''' The [[Marcala]] plant began in the Fall of 2007 and was completed in June 2008. The plant was upgraded in May 2011 to a flow rate of 3200 LPM.

'''Cuatro Comunidades''' In the Fall of 2008, the AguaClara team designed a water treatment plant with shallower tanks that doesn't need an elevated platform for the plant operator. The full scale pilot facility for this new design was built for the four communities of Los Bayos, Rio Frio, Aldea Bonito and Las Jaguas. Construction  was completed in March 2009.

'''Ajapa''' is a meditation and breathing technique. Tradition holds it comes from the 9 ancient [[Brahma Rishis]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Method==
Ajapa refers to the method discovered and developed to answer questions such as: who am I? and what is the world?

It has been developed into the breathing/meditation technique called [[Ajapa Yoga]]. 
''Ajapa'' means: 'a' - not; 'japa' - repeated, meaning something which goes on by itself without conscious repetition - like breathing. It has also been described as that which remains after the elimination of repulsion.  Repulsion is expansion, like [[exhalation]]; attraction is contraction, like [[inhalation]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Ajapa breathing controls repulsion and involves concentrating on sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">'''Andrei Ivanovich Bogdanov''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Иванович Богданов}}) (1692 – September 11, 1766) was one of the first  [[Russia]]n [[bibliography|bibliographers]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographers]].

Andrei Bogdanov had studied at Academician [[gimnasium]] (a gimnasium of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]). His father was a gunpowder-maker and Andrei had assisted him in his work. In 1727 according to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great's]] edict Bogdanov began work at the field of typographical art.
&lt;!--
'''Андре́й Ива́нович Богда́нов'''в (1692 — 11 сентября 1766, [[Санкт-Петербург]]) — один из первых русских [[Библиография|книговедов]]. Учился в гимназии при [[Петербургская Академия наук|Петербургской Академии Наук]]. Отец его был мастером порохового дела и Андрей Иванович помогал ему, пока указом [[Пётр I|Петра I]] от 1719 года не был определен «в службу к типографскому художеству». Далее работал в Санкт-Петербургской типографии, а после 1727 года — в типографии Академии Наук. С 1730 года Андрей Иванович работал в библиотеке Академии наук. 

Труд Андрея Ивановича Богданова ''«Историческое, географическое и топографическое описание Санкт-Петербурга от начала заведения его, с 1703, по 1751 год»''  —  первое дошедшее до нас произведение, в котором собраны сведения по [[География|географии]], [[Топонимика|топонимике]], административной структуре, населению Санкт-Петербурга. Это по сути энциклопедия столичной жизни первой половины XVIII века.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8813">[[File:Offrande aux autels et a la patrie.png|thumb|Title page of Roustan's first book on Christianity and Patriotism (1764)]]
'''Antoine-Jacques Roustan''' (23 October 1734 – 15 June 1808) was a [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]] pastor and theologian, who engaged in an extensive correspondence with [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].
Unlike Rousseau, he believed that a [[Christian republic]] was practical - that the Christian religion was not incompatible with patriotism or republicanism.{{sfn|Candal|2010}}

==Life==
Roustan was born on 23 October 1734 in [[Geneva]], the son of Jacques Roustan, a [[Protestant]] shoemaker and Marie Baile.
He studied theology at Geneva, and was ordained a minister in 1759.
In 1761 he married Jeanne-Françoise, daughter of Justus Saint-Andre, a barber.
He was a schoolteacher and minister of St. Evangile in Geneva from 1761–1764, when he became pastor of the Swiss Church of [[London]] (1764–1791).
In 1791 he became a "[[bourgeois]]" (gentleman) of Geneva, and in 1792 became a pastor in Geneva, and from 1797-1798 he was a headmaster.
He was elected a Member of the [[Council of Two Hundred]] in 1793.
Roustan and his friend the Rev. [[Jacob Vernes]] wrote a History of Geneva, which remained in manuscript form.
He published several books on Christianity and Deism.{{sfn|Candal|2010}}

==Correspondence with Rousseau==
Roustan exchanged many letters with Rousseau between 1757 and 1767.{{sfn|Candal|2010}}
In his first letter of March 1757 he compared Rousseau to [[Socrates]].&lt;ref group=fn name=Roustan1757a&gt;"Plus je me repasse en revue, et plus je trouve que je suis tout pétrifié de Socrate; lui et vous faites meme histoire, et en vérité nous sommes si Athéniens que nous meritons bien d'en avoir un." {{harv|Leigh|1998|pp=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Touchefeu|1999|pp=198}}  Rousseau praised him in return, but, although polite about the poetry he had sent, advised him against seeking a career as a man of letters.
Roustan wrote to Rousseau after reading ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' (1761) saying that although he found the novel delightful, he was concerned that it was immoral in describing adulterous love so vividly and in describing hope as the only reason to believe in Christianity.{{sfn|Cranston|1991|pp=263}}
He visited Rousseau in [[Môtiers]] in 1762 and welcomed in him in London in 1766, but retained his views on the compatibility between Christianity and patriotism.{{sfn|Candal|2010}}

Four of his works &amp;mdash; ''Défense du christianisme considéré du côté politique'', wherein he refuted some of Rousseau's arguments from ''[[On the Social Contract]]''; ''Discours sur les moyens de réformer les mœurs''; ''Examen des quatre beaux siècles de Voltaire''; and ''Dialogue entre Brutus et César aux Champs Élysées'' &amp;mdash; were collected and published in 1764 under the title ''Offrande aux autels et à la patrie''.{{sfn|BiographieUniverselle|1846|pp=140}}{{sfn|Quérard|1836|pp=246&amp;ndash;247}}
The rebuttal in ''Défense du Christianisme ou réfutation du chapitre VIII du Contrat Social'' is friendly, and in fact Rousseau approved of his work and helped him with finding a publisher. In it Roustan implied that Rousseau may not himself have believed in his stated view that the scriptures preach servitude and resignation, and went on to say that doing good works was an integral part of the religion, including fighting for freedom and against tyranny. He therefore felt that Christianity and Republicanism or patriotism were fully compatible.{{sfn|Rosenblatt|1997|pp=264&amp;ndash;265}}{{sfn|Touchefeu|1999|pp=358}}

In 1776 Roustan published a rebuttal to Rousseau's ''Profession of Faith of a Savoyard Vicar'' in ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]''.{{sfn|Candal|2010}}
His ''Examen critique de la seconde partie de la "profession de foi du Vicaire Savoyard"'' was one of the main reasons that Rousseau was mocked by [[Voltaire]] in Voltaire's ''Remontrances des pasteurs du Gévaudan''.{{sfn|BiographieUniverselle|1846|pp=140}}{{sfn|Quérard|1836|pp=246&amp;ndash;247}}

'''Barbara J. Grosz''' [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|CorrFRSE]] is the Higgins Professor of Natural Sciences at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="stepdown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2011/04/radcliffe-institute-dean-barbara-grosz-will-step-down|title=Radcliffe Institute Dean Barbara Grosz Will Step Down|work=[[Harvard Magazine]]|date=2011-04-14|accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has made seminal contributions to the fields of [[natural language processing]] and [[multi-agent system]]s.

==Education==
Grosz earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from [[Cornell University]] in 1969, and master's and doctoral degrees in computer science from the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1971 and 1977, respectively. &lt;!-- dead link (detected on June 8  2015): &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Barbara%20Grosz_0.pdf|title=Barbara J. Grosz Resume|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Research==
Grosz specializes in [[natural language processing]] and [[multi-agent system]]s. She developed some of the earliest computer dialogue systems and established the research field of computational modeling of discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rutter|first1=Michael Patrick|title=Computer science pioneer Barbara J. Grosz awarded Allen Newell Award|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/03/computer-science-pioneer-barbara-j-grosz-awarded-allen-newell-award/|website=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=2 April 2018|date=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work on models of collaboration helped establish that field and provides the framework for several collaborative multi-agent and human-computer interface systems. Grosz has developed a theory of discourse structure that specifies how discourse interpretation depends on interactions among speaker intentions, attentional state, and linguistic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grosz |first=Barbara J. |last2=Sidner |first2=Candace L |date=1986  |title=Attention, intentions, and the structure of discourse |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=12458 |journal=Computational Linguistics |publisher=MIT Press |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=175–204 |doi= |access-date=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grosz |first=Barbara J. |last2=Joshi |first2=Aravind K. |date=1995 |title=Centering: a framework for modeling the local coherence of discourse |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=211198 |journal=Computational Linguistics |publisher=MIT Press |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=203–225 |doi= |access-date=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been using the theory to study the use of intonation to convey information about discourse structure, for instance how tones demark, in spoken language, some of the structure that paragraphs and parentheses indicate in written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Alvin|title=AI evolution: From tool to partner|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2002/01/ai-evolution-from-tool-to-partner/|website=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=2 April 2018|date=31 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bartolomeo Spina''' (born at [[Pisa]] about 1475; died at [[Rome]], 1546) was an Italian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] theologian and scholastic philosopher.

==Life==

He joined the Dominican Order at Pisa in 1494. He was involved in the attempted take-over of the Milanese convent of [[Sant'Eustorgio]] by the Observant friars of the Congregation of Lombardy before becoming master of studies at the Dominican studio in Bologna in 1513-4.  He served as inquisitorial vicar in Modena from 1517-9, where he was involved in prosecuting witches, and then regent master at S. Domenico in Bologna in the early 1530s. He was appointed (1536) by the [[Venetian Senate]] to the chair of theology at the [[University of Padua]]. He was also for a time ''[[wikt:socius|socius]]'' of the [[Master-General of the Order of Preachers]], and [[prior provincial]] of the Holy Land.

In July, 1542, he was made [[Master of the Sacred Palace]] by [[Pope Paul III]], and during the four years that he discharged the duties of that office he rendered services to the [[Holy See]] and to the Fathers of the [[Council of Trent]], regarding many difficult and mooted questions. As Master of the Sacred Palace, he was said to have wanted to move against Copernicus' De revolutionibus, only stopped by his death. From the year 1518 Spina was engaged in a heated controversy with his famous confrère, [[Cardinal Cajetan]]. Still more harsh was his opposition to [[Ambrose Catharinus]], whom he denounced as guilty of heresy to [[Paul III]] about the beginning of the year 1546.

==Works==
The most important of Spina's works are:

*"Tutela Veritatis de Immortalitate Animæ contra Petrum Pomponatium" and
*"Flagellum in Tres Libros Apologiæ Pomponatii de Immortalitate Animæ",

both published in 1518. Of special interest are also

*"Tractatus de Strigibus et Lamiis" (Venice, 1523), and
*"Apologiæ Tres adversus Joann. Franc. Ponzinibium Jurisperitum" (Venice, 1525).

He also edited many works of [[Thomas Aquinas]], including his commentary on the Physics, Metaphysics, and logical works, as well as some of his Biblical commentaries (Matthew, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Lamentations).

In his treatise "De Conceptione B. Mariæ Virg." (Venice, 1533), Spina opposed the doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]].

In 1892 [[August Weismann]] proposed in his [[germ plasm]] theory that heritable information is transmitted only via [[germ cell]]s, which he thought contained determinants (genes). [[Francis Galton]], supposing that undesirable traits such as [[club foot]] and [[criminality]] were inherited, advocated eugenics, aiming to prevent supposedly defective people from breeding. [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[Paul Broca]] attempted to relate the cranial capacity (internal skull volume) to skin colour, intending to show that white people were superior. Other workers such as [[H. H. Goddard]], and [[Robert Yerkes]] attempted to [[Intelligence Quotient|measure people's intelligence]] and to show that the resulting scores were heritable, again to demonstrate the supposed superiority of people with white skin.

Galton popularized the phrase [[nature and nurture]], later often used to characterize the heated debate over whether genes or the environment determined human behavior. Scientists such as ecologists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Normile, Dennis |title=Nature From Nurture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=351 |issue=6276 |pages=908–910 |date=2016 |doi=10.1126/science.351.6276.908|pmid=26917750 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and behavioural geneticists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Powledge, Tabitha M. |title=Behavioral Epigenetics: How Nurture Shapes Nature|journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=588–592 |date=2011 |doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.8.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; now see it as obvious that both factors are essential, and that they are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moore, David S. |year=2003 |title=The Dependent Gene: The Fallacy of Nature Vs. Nurture |publisher=Henry Holt |isbn=978-0805072808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 20th century, the [[Biological determinism of human gender roles|determinism of gender roles]] was debated by geneticists and others. Biologists such as [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] attempted to describe [[femininity]] and [[homosexuality]] according to then-current social standards; against this, the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] and others argued that clothing and other preferences vary in different societies. The biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] founded the discipline of sociobiology, founded on observations of animals such as [[social insects]], controversially suggesting that its explanations of social behaviour might apply to humans.

Biological determinism is the belief that a human’s behavior is controlled by an person’s genes and inherited traits. It dates back to the 1800s. Stephen Jay Gould has spent his career tracing the roots of this “western” thought because it is more involved than anyone could have assumed. Gould suggests that the main theories of biological determinism are based on bad biology and bad use of the scientific method. When a scientist says they used the scientific method to gather their data, the readers automatically assume that the information given must be correct. 
	
Gould presents three key ideas that have influenced biological determinism. The first is that measurement and quantification have changed science over the past century and without context, these measurements are useless. If something is assigned a number, then it must be real, true, and scientific. If these numbers and measurements are given without context, then the data can be given many different meanings. The second is that reinfication, the idea that certain qualities (intelligence, race) are valid because we put a name on it. One could separate a group into different components and give a name to these divided groups and have it be true, but actually, there is nothing scientific about intelligence being used as a unitary quality. The third problem is that the main thought behind biological determinism is that traits are inherited. Scientists have traced certain traits through families lines and found that some are inherited. Gould suggests that these studies merely restate the original assumption. Gould points out that various theories of biological determinism have no evidence or science to back them up, and even though these ideas are very flawed, people still widely accept them. 
	
However, Gould is thought to be flawed in his own way because readers believe he is simply disregarding certain aspects of science. Gould questions that since the scientific aspects of the works themselves are so flawed that why is it so widespread accepted. Gould suggests that there could be some social, political, and economic forces which could explain why these biological determinism theories are so widely accepted, but he fails to go further deep into the topic. Gould shows that these biological determinism theories have many consequences for human life and scientists in the future can see these and use his book to continue trying to show the people that biological determinism, is in fact, false. 
	
In this review of Gould’s essay by Garland E. Allen, Allen writes that Gould has helped future scientists examine social, economic, and political values of this time regarding biological determinism. Biological determinism is still prominent in scientific works, past and present, that have been regarded by the public as true and believable. Gould wants his readers to understand that biological determinism has roots all throughout science, even though it has been proven false. .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Garland E.|date=1984|editor-last=Gould|editor-first=Stephen Jay|title=The Roots of Biological Determinism|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=141–145|jstor=4330882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germ plasm===
{{main|Germ plasm}}
In 1892, the Austrian biologist [[August Weismann]] proposed that multicellular organisms consist of two separate types of cell: [[somatic cell]]s, which carry out the body's ordinary functions, and [[germ cell]]s, which transmit heritable information. He called the material that carried the information, now identified as [[DNA]], the [[germ plasm]], and individual components of it, now called [[gene]]s, determinants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weismann, August |authorlink=August Weismann |year=1892 |title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung |trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A Theory of Inheritance |language=German |publisher=Fischer |location=Jena |url=http://www.esp.org/books/weismann/germ-plasm/facsimile/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann argued that there is a one-way transfer of information from the germ cells to somatic cells, so that nothing acquired by the body during an organism's life can affect the germ plasm and the next generation. This effectively denied that [[Lamarckism|Lamarckism (inheritance of acquired characteristics)]] was a possible mechanism of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Huxley, Julian| authorlink=Julian Huxley |year=1942 |title=Evolution, the modern synthesis |publisher=Allen and Unwin |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern equivalent of the theory, expressed at molecular rather than cellular level, is the [[central dogma of molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner, J. Scott |editor1=Henning, Brian G.|editor2=Scarfe, Adam Christian |title=Biology's Second Law: Homeostasis, Purpose, and Desire |work=Beyond Mechanism: Putting Life Back Into Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=naQm1_Lutq4C&amp;pg=PA192 |year=2013 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7391-7436-4 |page=192 |quote=Where Weismann would say that it is impossible for changes acquired during an organism's lifetime to feed back onto transmissible traits in the germ line, the CDMB now added that it was impossible for information encoded in proteins to feed back and affect genetic information in any form whatsoever, which was essentially a molecular recasting of the Weismann barrier.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eugenics===
[[File:Francis Galton 1850s.jpg|thumb|upright|The early eugenicist [[Francis Galton]] invented the term [[eugenics]] and popularized the phrase [[nature and nurture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Galton, Francis |authorlink=Francis Galton |date=1874 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_uE-bpGo2N4C&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=On men of science, their nature and their nurture |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain |volume=7 |pages=227–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Eugenics}}

Early ideas of biological determinism centred on the inheritance of undesirable traits, whether physical such as [[club foot]] or [[cleft palate]], or psychological such as [[alcoholism]], [[bipolar disorder]] and [[criminality]]. The belief that such traits were inherited led to the desire to solve the problem with the [[eugenics]] movement, led by a follower of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911), by forcibly reducing breeding by supposedly defective people. By the 1920s, many U.S. states brought in laws permitting the compulsory [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] of people considered genetically unfit, including inmates of [[prison]]s and [[psychiatric hospital]]s. This was followed by similar laws in Germany, and throughout the Western world, in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Garland Edward |title=Biological determinism |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/biological-determinism |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllenReview&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Garland E. |title=The Roots of Biological Determinism: review of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=141–145 |jstor=4330882 |doi=10.1007/bf00397505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mismeasure&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |title=The Mismeasure of Man |date=1981 |publisher=W.

===Scientific racism===
{{main|Scientific racism}}

Under the influence of determinist beliefs, the American [[craniologist]] [[Samuel George Morton]] (1799–1851), and later the French anthropologist [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880), attempted to measure the cranial capacities (internal skull volumes) of people of different skin colours, intending to show that whites were superior to the rest, with larger brains. All the supposed proofs from such studies were invalidated by methodological flaws. The results were used to justify [[slavery]], and to oppose [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name=AllenReview/&gt;

===Heritability of IQ===
{{main|Heritability of IQ}}[[Alfred Binet]] (1857–1911)  designed tests specifically to measure performance, not innate ability.  From the late 19th century, the American school, led by researchers such as [[H. H. Goddard]] (1866–1957), [[Lewis Terman]] (1877–1956), and [[Robert Yerkes]] (1876–1956), transformed these tests into tools for measuring inherited mental ability.  They attempted to measure people's intelligence with [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ tests]], to demonstrate that the resulting scores were [[heritable]], and so to conclude that people with white skin were superior to the rest.  It proved impossible to design culture-independent tests and to carry out testing in a fair way given that people came from different backgrounds, or were newly arrived immigrants, or were illiterate. The results were used to oppose immigration of people from southern and eastern Europe to America.&lt;ref name=AllenReview/&gt;

===Human gender roles===
{{main|Biological determinism of human gender roles}}

Lynda Birke argues in her 1992 book ''In Pursuit of Difference'' that biology explains sexual differences by the mechanisms of chromosomes, genetics, and inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;''In Pursuit of Difference'' by Lynda Birke, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, hormonal differences are not absolute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality|publisher=The Drum|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people can be born with intersex characteristics, for example as a genetic mosaic.&lt;ref name="isna.org"&gt;[http://www.isna.org Intersex Society of North America]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality]] can be attributed to both [[Biology and sexual orientation|biological and social causes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Nature/Sexual Culture|year=1995|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226001821|page=4|edition=1|editor=[[Paul R.

The neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]] in 1991 studied the difference in [[hypothalamic structure]]s between homosexual and heterosexual men, finding that the [[INAH 3|INAH-3]] suggested a partial cause for homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spanier |first=Bonnie |journal=[[NWSA Journal]] |year=1995 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=54–71 |title=Biological Determinism and Homosexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nimmons |first=David |title=Sex and the Brain |url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/mar/sexandthebrain346/?searchterm=levay#.UpLnSGRDuqw |work=[[Discover Magazine]]|date=March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]], and [[Leon Kamin]]'s book ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'' discussed a study of girls who were relatively "[[masculinity|masculinized]]". The biologists [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] looked for ways to describe femininity that fitted their own social standards, such as clothing preference or using makeup. The experiment, in Lewontin's words, "ignores the existence of societies in which women wear pants, or in which men wear skirts, or in which men enjoy and appropriate jewelry to themselves." Gender differences in work are becoming less pronounced, suggesting that these are imposed by society.&lt;ref name=LewontinRoseKamin1984&gt;[[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin, Richard]], Steven Rose, and Leon Kamin. ''Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology and Human Nature''. New York: Pantheon Books, 1984. "The Determined Patriarchy", Chapter 6, pp. 131–163&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Anne Fausto-Sterling#The Standard Model|standard model of sex and gender]] indicates a clear-cut dichotomy between males and females, with no overlap, a cultural model followed by professionals such as doctors when they deal with gender assignment.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne, "Of Gender and Genitals" in ''Sexing the Body, Of Gender and Genitals'', Basic Books, 2000, pp. 44–77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociobiology===
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|thumb|[[E. O. Wilson]] reignited debate on biological determinism with his 1975 book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''.]]
{{main|Sociobiology}}

&lt;div&gt;[[Sociobiology]] emerged with [[E. O. Wilson]]'s 1975 book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sociobiology: a new synthesis and an old quarrel |author=May, Robert M. |date=1 April 1976 |volume=260 |issue=5550 |pages=390–392 |pmid=11643303 |doi=10.1038/260390a0 |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a putative [[altruism]] gene is debated.

J. | last2=Hurd | first2=P. L. | last3=Crespi | first3=B. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geneticist [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] argues that altruistic behaviour like "loving our neighbour" is built into the human genome, with the proviso that neighbour means member of "our tribe", someone who shares many genes with the altruist, and that the behaviour can thus be explained by [[kin selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Giberson |first1=Karl |title=Book review: ‘The Serpent’s Promise,’ on Bible-Science tensions, by Steve Jones |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/book-review-the-serpents-promise-on-bible-science-tensions-by-steve-jones/2014/08/15/6db92e54-133f-11e4-98ee-daea85133bc9_story.html |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary biologists such as Jones have argued that genes that did not lead to selfish behaviour would die out compared to genes that did, because the selfish genes would favour themselves. However, the mathematician George Constable and colleagues have argued that altruism can be an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]], making organisms better able to survive random catastrophes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Ian |title=Altruism has more of an evolutionary advantage than selfishness, mathematicians say |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/altruism-selfishness-evolution-mathematics-princeton-bath-university-a7148471.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Constable Rogers McKane Tarnita pp. E4745–E4754"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Constable | first=George W.

==Nature versus nurture debate==
{{main|Nature and nurture}}

The belief in biological determinism has been matched by a [[tabula rasa|blank slate]] denial of any possible influence of genes on human behavior, leading to [[Nature and nurture|a long and heated debate about "nature and nurture"]]. By the 21st century, many scientists had come to feel that the dichotomy made no sense. They noted that genes were expressed within an environment, in particular that of [[prenatal development]], and that genes were continuously controlled by the environment through mechanisms such as [[epigenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Matt Ridley |author=Ridley, M. |date=2003 |title=Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience, &amp; What Makes Us Human |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=978-0-002-00663-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moore, David S. |title=The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-199-92234-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gutiérrez, Luci |date=January 24, 2014 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/time-to-retire-the-simplicity-of-nature-vs-nurture-1390610295 |title=Time to Retire The Simplicity of Nature vs. Nurture |newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Philosophical Association''' is a British organisation set up in October 2002 to promote the study of philosophy.&lt;ref name="thes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=184517&amp;sectioncode=26|title=Society set up to counter threats|last=Goddard|first=Alison|date=31 October 2003|work=Times Higher Education Supplement|accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpa.ac.uk/about BPA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
During the early 1980s the merging of educational establishments and financial cut-backs meant that some philosophy departments had closed and more were under threat. The National Committee for Philosophy (NCP) was formed to try and address this. The committee was successful and, following on from their success sought to secure the future of the subject of philosophy in education.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans|first=David|title=The British Philosophical Association|url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/43/The_British_Philosophical_Association|accessdate=12 April 2014|newspaper=Philosophy Now|date=October/November 2003 (issue 43)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The NCP evolved – after three years of discussion and planning – into the British Philosophical Association (BPA) and agreed its constitution, "to promote and foster the teaching and study of, and research in Philosophy in the United Kingdom, within higher education and also within the wider community",&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web|title=British Philosophical Association Constitution|url=http://bpa.ac.uk/about/british-philosophical-association-constitution|publisher=British Philosophical Association|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a meeting in Liverpool 30 October 2002.&lt;ref name=NCP&gt;{{cite web|last=Jewell|first=Nik|title=The National Committee For Philosophy: Its Origins And Activities|url=http://78.158.56.101/archive/prs/view.html/PrsDocuments/123.html|publisher=The Higher Education Academy – Subject Centre for Philosophical and Religious Studies|accessdate=12 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140412163042/http://78.158.56.101/archive/prs/view.html/PrsDocuments/123.html|archivedate=12 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first annual meeting was held on 24 October 2003 at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt;

In [[metaphysics]], '''conceptualism''' is a theory that explains universality of [[particular]]s as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind.&lt;ref name="Conceptualism" /&gt; Intermediate between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside the mind's perception of them.&lt;ref name="universals" /&gt; Conceptualism is [[anti-realist]] about [[abstract objects]], just like [[immanent realism]] is (their difference being that immanent realism does not deny the mind-independence of universals, like conceptualism does).&lt;ref&gt;Neil A. Manson, Robert W. Barnard (eds.), ''The Bloomsbury Companion to Metaphysics'', Bloomsbury, 2014, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Medieval philosophy ===
The evolution of late [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] terminology has led to the emergence of conceptualism, which stemmed from doctrines that were previously considered to be nominalistic. The terminological distinction was made in order to stress the difference between the claim that universal mental acts correspond with universal intentional objects and the perspective that dismissed the existence of universals outside the mind. The former perspective of rejection of objective [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] was distinctly defined as conceptualism.

[[Peter Abélard]] was a medieval thinker whose work is currently classified as having the most potential in representing the roots of conceptualism. Abélard’s view denied the existence of determinate universals within things.&lt;ref name="Abailard" /&gt; [[William of Ockham]] was another famous late medieval thinker who had a strictly conceptualist solution to the metaphysical problem of universals. He argued that abstract concepts have no ''[[wikt:fundamentum|fundamentum]]'' outside the mind.&lt;ref name="Ockham" /&gt;

In the 17th century conceptualism gained favour for some decades especially among the [[Jesuit]]s: [[Hurtado de Mendoza (philosopher)|Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Rodrigo de Arriaga]] and [[Francisco Oviedo (philosopher)|Francisco Oviedo]] are the main figures. Although the order soon returned to the more realist philosophy of [[Francisco Suárez]], the ideas of these Jesuits had a great impact on the [[early modern philosophy]].

=== Modern philosophy ===
Conceptualism was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern]] thinkers, including [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] – often in a quite simplified form if compared with the elaborate scholastic theories.&lt;ref&gt;David Bostock, ''Philosophy of Mathematics: An Introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, p. 43: "All of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume supposed that mathematics is a theory of our ''ideas'', but none of them offered any argument for this conceptualist claim, and apparently took it to be uncontroversial."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Di Bella, Tad M. Schmaltz (eds.), ''The Problem of Universals in Early Modern Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 64 "there is a strong case to be made that Spinoza was a ''conceptualist'' about universals" and p. 207 n. 25: "Leibniz's conceptualism [is related to] the Ockhamist tradition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term is applied even to the radically different philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], who holds that universals have no connection with external things because they are exclusively produced by our ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' mental structures and functions.&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], conceptualist views were held by [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sarlemijn, ''Hegel's Dialectic'', Springer, 1975, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary philosophy&lt;!--'Conceptualist realism', 'Perceptual conceptualism', 'Perceptual non-conceptualism', 'Perceptual nonconceptualism', and 'Nonconceptual mental content' redirect here; linked from 'John McDowell--&gt; ===
[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[philosophy of mathematics]] has been construed as a form of conceptualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Zahar, Elie| year=2001| title=Poincaré's Philosophy: From Conventionalism to Phenomenology| publisher=Open Court Pub Co| location=Chicago| page=211| isbn=0-8126-9435-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conceptualist realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a view put forward by [[David Wiggins]] in 1980) states that our conceptual framework maps reality.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Ferner, ''Organisms and Personal Identity: Individuation and the Work of David Wiggins'', Routledge, 2016, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though separate from the historical debate regarding the status of universals, there has been significant debate regarding the conceptual character of experience since the release of ''Mind and World'' by [[John McDowell]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind and World |last1=McDowell |first1=John |year=1994 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-57610-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDowell's touchstone is the famous refutation that [[Wilfrid Sellars]] provided for what he called the "[[Myth of the Given]]"—the notion that all empirical knowledge is based on certain assumed or 'given' items, such as sense data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/ | title = Wilfrid Sellars | accessdate = 2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in rejecting the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues for '''perceptual conceptualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which perceptual content is conceptual "from the ground up", that is, all perceptual experience is a form of conceptual experience. McDowell's [[philosophy of justification]] is considered a form of [[foundationalism]]: it is a form of foundationalism because it allows that certain judgements are warranted by experience and it is a coherent form of this view because it maintains that experience can warrant certain judgements because experience is irreducibly conceptual.&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, 1994, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

A clear motivation of contemporary conceptualism is that the kind of perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique in the fact that it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have urged that our perceptual relation to the world is conceptual all the way out to the world’s impacts on our receptive capacities. The idea of the conceptual that I mean to be invoking is to be understood in close connection with the idea of rationality, in the sense that is in play in the traditional separation of mature human beings, as rational animals, from the rest of the animal kingdom. Conceptual capacities are capacities that belong to their subject’s rationality. So another way of putting my claim is to say that our perceptual experience is permeated with rationality. I have also suggested, in passing, that something parallel should be said about our agency.&lt;ref name=McDowellPaper&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McDowell | first1 = J. | title = What Myth? | doi = 10.1080/00201740701489211 | journal = Inquiry | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 338–351 | year = 2007 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McDowell's conceptualism, though rather distinct (philosophically and historically) from conceptualism's genesis, shares the view that universals are not "given" in perception from outside the sphere of reason. Particular objects are perceived, as it were, already infused with conceptuality stemming from the spontaneity of the rational subject herself.

The application of the term "perceptual conceptualism" to Kant's [[philosophy of perception]] is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-judgment/supplement1.html "The Togetherness Principle, Kant’s Conceptualism, and Kant’s Non-Conceptualism" – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued for a rival interpretation of Kant's work termed '''perceptual non-conceptualism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hanna, "Kantian non-conceptualism", ''Philosophical Studies'' '''137'''(1):41–64 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deity yoga''' (Tibetan: ''lha'i rnal 'byor''; Sanskrit: ''Devata-yoga'') is a practice of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]] involving identification with a chosen deity through visualisations and rituals, and the realisation of [[Sunyata|emptiness]]. According to the Tibetan scholar [[Tsongkhapa]], deity yoga is what separates Buddhist [[Tantra]] practice from the practice of other Buddhist schools.&lt;ref&gt;Power, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 271&lt;/ref&gt;

Deity yoga involves two stages, the '''generation stage''' and the '''completion stage'''. In the generation stage, one dissolves the mundane world and visualizes one's chosen deity ([[yidam]]), its [[mandala]] and companion deities, resulting in identification with this divine reality.&lt;ref&gt;Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In the completion stage, one dissolves the visualization of and identification with the yidam in the realization of [[sunyata]] or emptiness. Completion stage practices can also include [[subtle body]] energy practices.&lt;ref&gt;Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Kalachakra (Buryatia, 19th c.).jpg|thumb|right|Painting of [[Kalachakra]], a [[yidam]] (Buryatia, 19th c.)]]
===Purpose===
The purpose of Deity yoga is to bring the meditator to the realization that the [[yidam]] or meditation deity and the practitioner are in essence the same, that they are [[non-dual]] (''advaya''). According to John Powers. "Deity yoga is a technique for becoming progressively more familiar with the thoughts and deeds of a buddha, until the state of buddhahood is actualized through repeated practice."&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 272.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche|Gyatrul Rinpoche]], the point of this practice is to "understand your [[buddha nature]], which is the very essence of your being" and is "intrinsically present" in all beings.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatrul Rinpoche, Generating the Deity, 1996, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the deity is a reflection of qualities already inherent in the practitioner is what makes this practice different than mere deluded or wishful thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 272.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The yidam generally appears in a [[mandala]] and the practitioner visualizes himself or herself and their environment as the yidam and mandala of their Deity Yoga practice. This visualization method undermines a habitual belief that views of reality and self are solid and fixed, enabling the practitioner to purify spiritual obscurations (Sanskrit: ''[[kleśā (Buddhism)|klesha]]'') and to practice compassion and wisdom simultaneously:
{{quote|Deity Yoga employs highly refined techniques of creative imagination, visualisation, and photism in order to self-identify with the divine form and qualities of a particular deity as the union of method or skilful means and wisdom. As His Holiness the Dalai Lama says, "In brief, the body of a Buddha is attained through meditating on it".&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (2004). ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs''. Serindia Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}}. p. 142.

===Visualisation===
Representations of the deity, such as a statues, paintings (Tibetan: ''[[thangka]]''), or [[mandala]]s, are often employed as an aid to visualization in both the [[Generation Stage]] (Tibetan: ''Kye-rim'') and the [[Completion Stage]] (Tibetan: ''[[Dzog-rim]]'') of [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]. The mandalas are symbolic representations of sacred enclosures, [[sacred architecture]] that house and contain the uncontainable essence of a yidam. In the book, ''The World of Tibetan Buddhism'', the Dalai Lama describes a mandala: “This is the celestial mansion, the pure residence of the deity.”

===Yidams===
{{see also|sādhana}}
In the Vajrayāna Buddhism of Tibet and East Asia, which follow the [[Nalanda|Nālandā Tradition]] of [[India]]-[[Tibet]]-[[China]], there are fifteen major tantric ''sādhanās'', each connected with a specific [[yidam]]:

===Mandalas===
[[File:Mandala of the Forms of Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Transcendent Wisdom.jpg|thumb|right|Mandala of the Forms of [[Manjushri]], the [[Bodhisattva]] of Transcendent Wisdom]]
Mandalas are used as an aid in realizing the inner ground:
{{quote|[E]xternal ritual and internal sadhana form an indistinguishable whole, and this unity finds its most pregnant expression in the form of the mandala, the sacred enclosure consisting of concentric squares and circles drawn on the ground and representing that adamantine plane of being on which the aspirant to Buddhahood wishes to establish himself. The unfolding of the tantric ritual depends on the mandala; and where a material mandala is not employed, the adept proceeds to construct one mentally in the course of his meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Kvaerne, Per (1975).

==Generation stage==
In [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] Buddhism, the '''generation stage''' (T:''kye rim, Wyl., bskyed rim''; S:''utpatti-krama'') is the first phase of Deity yoga. It is associated with the 'Father Tantra' (Wylie: ''pha-rgyud''; ''pa-rgyud'') class of ''[[Anuttara Yoga Tantra|anuttara-yoga-tantras]]'' of the [[Sarmapa]] or associated with what is known as [[Mahayoga]] Tantras by the [[Nyingmapa]]. An example of a 'Father Tantra' is the ''[[Guhyasamāja tantra|Guhyasamāja Tantra]]''.

The generation stage engages creative imagination or [[Creative visualization|visualization]] as an ''[[upaya]]'' or skillful means of personal transformation through which the practitioner ([[sadhaka]]) either visualizes a meditational deity (''[[yidam]]'') or [[refuge tree]] before themselves in ''front generation'', or as themselves in ''self generation'', to engender an alteration to their perception and/or experience of the appearance aspect of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''.  Great Britain, Oxford:  Oxford University Press. P.100.  {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One practices oneself in the identification with the meditational Buddha or deity (''[[yidam]]'') by visualisations, until one can meditate single-pointedly on ''being'' the deity.{{refn|group=note|A comparison may be made with the "Role theory" of [[Hjalmar Sundén]], which describes how identification with a religious figure can lead to conversion. See (in Dutch) N. Hijweege (1994, ''Bekering in de gereformeerde gezindte'', which describes how the story of Paulus conversion on the road to Damascus serves as an example of the "ideal-conversion" in orthodox Protestant churches.}}

According to [[Tsongkhapa]], throughout the various stages of visualization one is to maintain the cognition of [[shunyata|emptiness]] and "one trains in [causing] everything to appear as like illusions".&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel; Highest Yoga Tantra, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Reginald Ray writes that during the process of yidam visualization, the deity is to be imaged as not solid or tangible, as "empty yet apparent", with the character of a [[mirage]] or a [[rainbow]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World, The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, Shambala, page 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Four purities ===
In the ''generation stage'' of Deity Yoga, the practitioner visualizes the "Four Purities" (Tibetan: ''yongs su dag pa bzhi''; ''yongs dag bzhi'')&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Tibetan+%2528Transliterated%2529/yongs+dag+bzhi yongs su dag pa bzhi] (accessed: January 3, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; which define the principal Tantric methodology of Deity Yoga that distinguishes it from the rest of Buddhism:{{sfn|Yuthok|1997|p=27}}
# Seeing one's body as the body of the deity
# Seeing one's environment as the [[pure land]] or [[mandala]] of the deity
# Perceiving one's enjoyments as bliss of the deity, free from attachment
# Performing one's actions only for the benefit of others (bodhichitta motivation, altruism)&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/tantra_practice.html Kalachakranet (2006), ''Tantric Practice''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322072203/http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/tantra_practice.html |date=2009-03-22 }} (Source: January 3, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Front generation===
Front generation is a form of meditative visualization employed in Tantric Buddhism in which the [[Iṣṭha-deva(tā) (Buddhism)|''yidam'']] is visualized as being present in the sky facing the practitioner as opposed to the self-identification that occurs in self generation.  According to the Vajrayana tradition, this approach is considered less advanced, hence safer for the ''sadhaka'', and is engaged more for the [[rite]]s of [[propitiation]] and [[worship]].&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''.  Great Britain, Oxford:  Oxford University Press. P.96.  {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self generation===
Self generation is a form of meditative visualization employed in Tantric Buddhism in which the ''yidam'' is invoked and then merged with the ''[[sadhaka]]'' as an ''[[upaya]]'' of self-transformation.  This is as opposed to the method of front generation.  According to the Vajrayana tradition, self generation is held to be more advanced and accompanied by a degree of spiritual risk from the ''[[siddhi]]'' it may rapidly yield.&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''.  Great Britain, Oxford:  Oxford University Press. P.257.  {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important element of this is "divine pride", which is "the thought that one is oneself the deity being visualized."&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel; Highest Yoga Tantra, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Powers, "divine pride is different from ordinary, afflicted pride because it is motivated by compassion for others and is based on an understanding of emptiness. The deity and oneself are both known to be empty, all appearances are viewed as manifestations of the luminous and empty nature of mind, and so the divine pride of deity yoga does not lead to attachment, greed, and other afflictions."&lt;ref&gt;Power, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Completion stage==
[[File:Практика туммо.jpg|thumb|A painting of a yogi showing the central energy channel and side channels.]]
The completion stage (Tibetan:''dzok-rim, (Wyl: rdzogs rim)''; Sanskrit:''saṃpanna-krama'') is the second stage of deity yoga. Completion stage may also be translated as "perfection stage" or "fulfillment mode." In the completion stage one engages in practices associated with the [[subtle body]] energies and dissolves the deity into ''[[sunyata]]''.

The practitioner can use either the ''path of method (thabs lam)'' or the ''path of liberation ('grol lam)''.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=19}} At the path of method the practitioner engages in [[subtle body]] energy practices. These involve the subtle energy system of energy channels (''rtsa''), winds or currents (''rlung''), and drops or charged particles (''thig le'') which are said to converge at certain points along the spinal column called [[chakras]].&lt;ref&gt;Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The "wind energy" is directed and dissolved into the heart chakra, where-after the [[Mahamudra]] remains,{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=116}} and the practitioner is physically and mentally transformed. At the path of liberation the practitioner applies [[mindfulness]],{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=17}} a preparatory practice for [[Mahamudra]] or [[Dzogchen]], to realize the inherent [[sunyata|emptiness]] of every-'thing' that exists.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=16-20}}

Jake Dalton uses the terms "practices with signs" (''mtshan bcas'') and practices without signs" (''mtshan med''). The "practices with signs" are "channels and winds" (''rtsa lung'') practices, while in the practices without signs "the enlightened view is accomplished instantaneously, without any effort."&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Jake (2003). 'Anuyoga Literature' in ''rNying ma rgyud 'bum – Master Doxographical Catalog'' of the [[THDL]]. Source: [http://www.thdl.org/xml/ngb/showNgb.php?doc=Ng.ed.xml&amp;l=d0e2587&amp;mode=dox] (accessed: Sunday August 24, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subtle energy practices===
The completion stage employs the "mystic vortices" of the body, the ''[[chakra|cakra]]'', the subtle energy of the [[subtle body]], the five ''[[prana]]s'' or ''[[vayu|vāyu]]'', together with the channels, the ''[[nadi (yoga)|nadi]]'' through which the energy flows in order to generate the 'great bliss' (Tibetan: ''Dem Chog'' or ''bde-mchog''; Sanskrit: ''Maha-sukha'') associated with ''[[bodhi]]'' or enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''.  Great Britain, Oxford:  Oxford University Press. P.63.  {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Keith Dowman,
{{quote|Examples of fulfillment mode yogas are dream yoga, the yoga of the mystic heat, Mahamudra meditation, the yoga of the apparitional body, the yoga of resurrection, clear light meditation, and the yoga of uniting skillful means [upaya] and perfect insight [prajna] to create the seed-essence of pure pleasure.&lt;ref name="Dowman, Keith 2007"&gt;Dowman, Keith (1984). ''Introduction to Masters of Mahamudra''. Source: [http://keithdowman.net/essays/siddhas.htm] (accessed: December 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Berzin]],
{{quote|On the complete stage, we cause the energy-winds (''rlung'', Skt. ''prana'') to enter, abide, and dissolve in the central channel. This enables us to access the subtlest level of mental activity ([[Luminosity (Vajrayana)|clear light]], ''&lt;nowiki&gt;‘&lt;/nowiki&gt; od-gsal'') and use it for the nonconceptual cognition of voidness&amp;nbsp;– the immediate cause for the omniscient mind of a Buddha. We use the subtlest level of energy-wind, which supports clear light mental activity, to arise in the form of an [[illusory body]] (''sgyu-lus'') as the immediate cause for the network of form bodies (Skt. ''rupakaya'') of a Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Berzin, Alexander (2008). "The Major Facets of Dzogchen" in ''Study Buddhism''. Source: [http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/dzogchen-advanced/the-major-facets-of-dzogchen] (accessed: June 6, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The completion stage is defined differently in various strands on Vajrayana practice:
{{quote|[T]he completion stage defined as the dissolving of the visualization of a deity corresponds to Mahayoga; the "Completion stage with marks" based on yogic practices such as tummo corresponds to Anu Yoga: and the "Completion stage without marks" is the practice of Ati Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Completing_Stage rywiki, ''Completing Stage''] (accessed:  December 13, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Keith Dowman,
{{quote|Fulfillment meditation includes "higher" techniques of meditation, which result in understanding of ultimate truth. But since relative and ultimate truth are two sides of the same coin, creative and fulfillment stages both lead to the same goal. Fundamentally, fulfillment meditation techniques entail the perception of emptiness in form, or the dissolution of form into emptiness: the dissolution of the creative stage vision into emptiness is technically a fulfillment stage practice.&lt;ref name="Dowman, Keith 2007"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3829">'''Denis Miéville''' (15 September 1946 – 27 October 2018) was a Swiss expert on the logic of [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]] and natural logic.

== Biography ==
Denis Miéville was raised in the towns of [[Colombier, Neuchâtel|Colombier]] ([[Canton of Neuchâtel]]) and [[Essert-Pittet]] ([[Canton of Vaud]]). After studying [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] at the [[University of Neuchâtel]] (Switzerland) and [[Bowling Green University]] (Ohio, United States), Denis Miéville developed an interest in the development and formalization of natural logic that led him to study both the theory of collective classes and the foundations of maximal predicates in propositional logic. These interests were integrated in the doctoral thesis that he defended in 1984 ("A Development of [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]]'s logical systems: Protothetic, [[ontology]] and [[mereology]]") at the [[University of Neuchâtel]], supervised by the eminent logician Jean-Blaise Grize. Appointed Professor at the [[University of Neuchâtel]] in 1987 (he will become its rector from 1999 to 2003), he taught logic and chaired the Semiologic Research Centre.

Professor Miéville has taught at various institutions such as the [[University of Geneva]], the [[University of Rennes]] in [[France]] and the [[University of Iasi]] in [[Romania]]. The [[University of Iasi]] awarded him a degree [[Honoris causa]] in 2003. He also received the Honorary Certificate of the [[Francophony]] in 2001.

== Research interests ==
Professor Miéville developed an expertise on [[Lesniewski]]'s logic due to his interest in developmental systems, that have the advantage of being dynamic, universal, free and of a higher order. Moreover, by developing a theory of syntactic-semantic categories, he focussed on a methodology able to identify logico-discursive indices in texts, by representing them as argumentative and reasoned structures.His interests became more and more inclined towards understanding the way in which discursive thought creates meaning, by inscribing it into reasoning networks. This is one of the reasons that led Professor Miéville to specifically examine the discursive procedures from which new knowledge is developed, such as those proceeding by analogy, and those structuring creative definitions. Very sensitive to the epistemological dimension of knowledge, he has been interested in how concepts develop gradually and crystallize into stable entities.

'''Dowry of Mary''' (or '''Dowry of the Virgin''', '''Our Lady's Dowry''', and similar variations) is a title used in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] contexts to refer to [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Womersley, David (2010), ''Divinity and State'', [[Oxford University Press]], p. 16. {{ISBN|978-0-19-925564-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincent Nichols|Nichols, Vincent]] et al. ''Firmly I Believe and Truly: The Spiritual Tradition of Catholic England'' (2011), [[Oxford University Press]], p. 21. {{ISBN|978-0-19-929122-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, Brian et al. (2010), ''Cultural Reformations: Medieval and Renaissance in Literary History'', [[Oxford University Press]], p. 117. {{ISBN|978-0-19-921248-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early use==
The title originated in the [[Medieval]] period, when devotion to the [[Virgin Mary]] in England was particularly strong.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joanna Bogle|Bogle, Joanna]] (1992), ''A Book of Feasts and Seasons'', Gracewing, p. 159. {{ISBN|978-0-85244-217-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNally, Terrence J. (2009), ''What Every Catholic Should Know About Mary'', [[Xlibris]], p. 76. {{ISBN|978-1-4415-1051-8}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that England belonged in some special way to Mary, who was seen as the country's "protectress" and who through her powers of [[Intercession of saints|intercession]] acted as the country's defender or guardian.&lt;ref name="saul"&gt;[[Nigel Saul|Saul, Nigel]] (2011), ''For Honour and Fame: Chivalry in England, 1066-1500'', [[Random House]], p. 208. {{ISBN|978-1-84792-052-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the short film ''Saint Edmund Arrowsmith'' by the company known as Mary's Dowry Productions, this title in reference to England first appeared in 1051. Though the title's precise origin is unknown, it had become widespread by the middle of the fourteenth century, and around the year 1350 a [[mendicant]] preacher stated in a sermon that "it is commonly said that the land of England is the Virgin's dowry".&lt;ref name="saul" /&gt; Around fifty years later, Archbishop [[Thomas Arundel]], discussing Mary and the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], wrote that "we [[English people|English]], being ... her own Dowry, as we are commonly called, ought to surpass others in the fervour of our praises and devotions".&lt;ref&gt;Boss, Sarah (2004), ''Mary'', [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], p. 118. {{ISBN|978-0-8264-5788-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the reign of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], the title ''dos Mariae'', "dowry of Mary", was being applied to England in [[Latin language|Latin]] texts&lt;ref&gt;[[Lisa Hilton (writer)|Hilton, Lisa]] (2009), ''Queens Consort: England's Medieval Queens'', [[Phoenix Books]], {{ISBN|978-0-7538-2611-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to chronicler [[Thomas Elmham]], English priests sought the intercession of "the Virgin, protectress of her dower" on the eve of the [[Battle of Agincourt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nigel Saul|Saul, Nigel]] (2011), ''For Honour and Fame: Chivalry in England, 1066-1500'', [[Random House]], p. 209. {{ISBN|978-1-84792-052-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions in art==
{{double image|right|The Wilton Diptych (left).jpg|150|The Wilton Diptych (Right).jpg|150|The Wilton Diptych (c. 1395).}}
The [[Wilton Diptych]], completed around 1395, depicts [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] kneeling before the [[Virgin and Child]]. Carried by a nearby angel is the [[Cross of St George]], the staff of which is surmounted by an orb featuring a minuscule map of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Strong|Strong, Roy]] (2000), ''The Spirit of Britain: A Narrative History of the Arts'', [[Random House]], p. 2. {{ISBN|978-0-7126-6495-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[altarpiece]] from the same era  showed Richard handing the orb to Mary, with the inscription ''Dos tua Virgo pia haec est'', "This is thy dowry, O Holy Virgin".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Dillian et al. (1998), ''The Regal Image of Richard II and the Wilton Diptych'', Harvey Miller Publishers, p. 24. {{ISBN|978-1-872501-72-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavezzo, Kathy (2003), ''Imagining a Medieval English Nation'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], p. 177 {{ISBN|978-0-8166-3734-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[English Reformation]], the notion of England enjoying a special association or relationship with Mary became an important aspect of [[Recusancy|recusant]] Catholic spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Espinosa, Ruben (2011), ''Masculinity and Marian Efficacy in Shakespeare's England'', [[Ashgate Publishing]]p. 14. {{ISBN|978-1-4094-0116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents at [[English College, Valladolid|English College]] in [[Valladolid]], Spain owned a painting which depicted Mary being handed a scroll carrying the words "We will remain under the shade of your wings till the wickedness passes" by a group of kneeling [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. The painting's superscription read ''Anglia dos Mariae'', "England, Mary's dowry".&lt;ref&gt;Shell, Alison (1999), ''Catholicism, Controversy, and the English Literary Imagination, 1558-1660'', [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 206. {{ISBN|978-0-521-58090-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a college in [[Seville]] it was reported that students had raised a painting of Mary carrying the superscription "Anglia Dos Mariae. England is the Dowry of Our Lady".&lt;ref&gt;Highley, Christopher (2008), ''Catholics Writing the Nation in Early Modern Britain and Ireland'', [[Oxford University Press]], p. 20. {{ISBN|978-0-19-953340-4}}. "Anglia Dos MariÆ. Ingland is the Dowry of our ladye."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papal recognition==
[[Pope Leo XIII]] referred to England's association with the title in 1893. Addressing a group of Catholic pilgrims from England in [[Rome]], he spoke of "the wonderful filial love which burnt within the heart of your forefathers towards the great Mother of God ... to whose service they consecrated themselves with such abundant proofs of devotion, that the kingdom itself acquired the singular and highly honourable title of 'Mary's Dowry.'"&lt;ref&gt;Morris, John; Smith, Sydney (1896), ''Historical Papers'', [[Catholic Truth Society]], p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5616">'''Edmund Noble''' (January 8, 1853 – January 8, 1937) was an Anglo-American [[author]], [[journalist]], [[philosopher]] and [[Editing|editor]].

== Biography ==
Edmund Noble was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, in 1853. He was the son of John and Eliza Noble who were natives of England. After the death of his father, in 1868, his mother and other members of the family [[Emigration|emigrated]] to the United States in 1872, and located in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. He was educated under the instruction of his grandfather the Rev. William George Nevatt, and in the public schools of [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helen's]], Lancashire, England. Upon completing his studies he entered the journalistic field.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Massachusetts. Biographical - Genealogical. Vol. I. Boston, 1916. P. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

Noble began  his career as a reporter on the "St. Helen's Standard" in 1872. Later, he moved to [[Liverpool]], where he worked on the "Liverpool Courier" and "Liverpool City News".  From 1882 to 1884 Noble was a special correspondent in Russia for various English newspapers including the "[[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]", "Daily Globe", "[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]" and "[[The Herald (Glasgow)|Glasgow Herald]]".&lt;ref&gt;Who Was Who in America. Vol. I. 1897-1942. Chicago, 1962. P. 901&lt;/ref&gt; There he met his future wife, Lydia Lvovna Pimenoff, a Russian citizen.

Noble was an advocate of [[Emergent evolution|emergent]] and [[theistic evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Eldridge, Seba. (1928). ''Reviewed Work: Purposive Evolution by Edmund Noble''. ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'' 37 (3): 269-273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;McDougall, William. (1929).

Willett, Clark. p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; His evolutionary theory is outlined in his book ''Purposive Evolution'' (1926). It was positively reviewed by philosopher [[John Dewey]], but criticized by psychologist [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]].&lt;ref name="McDougall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1927). ''The Integration of a Moving World. Purposive Evolution: The Link Between Science and Religion by Edmind Noble''. ''[[The New Republic]]'' 51: 22-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in the United States ==

In 1885 Noble and Pimenoff moved to the United States. They settled in Boston, where Noble worked as a correspondent on the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' (1885–1931). He took part in Free Russia Movement as a member of [[Society of Friends of Russian Freedom|the Society of American Friends of Russian Freedom]]. From 1892 to 1894 he edited the monthly magazine of the Society ''Free Russia''. He could speak the Russian language and actively supported Russian [[Émigré]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hum.sbras.ru/snm/HY2008/11%20Nethipurik__hy2008.rtf Nechiporuk D.M. What Americans Can Do for Russia?

Most of their life Edmund Noble and Lydia Pimenoff-Noble spent in [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], near Boston. They had two daughters, Beatrice Noble and Lydia Edmundovna Noble. The latter was a poet, who translated from Russian into English the Russian poet Balmont.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch01073 Papers of Lydia Edmundovna Noble, 1895-1940]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ellen M. Mitchell''' (1838–1920) was an American [[philosopher]], educator and education reformer. She was one of the first women to be appointed lecturer in a university,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindermann|first=Kate|title=Ellen Mitchell|url=http://www.societyforthestudyofwomenphilosophers.org/Ellen_Mitchell.html|work=Women Philosophers|publisher=Kate Lindermann|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to writing philosophy, literature and literary criticism.

==Biography==

Ellen M. Smith was born in the Village of [[Geddes, New York]] to Harriet H. Rowland and Edwin R. Smith, the eldest of their four children. She graduated from the Cortland Academy, Homer, N.Y. in 1860, with a major in Classics. Ellen, also, taught school in Syracuse.  During the Civil War her brother, Edwin R. Smith, Jr., served in New York's 149th Regiment. Edwin was killed in the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 3, 1863. He was initially reported severely wounded; the family tried to determine whether the Confederates had captured him and treated him in the Confederate field hospital at Ellwood Manor. However, Edwin was lost without a trace.  Ellen adopted the nom de plume "Ella Ellwood" in identification with Edwin, writing with the name Ellwood during the war. Following Edwin's death, Ellen resigned her teaching position in Syracuse and moved to Cairo, Illinois, where she lived with her uncle, Ward L. Smith and his wife, Anna.

During the war, Ellen moved to [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. She wrote for the Missouri Republican newspaper of St. Louis, continuing to use the nom de plume Ella Ellwood until the war's end.  She married St. Louis attorney and Union civil war veteran Joseph W. Mitchell in the Presbyterian Church of Alton, Illinois in 1867. While in St. Louis, she attended the Hegelian philosophy lectures which had been organized there by William T. Harris. She and Joseph also contributed to a literary and philosophical discussion group called "The Pen &amp; Pencil Club," often hosting the meetings in their home.  
 
Ellen and Joseph moved to [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1878, seeking effective treatment for Joseph's illness (possibly tuberculosis). However, Joseph died in February, 1879. Ellen remained in Denver, where she taught school and, then, lectured on philosophy and literature in the [[University of Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindermann |first=Kate |title=Ellen Mitchell |url=http://www.women-philosophers.com/Ellen-Mitchell.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130725202858/http://www.women-philosophers.com/Ellen-Mitchell.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2013 |work=Women Philosophers |publisher=Kate Lindermann |accessdate=24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, she actively contributed to the Kant Club, and to the Fortnightly Club, of Denver.

Ellen M. Mitchell attended the first session, in July 1879, of the Concord Summer School of Philosophy, which was hosted in Concord, Mass. by Bronson Alcott on his property.  William T. Harris organized the school and its programs after leaving St. Louis, with the intention of unifying the Hegelian Idealism of the St. Louis Philosophical Society with the Transcendentalism of Concord.  At that first 1879 session, Ellen became acquainted with many women from across the country who were leading the struggle for women's suffrage, as well as the efforts to improve educational and social policy standards.  Among those she met while attending the 1879 Concord session was Julia Ward Howe who, later, became the president of the Association for the Advancement of Women.  The Concord School played an important role in helping to build networks of policy reformers; more than one half of those who attended were women.  Mrs. Mitchell participated in the annual Concord School of Philosophy every year, until its final session in 1888. She wrote, in 1880, a description of the lectures during the previous session, and she delivered a paper titled "Friendship in Aristotle's Ethics" during the Concord session of July, 1887.

Mitchell actively contributed to the Association for the Advancement of Women, regularly attending the annual congresses.  At the 12th Woman's Congress in 1884, held at Baltimore, she delivered a paper titled "A Study of Hegel."  By the A.A.W.'s 13th Congress, held at Des Moines, Iowa, she was Vice Pres. of the A.A.W. for Colorado.  At that same 13th  Annual Congress, Prof. Maria Mitchell, of New York, and Ellen M. Mitchell, of Chicago (Mrs. Francis Mitchell) also were serving the A.A.W. as V.P.'s for the states of New York and Illinois, respectively.  At the A.A.W.'s 18th Women's Congress, at Toronto in 1890, Mitchell delivered a paper titled, "The Dramas of Henrik Ibsen."  Continuing as V. P. of the A.A.W. for Colorado, she was "Chairman" of the A.A.W.'s Committee for Topics and Papers. For the A.A.W.'s 19th Woman's Congress in 1891, at Grand Rapids, Mich., she continued serving as V.P. for Colorado, as the Chair of the Topics &amp; Papers Committee, and she delivered a paper titled "The Real and the Ideal in Art."

Throughout her career, Mitchell advocated, and endeavored to realize, the noble aspiration for American philosophy which was advocated by Walt Whitman in his great poetic essay manifesto of 1871, "Democratic Vistas".  

After 1893, she permanently returned to Geddes (by then a part of Syracuse) to care for her parents. In Syracuse, she organized and led the Round-Table of Syracuse, a literary and philosophical community adult seminar group. The Round Table began in 1894 and continued for more than 20 years.  To assist the participants in their studies and discussions, Mitchell wrote and privately published a series of essays on Dante, Tennyson, and Goethe. The title for one of the essays, "The Way of the Soul" is adapted from Hegel's introduction to his Phenomenology of Spirit. In her introduction to the essay, she wrote:
     "The Round Table of Syracuse is composed of a number of women who meet, season after season, to study and discuss the great books of the world.  They believe with Lowell that the truths which literature interprets can be known only by study of the supreme literary masterpieces.  They seek to trace the influence of literature upon art and their reciprocal relation to the history and social movements of an epoch.
      A clear yet spiritual interpretation of the author's meaning is diligently sought at first without the aid of any commentary.  This plan stimulates the members to do their own thinking, to discover for themselves what the original work has to say that they can comprehend.  Later, the help of commentaries is welcomed, ideas are compared and sifted, and opinion separated from knowledge.
      One aim of the Round Table is rational conversation.  By question and answer, by informal discussion, by the living contact of mind with mind, thought is quickened and stimulated, and many a problem independently suggested and solved.
      The studies pursued during the season of 1901-1902 relate for the most part to the dominant ideas of the nineteenth century as expressed in literature, art, philosophy, and science.  Selections from the great prose writers were followed by a comparative study of Tennyson's 'In Memoriam' and Dante's 'Divine Comedy'.  To sum up the spiritual gain of this work is impossible.  The following essay simply seeks to trace 'The Way of the Soul' out of the 'shadow of night' into the 'daybreak.'   Syracuse, March 15, 1902."

Ellen M. Mitchell died in Syracuse, N.Y. May 14, 1920 at the age of 81, three months before the 19th amendment to the constitution was ratified, finally establishing universal suffrage.  She is interred beside her parents in the Myrtle Hill Cemetery of the Village of Geddes.

In her obituary, May 16, 1920, the Syracuse Herald newspaper commented:  "The Herald records with sincere regret the death of Mrs. Ellen M. Mitchell, for many years the gentle preceptor and oracle of the Syracuse Round Table.  The value of her services to the literary life of the city cannot easily be overestimated....Mrs. Mitchell's personality was singularly lovable, and it imparted a magnetic charm to her discourse and her teaching.  On its intellectual side the City of Syracuse is much the poorer by her death."

==Philosophy==
"A Study of Greek Philosophy", Mitchell's book length philosophical discussion, was published in 1891 by S.C.Griggs &amp; Co. The book contains 36 chapter essays, chronologically presenting the development of the classical Greek tradition in philosophy, extending from the pre-Socratics to the neo-Platonists.  Her book is the first book length philosophical analysis to have been written in America by a woman scholar.  It guides university students, philosophy specialists, educators, and adult scholars through a program of study of the ancient Greek tradition in philosophy.  The book is, also, the first book to preserve the legacy of ancient Greek philosophy in the New World.

In her introduction to her book, Mitchell wrote:

     "It may be interesting to my readers to know something of the genesis of this book.  Twelve years ago, in St. Louis, a little band of women used to assemble every week to study and discuss the problems of philosophy.  I led the circle as teacher and learner.  Beginning with the study of Greek thought, and applying myself diligently to the works of the great masters, and the commentaries to be found in English, German and French, I sought continually to make clear to others what became clear to myself.  At the end of two years, the circle in St. Louis was exchanged for one in Denver, but with unabated interest and enthusiasm on my part and that of my co-workers.  At their request, the verbal exposition became a written one, and finally developed into its present form.  Whatever merit it possesses is due in part to those who have helped me towards the light by their eager questions, their hesitation at the obscure, their quick appreciation of spiritual truth hidden beneath obscure phraseology, their loving fellowship and sympathy.  Above all other teachers I am indebted to Dr. William T. Harris. From him I first learned to seek philosophy in the history of philosophy, and to find it everywhere as the spiritual interpretation of the universe.  I have also received help and stimulus from the expositions and lectures of Prof. F. Louis Soldan, of St. Louis; Prof. D.J. Snider, of Chicago; Prof. Thomas Davidson, of New York; from the Concord School of Philosophy; and the Kant Club, of Denver."

Reviews of the book were offered by prominent scholars and thought leaders when it was published in 1891:
     * Dr. W.T. Harris, U.S. Commissioner of Education: "It shows on every page evidence of scholarship in the best lines, and of real insight into the questions discussed." 
     * S.H. Howison, Prof. of Philosophy, University of California, Berkeley: "I am deeply gratified to read in English, at last, a work on the great Greek thinkers that does not 'condescend' toward them as if they were infantile minds compared with moderns, but brings to convincing light the truly permanent value of their thinking."
     * Edmund Clarence Stedman: "This survey, with its analysis of the Greek schools, is the most clear and inclusive, as far as my knowledge extends, that has been made in our language within so compact a space. It is of genuine value."
     * Prof. Louis J. Block, Chicago: "Admirable in spirit and excellent in matter.  I do not know where a clearer and more useful history of Greek philosophy is to be found."
     * Frank Sanborn, in Springfield Republican: "There is probably no manual better than this for those who would begin the study of the Greek masters, and yet the book lacks the dryness of manuals and has an interest for all thoughtful readers."
     * Caroline K. Sherman, in Chicago Herald: "This is no superficial hand-book giving a hasty survey of Greek thought - no condensed, simplified form of a larger treatise. It is a careful study from original sources of the great thinkers of antiquity, and it is presented to willing students in a form that will tempt them to go likewise to the same original sources."
     * Science, New York: "This work is written in an earnest, serious spirit, and with an evident desire to present the truth as the writer understands it. It is impartial too as between the different schools of thinkers, none of them being slighted, and no decided preference shown for one over another except as their real importance demands it."
     * Vouga's Art Folio, New York: "The work is comprehensive, and the author has, in a clear compact manner, given a place to each school, following the sequences in a style likely to impress the readers most forcibly, while the explanations and deductions show a most thorough and careful study of a complex and sometimes confused subject." 
     * Review of Reviews, New York: "This little work is an interesting, valuable, and very comprehensive view of the whole course of Greek philosophic thought."
     * The Scotsman, Edinburgh: "The book is one from which the general readers can gather a clear idea of the drift of Greek thought, its subject-matter and development, which will serve as an excellent groundwork for further study." 
     * The Methodist Review, Volume 52 (1892):  "The value of philosophy is the basal assumption in the issue of the above volume. Because of its lofty range of inquiry, its thought discipline, and its search after the ultimate truth, it ranks among the chief studies that can occupy human attention.  Greek philosophy also, from its antecedent and fundamental relation to the later philosophic systems, is a perpetual body of instruction. Its maxims have an enduring charm for men; its theories, if dissented from, are wisely conceived; its leaders are among the great schoolmasters of the world.  In a circle of St. Louis women, where the study of Greek thought was undertaken under the lead of the present author, the book now considered had its origin.  From the rise of philosophy in Greece, under the Ionians, to its close following Neo-Platonism the historic review here sweeps.  The personality of many great leaders of Grecian thought-as Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno-is set forth with clearness; and the differing systems which they gave to their age and the world are traced with sufficient outline for the full understanding of the whole range of Grecian inquiry in those great centuries of intellectual activity.  It is instructive in these days, when the materialistic is receiving its full share of notice at the expense of the ideal, to notice such a circle of learners as that which gave the present volume its origin; and in the published result of their philosophic pursuits a wider circle of readers should find enjoyment and edification." 
     * Julia Ward Howe, in Literary World, Boston: "Mrs. Mitchell's volume is evidently the work of one who loves philosophy for its own sake. No tiresome pedantry, no encyclopedic dryness is found in its pages, but an earnest desire to present the theme in a graphic and tangible form, which shall rather invite the reader to its further study than discourage him with a mass of difficulties not to be overcome. A wholesome, appreciative, intelligible book. The volume of some two hundred eighty pages represents wide reading and careful study. Its contents belong to that easy reading which does not come of easy writing, but of the endeavor on the part of the writer to make "the crooked straight and rough places plain," an endeavor which cannot in this field be too highly commended.  Mrs. Mitchell conveys much valuable information and suggestion in a small space, but does not fatigue the reader with overcrowding facts and statements.  Rev. W.R. Alger, highly reputed as a student and lover of philosophy, contributes a brief paper on the "Claim and Charm" of his favorite pursuit."

William R. Alger, in his introduction to the book wrote, in part:
      "The etymological force of the word philosophy is the love of wisdom. Seizing this, we grasp a descriptive phrase, not a definition; we take possession of the practical substance but miss the dialectic essence.  Wisdom is knowledge enriching experience with blessed fruits.  Wisdom is assimilative insight in fruition at its goal.  But, let us leave the surface of description, and enter the depth of definition.  What is philosophy?  It is that form of thinking wherein all the parts imply one another, and every part implies the whole.  It is that kind of knowledge which has its presuppositions in itself, and is, therefore, independent of all other knowledge, while all other knowledge is dependent upon it.  It is the self-seizure of the idea in reflective consciousness.  It is the science of self-activity.  It is the pure search after the First Principle, the finding of it, and the deduction thence of all else.  It takes for its province those elements and methods which are common to all the special sciences, and groups them in a sovereign unification.  Hence, with entire justice, it has generally been designated the science of sciences, queen of all the rest.  Strenuous efforts have recently been made in several elaborate lectures to show that ethical science does not depend either on religion or philosophy, but is every way competent to itself.  This is a shallow confusion of thought, and an unwarrantable use of language.  The case may be conclusively stated in a nutshell thus: Philosophy is the science of ultimate grounds.  Morality is the science of right and wrong in human conduct."

Ellen Mitchell focused her writings on the philosophy of history, philosophy of art, political ethics, [[transcendentalism]], and [[Phidias]] and [[Plato]]. While lecturing at the Denver University she was one of the first to introduce women to idealist thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the other being Marietta Kies.

In “The Philosophy of Pessimism” she was one of the philosophers who resisted philosophical systems that grew out of the skeptical tradition. They were not interested in determining what is not true, possible, or real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She only believed in positive theories that relied on what God created, like nature rather than based on human reason and judgment, it was based on the God-given world. Mitchell was part of the idealist philosophers.

One of her larger successes was “A Study of Hegel.” This seventeen page article did not discuss Hegel’s theories in detail. It does discuss important issues for women; nature, art, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a paragraph in the article that distorts Hegel’s thought by using her own thoughts;

:"We communicate with the outward world through the organs of sense; but the impressions received by this means are confused and unrelated, and do not of themselves constitute knowledge, until they have been referred to the unifying power of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conflicts with Hegel’s belief as the mind must not be said to stand apart from the world as Mitchell here implies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paragraph starts the same as Hegel's belief of communicating with the world through senses, but it changes to hers about how to gain the power of knowledge is through using these senses to your individual experiences in life. This shows that she did not always just state other philosopher beliefs, but also had her own philosophies. When it came to the person and society Mitchell said that someone being away from social order is impossible. She states that “social institutions play a critical role in individual self-determination",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  meaning that in order to rise above, an individual must become a part of society to be able to rise above it.

In her book ''A study of Greek Philosophy'' she claims the object of knowledge in philosophy is the human spirit itself, and truth is a living process which develops and advances in the civilizing course of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Ellen M.|title=A Study of Greek Philosophy: -1891|year=1891|publisher=Cornell University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the book it reveals that we gain self-knowledge as we gain more experiences in life that affects our knowledge and become who we are.

[[File:Nelumbo nucifera2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] flower, the species of flower said to have been used during the Flower Sermon.]]
The '''Flower Sermon''' is a story of the origin of [[Zen]] Buddhism in which ''[[Śākyamuni Buddha]]'' (Siddhartha Gautama) [[Dharma transmission|transmits]] direct ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]]'' (wisdom) to the disciple [[Mahakasyapa|Mahākāśyapa]]. In the original Chinese, the story is '''''Niān huá wéi xiào''''' (拈華微笑, literally "Pick up flower, subtle smile").

==Content==
In the story, ''Śākyamuni'' gives a wordless sermon to his disciples (''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'') by holding up a white flower. No one in the audience understands the Flower Sermon except [[Mahākāśyapa]], who smiles. Within Zen, the Flower Sermon communicates the ineffable nature of ''[[Suchness|tathātā]]'' (suchness) and Mahākāśyapa's smile signifies the direct [[Dharma transmission|transmission]] of wisdom without words. Śākyamuni affirmed this by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I possess the true [[Dharma]] eye, the marvelous mind of [[Nirvana]], the true form of the formless, the subtle [D]harma [G]ate that does not rest on words or letters but is a special transmission outside of the scriptures. This I entrust to Mahākāśyapa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinrich Dumoulin|title=Zen Buddhism: a history|year=2005|pages=9|isbn=0-941532-89-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




==History==
The story of the Flower Sermon appears to have been created by [[Chinese Chán]] Buddhists.&lt;ref name="mystics"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pBmFhnrVfUC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=mystic+flower+sermon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6o_Bak7B3Q&amp;sig=2PiFZwSvG_Dt8bQEErSJv0Am6TU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0HuqSZL_Oozo6QPrnI20Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result|title=Mystics|last=Harmless|first=William|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=192|ISBN=9780198041108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known version of the tale appeared in 1036.&lt;ref name="mystics"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6189">'''Gerard Boate''' (also '''Gérard de Boot''', '''Bootius''' or '''Botius''') (1604, [[Gorinchem]] – 1650, [[Dublin]]) was a Dutch physician, known for his ''Natural History of Ireland''.

==Life==
Boate was born '''Gerrit/Gerard Boot''', in [[Gorinchem]], son of the knight Godfried Boot (c.1570–1625) and of Christine van Loon. He entered the [[university of Leyden]] as a medical student &lt;!-- 21 June 1628, (seems unlikely)--&gt; and graduated there as doctor of medicine 3 July 1628. His younger brother [[Arnold Boate]] (1606–1653) followed him to study medicine in Leiden. Both moved to London around 1630, where their family had settled earlier. Gerard became employed as physician to [[Charles I of England]] and Arnold as physician to the [[Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]]. In 1631 in London Gerard married Catharina Menning (or Manning) with whom he had three children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/retroboeken/nnbw/#source=4&amp;page=113 Biographies of Arnold and Gerard Boot] in the [[Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek]], vol. 4, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Boate became a contributor to the fund under the English act of parliament of 1642, which admitted the Dutch to subscribe money for the reduction of the Irish, to be subsequently repaid by grant of forfeited lands in Ireland. He was admitted a licentiate of the [[College of Physicians]] 6 November 1646. In April 1649 the appointment of Boate as doctor to the hospital at Dublin was referred by the council of state in London to [[Oliver Cromwell]], who had just been appointed commander-in-chief for Ireland. The treasurer-at-war in the following September paid Boate fifty pounds, as physician for Ireland.

Boate arrived in Ireland at the latter end of 1649, while Cromwell was in command there, but he survived only a short time. He died in January 1650. In repayment of Boate's contributions, his widow Katherine Boate, obtained, under certificate dated 15 November 1667, over one thousand acres of land in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]]. Among their descendants was the High Court judge [[Godfrey Boate]],&lt;ref&gt;Ball, F. Elrington  "The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921" John Murray London 1926 Vol.2 p.194&lt;/ref&gt; who is chiefly  remembered for the mocking  elegy on his death by [[Jonathan Swift]]. The Boate lands passed by inheritance to the Hemsworth family.

==Works==
In 1630 he published a book styled ‘Horæ Jucundæ.’ With his brother Arnold, he produced a treatise on philosophy, ''Philosophia Naturalis Reformata'',  published in 1641.

To support the interest of adventurers subscribing for potential Irish lands, he undertook the compilation of a work to supply information on Irish produce. Boate himself had never visited Ireland; but materials for his work were furnished by his brother Arnold and by some of the English who had been expelled by the [[Irish rebellion of 1641]]. Boate started the ‘Natural History’ early in 1645 and completed it within the year, but its publication was deferred.

Boate's papers and his ‘Natural History’ left behind him in London came into the hands of [[Samuel Hartlib]]. With the assent of Arnold Boate, then in Paris, the ‘Natural History’ was published at London in 1652 by Hartlib, with a dedication to [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Charles Fleetwood]], commander-in-chief in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Full title: ‘Ireland's Naturall History. Being a true and ample description of its situation, greatness, shape, and nature; of its hills, woods, heaths, bogs; of its fruitfull parts and profitable grounds, with the severall ways of manuring and improving the same; with its heads or promontories, harbours, roades, and bayes; of its springs and fountaines, brookes, rivers, loghs; of its metalls, mineralls, freestone, marble, sea-coal, turf, and other things that are taken out of the ground. And lastly of the nature and temperature of its air and season, and what diseases it is free from or subject unto. Conducing to the advancement of navigation, husbandry, and other profitable arts and professions. Written by Gerard Boate, late Doctor of Physick to the State in Ireland, and now published by Samuel Hartlib, Esq., for the common good of Ireland, and more especially for the benefit of the Adventurers and Planters there.’&lt;/ref&gt; In his dedication, Hartlib observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I lookt also somewhat upon the hopefull appearance of replanting Ireland shortly, not only by the adventurers, but happily by the calling in of exiled Bohemians and other Protestants also, and happily by the invitation of some well affected out of the Low Countries, which to advance are thoughts suitable to your noble genius, and to further the settlement thereof, the Natural History of that countrie will not be unfit, but very subservient.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ‘Natural History’ is divided into twenty-four chapters. In a letter, dated Paris, 10 August, prefixed to the volume and addressed to Hartlib, Arnold Boate stated that his brother had contemplated three more books on the plants, ‘living creatures,’ and natives of Ireland respectively. A French version, under the title of ‘Histoire Naturelle d'Irlande,’ was published at Paris in 1666. A quarto edition of the ‘Natural History’ by Boate was published at Dublin in 1726, and reissued there in 1755. It was again published in the first volume of a ‘Collection of Tracts and Treatises illustrative of the Natural History, Antiquities, and Political and Social State of Ireland,’ Dublin, 1860.

Canters studied [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Groningen]]. She went on to study the philosophy of religion with feminist philosopher and theologian Professor [[Grace Jantzen]] at King's College, London University. Canters was awarded a Master of Arts degree. Following this Canters won a scholarship to study for a doctorate at the University of Sunderland under the supervision of Dr. [[Pamela Sue Anderson]] and others.

Her thesis was a study of the Belgian feminist philosopher and former Lacanian psychoanalyst [[Luce Irigaray]], in particular her book ''Elemental Passions''. Eventually, her thesis was supervised by Jantzen and successfully examined.

''Infrastructure for Peace'' is a new approach in [[peacebuilding]] which gained momentum after locally led and participatory peacebuilding practices tended to yield effective results in some countries beset by conflicts. It underpins the ideas of [[conflict transformation]] and stresses on under-girding the politically negotiated settlements at top level by peacebuilding efforts at the grassroots.

==Definition==
In 2010, governments, political parties, civil society and [[United Nations]] country representatives from 14 African countries in [[Kenya]] agreed upon a working definition of ''infrastructures for peace'' as a ‘dynamic network of interdependent structures, mechanisms, resources, values and skills which, through dialogue and consultation, contribute to conflict prevention and [[peacebuilding]] in a society’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=JPD Editors|title=The Evolving Landscape of Infrastructures for Peace|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=1–7|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774793|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15423166.2013.774793#.VXvjcfmqqko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Studies exemplify [[National Peace Council (Ghana)]], Department on Ethnic, Religious Policy and Civil Society Interaction (Kyrgyzstan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Chetan|last2=de la Haye|first2=Jos|title=‘Hybrid Peacemaking: Building National "Infrastructures for Peace"’|journal=Global Governance|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=13–20|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/UNDP_BCPR_Chetan%20Kumar_Infrastructures%20for%20Peace.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economical approaches in Guyana, Bolivia and Kenya and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] contributes to about 30 infrastructures for peace projects around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Jordan|title=Infrastructures for Peace as a Path to Resilient Societies: An Institutional Perspective|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=14–24|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774806|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15423166.2013.774806#.VXvk9Pmqqko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critical studies on the ''infrastructure for peace'' mainly see this as a fuzzy concept because [[peacebuilding]] cannot be guaranteed only by local efforts. Such local infrastructures are prone to suffer from political upheavals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuma|first1=Aeneas|last2=Ojielo|first2=Ozonnia|title=Building a Standing National Capacity for Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Kenya|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=25–39|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774790}}&lt;/ref&gt; they still rely on external funding and cannot do well under strictly autocratic regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odendaal|first1=Andries|title=The Political Legitimacy of National Peace Committees|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=40–53|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.767601}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21647259.2016.1156813?journalCode=rpcb20 New research works], which conflate infrastructures for peace with [[security sector reform]] have also suggested such architectures need to rise above local boundaries to negotiate on security issues because (in)security has transnational connections.&lt;ref&gt;Ghimire, Safal. 2016.

As its first secretary, he influenced the initial work of the Académie, but his legacy and influence on the Académie and the growth of science in France is mixed.

==Early life and education==

He was born at [[Vire]], Normandy (now in the department of [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]]), the son of Vire lawyer Nicolas Du Hamel. The family also included two other brothers, Georges, who would become a lawyer like his father and go onto great success as a member of the Grand Conseil in Paris, and Guillaume, who became a priest and served in the court of the King of France.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, David. ''Science and Social Status: The Members of the Académie des Sciences, 1666–1750.'' The Boydell Press, 1995, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;  He began his formal studies at [[Caen]], moving to  Paris in 1642.  Du Hamel demonstrated an early aptitude for scholarly work, and at the age of eighteen published an explanation of the work of [[Theodosius of Bithynia]] called ''Sphériques de Théodose'', to which he added a treatise on [[trigonometry]]. He also showed an interest in a religious career, entering the [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Congregation of the Oratory]] in 1643, choosing them over other sects due to their focus on service and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to Angers to teach philosophy, and was formally ordained a priest while there in 1649.  While in Angers, he not only focused his attention on theology, but also on the study of mathematics, astronomy, and science. He was then  transferred back to Paris as an instructor at an Oratorian school on the Rue Saint Honoré. It is while in Paris that he published two of his works, the ''Astronomia Physica'' and ''De Meteoris et Fossibilus''  in 1660, both of which analyze and compare ancient theories with [[Cartesianism]]. This combination of theoretical and scientific analysis made many of Du Hamel's contemporaries see him and his work as a link between theology and the new ideas of science.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Paris==
His return to Paris coincided with the end of the [[Fronde]] rebellion in 1652.  This timing proved fortuitous for Du Hamel, as his absence from the capital meant he was not tainted by political leanings or participation in the rebellion.  He also became reacquainted with his brother George, who, as a prominent attorney and member of the Grand Conseil, introduced him to some powerful patrons, including Hardouin de Péréfixe, a former tutor of Louis XIV and Archbishop of Paris, as well as the prominent Barberini family.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  Du Hamel leaves the Oratorians in 1653, but is then put in charge of the parish of [[Neuilly-sur-Marne]]. Resigning this position in 1663, he became chancellor of the church of [[Bayeux]]. At the same time, he is also busy in his study of natural philosophy and science, writing one of his most famous works, ''De Consensu Veteris er Novae Philosophiae'', in 1663.  By now, Du Hamel is a well-known and well-respected scholar with books on theological and philosophical issue that gained attention in the learned community, and with the help of his brother, and possibly his patron Péréfixe, Du Hamel comes to the attention of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] as a potential secretary for the new Académie des Sciences. Du Hamel possesses many qualities that Colbert was looking for in a secretary for the group: he could read and write well in Latin, which would allow for communication with other scholars in Europe, he had recently published well-received works, he did not have any residual political alliance from the Fronte rebellions, and he had not participated in the handful of private academies that preceded the founding of the Académie des Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; When Colbert founds the Académie of Sciences in 1666, he appointed Du Hamel its first secretary.

==Académie des Sciences==
Initially, Du Hamel handled the traditional work of a secretary; he recorded the minutes of the meetings, and assisted in the leadership of the group.  One of his first duties was a trip to Caen to visit the [[Académie de Physique]], formed there in 1662 by [[Pierre-Daniel Huet]] and André Graindorge.  Here, he observed the operation of the group, and, when the Académie des Sciences is officially founded at the end of 1666, establishes a relationship between the two groups, which will become more formal after the Académie de Physique follows the Académie des Science as the second scientific group to receive royal recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, p. 162-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is Du Hamel, through his writings, which influence the social perception of the organization.  In 1678 he publishes a new, four volume work ''Philosophia Vetus et Nova'' (originally attributed to Colbert, but written by Du Hamel), a new version of his ''De Consensu Veteris er Novae Philosophiae'' that was created to be used in universities and other schools to discuss and attempt to reconcile the various schools of philosophy, both ancient and modern.  It was considered one of the most influential books in France at the time.  Du Hamel also attributed the theories espoused by the book as representative of the ideas of the Academie, rather than just his own, allowing the Académie and its principals to touch students and promote and popularized science in the educated parts of French society.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Du Hamel’s influence would not be felt as strongly as he (and others) may have wished, with some scholars attributing this to his religious influences, and others to his attention to other work.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, p.146, and Stroup, Alice. "Royal Funding of the Parisian Académie Royal des Sciences During the 1690s," in ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.'' Volume 77, Part 4, 1987, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, his sterling reputation and his command of Latin caused him to be appointed as a member of the French delegation at [[Aix-la-Chapelle]], negotiating a peace with Spain after the [[War of Devolution]].  In addition, he was later sent to England to assist a French diplomat, and while there, met with [[Robert Boyle]], [[Henry Oldenburg]], and other members of the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

This extended absence from the Académie undermined Du Hamel’s influence on the group.  While away, [[Jean Gallois]] had been acting as secretary, but didn’t command the same respect and admiration from the other members&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, even upon returning to Paris, Du Hamel does not immediately reengage with the Académie, leaving the business affairs of the group in disorder, with no minutes recorded for the group from 1670–1674.&lt;ref&gt;Stroup, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Du Hamel also began to devote himself more reverently to his religious work, stepping back from scientific studies, except for his continued efforts toward writing and publishing a history of the Académie (in Latin).  His commitment to writing and publishing in Latin also causes him some difficulty within the Académie, as many of the newer members prefer to write and publish in French.  He completed his history of the group (''Regiae Scientiarum Academiae Historia'') in 1698, shortly after being replaced as secretary by [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]].   The reorganization of the Académie in 1699 had little or no effect on Du Hamel, with the changes to the organization in many ways anathema to his own interests and values.  By 1700 as his scientific work was minimal, and his increasing attention directed toward the church and religion.  Du Hamel died on August 6, 1706 in Paris.

==Legacy==
Du Hamel’s legacy is mixed.  He is best remembered as the first secretary of the Académie des Sciences, but exerted little or no influence over administrative and organizational matters, the traditional role of the secretary.  Instead, it is Du Hamel’s scholarly work, both in his analysis of the competing philosophies of the ancient and new science, as well as his role in disseminating the values and beliefs of the Académie to students and scholars that prove to be the most influential on the history of the science in France.

==Published works==

[[File:John Chilembwe.jpg|thumb|The last known photo of John Chilembwe (left) taken in 1914 about a year before his death]]
Reverend '''John Chilembwe''' (1871 – February 3, 1915) was a [[Baptist]] pastor and educator, who trained as a minister in the [[United States]], returning to [[Nyasaland]] in 1901. He was an early figure in the resistance to [[colonialism]] in Nyasaland ([[Malawi]]), opposing both the treatment of Africans working in agriculture on European-owned [[plantations]] and the colonial government's failure to promote the social and political advancement of Africans. 

Soon after the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Chilembwe organised [[Chilembwe uprising|an unsuccessful uprising]] against colonial rule. Today, Chilembwe is celebrated as a hero of independence, and [[John Chilembwe Day]] is observed annually on January 15 in Malawi.

== Early life ==
There is limited information about John Chilembwe's parentage and birth. An American pamphlet of 1914 claimed that John Chilembwe was born in [[Sangano, Malawi|Sangano]], [[Chiradzulu District]], in the south of what became Nyasaland, in June 1871. [[Joseph Booth (missionary)|Joseph Booth]] also stated that Chilembwe's father was a [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]] and his mother a [[Mang'anja]] slave, captured in warfare. This information was contemporary; in the 1990s, John Chilembwe's granddaughter stated that Chilembwe's father may have been called Kaundama, and was one of those who settled at Mangoche Hill during the Yao infiltration into Mang'anja territory, and that his mother may have been called Nyangu: his likely pre-baptismal name was Nkologo. However, other also quite recent sources give differing parental names.&lt;ref&gt;D T Stuart-Mogg, (1997). A Brief Investigation into The Genealogy of Pastor John Chilembwe of Nyasaland and Some Thoughts upon the Circumstances Surrounding his Death, The Society of Malawi Journal, Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 44–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilembwe attended a [[Church of Scotland]] mission from around 1890.

=== Influence of Joseph Booth ===
In 1892 he became a house servant of [[Joseph Booth (missionary)|Joseph Booth]], a radical and independent-minded missionary. Booth had arrived in Africa in 1892 as a Baptist to establish the [[Zambezi Industrial Mission]] near [[Blantyre]]. Booth was critical of the reluctance of Scottish Presbyterian missions to admit Africans as full church members, and later founded seven more independent missions in Nyasaland which, like the Zambezi Industrial Mission, focused on the equality of all worshippers. In Booth's household and mission where he was closely associated with Booth, Chilembwe became acquainted with Booth's radical religious ideas and egalitarian feelings.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). ''Independent African.  John Chilembwe and the Origins, Setting and Significance of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915''. Edinburgh University Press, pp. 25, 36–8, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Fields, (1985). ''Revival and Rebellion in Colonial Central Africa'', Princeton University Press pp. 125–6. {{ISBN|978-069-109409-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Booth left Nyasaland with Chilembwe in 1897; he returned to Nyasaland alone in 1899 but left permanently in 1902, although he continued to correspond with Chilembwe. After 1906, Booth was strongly influenced by [[Millennialism]], but the extent to which he retained influence over Chilembwe after 1902 or influenced him towards millennial beliefs is disputed, although Booth later strongly influenced [[Elliot Kenan Kamwana]], the first leader of the Watchtower followers of [[Charles Taze Russell]] in Nyasaland.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Fields, (1985). ''Revival and Rebellion in Colonial Central Africa'', pp. 99–100, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Linden and I. Linden, (1971). John Chilembwe and the New Jerusalem, ''[[The Journal of African History]]'', Vol. 12, No. 4, p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education in the United States and relations with American and African Independent Churches===
In 1897 Booth and Chilembwe traveled together to the United States. Because of the difficulties the two encountered when traveling together in the United States, Booth introduced Chilembwe to the Rev. Dr. Lewis G Gordon, Foreign Missions Secretary of the National Baptist Convention, who arranged for the latter to attend the Virginia Theological Seminary and College, (now [[Virginia University of Lynchburg]]), a small Baptist institution at [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] where he almost certainly studied [[African-American]] history.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Garvey (ed. R A Hill), (2006).The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers, Vol. IX: Africa for the Africans, 1921–1922. Oakland, University of California Press, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The principal was a militantly independent Negro, Gregory Hayes and Chilembwe both experienced the contemporary prejudice against negroes and was exposed to radical American Negro ideas and the works of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], [[Booker T. Washington]], [[Frederick Douglass]] and others. He was ordained as a Baptist minister at Lynchburg in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958).

Rotberg and A. A. Mazrui, eds., Protest and Power in Black Africa, New York, Oxford University Press, 356-8. {{ISBN|978-019-500093-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his studies at Lynchburg in 1900, he returned to Nyasaland in 1900 with the blessing of the Foreign Missions Board and financial assistance from the National Baptist Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Garvey (ed. R A Hill), (2006).The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers, Vol. IX: Africa for the Africans, 1921–1922. Oakland, University of California Press, pp. 427-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first 12 years of his ministry after his return to Nyasaland, Chilembwe encouraged African self-respect and advancement through education, hard work and personal responsibility, as advocated by [[Booker T. Washington]],&lt;ref&gt;G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African. John Chilembwe and the Origins, Setting and Significance of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915. Edinburgh University Press, pp. 166, 417&lt;/ref&gt;  His activities were initially supported by white Protestant missionaries, although his relations with Catholic missions were less friendly.&lt;ref&gt;B Morris (2016) The Chilembwe Rebellion, the Society of Malawi Journal, Vol. 68, No. 1 p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1912, Chilembwe developed closer contacts with local [[African initiated church|independent African churches]], including [[Seventh Day Baptist]] and [[Churches of Christ]] congregations, with the aim of uniting some or all of these African churches with his own mission church at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;R. Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, African Historical Studies, Vol. 4, No. 2, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Chilembwe's congregation had formerly been Watchtower followers and he maintained contact with Elliot Kamwana, but the influence of Watchtower's millennial beliefs on him is minimised by most authors except the Lindens.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. I. Rotberg, (1965).

John Chilembwe and the New Jerusalem, The Journal of African History, Vol. 12, No. 4, pp. 631–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the vast majority of those found guilty of rebellion and sentenced to death or to long terms of imprisonment were members of Chilembwe's church, a few other members of the Churches of Christ in Zomba were also found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;L. White, (1984). 'Tribes' and the Aftermath of the Chilembwe Rising, African Affairs, Vol. 83, No. 333, pp. 522–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Nyasaland and mission work==
{{main|Chilembwe's motivation}}
In 1900 Chilembwe returned to Nyasaland, in his own words, "to labour amongst his benighted race". Backed financially the [[National Baptist Convention of America]] who also provided two American Baptist helpers until 1906, Chilembwe started his [[Providence Industrial Mission]] (P.I.M.) in Chiradzulu district. In its first decade, the mission developed slowly, assisted by regular small donations from his American backers, and Chilembwe founded several schools, which by 1912 had 1,000 pupils and 800 adult students.

He preached the values of hard-work, self-respect and self-help to his congregation and, although as early as 1905 he used his church position to deplore the condition of Africans in the protectorate, he initially avoided specific criticism of the government that might be thought subversive. However, by 1912 or 1913, Chilembwe had become more politically militant and openly voiced criticism over the state of African land rights in the [[Shire Highlands]] and of the conditions of labour tenants there, particularly on the A. L. Bruce Estates.&lt;ref&gt;R. Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, pp. 306–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that Chilembwe preached a form of [[Millenarianism]] and that this may have influenced his decision to initiate an armed uprising in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;R. I. Rotberg (1971). Psychological Stress and the Question of Identity: Chilembwe's Revolt Reconsidered, in R. I. Rotberg and A . A. Mazrui (editors) Protest and Power in Black Africa. New York. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; There is very little direct evidence of what Chilembwe did preach although, at least in his first decade in Nyasaland, his main message was of African advancement through Christianity and hard work.&lt;ref&gt;R. Tangri (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, p. 306–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859–1966 Woodbridge, James Currey p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence that has been interpreted as showing his millenarian views is dated from 1914 onward,&lt;ref&gt;J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859–1966 Woodbridge, James Currey p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Linden and I. Linden (1971). John Chilembwe and the New Jerusalem". The Journal of African History. Vol. 12 p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt; when he began baptizing many new church members without their first receiving instruction, as was normal Baptist practice.&lt;ref&gt;L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, p. 133, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-32182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this evidence is ambiguous, and Chilembwe's activities have been more closely related to the [[Ethiopian movement]] of African churches breaking away, often with black American backing, from the more orthodox but European controlled [[Presbyterian]], [[Baptist]], [[Methodist]] or other denominations, than being under the influence of overtly millenarian groups such as the [[Seventh day Adventist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. Jack Thompson]] (2015). "Prester John, John Chilembwe and the European Fear of Ethiopianism," ''The Society of Malawi Journal'' Vol. 68, No. 2, pp. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial grievances===
In the [[Shire Highlands]], the most densely populated part of the protectorate, European estates occupied about 867,000 [[acres]], or over 350,000 [[hectares]], almost half of the best [[arable land]]. Relatively few local Africans remained on the estates when the owners introduced labour rents, preferring to settle on [[Crown Land]] where [[customary law]] entitled them to use (sometimes overcrowded) land belonging to the community, or to become [[migrant workers]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Pachai, (1978). Land and Politics in Malawi 1875–1975, Kingston (Ontario), The Limestone Press, pp. 36–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, planters with large areas of available land but limited labour could engage migrants from [[Mozambique]] (who had no right to use community lands) on terms that Nyasaland Africans found unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;L. White, (1984). 'Tribes' and the Aftermath of the Chilembwe Rising, pp. 513–15.&lt;/ref&gt; These were called "Anguru", a convenient term employed by Europeans to describe as a number of different peoples, mostly speaking one of the [[Makua languages]], often the [[Lomwe language]], who themselves used various names to refer to their places of origin in Mozambique. They left Mozambique in significant numbers from 1899 when a harsh new labour code was introduced, and especially in 1912 and 1913 after a Mozambique famine in 1912. In 1912, the British [[Colonial Office]] described them as working for such low wages as were “a record for any settled part of Africa”. Many of those convicted after the rising were identified as "Anguru".&lt;ref&gt;L. White, (1984). 'Tribes' and the Aftermath of the Chilembwe Rising, pp. 515–18, 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the estates where the "Anguru" became tenants were generally poor, and Africans both on estates and Crown Lands were subjected to an increase in [[Hut tax]] in 1912, despite food shortages. Chilembwe's Providence Industrial Mission was situated in an area dominated by the [[A. L. Bruce Estates]], named after a son-in-law of [[David Livingstone]]. From 1906, A. L. Bruce Estates developed and started to plant a hardy variety of cotton suitable for the Shire Highlands. Cotton required intensive labour over a long growing period, and the estate manager [[William Jervis Livingstone]] (reputed to be a distant relative of David Livingstone) ensured that 5,000 workers were available throughout its 5 or 6 months by exploiting the obligations of the labour tenancy system called [[thangata]], underpaying wage labour and by often violent coercion.&lt;ref&gt;J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859–1966 Woodbridge, James Currey pp. 130–2. {{ISBN|978-1-84701-050-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Livingstone Bruce]], who controlled the A. L. Bruce Estates operations, instructed Livingstone
not to allow any mission work to be carried on or schools to be opened on the Bruce Estates, although the company provided free medical and hospital treatment for workers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Linden and I. Linden, (1971). John Chilembwe and the New Jerusalem, p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Livingstone Bruce held the considered view that educated Africans had no place in colonial society and he opposed their education. He also recorded his personal dislike for Chilembwe as an educated African, and considered all African-led churches were centres for agitation, and prohibited building them on the estate. Although this prohibition applied to all missions, Chilembwe's was the closest; it became a natural focus for African agitation, and Chilembwe became the spokesman for African tenants on the Bruce Estates. Chilembwe provoked confrontation by erecting churches on estate land, which Livingstone burned down because he considered them as centres for agitation against the management and because they made potential claims on estate land.&lt;ref&gt;R Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to the colonial system===
Chilembwe was angered by Livingstone's refusal to accept the worth of African people, and also frustrated by the refusal of the settlers and government to provide suitable opportunities or a political voice to the African "new men", who had been educated by the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and other missions in Nyasaland or in some cases had received a higher education abroad. A number of such men became Chilembwe's lieutenants in the rising.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African, pp. 240–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Linden and I. Linden, (1971). John Chilembwe and the New Jerusalem, pp. 633–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in his first decade at P.I.M., Chilembwe had been reasonably successful, in the five years before his death, he faced a series of problems in the mission and in his personal life. From around 1910, he incurred several debts at a time when mission expenses were rising and funds from his American backers were drying up. Attacks of asthma, the death of a daughter, and his declining eyesight and general health may have deepened his sense of alienation and desperation.&lt;ref&gt;R. I. Rotberg, (1970). Psychological Stress and the Question of Identity: Chilembwe's Revolt Reconsidered, pp. 365–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background to the 1915 Uprising==
The sources cited above agree that, after 1912 or 1913 the series of social and personal issues mentioned increased Chilembwe's bitterness toward Europeans in Nyasaland, and moved him towards thoughts of revolt. However, they treat the outbreak and effects of the First World War as the key factor in moving him from thought to planning to take action, which he believed it was his destiny to lead, for the deliverance of his people.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African, pp. 234–5, 263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, pp. 308–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of this war, some 19,000 Nyasaland Africans served in the [[King's African Rifles]], and up to 200,000 others were forced to be porters for varying periods, mostly in the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]] against the Germans in Tanganyika, and disease caused many casualties among them.&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Page, (2000). "The Chiwaya War": Malawians and the First World War, Boulder (Co), Westview Press pp. 35–6, 37–41, 50–3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the earliest campaigns, a German invasion of Nyasaland and a battle at [[Karonga]] in September 1914 caused Chilembwe to write an impassioned letter against the war to the "Nyasaland Times" newspaper, saying that a number of his countrymen, "have already shed their blood", others were being "crippled for life" and "invited to die for a cause which is not theirs". The war-time censor prevented publication of the letter, and by December 1914, Chilembwe was regarded with suspicion by the colonial authorities.&lt;ref&gt;R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 81–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governor decided to deport Chilembwe and some of his followers, and approached the Mauritius government asking them to accept the deportees a few days before the rising started. The censoring of Chilembwe's letter appears to be the trigger moving him to an actual conspiracy. He began organising a rebellion, gathering together a small group of Africans, educated either at the Blantyre Mission or the schools of the independent, separatist African churches in the Shire Highlands and [[Ntcheu|Ncheu]] District, as his lieutenants. In a series of meetings held in December 1914 and early January 1915, Chilembwe and his leading followers aimed at attacking British rule and supplanting it, if possible. However, it is possible that he learnt of his intended deportation, and was forced to bring forward the date of his revolt, making the prospects of its success more unlikely, and turning it into a symbolic gesture of protest.&lt;ref&gt;R Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, pp.309–11.&lt;/ref&gt; When he brought forward the date of the Shire Highlands rising, Chilembwe was unable to ensure that it could still be coordinated with the planned rising in the Ntcheu District, which was therefore largely abortive.&lt;ref&gt;J. Linden and I. Linden, (1971). John Chilembwe and the New Jerusalem, p. 629&lt;/ref&gt; The failure in Ncheu District may also relate to the pacifism of many Seventh Day Baptist and Watchtower followers who were expected to rise there.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Fields, (1985). Revival and Rebellion in Colonial Central Africa, pp. 125–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1915 Uprisings and death==
{{main|Chilembwe uprising}}
The aims of the rising remain unclear, partly because Chilembwe and many of his leading supporters were killed, and also because many documents were destroyed in a fire in 1919. However, use of the theme of "Africa for the Africans" suggests a political motive rather than a purely millennial religious one.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African, pp. 504–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chilembwe is said to have drawn parallels between his rising and that of John Brown, and stated his wish to "strike a blow and die" immediately before the rising started.&lt;ref&gt;R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is based solely on what [[George Simeon Mwase]], who was absent from Nyasaland in 1915, wrote 17 years after the event. Mwase claimed the phrase, “…strike a blow and die…” was said by Chilembwe several times, but it is not recorded elsewhere, and it conflicts with the actual course of the uprising, where several of the chosen leaders stayed home and many followers fled once troops appeared.&lt;ref&gt; T Price (1969) Review of “Strike a Blow and Die” by George Simeon Mwase and Robert I. Rotberg, Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, Vol. 39, No. 2 p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of Chilembwe's plan was to attack European centres in the Shire Highlands on the night between 23 and 24 January 1915, to obtain arms and ammunition, and the second was to attack European estates in the same area simultaneously. Most of Chilembwe's force of about 200 men were from his P.I.M congregations in Chiradzulu and [[Mulanje]], with some support from other independent African churches in the Shire Highlands. In the third part of the plan, the forces of the Ncheu revolt based on the local independent Seventh Day Baptists would move south to link up with Chilembwe. He hoped that discontented Africans on European estates, relatives of soldiers killed in the war and others would join as the rising progressed.&lt;ref&gt;R Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, pp. 310–12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is uncertain if Chilembwe had definite plans in the event of failure; some suggest he intended to seek a symbolic death, others that he planned to escape to Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 84–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The first and third parts of the plan failed almost completely: some of his lieutenants did not carry out their attacks, so few arms were obtained, the Ncheu group had failed to form and move south, and there was no mass support for the rising.&lt;ref&gt;J. McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859–1966 Woodbridge, James Currey p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack on European estates was largely one on the Bruce estates, where William Jervis Livingstone was killed and beheaded and two other European employees killed. Three African men were also killed by the rebels; a European-run mission was set on fire, and a missionary was severely wounded and an African girl died in the fire. Apart from this girl, all the dead and injured were men, as Chilembwe had ordered that women should not be harmed. On 24 January, a Sunday, Chilembwe conducted a service in the P.I.M. church next to a pole impaling Livingstone's head, but by 26 January he realised that the uprising had failed to gain local support. After avoiding attempts to capture him and apparently trying to escape into Mozambique, he was tracked down and killed on 3 February.&lt;ref&gt;R Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859–1966 Woodbridge, James Currey p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath of the Uprising==
Most of Chilembwe's leading followers and some other participants in the rising were executed after summary trials under [[Martial law]] shortly after it failed. The total number of those killed is unclear, because [[extrajudicial killings]] were carried out by European members of the Nyasaland Volunteer Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 87–91,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Charlton (1993). Some Notes on the Nyasaland Volunteer Reserve, The Society of Malawi Journal, Vol. 46, No. 2, pp. 35–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Commission of Enquiry into Chilembwe’s uprising was appointed and, at its hearings in June 1915, the European planters blamed missionary activities while European missionaries emphasised the dangers of the teaching and preaching by independent African churches like those led by Chilembwe. Several Africans who gave evidence complained about the treatment of workers on estates, but were largely ignored. The official enquiry needed to find causes for the rising and it blamed Chilembwe for his mixture of political and religious teaching, but also the unsatisfactory conditions on the A L Bruce Estates and the unduly harsh regime of W J Livingstone.&lt;ref&gt;L White, (1984). 'Tribes' and the Aftermath of the Chilembwe Rising, pp. 523–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The enquiry heard that the conditions imposed on the A L Bruce Estates were illegal and oppressive, including paying workers poorly or in kind (not in cash), demanding excessive labour from tenants or not recording the work they did, and whipping and beating both workers and tenants. The abuses were confirmed by Magomero workers and tenants questioned by the Commission in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 78–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livingstone alone was blamed for these unsatisfactory conditions, and the resident director of the A L Bruce Estates, Alexander Livingstone Bruce, who had absolute control over estate policy and considered that educated Africans had no place in colonial society, escaped censure.&lt;ref&gt;J McCracken, (2012).A History of Malawi, 1859–1966, pp. 130–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept that the only appropriate relationship between Europeans and Africans was that of master and servant was at the heart of colonial society, led by the landowners. This concept may have been what Chilembwe aimed to fight against with his schools and self-help schemes, and ultimately why he turned to violent action,&lt;ref&gt;L White, (1984). 'Tribes' and the Aftermath of the Chilembwe Rising, pp. 524–5.&lt;/ref&gt; although see also &lt;ref&gt;Rotberg, Robert. Psychological Stress and the Question of Identity: Chilembwe's Revolt Reconsidered" in Protest and Power in Black Africa. p337-373. Ox Uni Press 1970&lt;/ref&gt; for an alternate viewpoint.

==Nyasaland Independence and legacy==
[[File:5 kwacha.jpg|thumb|5 kwacha banknote of 2005]]
[[Nyasaland]] gained independence in 1964, taking the name Malawi. Chilembwe's likeness was seen on the obverse of all [[Malawian kwacha]] notes from 1997 until May 2012, when new notes were launched; the 500 Kwacha note still carries his portrait. Since December 2016, the newly introduced 2000 Kwacha note also carries his picture.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} John Chilembwe Day is observed annually on January 15 in Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malawihighcommission.co.uk/index.php/about-malawi|title=About Malawi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal malpractice''' is the term for [[negligence]], breach of [[fiduciary duty]], or [[breach of contract]] by an [[Lawyer|attorney]] during the provision of legal services that causes harm to a client.&lt;ref name=conclaims/&gt;

==Examples==
A common example of legal malpractice involves the lawyer's missing a deadline for filing a paper with the court or serving a paper on another party, where that error is fatal to the client's case or causes the client to spend more money to resolve the case than would otherwise have been required.&lt;ref name=expertlaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Malpractice Law and Litigation|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/malpractice/legal_malpractice.html|website=Expert Law|publisher=Expertlaw.com|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=In re Kaiser Grp.  Int’l Inc.,  No. 00-02263-MFW (Bankr. D. Del. Aug.  17, 2010).|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6392701043603714793|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a lawyer may commit malpractice by:
* After being retained to file a claim or lawsuit, failing to file a case before the statute of limitations expires.
* Failing to respond to potentially dispositive motions filed by the opposing party.
* Failing to timely file a notice of appeal.

Malpractice may also occur as the result of a breach of the contract pursuant to which the client is represented by the attorney.&lt;ref name=conclaims&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Josh J.|title=Continuing Evolution of Legal Mal Breach of Contract Claims|url=https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/almID/1202758271123/|website=The Legal Intelligencer|accessdate=7 March 2018|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

Under U.S. law, in order to rise to an actionable level of negligence (an actual breach of a legal [[duty of care]]), the injured party must show that the attorney's acts were not merely the result of poor strategy, but that they were the result of errors that no reasonably prudent attorney would make. While the elements of a cause of action for legal malpractice may vary by state, under typical state law the four elements of legal malpractice are:
# An attorney-client relationship,
# Negligence by the attorney,
# A loss or injury to the client caused by the negligence, and
# Financial loss or injury to the client.&lt;ref name=expertlaw/&gt;

To satisfy the third element, legal malpractice requires proof of what would have happened had the attorney not been negligent; that is, "but for" the attorney's negligence ([[sine qua non|"but for" causation]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Viner v. Sweet,'' 30 Cal. 4th 1232, 70 P.3d 1046, 135 Cal. Rptr. 2d 629 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; If the same result would have occurred without negligence by the attorney, no [[cause of action]] will be permitted.  "But for" or actual causation can be difficult to prove.  If the malpractice alleged occurred in litigation, the legal malpractice  case may result in a "trial-within-a-trial" which delves into the facts of the case for which the client originally retained the attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koffler|first1=Joseph H.|title=Legal Malpractice Damages in a Trial Within a Trial: A Critical Analysis of Unique Concepts: Areas of Unconscionability|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=1989|volume=73|issue=1|page=40|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1727|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof of innocence===

In at least 11 jurisdictions, a person convicted of a crime who then sues his defense attorney must first prove that he was factually ''innocent'' (in other words, he must first petition for and obtain [[exoneration]] from the court that originally convicted him before filing suit) and that he was convicted only because of his attorney's negligence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Wiley v. County of San Diego'', 19 Cal. 4th 532, 966 P.2d 983, 79 Cal. Rptr. 2d 672 (1998).  In this case, the [[Supreme Court of California]] noted that 10 states have already squarely ruled that factual innocence is an essential element of a criminal convict's legal malpractice case against his attorney, and proceeded to join them.  The Court also noted that the exceptions are Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;  A plaintiff who has lost a civil case must prove that the legal malpractice complained of caused the case to be lost, so that the plaintiff can then recover from the negligent attorney the damages that would have been owed by the underlying defendant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some jurisdictions have reject or limit application of the actual innocence element of the exoneration rule, meaning that a criminal defendant may pursue a legal malpractice claim against his counsel without first having to prove actual innocence or obtain post-conviction relief.

The rule may be held inapplicable where the question of guilt is irrelevant to the alleged malpractice. For example, in Iowa, a defendant who receives inadequate representation at sentencing was allowed to pursue a malpractice claim without also challenging the underlying conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Kraklio vs. Simmons'', No. 16-1392 (Iowa Supreme Court, 2018)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18231819296888639471|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kansas, a legal malpractice action was allowed when brought by defendant who was not claiming innocence but was instead asserting that an error by criminal defense counsel cost him the opportunity for a more favorable plea bargain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Cortez v. Gindhart'', 435 N.J. Super. 589 (App. Div. 2014)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8291825146134691388|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iowa and Kansas have held that proof of innocence is not a separate element of a legal malpractice claim against a criminal defense lawyer, but is instead a factor that a jury may consider when applying the standard elements of legal malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Barker v. Capotosto'', 875 NW 2d 157 (2016)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11803035564960815945|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Mashaney v. Bd. of Indigents' Def. Servs.'', 302 Kan. 625, 355 P.3d 667 (2015)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1897493449021192205|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Idaho Supreme Court found that to require a defendant to show actual innocence in order to proceed with a legal malpractice claim against a criminal defense lawyer would conflict with the presumption of innocence a defendant is to enjoy at trial, disregards harm that may result to a client other than being convicted, and potentially allow a defense lawyer to shirk duties to a client the lawyer knows to be guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Molen v. Christian'', 388 P. 3d 591 (2017)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13009923380255453327|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ludwig Landgrebe''' (9 March 1902, [[Vienna]] &amp;ndash; 14 August 1991, [[Cologne]]) was an Austrian [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] and Professor of philosophy. He is the grandfather of award-winning German actor Max Landgrebe.

== Life ==
Landgrebe studied philosophy, history and geography in [[University of Vienna|Vienna]]. Influenced by [[Max Scheler]], he continued his studies in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]]. In 1923 Landgrebe became assistant to [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859-1938). After the approval of his doctoral dissertation, Landgrebe transferred to [[Prague]] for his postdoctoral qualification under [[Oskar Kraus]]. From 1939 he collaborated with [[Eugen Fink]] at the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy|Husserl-Archives]] in [[Leuven]]. Landgrebe's wife, Ilse Maria Goldschmidt, was of Jewish ancestry and sister of the writer [[Georges-Arthur Goldschmidt]].  In 1940 Landgrebe was deported to Belgium. He worked part-time as a merchant assistant in Hamburg.

In 1945 Landgrebe had his post-doctorate reapproved in [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]], and he was made ordinary professor in 1947 in [[University of Kiel|Kiel]], where [[Hans Blumenberg]] was one of his students. In 1954 he transferred to [[Cologne]], and become director of the Husserl-Archives there. Landgrebe is known as one of Husserl's closest associates, but also for his independent views relating to the subjects of history, religion and politics, as seen from the viewpoints of [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]]. Metaphysics - ''Man's reflective remembrance, upon the whole of his being''.

==Biography==
Merlin Stone was born in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush,]] [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. She attended Public School #217 and [[Erasmus Hall High School]], where she graduated in 1949 with a Metallic Art Medal Award.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
She became interested in [[archaeology]] and ancient religions from her study of ancient art. 
She taught at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 
From 1958 to 1967, she worked as a sculptor, exhibiting widely and executing numerous commissions.&lt;ref&gt;According to the author's information on the 1976 Harcourt edition of ''When God Was a Woman''.&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent a decade on research before writing the book published in the UK as ''The Paradise Papers'' and then in the U.S. as ''[[When God Was a Woman]]'' (1976). It describes her theory of how the Hebrews suppressed goddess-worshipping religions practiced in [[Canaan]] and how their reaction to what she says were existing [[Matriarchy|matriarchial]] and [[matrilineal]] societal structures shaped [[Judaism]] and thus [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone (1976) p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Her theory builds on the ideas of [[The Greek Myths|Robert Graves]],&lt;ref&gt;Stone (1976) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; but rather than starting from his work, Stone gathered material from the "libraries, museums, universities, and excavation sites of the United States, Europe and the Near East."&lt;ref&gt;Stone (1976) p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; She observed within these materials "the sexual and religious bias of many of the erudite scholars of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries",&lt;ref&gt;Stone (1976) p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; and challenges many of their conclusions, raising doubts about the criticisms of Graves's theories.

Her other major work, ''Ancient Mirrors of Womanhood'', collects stories, myths, and prayers involving goddess figures from a wide variety of world religions, ancient and otherwise. Stone's hypotheses are radical and challenging to the accepted views of antiquity. She is the author of numerous short stories, book reviews, and essays, including ''3,000 Years of Racism''.

Stone's book ''When God Was a Woman'' had a profound effect on the emerging Goddess Culture of the 1970s and 1980s in the US.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=10 November 2014|title=Merlin Stone Remembered|url=|department=Book reviews|journal=Publishers Weekly|volume=261|issue=45|pages=55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was featured in the 1989 documentary ''[[Goddess Remembered]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kinolorber.com/film/view/id/1028|title=Women and Spirituality: The Goddess Trilogy|last=|first=|date=|website=Kino Lorber|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was diagnosed with [[pseudobulbar palsy]] in 2005&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and died of [[dementia]] complications in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150424949945335&amp;id=1029487486|title=Requiem for Merlin Stone|last=Budapest|first=Zsuzsanna|authorlink=Zsuzsanna Budapest|date=25 February 2011|website=Facebook|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Othmar Spann''' (1 October 1878 – 8 July 1950) was a conservative [[Austria]]n philosopher, sociologist and economist whose radical anti-liberal and anti-Socialist views, based on early 19th century [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic]] ideas expressed by [[Adam Müller]] et al. and popularized in his books and [[lecture]] courses, helped antagonise political factions in Austria during the interwar years.

== Early life ==

Othmar Spann was the son of Josef Spann, a manufacturer and inventor. Spann grew up in Altmannsdorf, a suburban area of Vienna, Austria which is 15 minutes outside of the central city. Spann attended a ''Bürgerschule'' (citizen school) and graduated in 1898. After that he studied philosophy in Vienna, followed by Political Sciences in [[Zürich]], [[Bern]], and [[Tübingen]]. He received his doctorate in Political Science in 1903.

From 1904 to 1907, Spann worked for the "Center for Private Welfare Service" in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. He was responsible for empirical studies of this population of workers. By the end of 1904 Spann, along with Hermann Beck and Hanns Dorn founded a newspaper called "Critical Pages for the whole Social Sciences."

In 1907, Spann wrote his "Habilitation in Political Economy" for the [[Hochschule]] in [[Brno|Brünn]]. From 1907 to 1909 he was given the position of ''"[[privatdozent]]"'' which allowed him to teach and collect fees from students. As early as 1908 Spann began working as the full-time imperial-royal vice-secretary of the statistic central commission in Vienna. He was given the position of creating a new census for Austria between 1909 and 1910.

From 1914 to 1918, during the First World War, Spann was a first lieutenant of the reserve. He was hurt during a conflict in [[Lemberg]], Ukraine on 27 August 1914. When he recovered he was first a commander of a company of Russian prisoners and then until later in 1918 he was given a position on the "scientific committee for wartime economy" with the war Ministry in Vienna.

In 1919, Spann was appointed to a position at the University of Vienna, where he taught until 1938.

Spann was popular with students, not only for his lectures which would spill out into the hallways at the University, but also for mid-summer festivals which he would hold in the woods where he would teach that "the ability to intuit essences was nurtured by jumping over the fire..." (Caldwell 2004, 138-9)

== Activism ==

Repeatedly, Spann tried to draw the ruling powers' attention to his authoritarian theory of a [[corporate state]], which he thought be introduced immediately for the benefit of all. In 1928. he joined the [[Militant League for German Culture]]. Around 1930, he also joined the [[Nazi Party]].

== Removal from teaching ==

Although to a large degree in tune with the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', he repeatedly met with disapproval until, in 1938, right after the ''[[Anschluss]]'', he was briefly imprisoned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and eventually barred from his [[professor]]ship at the [[University of Vienna]], which he had held since 1919. Living as a recluse till the end of the war, Spann tried to get his university post back in 1945, aged 67. However, he was not allowed to resume his teaching and died in 1950, disappointed and embittered.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The '''Pashtun Tahafuz Movement''' ({{lang-ps|پښتون ژغورنې غورځنګ}}, {{lang-ur|{{nq|پشتون تحفظ تحریک}}}}; abbreviated '''PTM'''), or the '''Pashtun Protection Movement''', is a [[social movement]] for [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] [[human rights]], based in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]]. It originally started in May 2014 as the '''Mahsud Tahafuz Movement''' as an initiative for removing [[land mine|landmines]] from [[Waziristan]] (especially [[Mahsud]] land) and other parts of the former [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], affected by the [[war in North-West Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bbc.in/2p9q0vg|title=د پښتنو منظور پښتون له کومه راغی؟|date=2018-03-11|work=[[BBC Pashto]]|access-date=2018-03-12|language=ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The movement rose to prominence in January 2018 when it began a justice movement for [[Encounter killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud|Naqeebullah Mehsud]], who was killed [[extrajudicial killing|extrajudicially]] during a police encounter in [[Karachi]] that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/199383/young-pashtuns-shown-mirror-mainstream-pakistan/|title=Young Pashtuns have shown the mirror to ‘mainstream’ Pakistan|date=2018-02-11|work=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining popularity among the Pashtuns in January, its name was changed from the "Mahsud Tahafuz Movement" to the "Pashtun Tahafuz Movement" (Pashtun Protection Movement).

===January - February, 2018===
On January 26, 2018, the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement organized a protest march starting from [[Dera Ismail Khan]], passing through [[Lakki Marwat]], [[Bannu]], [[Domel]], [[Karak, Pakistan|Karak]], [[Kohat]], and [[Darra Adam Khel]], and reaching [[Peshawar]] on January 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/191100/long-march-naqeeb-killing-reaches-peshawar/|title=Long march against Naqeeb killing reaches Peshawar|date=2018-01-29|work=Daily Times|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then after passing through [[Charsadda]], [[Mardan]], [[Swabi]], and [[Tarnol, Islamabad|Tarnol]], the march reached [[Islamabad]], where a [[sit-in]] called "All Pashtun National [[Jirga]]" was organized from February 1. The jirga condemned the murder of the Pashtun shopkeeper [[Encounter killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud|Naqeebullah Mehsud]] who was shot dead by police force in [[Karachi]] during an encounter, and the alleged state oppression against the Pashtuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/pashtun-tribes-stage-unprecedented-protest-in-pakistan/|title=Pashtun Tribes Stage Unprecedented Protest in Pakistan|date=2018-02-08|work=[[The Diplomat]]|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It asked the government to set up a [[judicial inquiry]] for Naqeebullah Mehsud, as well as for all the other Pashtuns murdered [[extrajudicial killing|extrajudicially]] in [[encounter killings by police|police encounters]]. The jirga demanded to stop [[racial profiling]] of the Pashtuns in Pakistan, and to bring the Pashtun [[missing person]]s before the court of law, so that those who are innocent but held could be freed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theweek.in/news/world/why-are-the-pashtun-angry-durand-line-afghanistan-pakistan-anwarrao.html|title=Decades of suffering leave the Pashtun youth angry|date=2018-02-06|work=[[The Week (Indian magazine)|The Week]]|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jirga also demanded [[Pakistan Army]] to guarantee that they will not [[kidnapping|abduct]] or open fire on innocents in the tribal areas, or use violence or [[collective punishment]] against entire villages and tribes, and that they will not impose the frequent [[curfew]]s on the movement of locals even after minor incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/02/03/3rd-day-of-pashtun-sit-in-protesters-refuse-to-budge-till-acceptance-of-demands/|title=3rd day of Pashtun sit-in: Protesters refuse to budge till acceptance of demands|date=2018-02-03|work=[[Pakistan Today]]|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another demand was to remove all [[land mine|landmines]]s planted in the tribal areas, which have resulted in many civilian casualties. The protesters said that since 2009, more than 35 people including children had been killed due to landmines in South Waziristan alone.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/world/asia/pakistan-pashtun-long-march.html|title=In Pakistan, Long-Suffering Pashtuns Find Their Voice|date=2018-02-06|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sit-in in Islamabad ended on February 10,  but the organizers of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement announced that they would reconvene the protest if their demands were not fulfilled by the government.&lt;ref name="voa"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/pashtun-protest-islamabad/4248586.html|title=Pashtuns End Protest in Islamabad, Vow to Reconvene if Demands Not Met|date=2018-02-10|work=[[Voice of America]]|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advisor to Prime Minister on political affairs, Engr.

From March 9 to 11, 2018, PTM organized a protest march from [[Dera Ismail Khan]] to [[Quetta]], passing through [[Drazinda]], [[Zhob]], [[Killa Saifullah]], and [[Khanozai]]. After reaching Quetta, a grand public gathering was organized at [[Sadiq Shaheed Stadium]], Quetta. Representatives of various political parties addressed the gathering.

Pashteen said at the gathering: “We had set one month deadline to certain quarters to apprehend Rao Anwar which expired but no action has been taken by the government.”&lt;ref name="the nation"/&gt;

There was a grand gathering of PTM in [[Swat District]] at [[Kabal Tehsil|Kabal]] ground near [[Mingora]], on 29th April 2018, which was attended by more than 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/234107/jirgas-settle-dispute-among-rivals-not-between-state-and-citizens/|title=‘Jirgas settle dispute among rivals, not between state and citizens’ - Daily Times|date=2018-04-30|work=Daily Times|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attendees were mostly relatives of alleged missing persons in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/apr/29/pashtun-tahaffuz-movement-agitators-gather-in-swat-to-protest-atrocities-in-pakistan-1807986.html|title=Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement agitators gather in Swat to protest atrocities in Pakistan|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking with gathering, Manzoor Pashteen said,&lt;blockquote&gt;“We are demanding our legal rights within the domain of the Constitution but who will seek accountability from those who violated Article 6 of the Constitution of Pakistan.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pashteen criticized [[Pervez Musharraf]] for his alleged terrorism, and demanded for Musharraf and the spokesperson of the [[Taliban]] [[Ehsanullah Ehsan (Taliban spokesman)|Ehsanullah Ehsan]] to be punished.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 13 May gathering in Karachi ===
The [[Karachi]] gathering was held on 13 May 2018 at the ground near Al-Asif Square in [[Sohrab Goth]], Karachi. [[Bagh-e-Jinnah, Karachi|Bagh-e-Jinnah]] was the initially planned venue but the authorities didn't permit it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1407436|title=Manzoor Pashteen reaches Karachi to address thousands of PTM supporters|last=Dawn.com|date=2018-05-13|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the event, three separate criminal cases were registered against PTM at different police stations in Karachi for hate and anti-state speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1708634/1-govt-gives-ptm-greenlight-hold-karachi-jalsa/|title=Govt gives PTM greenlight to hold Karachi jalsa {{!}} The Express Tribune|date=2018-05-12|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; PTM activists accused authorities of sabotaging their event by initiating a wave of mass arrests and detentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/238947/every-single-person-who-facilitated-ptm-in-karachi-was-picked-up/|title=‘Every single person who facilitated PTM in Karachi was picked up’ - Daily Times|date=2018-05-12|work=Daily Times|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day before the event, Manzoor Pashteen was barred from boarding his scheduled flight to Karachi from [[Islamabad International Airport]]. He was told that his ticket had been cancelled and was not allowed to board the plane. He and his friends then drove for five hours to Lahore, and bought another plane ticket to fly from [[Lahore Airport]]. However, their ticket was again cancelled and they were forced to take a road trip to reach Karachi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/pakistan-pashtun-leader-recounts-grueling-detour/29240633.html|title=Pashtun Leader Recounts Grueling Detour|website=gandhara.rferl.org/|language=en|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the road trip, he was stopped and searched 23 times by the authorities,&lt;ref name="prospectmagazine"/&gt; which made his journey over 40 hours.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/05/13/ptm-holds-rally-in-karachi-despite-hurdles/|title=Manzoor Pashteen addresses thousands-strong crowd in Karachi|website=www.pakistantoday.com.pk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the gathering venue in Karachi hours after his scheduled arrival time, and addressed the awaiting crowd. At the gathering, he denounced extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances in Karachi and all across Pakistan, and also reiterated the main demands of PTM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/05/13/ptm-holds-rally-in-karachi-despite-hurdles/|title=Manzoor Pashteen addresses thousands-strong crowd in Karachi|website=www.pakistantoday.com.pk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prospectmagazine"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/other/manzoor-pashteen-pakistan-social-media|title=Meet the 23-year-old activist who could change Pakistan|website=www.prospectmagazine.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===28 October gathering in Bannu===
There was a grand gathering of PTM in [[Bannu]], southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, on 28 October 2018, which was attended by more than 60,000 people.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/urdu/pakistan-46019479/|title=بنوں: پشتون تحفظ موومنٹ کا کیا اب تک کا سب سے بڑا جلسہ تھا؟|date=2018-10-29|work=BBC Urdu|access-date=2018-10-31|language=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the largest public gatherings in the history of Bannu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/317607/ptms-roars-continue/|title=PTM’s roars continue|date=2018-11-02|work=Daily Times|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attendees included relatives of alleged missing persons in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/pashto/pakhtunkhwa-46017219|title=بنو کې د پښتون ژغورنې غورځنګ غونډې ته غبرګونونه|date=2018-10-29|work=BBC Pashto|access-date=2018-10-31|language=ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking with the gathering, Manzoor Pashteen said:&lt;blockquote&gt;“We are demanding our legal rights within the domain of the Constitution but who will seek accountability from those who violated Article 6 of the Constitution of Pakistan.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Media blackout in Pakistan==
Pakistan's mainstream television channels and media outlets are not reporting and covering the activities of the PTM. Their only medium to interact with the rest of [[Pakistan]] and to keep them updated is through [[social media]]. This further strengthens their narrative of being sidelined and ignored by the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nation.com.pk/28-Mar-2018/pashtun-tahaffuz-movement.html|title=Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement|date=2018-04-09|work=[[The Nation (Pakistan)|The Nation]]|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, the PTM meeting was scheduled to be held in [[Peshawar University]], but Deputy Commissioner Peshawar Islam Zeb, issued an order under section 144 CrPC, imposing ban on political meetings in University and satted any violation against the order shall be preceded against u/s 188 PPC and order will be exercised "for 30 days unless modified or withdrawn."&lt;ref name="Ban1"/&gt; Later the meeting was held in Baghi-e-Naran, [[Hayatabad]] with 200 person attending the gathering.&lt;ref name="Ban1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1671763/1-section-144-pashtun-tahafuz-movement-barred-campuses/|title=Section 144: Pashtun Tahafuz Movement barred from campuses - The Express Tribune|date=2018-03-29|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement's anthem is “Da Sanga Azadi Da?”, which means “What kind of freedom is this?”. Many Pashtun's have discovered their voice with this anthem and it encloses the various grievances they have from being caught between the militants and the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1399271|title=Pakhtun renaissance|last=Khan|first=Ghulam Qadir|date=2018-04-03|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43827660|title=The young tribesman rattling Pakistan's army|last=Khan|first=M.

==Incident at Karnal Sher Khan's mausoleum ==

During the campaign to inform people about the 12 August 2018 gathering in [[Swabi]], one day before the event, Manzoor Pashteen was denied entry into the mausoleum of [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] [[Karnal Sher Khan]] by Karnal Sher Khan's brother Anwar Sher Khan. Anwar said he denied Pashteen entry into the mausoleum out of respect for the Pakistan Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arynews.tv/en/karnal-sher-khan-brother-manzoor-pashteen/ |website=ARYNEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1778625/1-watch-manzoor-pashteen-heckled-capt-karnal-shers-mausoleum/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pashteen hat==
{{Main|Pashteen hat}}
The [[Pashteen hat]] (also known as the Mazari hat) has become the most iconic symbol of the PTM, as Manzoor Pashteen regularly wears it at public rallies and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alikozai|first1=Hasib Danish|title=Hats Proliferate as Symbol of Pashtun Protest Movement|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/hats-symbol-pashtun-protest-movement/4335923.html|accessdate=16 May 2018|work=[[Voice of America]]|date=6 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Due to PTM's outspoken criticism of [[Pakistan Army]], the Pakistan Army has claimed that PTM is backed by foreign powers and that their gatherings are engineered.&lt;ref name="apnews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pashtun rights group accuses Pakistan army of abuses|url=https://apnews.com/9e469749b9e94086af1b2cf07103acff|author=[[Kathy Gannon]]|website=[[Associated Press]] News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Engineered protests’ won’t be allowed, says army chief|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1401345|website=Dawn|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, news organizations in Pakistan have been pressured to ignore PTM, and university professors have been forced to identify the students attending PTM's protest gatherings.&lt;ref name="apnews"/&gt; Some Pakistani politicians also view PTM as working on a foreign agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manzoor Pashteen’s PTM: A ‘Rights Movement’ or a new ‘Regional Agenda’?|url=https://www.globalvillagespace.com/manzoor-pashteens-ptm-a-rights-movement-or-a-new-regional-agenda/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, PTM's leadership has openly declared that they are loyal to Pakistan and want their demands to be resolved within the [[Constitution of Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan’s Counterproductive Dismissal of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement|url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/05/pakistans-counterproductive-dismissal-of-the-pashtun-tahafuz-movement/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fabbri - Disputationes theologicae de restitutione et extrema unctione, 1624 - 4378759.tif|thumb|''Disputationes theologicae de restitutione et extrema unctione'', 1624]]
'''Philip Faber''' (Fabri) (1564, Spinata di [[Brisighella]] &amp;ndash; [[Padua]], 28 August 1630) was an Italian [[Franciscan]] theologian, philosopher and noted commentator on [[Duns Scotus]].

==Life==

In 1582 he entered the Order of St. Francis ([[Conventuals]]), at [[Cremona]]. After completing his studies, he taught in various monastic schools till he was appointed professor of philosophy in 1603, and in 1606 professor of theology, at the [[University of Padua]], where he was highly successful as a lecturer.

In 1625 he was elected provincial of the order, and he again took up his work as professor, expounding the teachings of Duns Scotus, abandoning the superlative style of other commentators.

==Works==

His most important works are:

*"Philosophia naturalis Scoti in theoremata distributa" (Parma, 1601, revised at Venice, 1606, 1616, 1622, and at Paris, 1622). 
*"Commentaria in quatuor libros sententiarum Duns Scoti" (Venice, 1613; 3rd ed. Paris, 1622); 
*"De Praedestinatione" (Venice, 1623), a complement to the first book of the ''[[Sentences]]''; 
*"De restitutione, et extremâ unctione" (Venice, 1624), an addition to the fourth book of the ''Sentences''; 
*"A treatise 'de Sacramento Ordinis, poenis et censuris ecclesiasticis'" (Venice, 1628).

His work, "De Primatu Petri et Romani Pontificis" and his "Commentaries on the Metaphysics of Aristotle" were published, after Faber's death, by his friend [[Matthew Ferchius]], who prefaced the "Commentaries", with a biography of the author.

'''''Primate Conservation''''' is a journal published by the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission|IUCN Species Survival Commission's]] [[IUCN Species Survival Commission#Primate Specialist Group|Primate Specialist Group]] about the world's primates. First published as a mimeographed newsletter in 1981, the journal today publishes [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] research and papers on primate species, particularly status surveys and studies on distribution and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.primate-sg.org/primate_conservation/|title=Primates-SG - Primate Conservation|website=www.primate-sg.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these regular papers, the journal has also been a significant place for [[Primatology|primatologists]] to publish descriptions of new primate species in ''Primate Conservation''.

'''Retributive justice''' is a theory of [[justice]] that holds that the best response to a crime is a [[punishment]] proportional to the offense, inflicted because the offender deserves the punishment. Prevention of future crimes ([[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]]) or [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] of the offender are not considered in determining such punishments. The theory holds that when an offender breaks the law, justice requires that he or she suffer in return. Retribution is different from [[revenge]] because retributive justice is only directed at wrongs, has inherent limits, is not personal, involves no pleasure at the suffering of others&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[Schadenfreude]]'', [[sadistic personality disorder|sadism]]&lt;/ref&gt; and employs procedural standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nozick |first=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC&amp;q=retributive+justice#v=snippet&amp;q=retributive%20justice%20revenge&amp;f=false |title=Philosophical Explanations |year=1981 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |pages=366–368|isbn=9780674664791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=‘Positive’ Retributivism and the Meaning of Desert |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-punishment/#PosRetMeaDes |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical texts advocating the retributive view include ''[[De Legibus]]'' (1st century BC), [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] ''Science of Right''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KANSOR|title=Science of Right|last=Kant|first=Immanuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1790), and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|''Philosophy'' ''of Right'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prconten.htm|title=Contents of Hegel's Philosophy of Right|last=Hegel|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1821).

The concept is found in most world cultures and in many ancient texts. The presence of retributive justice in [[ancient Jewish]] culture is shown by its inclusion in the [[Torah|law of Moses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Deuteronomy|19:17-21}}19:17-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Exodus|21:23-21:27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the punishments of "life for life, [[Eye for an eye|eye for eye]], tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot". Very similar phrasing is found in the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. Documents assert similar values in other cultures. However, the judgment of whether a punishment is appropriately severe can vary greatly across cultures and individuals.

==Purposes==
One purpose of official retribution is to channel the retributive sentiments of the public into the political and legal systems, so that people do not resort to [[lynching]]s, [[blood feud]]s, and other ugly forms of [[vigilante]] self-help. Another purpose is to promote societal solidarity through participation in the act of punishing, under the theory that "the society that slays together stays together." Another purpose is to prevent a situation in which a citizen who would have preferred to obey the law as part of his civic responsibility decides that he would be a fool to not violate it, when so many others are getting away with lawlessness that the point of his obedience is mostly defeated.&lt;ref name=retrospective/&gt;

==History==

In the early period of all systems of code, retribution for wrongs took precedence over the enforcement of rights. A rough sense of justice demanded that a criminal should be punished with the infliction of proportionate loss and pain as he inflicted on his victim. Therefore, "''[[an eye for an eye|lex talionis]]''" (an eye for an eye) was very prominent in ancient law. The Bible is no exception: in its oldest form it too included the "''lex talionis''", the law of "[[an eye for an eye|measure for measure]]" (this is only the literal translation of ''middah ke-neged middah'').

In the 19th century, [[philosopher]] [[Immanuel Kant]] argued in ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'', §49 E., that retribution is the only legitimate form of punishment the court can prescribe. He said that, "Judicial punishment can never be used merely as a means to promote some other good for the criminal himself or for civil society, but instead it must in all cases be imposed on him only on the ground that he has committed a crime."&lt;ref name="martin 174"&gt;Martin, Jacqueline (2005). ''The English Legal System'' (4th ed.), p. 174. London: Hodder Arnold. {{ISBN|0-340-89991-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant regarded punishment as a matter of justice, which must be carried out by the state for the sake of the law, not for the sake of the criminal or the victim. He argues that if the guilty are not punished, justice is not done&lt;ref name="james 2k7"&gt;Rachels, James (2007). ''The Elements of Moral Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; and if justice is not done, then the idea of law itself is undermined.

One of the reasons for the abandonment of retribution by 20th century reformers was that they gave up on the idea of personal autonomy, since they believed science had discredited it.&lt;ref name=retrospective/&gt;

== Principles ==
According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', retributive justice is committed to three principles:
* "Those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts, paradigmatically serious crimes, morally deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/justice-retributive/|title=Retributive Justice|last=Walen|first=Alec|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is "intrinsically morally good—good without reference to any other goods that might arise—if some legitimate punisher gives [those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts] the punishment they deserve."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "It is morally impermissible intentionally to punish the innocent or to inflict disproportionately large punishments on wrongdoers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Proportionality ===
[[Proportionality (law)|Proportionality]] requires that the level of punishment be related to the severity of the offending behaviour. An accurate reading of the biblical phrase "an eye for an eye" in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] is said to be: '''only'' one eye for one eye',{{Sfn | Plaut | 1981 | pp = 571ff}} or "an eye in place of an eye". However, this does not mean that the punishment has to be ''equivalent'' to the crime. A retributive system must punish severe crimes more harshly than minor crimes, but retributivists differ about how harsh or soft the system should be overall. The crime's level of severity can be determined in multiple ways. Severity can be determined by the amount of harm, unfair advantage or the moral imbalance that the crime caused.

Traditionally, philosophers of punishment have contrasted retributivism with [[utilitarianism]]. For utilitarians, punishment is forward-looking, justified by a purported ability to achieve future social benefits, such as crime reduction. For retributionists, punishment is backward-looking, justified by the crime that has already been committed. Therefore, punishment is carried out to atone for the damage already done.&lt;ref name="Cavadinodignan"&gt;Cavadino, M &amp; Dignan, J. (1997). ''The Penal System: An Introduction'' (2nd ed.), p. 39. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subtypes==
Retributive justice is of two distinct types. The classical definition embraces the idea that the amount of punishment must be proportionate to the amount of harm caused by the offence. A more recent version advocated by [[philosopher]] [[Michael Davis (philosopher)|Michael Davis]] asserts that the amount of punishment must be proportionate to the amount of unfair advantage gained by the wrongdoer. Davis introduced this version of retributive justice in the early 1980s, at a time when retributive justice was resurging within the [[philosophy of law]] community, perhaps due to the failings{{original research inline|date=July 2014}} of reform theory in prior decades.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph.}}

A retributive justice system's assessment of blameworthiness (or lack thereof) can either justify punishment or serve merely to limit the punishments society imposes for other reasons.&lt;ref name=retrospective&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1893&amp;context=journal_articles|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Many jurisdictions that adopt retributive justice, [[Incarceration in the United States|especially in the United States]], use [[mandatory sentencing]], where judges impose a penalty for a crime within the range set by the law. However, judges have limited discretion to consider [[mitigating factor]]s, leading to greater penalties under certain circumstances. 

When the punishment involves a fine, the theory does not allow the financial position of an offender to be considered, leading to situations in which a poor individual and a millionaire could be forced to pay the same amount. Such a fine would be punitive for the poor offender while insignificant for the millionaire.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp. 174&amp;ndash;175.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of pure retribution, many jurisdictions use variants such as the [[European Union]]'s emphasis on punitive equality, which base the amount of a fine not just on the offense but also on the offender's income, salary, and ability to pay. Consequently in 2002 a senior Finnish executive at [[Nokia]] was given a fine of €116,000 (US $103,000) on a traffic ticket issued for driving {{convert|75|km/h}} in a {{convert|50|km/h}} zone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1759791.stm|title=Nokia boss gets record speeding fine|last=|first=|date=14 January 2002|work=BBC News|access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, based on his income of €14 million (US $12.5 million) per year. Similarly, a Finnish businessman was required to pay €54,000 based on his yearly income of €6.5 million, making the fine equally punitive as a typical €200 (US $246) fine for the same offense would have been had it been issued to a Finn earning an average salary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/finland-home-of-the-103000-speeding-ticket/387484/|title=Finland, Home of the $103,000 Speeding Ticket|last=Pinsker|first=Joe|date=March 12, 2015|website=The Atlantic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The retributive theory's lack of consideration of the perpetrator's and victim's status has led many jurisdictions to move away from it in various ways, including punitive equality and taking into consideration the status and wealth, or lack of status and wealth, of an offender and their consequent ability to both pay fines and defend themselves effectively in court.

One critique of some concepts of just deserts are that they are primitive, emphasizing social harm rather than the character and culpability of offenders, an example being California's 1976 statute calling for "terms proportionate to the seriousness of the offense with provision for uniformity in the sentences of offenders committing the same offense under similar circumstances." More generally, prioritizing justice for the public over crime control goals has come under criticism as attributable more to the relative ease of writing sentencing guidelines as crime tariffs (as opposed to describing the appropriate influence of situational and personal characteristics on punishment) than to any sound arguments about penological theory.&lt;ref name=retrospective/&gt;

==Alternatives==
Traditional alternatives to retributive justice have been [[exile]] and [[shunning]]. In pre-modern societies such sentences were often the equivalent of the death penalty as individuals would find it impossible to survive without the support and protection of the society that they had wronged{{Citation needed|date=July 2017|reason=}}.

Modern alternatives to retributive measures include [[involuntary commitment|psychiatric imprisonment]], [[restorative justice]] and [[transformative justice]]. A general overview of [[criminal justice]] puts each of these ideals in context.

One [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] approach to this issue argues that full restitution (in the broad, rather than technical legal, sense) is compatible with both retributivism and a utilitarian degree of [[deterrence (psychology)|deterrence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la-articles.org.uk/libertarian_restitution.htm |title=Why Libertarian Restitution Beats State-Retribution and State-Leniency| author=J.

'''Revolutionary Action Movement''' (RAM) was a U.S.-based revolutionary black nationalist group in operation from 1962 to 1969.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They were the first group to apply the philosophy of [[Maoism]] to conditions of black people in the United States and informed the revolutionary politics of the [[Black Power movement]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Is It Nation Time?|last=Kelley|first=Robin|work=Stormy Weather: Reconstructing Black (Inter)Nationalism in the Cold War Era|publisher=U of Chicago Press|others=|year=2002|isbn=|editor-last=Glaude|editor-first=Eddie|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Is It Nation Time?: Contemporary Essays on Black Power and Black Nationalism|last=Glaude|first=Eddie|publisher=U of Chicago|year=2002|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=72–87|chapter=Stormy Weather|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAM was the only secular political organization which [[Malcolm X]] joined prior to 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/mxp/stanford.html|title=The Malcolm X Project at Columbia University|website=www.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;The group's political formation deeply influenced the politics of [[Huey P. Newton|Huey Newton]], [[Bobby Seale]], and many other future influential [[Black Panther Party]] founders and members.

==Group formation==
In 1961, students at Central State University, a historically black university in Ohio came together to form "Challenge," a small conglomerate group of [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS), [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), and [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). Largely made up of formerly expelled students and veteran activists, Challenge was created to further political awareness, particularly in relation to the black community.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ahmad |first1=Akbar Muhammed |chapter=RAM: The Revolutionary Action Movement |title=Black Power: In the Belly of the Beast |editor-first=Judson L. |editor-last=Jeffries |place=Urbana |publisher=U of Illinois P |year=2006 |pp=252–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of Donald Freeman, who was enrolled at Case Western Reserve University at the time, Challenge read [[Harold Cruse]]'s essay "Revolutionary Nationalism and the Afro-American" and thereafter shifted its focus from educating their participants to creating a mass black working-class nationalist movement in the North.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; After this drastic change of agenda, Challenge soon evolved into the Reform Action Movement, as they believed use of the word ''revolutionary'' would stir fear in the university administration.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Kelley, Robin D.

=== Leadership ===

==== Max Stanford ====
Max stanford (now Ahmad Muhammad) was one of the founding members of RAM, and served as both its national chairman and Philadelphia head for much of the group's existence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afro Asia: Revolutionary Political and Cultural Connections between African Americans and Asian Americans|last=Kelley|first=Robin|last2=Esch|first2=Betsy|publisher=Duke, UP|year=2008|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Philadelphia native, and one of [[James Boggs (activist)|James]] and [[Grace Lee Boggs]]' "adopted" kids, youth who spent a lot of time at the Boggs household and connected with their circle of activists. Prior to joining them, Stanford had been involved with militant civil rights activism since his teenage years. Through the lively discussions of revolutionary politics that thrived in the Boggs household, he developed a sharp critical consciousness and an impressive grasp of theory by adulthood.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Waiting 'Till The Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America|last=Joseph|first=Peniel|publisher=Henry Holt|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1963, Stanford also became a protege of Malcolm X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/mxp/stanford.html|title=The Malcolm X Project at Columbia University|website=www.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Donald Freeman ====
Don Freeman was black student at Case Western who originally organized Challenge at Central State and then went on to be one of the leaders of the Cleveland branch of RAM. He questioned, however, during RAM's early years, the validity of RAM as a Marxist organization since traditional Marxist theory focused on class, while ignoring racism. So although Freeman believed in collectively owned black enterprises, he also argued that white "socialists and Marxists do not possess the solutions to the ills of black America."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Structure ==
Though it initially started as a small student group at Central State College and Case Western Reserve University in Ohio,  RAM at its peak had chapters all over the nation. The full spread of RAM remains hard to discern because RAM was semi-clandestine in nature. Chapters in New York, Oakland, Cleveland, and Detroit went by pseudonyms so as to decrease public scrutiny, while the Philadelphia chapter continued to operate under RAM's name.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peniel, Joseph E. ''The Black Power Movement: Rethinking the Civil Rights-Black Power Era.'' Routledge, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to go underground was made by leadership after they judged that the ultra-right was preparing to crush the movement and that they could no longer be public without endangering noninvolved people and exposing them to violence.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=We Will Return in the Whirlwind|last=Ahmad|first=Muhammad|publisher=Charles H. Kerr Pub.|year=2007|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAM implemented a "system of rotating chairmen" to foster veteran leadership that would help educate the younger, less experienced members.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There were three levels of membership in RAM. The first consisted of members who were "professional, full-time field organizers." The second level was made up of members who paid their dues to the organization and "met the standards for the main criteria for cadre." The third group included undisclosed members who only donated money to RAM.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The overall structure of RAM was organized into three types of cells or units: area units, work units, and political units. Area units were designed to gain community influence by organizing around local issues. Work units were set up in factories or other industrial type settings, and the League of Black Workers, the predecessor to the [[League of Revolutionary Black Workers]], was eventually created through these units.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-last1=Bracey |editor-first1=John H., Jr. |editor-first2=Sharon |editor-last2=Harley |title=Part 4: The League of Revolutionary Black Workers, 1965-1976 |work=The Black Power Movement |publisher=Black Studies Research Sources |year=2004 |url= http://www.lexisnexis.com/documents/academic/upa_cis/100390_BlackPowerPt4LRBW.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political units were used to gain access into the Civil Rights Movement and transform it into a movement for black liberation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Ideology ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Afroamerican revolutionary, being inside the citadel of world imperialism and being the Vanguard against the most highly developed capitalist complex has problems no other revolutionary has had. His position is so strategic that victory means the downfall of the arch enemy of the oppressed (U.S. imperialism) and the beginning of the birth of a new world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; --"The African American War of National-Liberation," RAM's Black America&lt;/blockquote&gt;RAM was the first group in the United States to synthesize the thought of [[Marxism|Marx]], [[Leninism|Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], and [[Malcolm X]] into a comprehensive theory of revolutionary black nationalism. They combined socialism, [[black nationalism]], and [[Third-Worldism|Third World internationalism]] into a coherent and applicable theory that called for revolution "inside the citadel of world imperialism," meaning the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heartbeat of Struggle: The Revolutionary Life of Yuri Kochiyama|last=Fujino|first=Diane|publisher=U of Minnesota|year=2005|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolutionary nationalists of RAM believed that colonized peoples around the world must rise up and destroy the "universal slavemaster." They also believed that all people have a right to self-determination, including the "internal black colony" of the United States.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Black Nationalism: From Marcus Garvey to Louis Farrakhan|last=Van Deburg|first=William|publisher=New York U|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7QUCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In their opinion, African Americans had to gain control of land and political power through national liberation and establish revolutionary socialism in sovereign, liberated lands. They emphasized creating a black nation on land in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Texas, Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina that, in their eyes, rightfully belonged to black people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Nationalism in American Politics and Thought|last=Robinson|first=Dean|publisher=Cambridge UP|year=2001|isbn=|location=Cambridge, U.K.|pages=60–61|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This push for a sovereign black nation was in some ways a reiteration of an old black leftist line from the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In fact, many RAM activists derived their ideology from an older generation of revolutionary black leftists: [[Harry Haywood]], [[Queen Mother Moore|Queen Mother Audley Moore]], [[Harold Cruse]], and Abner Berry as well as James and Grace Lee Boggs. Many of these older revolutionaries played a role of ideological and political mentorship to RAM activists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Black internationalism ===
The revolutionary spirit of black Americans in the 1960s was by no means the sole example of rebellion in the world at that time. The decade brought forth revolutions and mass uprisings in countries all over the world, and though the people were protesting in different regions, most of these movements sought to achieve a similar goal: the universal elimination of racism and capitalism.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Lazerow, Jama, and Yohuru Williams. ''In Search of the Black Panther Party: New Perspectives on a Revolutionary Movement.'' Durham: Duke University Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of RAM understood that black nationalism, the formation of an independent nation of blacks in the U.S., was a concept inseparable from black internationalism, which had the goal of ending white supremacy through a conjoined effort of all oppressed groups to overthrow pan-European racism and the exploitative global capitalist system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Bush, Roderick D. ''The End of White World Supremacy: Black Internationalism and the Problem of the Color Line.'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the movement had a global vision, bigger than just the race relations of the United States. They saw the main battle as being between Western imperialism and the oppressed Third World within U.S. borders and around the world.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Against Empire: The History and Politics of the Black Panther Party|last=Bloom|first=Joshua|publisher=U of California|year=2013|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The context of black liberation was the entire world revolution, rather than cultural nationalism, which RAM considered reactionary and bourgeois. RAM members saw themselves as colonial subjects fighting a "colonial war at home."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The theory of black internationalism was first publicized in W.E.B. DuBois' ''Dark Princess'', where he argues that the black nation in America is just one faction of what he refers to as the "Land of the Blacks," a conglomeration of all racially subjugated groups around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alys Eve |last=Weinbaum |title=Reproducing Racial Globality: W.E.B Du Bois and the Sexual Politics of Black Internationalism |journal=Social Text 67 |date=Summer 2001 |pp=15–41 |format=pdf |url=https://english.washington.edu/research/publications/reproducing-racial-globality-web-du-bois-and-sexual-politics-black}}
&lt;/ref&gt; RAM spokesman Malcolm X later described the black revolution in the United States as part of a "worldwide struggle of the oppressed against the oppressor."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Several other political figures openly supported black internationalism, calling for people to join the revolution and be fully in conjunction "with the people in the great struggle for Africa and of suffering humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |last=Touré |first=Sekou |title=The Political Leader Considered as the Representative of a Culture |date=2 October 1959 |location=Conakry, Guinea |url=http://www.blackpast.org/1959-sekou-toure-political-leader-considered-representative-culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mao Zedong in Red.svg|thumb|RAM subscribed to Maoist ideology]]

=== Influence of Maoism and Maoist ethics ===
Some RAM activists saw themselves as an all-black cadre of [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army|Mao's Red Army]], and related their black freedom struggle to Mao's strategy of encircling capitalist countries to challenge imperialism. In solidarity and fighting alongside anti-colonial struggles in [[Chinese Civil War|China]], [[Zanzibar Revolution|Zanzibar]], [[Cuban Revolution|Cuba]], [[Indochina Wars|Vietnam]], [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|Indonesia]], and [[Algerian War|Algeria]], RAM activists saw themselves as playing a global role.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Among what some saw as the hedonism of the 1960s, Mao's revolutionary code of ethics, alongside the religious self-restraint preached by the [[Nation of Islam]], was a powerful force. Some RAM materials about their revolutionary code of ethics take quotations nearly verbatim from [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|The Little Red Book]]. When Robert F. Williams, chairman of RAM, came back from his exile in China, he also emphasized that all young black revolutionaries must "undergo personal and moral transformation. There is a need for a stringent revolutionary code of moral ethics. Revolutionaries are instruments of righteousness."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

RAM called for a "cultural revolution" of sorts: one that would purge the slave mentality from black people in the United States. They were for the creation of a new, revolutionary culture through the reclamation of African aesthetics, creation of art only in the service of the revolution, and active attempt to root out habits, traditions, customs, and philosophies taught to black people by white oppressors.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Political activities ==
There were three main branches of RAM: the founding branch in Cleveland, Ohio; the headquarters branch in Philadelphia, PA; and a west coast branch in Oakland, CA. Though the branches all had different local goals and accomplished different things, RAM engaged in several unifying national political activities.

For instance, all branches helped distribute Robert Williams' magazine, ''The Crusader'', after it had been banned within the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They also took a two-pronged approach to advocating their policies among other civil rights groups:  disparaging those that did not advocate for armed self-defense and, simultaneously, infiltrating them to try and spread their revolutionary ideology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Due to the fact that RAM was made up of mostly college-educated intellectuals (though many dropped out to organize full-time), they thought a lot about who they were trying to mobilize, eventually settling upon the black petit bourgeoisie youth and black working-class youth. RAM thought that the black petit bourgeoisie particularly embodied the contradictions of racial capitalism, and if properly brought into the movement, this group could form a "revolutionary intelligentsia capable of leading black America to true liberation."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They also used public street meetings to try and attract as many black working-class youth as possible to their organization, particularly gang members. RAM thought gang members had the most revolutionary potential of the population, because they could be trained to fight not against each other but against white power structures. They believed they could create a fighting force of former gang members on the model of the Congolese Youth guerrilla army and the Mau Mau guerrillas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In mid-1965,  before opposition to the Vietnam War gained momentum, RAM blazed the ideological trail, expressing solidarity with the Vietnamese National Liberation Front in their fight against imperialism. At the same time RAM was explicitly anti-draft, arguing and organizing around the hypocrisy of drafting black Americans to fight in a war against, in their eyes, other people victimized by U.S. imperialism.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The Black Guard was a national armed youth self-defense group run by RAM that argued for protecting the interests of Black America by fighting directly against its enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pure Fire: Self-Defense as Activism in the Civil Rights Era|last=Strain|first=Christopher|publisher=U of Georgia|year=2005|isbn=|location=Athens|pages=184–186|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Guard, in Max Stanford's words, "[was] to stop our youth from fighting amongst themselves, teach them a knowledge of [black] history...and prepare them...to protect our community from racist attacks."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Up South: Civil Rights and Black Power in Philadelphia|last=Countryman|first=Matthew|publisher=U of Pennsylvania|year=2006|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everywhere except for Philadelphia, RAM operated as a semi-clandestine group, existing behind front organizations, and under multiple names and branches. Due to this underground status, RAM focused more on producing [[Agitprop]] and less on actual community organizing. As a result, RAM has received less attention from historians than the Black Panther Party, even though they blazed the 1960s revolutionary black nationalist ideological trail and heavily influenced the Panthers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Malcolm X became a RAM officer in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/mxp/stanford.html|title=The Malcolm X Project at Columbia University|website=www.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Stanford has claimed that Malcolm X's [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]] (OAAU) was intended to be the popular front organization to RAM's underground black liberation army.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
[[File:Muhammad Ahamd.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ahmad (formerly Maxwell Stanford), the leader of the Philadelphia branch of RAM, discussing the Black Power movement]]

=== Philadelphia ===
Despite numerous chapters all over the country, by 1964, RAM's home base in Philadelphia was the main branch available to the public eye.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Philadelphia chapter was responsible for the publication of RAM's bimonthly newspaper, ''Black America,'' and the single paged newsletter ''RAM Speaks''.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; During their time in the city, RAM actively supported Leon Sullivan's 1962 selective patronage campaign. This was the beginning of the "don't buy where you can't work" method of direct boycott action that serves as an example of the effectiveness of the black masses to black liberation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Throughout its existence, RAM supported mass action all over Philadelphia, canvassed to try to listen to community needs, and provided public services that they thought were lacking. These actions ranged from responding to local residents' medical emergencies to providing weekly black history classes. By making their presence known throughout the streets and establishing a consistent presence throughout black neighborhoods in the city, RAM was able to effectively mobilize people for anti-union discrimination protests in 1963.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

RAM also advocated for the black students in Philadelphia's Bok High School in 1968 by providing protection and political education to students while they protested unequal conditions and a lack of community control in their educational environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Cleveland ===
In Cleveland, RAM was governed by a secret committee named the "Soul Circle,"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; which was essentially a small selection of black men involved in the local community, as well as civil rights, and student groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In 1962, a policy-oriented think tank named the Afro-American Institute was founded in Cleveland, Ohio. Through this organization, RAM members held free public lectures and worked with other activists to improve the black community in Cleveland.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The following year, Max Stanford and other RAM members traveled to Cleveland and joined CORE to assist in demanding better healthcare for black hospital patients and more inclusion of Black history in the Cleveland public school curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Afro-American Institute organized lectures by revolutionary black artists and intellectuals, and distributed leaflets to inform and inculcate the public in their revolutionary opinions. The subjects of the leaflets were wide-ranging, from elections to the arms race to the black struggle, and eventually the leaflets became the newsletter ''Afropinion''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In Cleveland, RAM's most notable accomplishment was their open protestation against Mae Mallory's incarceration. Mallory was a Black woman arrested for her relationship with Robert F. Williams, the future international chairman of RAM who, at the time, had fled to Cuba after being exiled from the United States.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Working with the institute and its allies, RAM petitioned the governor of Ohio to revoke the extradition warrant against Mallory and held a large demonstration in front of the county jail, insisting on Mallory's immediate release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Huey P. Newton.jpg|thumb|Huey P. Newton was in the Soul Students' Advisory Council in the mid 1960s]] --&gt;

=== Northern California ===
RAM's Northern California branch operated under the name the "Soul Students' Advisory Council" and started after then-member of the Afro-American Association and future-Black Panther Ernie Allen went on a trip to Cuba in 1964. There Allen traveled alongside the future organizers of [[Uhuru Movement|Uhuru]], [[Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement]], and the [[League of Revolutionary Black Workers]]. He also coincidentally met and talked to Max Stanford, who was in Cuba visiting Robert Williams at the same time. This confluence of events resulted in Allen establishing a branch of RAM in Oakland at Merritt College through the Soul Students' Advisory Council.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The Soul Students' Advisory Council published a widely distributed prose and poetry journal called ''Soulbook: The Revolutionary Journal of the Black World.'' It was a radical black culture magazine edited by future black power activists Bobby Seale, Huey Newton, and Ernie Allen, among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The Soul Students' Advisory Council, in its interaction with RAM, exposed Seale and Newton to anti-imperialism, socialism, and revolutionary nationalism for the first time, which was critical in their political development.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Political repression ==

=== FBI and COINTELPRO ===

{{Quote|text=The purpose of this new counterintelligence endeavor is to expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist, hate-type organizations and groupings, their leadership, spokesmen, membership, and supporters, and to counter their propensity for violence and civil disorder...Intensified action under this program should be afforded to the activities of...Revolutionary Action Movement...Particular emphasis should be given to extremists such as [[Stokely Carmichael]], [[H. Rap Brown|H. 'Rap' Brown]], [[Elijah Muhammad]], and [[Maxwell Stanford]].|author=[[J. Edgar Hoover]], 25 August 1967}}
[[File:J Edgar Hoover.jpg|thumb|[[J. Edgar Hoover]] was instrumental in implementing COINTELPRO and dismantling Black Power groups]]
As exemplified by police repression of RAM in Philadelphia in the summer 1967, the FBI and their [[COINTELPRO]] program targeted RAM for political destruction. However, RAM was just one of many civil rights or black nationalist groups targeted because of their politics. Tactics used to suppress RAM were also used to suppress and target [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), the Black Panther Party, the Nation of Islam, the [[National Welfare Rights Organization]], Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM), [[Republic of New Afrika]] (RNA), [[Congress of Afrikan People]], black student unions at universities all over the country, and black churches and community organizations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War at Home: Covert Action against U.S. Activists and What We Can Do about It|last=Glick|first=Bryan|publisher=South End Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Boston, MA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, following an exposé on RAM in Life magazine, Max Stanford and 16 other RAM members were arrested on conspiracy charges and for allegedly plotting to assassinate the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]'s [[Roy Wilkins]] and the [[National Urban League|Urban League]]'s [[Whitney Young]]. Stanford went underground to avoid arrest and indictment, but the rest of the Queens 17, as they were called, went to trial and had to pay a $200,000 bail bond.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Dissolution of RAM ===
In this context of government repression, RAM transformed itself into the [[Black Liberation Party]], and by 1969 had practically dissolved. Many of its members went back to their communities or joined other civil rights groups to continue pushing their ideology of black internationalism and armed self-defense.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Criticisms of RAM ==
On multiple occasions, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover condemned RAM, describing the organization as a "militant black nationalist hate group." During its existence, RAM was the target of denigration from a wide range of critics, including Dr. Martin Luther King.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Revisionism ===
Though RAM claimed it was a Maoist organization, some scholars, like Robin Kelley, have critiqued it for not sticking to Mao's philosophies. He writes: "Mao's insistence on the protracted nature of revolution was not taken to heart; at one point they suggested that the war for liberation would probably take ninety days. And because RAM's leaders focused their work on confronting the state head on and attacking black leaders whom they deemed reformists, they failed to build a strong base in black urban communities. Furthermore, despite their staunch internationalism, they did not reach out to other oppressed 'nationalities' in the United States."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Amidst the sectarianism of the New Left, other activists and black liberation organizations also criticized RAM. In particular, the Black Panther Party said that although RAM led the development of black nationalist thought in the U.S., examples of their application of revolutionary ideas was few and far between, and mostly limited to students, rather than the black underclass "lumpenproletariat" they claimed to represent. RAM oftentimes struggled to meld theory and practice.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

{{Chinese name|Rong}}
'''Róng Qǐqī''' ({{zh|s=荣启期|t=榮啟期|p=Róng Qǐqī}}) is a mythological&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Six Dynasties Civilization|author=Dien, A.E.|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300074048|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0zp6iMZoqt0C&amp;pg=PA341|page=341|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] [[folk hero]]. He is depicted as a [[recluse]], who shuns material possessions in favour of an ascetic life. Rong was known in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]] for a fable involving an alleged encounter with the philosopher [[Confucius]]. Although largely forgotten in the following centuries, in his time, the story of his encounter with Confucius was a source of artistic and poetic inspiration. The story is retold in the famous text ''[[Liezi]]'', written by [[Lie Yukou]], a circa 5th-century BCE [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] philosopher.&lt;ref name="Bokenkamp, Stephen.2009, p. 27"&gt;Bokenkamp, Stephen.(2009), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars conclude that Rong Qiqi, while a notable figure in early [[Chinese literature]], is likely fictional or legendary and not historical.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, Audrey.(1990), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Like many folk heroes, it is uncertain if Rong Qiqi is a fictional character, or if his story has some basis in truth.

According to the fable involving Rong, he lived to the age of 95.&lt;ref name="Dominik Declercq 1998 p. 383"&gt;Dominik Declercq (1998) p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; The text does not indicate the cause of Rong's predicament, whether it arose out of choice or from misfortune, but popular interpretations of the text have assumed it is the former.

==Encounter with Confucius==
[[File:Confucius Tang Dynasty.jpg|100px|thumb|right|A [[portrait painting|portrait]] of Confucius, by [[Tang Dynasty]] artist [[Wu Daozi]] (680–740).]]
In the story, Confucius encounters Rong Qiqi, an elderly recluse who has chosen a life of [[ascetism]]. Rong is starkly in contrast to the Confucian ideal of a successful man; he is elderly, poorly dressed, with little material possessions or ambitions. And yet, despite his poverty, Rong appears happy to Confucius. He responds to Confucius' bewilderment with a cheerful song, happily accompanied by his playing of the [[lute]].&lt;ref name="Bokenkamp, Stephen.2009, p. 27"/&gt; The [[Han Dynasty]] classic ''[[Huainanzi]]'' reports that "when Rong Qiqi plucks one chord of his lute, Confucius, moved by its harmony, rejoiced for three days."&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, Audrey.(1990), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius requests Rong provide reasons for his happiness. Rong Qiqi, Confucius surmised, has nothing to be joyful of; he has no possessions, no hope, and no future. Rong replies that he is happy for three reasons, his "three joys" ({{zh|s=三乐图|t=三樂圖|p=Sān lètú}}):&lt;ref name="Bokenkamp, Stephen.2009, p. 27"/&gt; being born human, being born a man, and living to an old age. That, for him, is enough.

After all, Rong surmises, most men are poor and all men will die, so why should he worry himself? This is consistent with all lives, so instead of waiting with everyone else for it to eventually end, why should he worry himself with anything? Why should he deny himself happiness? Instead of being miserable, waiting for his fate, he chooses to be happy.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet, Isabelle.(1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Says Rong Qiqi:
{{quote|For humans, a life of hardship is the norm and death is the end. Abiding by the norm, awaiting my end, what is there to be concerned about? &lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Archetypes of Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy|author=Soccio, D.|date=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495603825|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3-36GO3KuAkC&amp;pg=PA204|page=204|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Background===
Confucius was a famous [[philosopher]] in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], known for his emphasis on [[filial piety]] and on the importance of education and studying.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=雅舍小品選集|author=Liang, S.|date=2006|volume=2|publisher=香港中文大學出版社|isbn=9789629962197|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UMZdQT_FyHAC&amp;pg=PA14|page=14|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Confucius and Confucianism: The Essentials|author=Rainey, L.D.|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781444323603|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ID4gMCaLr0MC&amp;pg=PA29|page=29|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chien|1978|pp=117–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Analects|479&amp;nbsp;BC - 221&amp;nbsp;BC|loc=[http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.html#div-1  I.1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes him a perfect [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for Rong Qiqi, who rejects his personal responsibilities in favour of pursuing happiness.

==Appeal==
Rong Qiqi's appeal was his complete abstinence of material desires.&lt;ref name="Dominik Declercq 1998 p. 383"/&gt; He was similar to his Western counterpart, [[Diogenes the Cynic]], in rejecting all societal norms and physical comforts for a life of ascetic virtue.

He lived in poverty, not because he was forced to, but because he chose to. He chose to reject the material world. Being destitute was, by itself, not an appealing trait.

===In literature and art===
The philosophy of the possibly fictional Rong Qiqi was widely admired among writers, with artists viewing it at as a more natural, more fluid, more liberating way to live life. The poet [[Ruan Kan]] wrote approvingly of Rong, applauding Rong Qiqi's [[fatalism|fatalistic]] view of life as a way to achieve the tranquillity and harmony valued in [[Daoism]] as integral to the [[Tao]].&lt;ref&gt;Yao &amp; Gu (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Poets Gu Kaizhi and Tao Yuanming have also mentioned Rong Qiqi in their poetry, but the latter spoke of him with far more skepticism, wondering if such emphasis on the natural and abandonment of the worldly is actually worth it.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, Audrey.(1990), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some poets rejected Rong, seeing seclusion as a cheap escape from recent misfortune and responsibility. The poet [[Sengdu]], while praising the idea of seclusion as a means of spiritual enlightenment, rejected Rong's reaction to futility by indulging in simplistic joys and desire. As he describes in one of his poems, Sendu's response to Rong is "Though this age might be said to be joyous, what of later lives?"&lt;ref&gt;Bokenkamp, Stephen.(2009), p. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rong Qiqi was also popularly associated with a group of Chinese [[Taoist]] [[Qingtan]] scholars, writers, and musicians called the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]] who came together in the 3rd century CE. This is indicated in some apocryphal art from the 4th century CE, in a tomb near Nanjing, depicting Rong Qiqi with the Seven Sages.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, Audrey.(1990)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Seven Sages lived in a time period long after Rong Qiqi's, so this association is probably apocryphal, assuming that Rong Qiqi is a real person and not just a fanciful character.

'''Samuel Bailey''' (5 July 1791 – 18 January 1870) was a British philosopher, economist and writer. He was called the "[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] of [[Hallamshire]]".&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Ebenezer. ''The Poetical Works of Ebenezer Elliott''. 2 volumes. London: King &amp; Co., 1876. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qldep5fhhuwC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA127,M1 vol. 1, p. 127].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bailey was born at [[Sheffield]] on 5 July 1791, the son of Joseph Bailey and Mary Eadon. His father was among the first of those Sheffield [[merchant]]s who went to the United States to establish trade connections. After a few years in his father's business, he retired from all business concerns with an ample fortune, although he remained connected with the Sheffield Banking Company, of which he was a founder in 1831 and served as [[Chair (official)|chairman]] for many years.&lt;ref name="EWFB"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Lawrence|title=Free Banking in Britain|url=https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/upldbook115pdf.pdf|edition=2nd|year=1995|publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs|isbn=9780255363754}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} Although an ardent liberal, he took little part in political affairs. On two occasions, he stood for Sheffield as a "[[Radicals (UK)|philosophic radical]]" parliamentary candidate, but without success.

His life is for the most part a history of his numerous and varied publications. He died suddenly on 18 January 1870, leaving over £80,000 to the town [[trustee]]s of Sheffield for public use.

==Thought==
[[File:Bailey Essays1821.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Title page: ''Essays on the Formation and Publication of Opinions'' 1st ed. (1821)]]
[[File:Bailey - Critical dissertation on the nature, measures, and causes of value, 1931 - 5784078.tif |thumb|''Critical dissertation on the nature, measures, and causes of value'', 1931]]
His first work, ''Essays on the Formation and Publication of Opinions'', published anonymously in 1821, attracted more attention than any of his other writings. A sequel to it appeared in 1829, ''Essays on the Pursuit of Truth''. Between these two were ''Questions in Political Economy, Politics, Morals, &amp;c.'' (1823), and a ''Critical Dissertation on the Nature, Measure, and Causes of Value'' (1825), directed against the opinions of [[David Ricardo]] and his school.

His next publications also were on economic or political subjects, ''Rationale of Political Representation'' (1835), and ''Money and its Vicissitudes'' (1837) and he has been regarded as one of the main theorists of [[Free banking]].&lt;ref name="EWFB"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Lawrence|title=Free Banking in Britain|url=https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/upldbook115pdf.pdf|edition=2nd|year=1995|publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs|isbn=9780255363754}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} About the same time, there also appeared some of his [[pamphlet]]s, ''Discussion of Parliamentary Reform'', ''Right of Primogeniture Examined'', ''Defence of Joint-Stock Banks''. In 1842 appeared his ''Review of [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]'s Theory of Vision'' which called forth rejoinders from [[John Stuart Mill]] in the ''[[Westminster Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;Mill's review appeared in the October 1842 issue of the ''Westminster Review''. It was reprinted in his ''Dissertations and Discussions'' (1859), [https://books.google.com/books?id=RqCrvijeeUQC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA84,M1 vol. 2, pp. 84–119].&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrier's review appeared in the June 1842 issue of ''Blackwood's Magazine''. It was reprinted in his ''Lectures on Greek Philosophy and Other Philosophical Remains'' (1866), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bYYqAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA291,M1 vol. 2, pp. 291–347].&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey replied to his critics in a ''Letter to a Philosopher'' (1843), &amp;c.

In 1851 he published ''Theory of Reasoning'', a discussion of the nature of [[inference]], and an able criticism of the functions and value of the [[syllogism]]. In 1852 he published ''Discourses on Various Subjects''; and finally summed up his philosophic views in the ''Letters on the Philosophy of the Human Mind'' (three series, 1855, 1858,1863). The ''Letters'' contain a discussion of many of the principal problems in [[psychology]] and ethics. Bailey can hardly be classed as belonging either to the strictly [[Empiricism|empirical]] or to the [[Idealism|idealist]] school, but his general tendency is towards the former. (1) In regard to method, he founds [[psychology]] entirely on [[introspection]]. He thus, to a certain extent, agrees with the [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Scottish School]], but he differs from them in rejecting altogether the doctrine of [[Mind|mental faculties]]. What have been designated faculties are, upon his view, merely classified facts or phenomena of [[consciousness]]. He criticizes very severely the habitual use of [[metaphor]]ical language in describing mental operations. (2) His doctrine of [[perception]], which is, in brief, that "the perception of external things through the organs of sense is a direct mental act or phenomenon of consciousness not susceptible of being resolved into anything else,"&lt;ref&gt;Bain, Alexander.''The Senses and the Intellect''. London: Parker &amp; Son, 1855. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iJgu5v1CJ8gC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA370,M1 Page 370]&lt;/ref&gt; and the reality of which can be neither proved nor disproved, is not worked out in detail, but is supported by elaborate and sometimes subtle criticisms of all other theories. (3) With regard to general and abstract [[idea]]s and general [[proposition]]s, his opinions are those of the [[Empiricism|empirical school]], but his analysis frequently puts the matter in a new light. (4) In the theory of [[Morality|morals]], Bailey is an advocate of [[utilitarianism]] (though he objects to the term "utility" as being narrow and, to the unthinking, of sordid content), and works out with great skill the steps in the formation of the "complex" [[mental fact]]s involved in the recognition of [[duty]], [[moral obligation|obligation]], right.

He bases all moral phenomena on five facts:  (1) Man is susceptible to [[pleasure]] (and [[pain]]); (2) he likes (or dislikes) their causes; (3) he desires to reciprocate pleasure and pain received; (4) he expects such reciprocation from others; (5) he feels more or less sympathy with the same feelings in his fellows (cf. ''Letters'', 3rd series).

In 1845 he published ''Maro'' a poem in four [[canto]]s (85 pp., Longmans), containing a description of a young poet who printed 1000 copies of his first poem, of which only 10 were sold. He was a diligent student of [[Shakespeare]], and his last literary work was ''On the Received Text of Shakespeare's Dramatic Writings and its Improvement'' (1862).

'''Michael Sendivogius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɛ|n|d|ɪ|ˈ|v|oʊ|dʒ|i|ə|s}}; {{lang-pl|Michał Sędziwój}}; 1566–1636) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Alchemy|alchemist]], [[philosopher]], and medical doctor. A pioneer of chemistry, he developed ways of purification and creation of various [[acid]]s, [[metal]]s and other chemical compounds. He discovered that air is not a single substance and contains a life-giving substance-later called [[oxygen]], 170 years before [[Karl Wilhelm Scheele|Scheele's]] discovery of the element. He correctly identified this 'food of life' with the gas (also oxygen) given off by heating nitre ([[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masonic.benemerito.net/msricf/papers/marples/marples-michael.sendivogius.pdf "MICHAEL SENDIVOGIUS, ROSICRUCIAN, and FATHER OF STUDIES OF OXYGEN"]&lt;/ref&gt; This substance, the 'central nitre', had a central position in Sendivogius' schema of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus, ''Chemistry and Medical Debate: Van Helmont to Boerhaave'', Science History Publication, 2001, p. 13 n. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[Image:Alchemik Sedziwoj Matejko.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Alchemist Michal Sedziwoj|''Alchemist Sendivogius'', oil on board by [[Jan Matejko]]]]
Little is known of his early life: he was born in a noble family that was part of the [[Clan of Ostoja]].&lt;ref&gt;Miguel López-Pérez (ed.), ''Chymia: Science and Nature in Medieval and Early Modern Europe'', Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2010, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; His father sent him to study in university of [[Kraków]] but Sendivogius visited also most of the [[Europe]]an countries and universities; he studied at [[University of Vienna|Vienna]], [[University of Altdorf|Altdorf]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. His acquaintances included [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and [[Edward Kelley]]. It was thanks to him that King [[Stefan Batory]] agreed to finance their experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiz.pl/8,185.html ''Praktyk i mistyk'', Andrzej Datko, Wiedza i życie] (2012-06-12) (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1590s he was active in [[Prague]], at the famously open-minded court of [[Rudolf II]].

[[Image:POL COA Sędzimir.svg|100px|right| [[Ostoja Coat of Arms|Ostoja]]]]
In Poland he appeared at the court of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] around 1600, and quickly achieved great fame, as the Polish king was himself an alchemy enthusiast and even conducted experiments with Sendivogius. In [[Kraków]]'s [[Wawel]] castle, the chamber where his experiments were performed is still intact. The more conservative Polish nobles soon came to dislike him for encouraging the king to expend vast sums of money on chemical experimentation. The more practical aspects of his work in Poland involved the design of [[Mining|mines]] and metal [[foundry|foundries]]. His widespread international contacts led to his employment as a diplomat from about 1600.

In his later years, Michael Sendivogius spent more time in Bohemia and Moravia (now in the Czech Republic), where he had been granted lands by the Habsburg emperor. Near the end of his life, he settled in [[Prague]], in the court of [[Rudolf II]], where he gained even more fame as a designer of metal mines and [[foundry|foundries]]. However the [[Thirty Years' War]] of 1618-48 had effectively ended the golden age of alchemy: the rich patrons now spent their money on financing war rather than chemical speculation, and he died in relative obscurity.

==Works==
[[Daniel Stolcius]] in his ''Viridarium Chymicum'' (1624) praises Sendivogius as the author of twelve books.&lt;ref name="prinke"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Rafal T.|last=Prinke|url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/sendi.html|title=Michael Sendivogius and Christian Rosenkruetz The Unexpected Possibilities|journal=The Hermetic Journal|date=1990|pages=72–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these was his "New Chemical Light", published in 1604. Besides a relatively clear exposition of his theory on the existence of a 'food of life' in air, his books contain various scientific, pseudo-scientific and philosophical theories, and were repeatedly translated and widely read among such worthies as [[Isaac Newton]] into the 18th century.

==Sendivogius in fiction==
[[Image:Sedziwoj Figura1.jpg|right|thumb|125px|Illustration from the book ''Sędziwój'' by Józef Bohdan Dziekoński, 1896 edition]]
First appearance of this character in fiction was in an 1845 book "Sędziwoj" by [[Józef Bohdan Dziekoński]], a writer during the times of [[romanticism in Poland]]. Nowadays he appears in several books by Polish writer [[Andrzej Pilipiuk]] (''Kuzynki, Księżniczka, Dziedziczki''). He was also shown (thinly disguised) as the Alchemist Sendivogius in the Polish TV series in the 1980s.

The Polish 19th century realist painter [[Jan Matejko]] depicted Sendivogius demonstrating a transmutation of a base metal into gold before King [[Sigismund III Vasa]].

Sendivogius is also a character in the novel of [[Gustav Meyrink]] (part of ''Goldmachergeschichten, August Scherl Verlag, Berlin 1925''), a German author from Prague, Bohemia, who often wrote about alchemy and alchemists. He is also the central character in the 2012 fictional conspiracy thriller ''The Man With the Devil's Hand'' by Jarek Garliński, a Polish-English author and translator, who mainly specialises in Polish history during the Second World War.

==History of the term==
Stewardship was originally made up of the tasks of a domestic [[Steward (office)|steward]], from [[wikt:stig#Old English|stiġ]] (''house'', ''hall'') and [[wikt:weard#Old English|weard]], (''ward'', ''guard'', ''guardian'', ''keeper'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/steward American Heritage Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927174257/https://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/steward |date=2014-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/steward|title=steward - Definition of steward in English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewardship in the beginning referred to the household servant’s duties for bringing food and drink to the castle’s dining hall. Stewardship responsibilities were eventually expanded to include everything the domestic, service and management needs of the entire household.  

Commercial stewardship tends to the domestic and service requirements of passengers on ships, trains, airplanes or guests in restaurants.  This concept of stewardship continues to be referenced within these specific categories.  {{cn|date=March 2018}}

Stewardship is now generally recognized as the acceptance or assignment of responsibility to shepherd and safeguard the valuables of others.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''Tatramajjhattatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhist]] term that is translated as "equanimity", "neutrality of mind", etc. In the Theravada tradition, it is defined as a mental attitude of balance, detachment, and impartiality.&lt;ref name=bodhi1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hxopJgv85y4C&amp;q=neutrality+mind#v=snippet&amp;q=neutrality%20mind&amp;f=false Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), pp. 86]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tatramajjhattatā is identified as:
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Twenty-five beautiful mental factors|twenty-five beautiful mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings
* A synonym of [[upekkha]]

==Explanations==

===Theravada===
Bhikkhu Bodhi explains:
:The Pali term for this cetisaka literally means "there in the middleness." It is a synonym for equanimity ([[upekkha]]), not as neutral feeling, but as a mental attitude of balance, detachment, and impartiality. It has the characteristic of conveying consciousness and the mental factors evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess, or to prevent partiality. It is manifested as neutrality. It should be seen as the state of looking on with equanimity in the citta and cetasikas, like a charioteer who looks on with equanimity at the thoroughbreds progressing evenly along the roadway.&lt;ref name=bodhi1/&gt;

The [[Visuddhimagga]] (XIV, 153) states about equanimity:
: It has the characteristic of conveying citta and cetasikas evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess, or its function is to inhibit partiality. It is manifested as neutrality. It should be regarded as like a conductor (driver) who looks on with equanimity on thoroughbreds progressing evenly.&lt;ref name=gorkom1&gt;Gorkom (2010), [http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Equanimity.html#Equanimity Definition of Tatramajjhattatā ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nina van Gorkom explains:
:When there is equanimity there is neither elation nor depression. The object which is experienced is viewed with impartiality and neutrality, just as a charioteer treats with impartiality his well-trained horses. Equanimity effects the balance of the citta and the other cetasikas it arises together with. There is no balance of mind when akusala citta arises, when we are cross, greedy, avaricious or ignorant. Whereas when we are generous, observe morality (sīla), develop calm or develop right understanding of nāma and rūpa, there is balance of mind.&lt;ref name=gorkom1/&gt;

The '''Ten Precepts''' of Taoism were outlined in a short text that appears in [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] (DH31, 32), the ''Scripture of the Ten Precepts'' (''Shíjiè jīng'' 十戒經). The precepts are the classical rules of medieval [[Taoism]] as applied to practitioners attaining the rank of Disciple of Pure Faith (''qīngxīn dìzǐ'' 清心弟子). They first appeared in the ''Scripture on Setting the Will on Wisdom'' (''Zhìhuì dìngxīn jīng'' 智慧定心經) (DZ325).&lt;ref&gt;Livia Kohn. ''Cosmos &amp; Community: The Ethical Dimension of Daoism''. Three Pines Press 2004. pp 185-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one rule that is divided into Ten Precepts. That rule is the ''[[Tao]]'' (or ''Dao'').
==The Precepts==
#Do not kill but always be mindful of the host of living beings.
#Do not be lascivious or think depraved thoughts.
#Do not steal or receive unrighteous wealth.
#Do not cheat or misrepresent good and evil.
#Do not get intoxicated but always think of pure conduct.
#I will maintain harmony with my ancestors and family and never disregard my kin.
#When I see someone do a good deed, I will support him with joy and delight.
#When I see someone unfortunate, I will support him with dignity to recover good fortune.
#When someone comes to do me harm, I will not harbor thoughts of revenge.
#As long as all beings have not attained the Dao, I will not expect to do so myself.

'''''The Future of American Progressivism: An Initiative for Political and Economic Reform''''' is a 1999 book co-written by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] and philosopher, activist and public intellectual [[Cornel West]]. In the book, Unger and West describe a central tradition in American social thought that they call "the American religion of possibility." Arguing that economic inequality, political impasse, and increasing isolation of Americans from each other has called that tradition into question, Unger and West present a plan for increasing economic equality and deepening democracy so that the United States better fulfills the promises of the American religion of possibility.

==Reception==

The book received largely positive reviews. According to ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'', Unger and West

&lt;blockquote&gt;call for democratizing the market economy and energizing representative democracy by unleashing the creative abilities of Americans. For we've always been tinkerers, people willing to experiment to find a better way.... Their concerns include the influence of money on politics. While in the past this influence was 'sanctified by the judiciary as if the ability of money to talk . . . were a principle rather than a wrong,' it is now time for government to stop upholding this dismal system and start innovating with public financing. In a country where many Democrats aspire to be nothing more than generous Republicans, they maintain, this sort of re-emergent progressivism is needed to introduce a dose of American creativity. A bold political analysis that should inspire public life but, alas, probably will not.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/roberto-mangabeira-unger/the-future-of-american-progressivism/ Unsigned review of ''The Future of American Progressivism''.] ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'', September 15, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another laudatory review came from [[Mark Satin]] in the ''Radical Middle Newsletter'', who described the book as

&lt;blockquote&gt;exceptionally bold ... exceptionally detailed.... [O]nly a couple of pages into the book you’ll realize that their principal goal is to drag the old New Left and the new 'identity left,' kicking and screaming, into the world of entrepreneurship, personal responsibility, and scientific and technological progress. Instead of basking in unearned self-esteem, all high school students should be expected to master a tough set of conceptual, practical, and learning skills. In short: Progressives should lead the march away from the old economy, and thereby help define the emerging new economy of 'flattened hierarchies and permanent innovation.'&lt;ref&gt;Satin, Mark. "Four books, four visions; or, Where have you gone, Herbert Marcuse?" [http://www.radicalmiddle.com/x_berry_coates.htm ''Radical Middle Newsletter'', Issue No. 22 (March 2001)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing in ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', Eugene McCarraher commended Unger and West's "sweeping but sensible proposals," but contended that their celebration of the practices of vanguard industry as a path for the rest of the U.S. to reach economic equality was misguided:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By describing as "religion" the practical and experimental ways in which Americans approach technology and personal relations, Unger and West highlight the mixture of prophecy and wonkery that has been the glory and the bane of the progressive tradition. They marvel at "a worldwide network of productive vanguards," at "flexibility" and "decentralization" in labor markets and production, and at the "flattened hierarchies," "fluid job definitions," and "constant reshaping of products, services, and practices" that characterize the advanced sectors of contemporary capitalism. But ''The Future of American Progressivism'' seems unaware of the ways this lexicon articulates the libertarian elitism of the "productive vanguards." .... For a couple of leftists, the authors are remarkably forgetful of the market's coercive character.&lt;ref&gt;McCarraher, Eugene. "Missing: The Vision Thing." ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'' May 19, 2000, Vol. 127 Issue 10, p. 25-27, at 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' article about Unger's work as a cabinet minister in Brazil, he is best known in the United States for ''The Future of American Progressivism''.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, Simon. [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/world/americas/working-within-the-system-to-disrupt-brazilian-politics.html "Working Within the System to Disrupt Brazilian Politics."] ''The New York Times'', June 27, 2015, page A3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of '''Nal and Damayanti''' from the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' is a very popular and frequently told story. It has been interpreted in many languages which also includes [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Braj]]. This page describes the interpretations of the story conducted by [[Todar Mal]], the Hindu finance minister of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] and [[Faizi|Abu al-Faiz]], Akbar's poet laureate.
[[File:Faizi represent his work 'Nal wa daman' to Akbar.jpg |thumb| Faizi represent his work 'Nal wa daman' to Akbar.]]
Both the interpretations include the central theme of love. In Todar Mal's version, the story of [[Nala|Nal]] (or Nala) and [[Damayanti]] has themes such as love, deceit and war between [[Hindu deities]] and Nal. On the other hand, Faizi talks about three oppositions which also play a role as themes. The first opposition is love and intellect (aql), the second opposition is between love and beauty (husn) and the third opposition is between Ishq and junnun (frenzy). However, one account is related to [[Bhakti]] which includes a lot of Hindu deities and connections between the supreme power and human beings. The other account is related to [[Sufism]] which includes a passionate connection between love and humans.

A general statement related to Bhakti states that it is a devotional worship for one supreme deity, by whose blessings a person can achieve salvation. A Bhakti rendition of Nala-Damayanti: Todarmal’s ‘Nector of Nal’s life’ describes the famous story of Nal and Damayanti. The story is described from a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] traditional perspective keeping in mind the [[Hindu culture]]. The story includes themes of love, deceit and war. 'Nector of Nal's Life' is closely related to Bhakti of a Hindu deity called [[Hari]]. It starts off with Damayanti's life. Damayanti is a young princess whose beauty is beyond perfection. Due to this her mother insists on marrying her daughter to a God instead of marrying her to a mere human. They consider Lord [[Indra]] to be the perfect match for Damayanti. However, the goose that had been sent to Indra holding the invitation to the marriage was hit by a storm and lands in the kingdom of a handsome king named Nal. Nal takes cares of the goose and instead of continuing its journey the goose decides to choose Nal as the rightful husband of Damayanti. Lord Indra finds out that Nal is in love with Damayanti and demands him not to marry her or else he will have to pay for his actions. However, Indra realises that he must resort to deceit in order to win Damayanti, and so he decides to take the form of Nal. Damayanti is presented with two Nals and so she must choose the one she loves. "Anguished, she calls upon Hari who guides her actions and enables her to know which is truly Nal. Only when she looks into the eyes of both does she know her true love and garlands the real Nal" (Wadley 1999, 33). This is the first instance in the story in which the power of Bhakti is displayed.

Another instance during which the notion of Bhakti is exhibited is when Hari is worried about Indra conspiring with [[Rahu]] and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], Suraj and [[Shani|Sani]]. According to Hari, if their side won, they would cause Nal a lot of suffering. However, Hari says that if Nal was to remember Hari this whole time he would not be devastated. "But if this should happen and Nal continues to remember Hari throughout his twelve years of sorrow, he will return with more than he lost." (Wadley 1999, 34).  This notion of believe in God shows the true meaning of Bhakti in the [[Hindu culture]].

In addition, Nal and Damayanti were destined to struggle a lot. Indra attacks Narvar the kingdom of Nal. All four planets jointly attack the king and destroy his wealth, grain and palaces. Looking at this Damayanti calls upon Hari once again to protect them. "But as the crisis worsens, Dumaiti calls out to Hari, asking for his help. Hari sends Narad to take Nal out of the city before all the beings in it die from Indra's onslaught" (Wadley 1999, 34). With the help of Hari, Nal and Damayanti reach the house of an oil presser because Sani cannot harm those who press sesame oil. Here, once again Nal's powers are active and he helps the oil presser a lot by pressing lots of oil and making him very wealthy.

[[Sufism]] is the actualisation of the Truth by means of love and devotion. Love, Passion and Reason in Faizi's Nal-Daman," in Love in South Asia:ACultural History also talks about the story of Nal and Damayanti however; a lot of Sufism elements take account in this version. Abu al-Fayz Faizi’s interpretation starts off with the story of Nal. Nal is portrayed as a man who is possessed by love. He has an illness of love because of which he is not the same. Nal blames love for his state but after meeting Daman (Damayanti) he does not think that love is evil. This is when the first opposition is introduced; love and intellect (Aql). In Sufism context, “when love becomes excess, it can only lead to disaster, for this is the inevitable consequence of the neglect of the intellect (aql) and of notions of equilibrium that are crucial both for [[kingship]] and social order" (Alam and Subrahmanyam 2006, 116). After hearing many stories about love, he was possessed by it. Nal is told a story of an Indian princess (Daman) about whom there were many rumours around the kingdom. Upon hearing the story, he concludes that Daman is the reason for this sickness even though he had no direct or indirect contact with her. Also, a section in the story says that Nal is confused as to how the bandits broke into his treasure in spite of all the guards that have been patrolling it. This point is directly connected to intellect as Nal is taken over by love and cannot think straight.

Another opposition that has been introduced in the story is between love and beauty ([[husn]]). In Sufism context love is vulnerable and ever-seeking whereas beauty is distant, refuses to be engaged and altogether is remarkable for its indifference. "Beauty fires arrows and love is wounded" (Alam and Subrahmanyam 2006, 118). Upon hearing of the beauty of Daman, Nal is mesmerised and falls further into the sickness of love. Lastly, the third opposition that has been introduced is between love and frenzy (junnun). After marrying Daman, Nal is completely lost to pleasure. He is shown to be possessed by frenzy of passion. His life is shown to have formed an alliance between love ([[ishq]]) and frenzy (junnun) against intellect ([['Aql|aql]]). He is so deeply in love that he loses his sense of equilibrium which is an important component of a great ruler. Nal's younger brother tries to take advantage of this situation by proposing a game of chess. Whoever won this game would win all the goods, treasure and the kingdom. "Nal, who is already a prisoner of junnun, falls into this whirlpool as its unsuspecting victim" (Alam and Subrahmanyam 2006, 130).

Furthermore, another practice that portrays the element of junnun is the practice of [[Sati (practice)|Sati]]. In Hinduism sati was the practice of wife burning herself in the pyre of the husband. The wife would sacrifice their life along with their husbands. "The Sufi (follower of Sufism) brimming with love and fascination for his beloved, is thought to suffer immense pain, agitation, and distress over separation" (Rehman 2014, 3). The women would show their junnun for their husbands by setting themselves on fire because they cannot bear the separation.

The two accounts Bhakti and Sufism are also very similar within these two stories. Nal is portrayed as an aashiq in [[Faizi]]'s version and in Todarmal's interpretation Nal constantly falls in love with Damayanti once he hears how beautiful she is. In addition, when Nal goes to Daman's Swayamwara his competitor is a Pagan God compared to Indra in Todarmal's version. Another relevant point is the [[monotheism]] displayed. There are many Pagan Gods however; Nal only worships one ultimate God which is a little in parallel with the concept of Akbar praying to [[Allah]]. Nal is also shown to have amazing skills as a ruler. He makes a great king with a high intellect which again hints towards Akbar because he is known to be one of the greatest rulers in South Asian history.

In conclusion, the re-interpretation of the story of Nal and Damayanti suggests a lot about the interaction between Bhakti and Sufism in early modern India. Akbar the great mystic king was interested in spreading the rich Indian works all around the Persian tradition. Due to this he chose this story and it exhibits the great interest he had in Hinduism particularly the account of Bhakti. Taking the love story of Nal and Damayanti and adding a metrical scheme of the story of Layla-Majnun is what Abu al-Fayz Faizi tried achieving. The love of Nal for Damayanti is portrayed in a Sufi way by Faizi who used the components like junnun, ishq and aql to exhibit his state in love. In addition, the re-interpretation of story also exhibits the great interest Muslim rulers had in some of the Hindu/Bhakti traditions. This includes the traditions of swayamwara and Sati. Both the interpretations have the component of swayamwara present. In the Bhakti account, Nal is competing with Indra and many other kings to win Damayanti. On the other hand, the Sufism account shows Nal competing with a [[Pagan]] God and other kings to win Daman. Also, the notion of Sati is an olden Hindu tradition. In this tradition, the married women whose husband passes away, sits in the pyre of her husband. This tradition explains that once a husband dies, the wife has lost all the hopes of living and so she must take her life as well. Faizi is shown to be interested in the tradition of Sati because he uses this notion in his Sufism account of Nal and Damanyanti's story. After Nal dies, Daman sits in his pyre and dies with him. With the help of such re-interpretations many Bhakti traditions passed over to Muslim and Persian cultures and many Sufi traditions passed over to Hindu culture. Therefore, this suggests that the interaction between the two devotional traditions is very strong.

'''Udayana''', also known as '''Udayanācārya''' ('''Udyanacharya''', or '''Master Udayana'''), was a very important [[Indian logic|Hindu logician]] of the tenth century who attempted to reconcile the views held by the two major schools of [[logic]] ([[Nyaya]] and  [[Vaisheshika]]). This became the root of the [[Navya-Nyāya]] school of the thirteenth century, established by the [[Gangesha Upadhyaya]] ("New [[Nyāya]]") school of "right" reasoning, which is still recognized and followed in some regions of India.  He lived in [[Kariyan]] village in  [[History of Mithila|Mithila]], near present-day [[Darbhanga]], [[Bihar]] state, [[India]].

Udayana wrote a sub-gloss on Vachaspati's work called the Nyaya-vaartika-taatparya-tiikaa-parishuddhi. He wrote several other works such as the Kusumanjali, Atma-tattva-viveka, Kiranaavali and Nyaya-parishishhta (also called Bodha siddhi or Bodha shuddhi).

He is given credit by Naiyâyikas for having demolished in a final fashion the claims of the Buddhist logicians. All his works, or at least all of which we know, have been preserved, which attest to the respect in which he was held from the beginning.

==Nyayakusumanjali and the existence of God==
Udayana's ''[[Nyayakusumanjali]]'' gave the following nine arguments to prove the existence of creative God:&lt;ref name=csharma&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp.209-10&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Kāryāt'' (lit. "from effect"): The world is an effect, all effects have efficient cause, hence the world must have an efficient cause. That efficient cause is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Āyojanāt'' (lit., from combination): Atoms are inactive. To form a substance, they must combine. To combine, they must move. Nothing moves without intelligence and source of motion. Since we perceive substance, some intelligent source must have moved the inactive atoms. That intelligent source is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Dhŗtyādéḥ'' (lit., from support): Something sustains this world. Something destroys this world. Unintelligent ''Adrsta'' (unseen principles of nature) cannot do this. We must infer that something intelligent is behind it. That is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Padāt'' (lit., from word): Each word has meaning and represents an object. This representational power of words has a cause. That cause is God.
*''Pratyayataḥ'' (lit, from faith): [[Vedas]] are infallible. Human beings are fallible. Infallible Vedas cannot have been authored by fallible human beings. Someone authored the infallible Vedas. That author is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Shrutéḥ'' (lit., from scriptures): The infallible Vedas testify to the existence of God. Thus God exists.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Vākyāt'' (lit., from precepts): Vedas deal with moral laws, the rights and the wrongs. These are divine. Divine injunctions and prohibitions can only come from a divine creator of laws. That divine creator is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Samkhyāviśeşāt'' (lit., from the specialty of numbers): By rules of perception, only the number "one" can ever be directly perceived. All numbers other than one are inferences and concepts created by consciousness. When man is born, his mind is incapable of inferences and concepts. He develops consciousness as he develops. The consciousness development is self-evident and proven because of man's ability with perfect numerical conception. This ability to conceive numerically perfect concepts must depend on something. That something is divine consciousness. So God must exist.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;
*''Adŗşţāt'' (lit., from the unforeseen): Everybody reaps the fruits of his own actions. Merits and demerits accrue from his own actions. An Unseen Power keeps a balance sheet of the merit and demerit. But since this Unseen Power is Unintelligent, it needs intelligent guidance to work. That intelligent guide is God.&lt;ref name=csharma/&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}}

'''Vedanta''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|t|ə}}; [[Sanskrit]]: वेदान्त, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Vedānta}}'') or '''Uttara Mīmāṃsā''' is one of the six [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. ''Vedanta'' literally means "end of the [[Vedas]]", reflecting ideas that emerged from the speculations and philosophies contained in the [[Upanishad]]s. It does not stand for one comprehensive or unifying doctrine. Rather it is an umbrella term for many sub-traditions, ranging from [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] to [[Advaita|non-dualism]], all of which developed on the basis of a common textual connection called the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]''. The ''Prasthanatrayi'' is a collective term for the ''[[Principal Upanishads]]'', the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]].''

All Vedanta schools, in their deliberations, concern themselves with the following three categories but differ in their views regarding the concept and the relations between them: ''[[Brahman]]'' – the ultimate metaphysical reality,  ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' / ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'' – the individual soul or self, and  ''[[Prakriti]]'' – the empirical world, [[impermanence|ever-changing]] physical universe, body and matter.

Some of the better known sub-traditions of Vedanta include [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] (non-dualism), [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified non-dualism), and [[Dvaita]] (dualism). Most other Vedantic sub-traditions are subsumed under the term [[Bhedabheda]] (difference and non-difference). Over time, Vedanta adopted ideas from other [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools like ''[[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]]'' and ''[[Nyaya]]'', and, through this [[syncretism]], became the most prominent school of [[Hinduism]]. Many extant forms of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]] have been significantly shaped and influenced by the doctrines of different schools of Vedanta. The Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The word ''Vedanta'' literally means the ''end of the [[Vedas]]'' and originally referred to the ''[[Upanishads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=231,232,238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vedanta was concerned with the {{IAST|''jñānakāṇḍa''}} or Vedic knowledge part called the ''Upanishads''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koller|2013|pp=100–106}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=211}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The denotation of Vedanta subsequently widened to include the various philosophical traditions based on to the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}}; {{harvnb|Raju|1972|pp=176–177}}; {{harvnb|Isaeva|1992|p=35 with footnote 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Upanishads]]'' may be regarded as the end of ''Vedas'' in different senses:{{sfn|Raju|1972|pp=176–177}}
# These were the last literary products of the Vedic period.
# These mark the culmination of Vedic thought.
# These were taught and debated last, in the ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' (student) stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}}; {{harvnb|Scharfe|2002|pp=58–59,115–120,282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vedanta''' is one of the six [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools of [[Indian philosophy]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=231,232,238}} It is also called ''Uttara Mīmāṃsā'', the 'latter enquiry' or 'higher enquiry'; and is often contrasted with ''[[Mimamsa|Pūrva Mīmāṃsā]]'', the 'former enquiry' or 'primary enquiry'. ''Pūrva Mīmāṃsā'' deals with the ''karmakāṇḍa'' or rituals part (the ''[[Samhita]]'' and ''[[Brahmana]]s'') in the ''Vedas''.{{Sfn|Clooney|2000|pp=147–158}}{{Sfn|Mohan Lal Sandal|1925|p=16, Sutra 30}}{{refn|group=note|Historically, Vedanta has been called by various names. The early names were the Upanishadic ones (''Aupanisada''), the doctrine of the end of the ''Vedas'' (''Vedanta-vada''), the doctrine of ''[[Brahman]]'' (''Brahma-vada''), and the doctrine that ''Brahman'' is the cause (''Brahma-karana-vada'').{{Sfn|King|1995|p=268 with note 2}}}}

==''Prasthanatrayi'', the Three Sources==
The ''[[Upanishads]]'', the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavadgita]]'' and the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'' constitute the basis of Vedanta. All schools of Vedanta propound their philosophy by interpreting these texts, collectively called the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]'', literally, ''three sources''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ranganathan}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}; {{harvnb|Grimes|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The ''[[Upanishads]]'',{{refn|group=note|The ''Upanishads'' were many in number and developed in the different schools at different times and places, some in the Vedic period and others in the medieval or modern era (the names of up to 112 ''Upanishads'' have been recorded).{{sfn|Dasgupta|1922|pp=28}} All major commentators have considered twelve to thirteen oldest of these texts as the Principal ''Upanishads'' and as the foundation of Vedanta.}} or ''Śruti prasthāna''; considered the ''[[Sruti]]'', the “heard” (and repeated) foundation of Vedanta.
# The ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', or ''Nyaya prasthana'' / ''Yukti prasthana''; considered the reason-based foundation of Vedanta.
# The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', or ''Smriti prasthāna''; considered the ''[[Smriti]]'' (remembered tradition) foundation of Vedanta.

The ''Brahma Sutras'' attempted to synthesize the teachings of the ''Upanishads''.  The diversity in the teaching of the ''Upanishads'' necessitated the systematization of these teachings. This was likely done in many ways in ancient India, but the only surviving version of this synthesis is the ''Brahma Sutras'' of ''[[Badarayana]]''.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}

All major Vedantic teachers, including [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]], [[Rāmānuja|Ramanuja]], [[Nimbarka]], [[Vallabha Acharya|Vallabha]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], have composed commentaries not only on the ''Upanishads'' and ''Brahma Sutras'', but also on the ''Bhagavad Gita''. The ''Bhagavad Gita'', due to its syncretism of [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], and [[Upanishad]]ic thought, has played a major role in Vedantic thought.{{sfn|Pasricha|2008|p=95}}

==History==

The ''Upanishads'' present a rigorous philosophical inquiry in the form of identifying various doctrines and then presenting arguments for or against them. They form the basic texts and Vedanta interprets them through rigorous philosophical [[exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxx–xxxiiii}};  {{harvnb|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varying interpretations of the ''Upanishads'' and their synthesis, the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', led to the development of different schools of Vedanta over time of which three,{{sfn|Chatterjee|Dutta|1939|pp=317–318}} four,{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=177}} five&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/Colloquium03–DiffVedantas.pdf Prem Pahlajrai, Asian Languages and Literature, University of Washington, ''Vedanta: A Comparative Analysis of Diverse Schools'']{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or six{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=216}}{{refn|group=note|Sivananda also mentions Meykandar and the ''[[Shaiva Siddhanta]]'' philosophy.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=217}}}} are prominent.{{refn|group=note|Proponents of other Vedantic schools continue to write and develop their ideas as well, although their works are not widely known outside of smaller circles of followers in [[India]].}}

The history of Vedanta is divided into two periods: one prior to the composition of the ''Brahma Sutras'' and the other encompassing the schools that developed after the ''Brahma Sutras'' were written.

===Before the ''Brahma Sutras''===
Little is known{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} of schools of Vedanta existing before the composition of the ''Brahma Sutras'' (400–450 BCE).{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} considers the ''Brahma Sutras'' as a group of sutras composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years. The precise date is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|p=746}}; {{harvnb|Nakamura|1949|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} estimates that the book was composed in its current form between 400 and 450 BCE.}} It is clear that Badarayana, the writer of ''Brahma Sutras'', was not the first person to systematize the teachings of the ''Upanishads'', as he quotes six Vedantic teachers before him – Ashmarathya, Badari, Audulomi, Kashakrtsna, Karsnajini and Atreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxiii}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1996|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to other early Vedanta teachers – Brahmadatta, Sundara, Pandaya, Tanka and Dravidacharya – are found in secondary literature of later periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1996|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of these ancient teachers have not survived, but based on the quotes attributed to them in later literature, Sharma postulates that Ashmarathya and Audulomi were [[Bhedabheda]] scholars, Kashakrtsna and Brahmadatta were [[Advaita]] scholars, while Tanka and Dravidacharya were either Advaita or Vishistadvaita scholars.{{Sfn|Sharma|1996|pp=124–125}}

===''Brahma Sutras''===
{{Main article|Brahma Sutras}}
[[Badarayana]] summarized and interpreted teachings of the ''Upanishads'' in the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', also called the ''Vedanta Sutra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,151–152}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|pp=239–241}}; {{harvnb|Nicholson|2010|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Vedanta–sūtra are known by a variety of names, including (1) Brahma–sūtra, (2) Śārīraka–sutra, (3) Bādarāyaṇa–sūtra and (4) Uttara–mīmāṁsā.}} Badarayana summarized the teachings of the classical Upanishads&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=AN INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN PHILOSOPHY|last=Satischandra Chatterjee|first=Dhirendramohan Dutta|publisher=Rupa Publications India Pvt.

Though attributed to Badarayana, the Brahma Sutras were likely composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} The estimates on when the Brahma Sutras were complete vary,&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 746&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nakamura|1949|p=436}} with Nicholson in his 2013 review stating, that they were most likely compiled in the present form around 400–450 BCE.{{sfn|Nicholson|2013|p=26, Quote: "From a historical perspective, the Brahmasutras are best understood as a group of sutras composed by multiple authors over the course of hundreds of years, most likely composed in its current form between 400 and 450 BCE."}} Isaeva suggests they were complete and in current form by 200 CE,&lt;ref&gt;NV Isaeva (1992), Shankara and Indian Philosophy, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1281-7}}, page 36&lt;/ref&gt; while Nakamura states that "the great part of the ''Sutra'' must have been in existence much earlier than that."{{sfn|Nakamura|1949|p=436}}

The book is composed of four chapters, each divided into four quarters or sections.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}} These sutras attempt to synthesize the diverse teachings of the Upanishads. However, the cryptic nature of aphorisms of the ''Brahma Sutras'' have required exegetical commentaries.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=151–152}} These commentaries have resulted in the formation of numerous Vedanta schools, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|2010|pp=26–27}}; {{harvnb|Mohanty|Wharton|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between the ''Brahma Sutras'' and Adi Shankara===
{{See also|Vedas|Upanishads|Darsanas}}

Little with specificity is known of the period between the ''Brahma Sutras'' (5th century BCE) and Adi Shankara (8th century CE).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}{{sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=163}} Only two writings of this period have survived: the ''Vākyapadīya'', written by [[Bhartṛhari]] (second half 5th century{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=426}}), and the ''Kārikā'' written by Gaudapada (early 6th{{sfn|Michael Comans|2000|p=163}} or 7th century CE).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}

Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his school in his commentaries.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002}} A number of important early Vedanta thinkers have been listed in the ''Siddhitraya'' by Yamunācārya (c. 1050), the ''Vedārthasamgraha'' by Rāmānuja (c. 1050–1157), and the ''Yatīndramatadīpikā'' by Śrīnivāsa Dāsa.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} At least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahma Sutras and Shankara's lifetime.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}{{refn|group=note|Bhartŗhari (c. 450–500), Upavarsa (c. 450–500), Bodhāyana (c. 500), Tanka (Brahmānandin) (c. 500–550), Dravida (c. 550), Bhartŗprapañca (c. 550), Śabarasvāmin (c. 550), Bhartŗmitra (c. 550–600), Śrivatsānka (c. 600), Sundarapāndya (c. 600), Brahmadatta (c. 600–700), Gaudapada (c. 640–690), Govinda (c. 670–720), Mandanamiśra (c. 670–750).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}}}

A noted scholar of this period was Bhartriprapancha. Bhartriprapancha maintained that the Brahman is one and there is unity, but that this unity has varieties. Scholars see Bhartriprapancha as an early philosopher in the line who teach the tenet of [[Bhedabheda]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Essentials of Indian Philosophy|last=Hiriyanna|first=M.|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (2008 Reprint)|year=1948|isbn=978-81-208-1330-4|location=Delhi|pages=19, 21–25, 150–152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaudapada, Adi Shankara and Advaita Vedanta===
{{Main article|Advaita Vedanta|Gaudapada}}

Gaudapada (c. 6th century CE),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michael Comans|2000|p=163}}; {{harvnb|Jagannathan|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the teacher or a more distant predecessor of [[Govinda Bhagavatpada|Govindapada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Michael Comans|2000|pp=2,163}}&lt;/ref&gt; the teacher of Adi Shankara. Shankara is widely considered as the founder of [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=177}} Gaudapada's treatise, the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}''—also known as the ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'' or the ''{{IAST|Āgama Śāstra}}''{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=239}}—is the earliest surviving complete text on Advaita Vedanta.{{refn|group=note|There is ample evidence, however, to suggest that Advaita was a thriving tradition by the start of the common era or even before that. Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his Sampradaya.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002}} Scholarship since 1950 suggests that almost all [[Sannyasa#Sannyasa Upanishads|Sannyasa Upanishads]] have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olivelle|1992|pp=17–18}}; {{harvnb|Rigopoulos|1998|pp=62–63}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|1995|p=332 with note 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd Century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olivelle|1992|pp=x–xi,8–18}}; {{harvnb|Sprockhoff|1976|pp=277–294,319–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong Advaita Vedanta views in these ancient Sannyasa Upanishads may be, states [[Patrick Olivelle]], because major Hindu monasteries of this period belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition.{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=17–18}}}}

Gaudapada's ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'' relied on the [[Mandukya Upanishad|Mandukya]], [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Brihadaranyaka]] and [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chhandogya]] ''Upanishads''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=239}}; {{harvnb|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}}; {{harvnb|Nakamura|1950|p=308}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'', Advaita (non-dualism) is established on rational grounds (''upapatti'') independent of scriptural revelation; its arguments are devoid of all religious, mystical or scholastic elements. Scholars are divided on a possible influence of [[Buddhism]] on Gaudapada's philosophy.{{Refn|group=note|Scholars like {{harvtxt|Raju|1972|p=177}}, following the lead of earlier scholars like Sengupta,{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} believe that Gaudapada co-opted the Buddhist doctrine that ultimate reality is pure consciousness [[Yogacara#Representation–only|(''vijñapti-mātra'')]]. {{harvtxt|Raju|1972|pp=177–178}} states, "Gaudapada wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the Mandukaya Upanisad, which was further developed by Shankara." {{harvtxt|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} states that the whole purpose of Gaudapada was to present and demonstrate the ultimate reality of Atman, an idea denied by [[Buddhism]]. According to {{harvtxt|Murti|1955|pp=114–115}}, Gaudapada's doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Gaudapada's influential text consists of four chapters; Chapter One, Two and Three of which are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor. Chapter Four uses Buddhist terminology and incorporates Buddhist doctrines but Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada through the 17th century, state both Murti and Richard King, never referenced nor used Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three.{{sfn|Jagannathan|2011}} While there is shared terminology, the doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different, states {{harvtxt|Murti|1955|pp=114–115}}}} The fact that Shankara, in addition to the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', the principal ''Upanishads'' and the ''[[Bhagvad Gita]]'', wrote an independent commentary on the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'' proves its importance in {{IAST|Vedāntic}} literature.{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}}

Adi Shankara (788–820), elaborated on Gaudapada's work and more ancient scholarship to write detailed commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi and the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}''. The Mandukya Upanishad and the ''{{IAST|Kārikā}}'' have been described by Shankara as containing "the epitome of the substance of the import of Vedanta".{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2008|pp=203–206}} It was Shankara who integrated Gaudapada work with the ancient ''Brahma Sutras'', "and give it a ''locus classicus''" alongside the realistic strain of the ''Brahma Sutras''.{{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=64}}{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} writes: "The ''Brahmasutras'' themselves espouse the realist Parinamavada position, which appears to have been the view most common among early Vedantins."}} His interpretation, including works ascribed to him, has become the normative interpretation of Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakamura|1950}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|Shankara synthesized the ''Advaita–vāda'' which had previously existed before him,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=678}} and, in this synthesis, became the restorer &amp; defender of an ancient learning.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} He was an unequaled commentator,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} due to whose efforts and contributions,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=678}} Advaita Vedanta assumed a dominant position within Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}}}}

A noted contemporary of Shankara was  [[Maṇḍana Miśra]], who regarded [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] and Vedanta as forming a single system and advocated their combination known as ''Karma-jnana-samuchchaya-vada''.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=239–241,372–375}}{{refn|group=note|According to Mishra, the [[sutra]]s, beginning with the first sutra of Jaimini and ending with the last sutra of Badarayana, form one compact [[shastra]].{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=239–241,372–375}}}} The treatise on the differences between the Vedanta school and the Mimamsa school was a contribution of Adi Shankara. Advaita Vedanta rejects rituals in favor of [[sannyasa|renunciation]], for example.{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=175-176}}

===Ramanuja and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta===
Rāmānuja (1017–1137 CE) was the most influential philosopher in the [[Vishishtadvaita]] tradition. As the philosophical architect of Vishishtadvaita, he taught qualified [[Nondualism|non-dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sullivan|2001|page=239}}; {{harvnb|Schultz|1981|pp=81–84}}; {{harvnb|Bartley|2013|pp=1–2}}; {{harvnb|Carman|1974|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanuja's teacher, Yadava Prakasha, followed the Advaita monastic tradition. Tradition has it that Ramanuja disagreed with Yadava and Advaita Vedanta, and instead followed [[Nathamuni]] and [[Yamunacharya|Yāmuna]]. Ramanuja reconciled the ''Prasthanatrayi'' with the theism and philosophy of the Vaishnava [[Alvars]] poet-saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olivelle|1992|pp=10–11,17–18}}; {{harvnb|Bartley|2013|pp=1–4,52–53,79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanuja wrote a number of influential texts, such as a [[bhasya]] on the ''Brahma Sutras'' and the ''Bhagavad Gita'', all in Sanskrit.{{Sfn|Carman|1994|pp=82–87 with footnotes}}

Ramanuja presented the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and [[Hindu soteriology|soteriological]] importance of bhakti, or the devotion to a personal God (Vishnu in Ramanuja's case) as a means to spiritual liberation. His theories assert that there exists a plurality and distinction between Atman (souls) and Brahman (metaphysical, ultimate reality), while he also affirmed that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the Brahman.&lt;ref name="Bartley 2013 1–2,9–10,76–79,87–98"&gt;{{harvnb|Bartley|2013|pp=1–2,9–10,76–79,87–98}}; {{harvnb|Sullivan|2001|page=239}}; {{harvnb|Doyle|2006|pp=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishishtadvaiata provides the philosophical basis of [[Sri Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernard|1947|pages=9–12}}; {{harvnb|Sydnor|2012|pp=0–11,20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramanuja was influential in integrating ''[[Bhakti]]'', the devotional worship, into Vedanta premises.{{Sfn|Fowler|2002|p=288}}

=== Madhva and Dvaita ===
Dvaita was propounded by Madhvacharya (1238–1317 CE).{{refn|group=note|Many sources date him to 1238–1317 period,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=12–13,359–361}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some place him over 1199–1278 CE.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}}} He presented the opposite interpretation of Shankara in his Dvaita, or dualistic system.{{sfn|Bernard|1947|pp=9–12}} In contrast to Shankara's non-dualism and Ramanuja's qualified non-dualism, he championed unqualified dualism. Madhva wrote commentaries on the chief ''Upanishads'', the ''Bhagavad Gita'' and the ''Brahma Sutra''.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|p=187}}

Madhva started his Vedic studies at age seven, joined an Advaita Vedanta monastery in Dwarka (Gujarat),{{Sfn|Sheridan|1991|p= 117}} studied under [[guru]] Achyutrapreksha,{{Sfn|Dehsen|1999|p=118}} frequently disagreed with him, left the Advaita monastery, and founded Dvaita.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=79-80}} Madhva and his followers Jayatirtha and Vyasatirtha, were critical of all competing Hindu philosophies, Jainism and Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1962|pp=128–129,180–181}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|pp=150–151,372,433–434}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; but particularly intense in their criticism of Advaita Vedanta and Adi Shankara.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=372–375}}

Dvaita Vedanta is theistic and it identifies Brahman with Narayana, or more specifically Vishnu, in a manner similar to Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. But it is more explicitly pluralistic.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=188–189}} Madhva's emphasis for difference between soul and Brahman was so pronounced that he taught there were differences (1) between material things; (2) between material things and souls; (3) between material things and God; (4) between souls; and (5) between souls and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|p=396}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocated for a difference in degrees in the possession of knowledge. He also advocated for differences in the enjoyment of bliss even in the case of liberated souls, a doctrine found in no other system of Indian philosophy. {{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=188–189}}

==Overview of the schools of Vedanta==

===Schools propounding Non-dualism===

====Advaita school====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|right|x216px|Shankaracharya]]
{{main article|Advaita Vedanta}}
Advaita Vedanta ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|Advaita Vedānta}}''; [[Sanskrit]]: अद्वैत वेदान्त) espouses non-dualism and monism. ''Brahman'' is held to be the sole unchanging metaphysical reality and identical to ''Atman''.{{sfn|Stoker|2011}} The physical world, on the other hand, is always-changing empirical [[Maya (illusion)|''Maya'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Das|1952}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=160–161}}; {{harvnb|Doniger|1986|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Doniger|1986|p=119}} says "that to say that the universe is an illusion (''{{IAST|māyā}}'') is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. ''Maya'' not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge."}} The absolute and infinite ''Atman''-''Brahman'' is realized by a process of negating everything relative, finite, empirical and changing.{{sfn|Das|1952}} The school accepts no duality, no limited individual souls (''Atman'' / ''Jivatman''), and no separate unlimited cosmic soul. All souls and existence across space and time is considered as the same oneness (i.e. monism).{{sfn|Sharma|2007|pp=19–40,53–58,79–86}} Spiritual liberation in ''Advaita'' is the full comprehension and realization of oneness, that one's unchanging ''Atman'' (soul) is the same as the ''Atman'' in everyone else, as well as being identical to the ''nirguna'' ''Brahman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Indich|1995|pp=1–2, 97–102}}; {{harvnb|Etter|2006|pp=57–60, 63–65}}; {{harvnb|Perrett|2013|pages=247–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vishishtadvaita====
{{main article|Vishishtadvaita}}
[[File:Ramanuja embracing Lord Varadaraj.jpg|thumb|right|x160px|Ramanujacharya depicted with Vaishnava [[Tilaka]] and Vishnu statue.]]

''Vishishtadvaita'' asserts that ''Jivatman'' (human souls) and ''Brahman'' (as ''Vishnu'') are different, a difference that is never transcended.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Betty|2010|pp= 215–224}}; {{harvnb|Craig|2000|pp=517–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this qualification, Ramanuja also affirmed monism by saying that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the ''Brahman''.&lt;ref name="Bartley 2013 1–2,9–10,76–79,87–98"/&gt; ''Vishishtadvaita'', like ''Advaita'', is a non-dualistic school of Vedanta in a qualified way, and both begin by assuming that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Etter|2006|pp=57–60,63–65}}; {{harvnb|Buitenin|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the relation between the ''Brahman'' and the world of matter (''Prakriti''), ''Vishishtadvaita'' states both are two different absolutes, both metaphysically true and real, neither is false or illusive, and that ''saguna'' ''Brahman'' with attributes is also real.{{sfn|Schultz|1981|pp=81–84}} Ramanuja states that God, like man, has both soul and body, and the world of matter is the glory of God's body.{{sfn|Buitenin|2010}} The path to ''Brahman'' (''Vishnu''), according to Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of the personal god (''[[bhakti]]'' of ''saguna'' ''Brahman'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schultz|1981|pp=81–84}}; {{harvnb|Buitenin|2010}}; {{harvnb|Sydnor|2012|pp=84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shuddhādvaita====
{{main article|Shuddhadvaita}}[[File:Shri mahaprabhuji.jpg|thumb|right|text|x224px|Vallabhacharya]]
''[[Shuddhadvaita]]'' (pure non-dualism) states that the entire universe is real and is subtly ''[[Brahman]]'' only in the form of ''[[Krishna]]''.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}} Vallabhacharya, the propounder of this philosophy, agreed with Advaita Vedanta's [[ontology]], but emphasized that ''prakriti'' (empirical world, body) is not separate from the ''Brahman'', but just another manifestation of the latter.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}} Everything, everyone, everywhere—soul and body, living and non-living, ''jiva'' and matter—is the eternal ''[[Krishna]]''.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479-481}} The way to ''Krishna'', in this school, is ''[[bhakti]]''.  Vallabha opposed renunciation of monistic ''sannyasa'' as ineffective and advocates the path of devotion (''bhakti'') rather than knowledge (''jnana''). The goal of ''bhakti'' is to turn away from ego, self-centered-ness and deception, and to turn towards the eternal ''Krishna'' in everything continually offering freedom from ''[[samsara]]''.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}}

===School propounding Dualism - Dvaita===
{{main article|Dvaita}}
[[File:Shri Madhvacharya.jpg|thumb|x184px|Madhvacharya]]

This school is based on the premise of dualism. ''Atman'' (soul) and ''Brahman'' (as ''Vishnu'') are understood as two completely different entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}; {{harvnb|Dehsen|1999|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Brahman'' is the creator of the universe, perfect in knowledge, perfect in knowing, perfect in its power, and distinct from souls, distinct from matter.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=353–354}} {{refn|group=note|The concept of ''Brahman'' in ''Dvaita'' Vedanta is so similar to the monotheistic eternal God, that  some early colonial–era ''[[Indologist]]s'' such as [[George Abraham Grierson]] suggested Madhva was influenced by early [[Christian]]s who migrated to India, {{sfn|Kulandran|Hendrik|2004|pp=177–179}} but later scholarship has rejected this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Sarma|2000|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In ''Dvaita'' Vedanta, an individual soul must feel attraction, love, attachment and complete devotional surrender to ''Vishnu'' for salvation, and it is only His grace that leads to redemption and salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1962|pp=417–424}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|1960|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madhva believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned, a view not found in ''Advaita'' and ''Vishishtadvaita'' Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1960|pp=374–375}}; {{harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=361–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Vishishtadvaita'' Vedanta asserted "qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls", Madhva asserted both "qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls".{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=374}}

===Schools propounding Bhedabheda===
{{main article|Bhedabheda}}''[[Bhedabheda|Bhedābheda]]'' means "difference and non–difference" and is more a tradition than a school of Vedanta. The schools of this tradition emphasize that the individual self (''Jīvatman'') is both different and not different from ''Brahman''.{{sfn|Nicholson}} Notable figures in this school are Bhartriprapancha, [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhāskara]] (8th–9th century), Ramanuja's teacher Yādavaprakāśa, [[Nimbārka]] (13th century) who founded the [[Dvaitadvaita]] school, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya]] (1486–1534) who founded the [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] school and [[Vijnanabhiksu|Vijñānabhikṣu]] (16th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson}}; {{harvnb|Sivananda|1993|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|group=note|According to Nakamura and Dasgupta, the ''Brahmasutras'' reflect a ''[[Bhedabheda]]'' point of view,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}} the most influential tradition of Vedanta before Shankara. Numerous Indologists, including Surendranath Dasgupta, Paul hacker, Hajime Nakamura, and Mysore Hiriyanna, have described ''Bhedabheda'' as the most influential school of Vedanta before Shankara.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=26}}}}

====Upadhika====
Bhaskara, in postulating ''Upadhika'', considers both identity and difference to be equally real. As the causal principle, ''Brahman'' is considered non-dual and formless pure being and intelligence.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=340}} The same ''Brahman'', manifest as events, becomes the world of plurality. ''{{IAST|Jīva}}'' is ''Brahman'' limited by the mind. Matter and its limitations are considered real, not a manifestation of ignorance. Bhaskara advocated ''bhakti'' as ''dhyana'' (meditation) directed toward the transcendental ''Brahman''. He refuted the idea of ''Maya'' and denied the possibility of liberation in bodily existence.{{sfn|Mohanty|Wharton|2011}}

====Dvaitādvaita====
[[File:Nimbarkacharya's holy icon at the Ukhra Nimbarka Peeth Mahanta Asthal(West Bengal).JPG|thumb|right|x115px|Nimbarkacharya's icon at Ukhra, West Bengal]]
{{main article|Dvaitadvaita}}[[Nimbarka|Nimbārka]] propounded ''[[Dvaitādvaita]]'', based upon [[Bhedabheda|Bhedābheda]] as was taught by [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhāskara]]. ''Brahman'' (God), souls ''(chit)'' and matter or the universe ''(achit)'' are considered as three equally real and co-eternal realities. ''Brahman'' is the controller ''(niyantr)'', the soul is the enjoyer ''(bhoktr)'', and the material universe is the object enjoyed ''(bhogya)''. The Brahman is ''[[Krishna]]'', the ultimate cause who is omniscient, omnipotent, all-pervading Being. He is the [[efficient cause]] of the universe because, as Lord of ''Karma'' and internal ruler of souls, He brings about creation so that the souls can reap the consequences of their ''karma''. God is considered to be the [[material cause]] of the universe because creation was a manifestation of His powers of soul ''(chit)'' and matter ''(achit)''; creation is a transformation ''(parinama)'' of God's powers. He can be realized only through a constant effort to merge oneself with His nature through meditation and devotion. {{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=376}}

====Achintya-Bheda-Abheda====
[[File:Chaitanya-Mahabrabhu-at-Jagannath.jpg|thumb|right|x195px|Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]
{{main article|Achintya Bhedabheda}}
[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] was the prime exponent of ''Achintya-Bheda-Abheda''.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=247}} In [[Sanskrit]] ''achintya'' means 'inconceivable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=407}}; {{harvnb|Gupta|2007|pp=47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Achintya-Bheda-Abheda'' represents the philosophy of "inconceivable difference in non-difference",{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=378–380}} in relation to the non-dual reality of ''Brahman''-''Atman'' which it calls (''[[Krishna]]''), ''svayam bhagavan''.{{sfn|Gupta|2016|pp=44–45}} The notion of "inconceivability" (''acintyatva'') is used to reconcile apparently contradictory notions in Upanishadic teachings. This school asserts that ''Krishna'' is ''[[Bhagavan]]'' of the ''bhakti yogins'', the ''Brahman'' of the ''jnana yogins'', and has a divine potency that is inconceivable. He is all-pervading and thus in all parts of the universe (non-difference), yet he is inconceivably more (difference). This school is at the foundation of the ''[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]]'' religious tradition.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=378–380}}

== Vedanta philosophy ==

The important approaches followed by the most noted proponents of different schools of Vedanta are summarized below:
# To theorize that the soul (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' / ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'') and the physical universe (''[[Prakriti]]'') are both identical with and different from ''[[Brahman]]''. This view is held by Bhartriprapancha.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}
# To place non-dualistic ideas in the most important place, relegating dualistic ideas to an interim position. This approach is followed by Shankara.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michael Comans|1996|pp=49–71}}; {{harvnb|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–53}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2000| pp=224–228 with notes 8, 13 and 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To theorize that non-dualism is qualified by difference. This is Ramanuja's approach.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|p=346}}
# To emphasize dualism, discrediting and offering an alternative explanation of non-dualistic ideas. This is from Madhva.{{sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=368–374}}

Sivananda gives the following explanation:
{{quote|Madhva said, "Man is the servant of God," and established his Dvaita philosophy. Ramanuja said, "Man is a ray or spark of God," and established his Visishtadvaita philosophy. Sankara said, "Man is identical with Brahman or the Eternal Soul," and established his Kevala Advaita philosophy.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=217}}}}

===Common features===
Despite their differences, all schools of Vedanta share some common features:
# ''Brahman'' exists as the unchanging material cause and instrumental cause of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Das|1952}};  {{harvnb|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}; {{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|p=122}}; {{harvnb|Sheridan|1991|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''Upanishads'' are a reliable source of knowledge (''Sruti Śabda'' in [[Pramana]]);{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=34,66}} Vedanta is the pursuit of knowledge into the ''Brahman'' and the ''Ātman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2002|pp=34,66}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Belief in rebirth and the desirability of release from the cycle of rebirths, ''(mokşa)''.{{sfn|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}
# The self  (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' / ''[[Jiva|Jivātman]]'') is the agent of its own acts ([[karma]]) and the recipient of the consequences of these actions.{{sfn|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}
# Rejection of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] and conclusions of the other Vedic schools (Nyaya, Vaisheshika, [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], and, to some extent, the [[Purva Mimamsa]].){{sfn|Doniger|Stefon|2015}}

===Metaphysics===
Vedanta philosophies discuss three fundamental metaphysical categories and the relations between the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raju|1972|pp=176–177, 505–506}}; {{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}; {{harvnb|Fowler|2002|pp=49–59, 254, 269, 294–295, 345}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Ishvara]]'': the ultimate reality&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Das|1952}}; {{harvnb|Puligandla|1997|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brahman / Ishvara - Conceptions of the Supreme Reality ====
Shankara, in formulating Advaita, talks of two conceptions of ''Brahman'': the higher ''Brahman'' as undifferentiated Being, and a lower ''Brahman'' endowed with qualities as the creator of the universe.{{sfn|Chari|1988|pp=2,383}}
# ''Parā'' or Higher ''Brahman'':  the undifferentiated, absolute, infinite, transcendental, supra-relational Brahman beyond all thought and speech is defined as ''parā'' ''Brahman'', ''nirviśeṣa'' Brahman or ''nirguṇa'' Brahman and is the Absolute of metaphysics.
# ''Aparā'' or Lower ''Brahman'': the ''[[Brahman]]'' with qualities defined as ''aparā'' ''Brahman'' or ''saguṇa'' ''Brahman''. The ''saguṇa'' ''Brahman'' is endowed with attributes and represents the personal God of religion.

Ramanuja, in formulating Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, rejects ''nirguṇa''—that the undifferentiated Absolute is inconceivable—and adopts a theistic interpretation of the ''Upanishads'', accepts ''Brahman'' as ''Ishvara'', the personal God who is the seat of all auspicious attributes, as the One reality. The God of Vishishtadvaita is accessible to the devotee, yet remains the Absolute, with differentiated attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2002|p=317}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=2,383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhva, in expounding Dvaita philosophy, maintains that ''[[Vishnu]]'' is the supreme God, thus identifying the ''Brahman'', or absolute reality, of the ''Upanishads'' with a personal god, as Ramanuja had done before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britannica|2016}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nimbarka, in his dvaitadvata philosophy, accepted the ''Brahman'' both as ''nirguṇa'' and as ''saguṇa''. Vallabha, in his shuddhadvaita philosophy, not only accepts the triple ontological essence of the ''Brahman'', but also His manifestation as personal God (''Ishvara''), as matter and as individual souls.{{sfn|Vitsaxis|2009|pp=100–101}}

==== Relation between Brahman and Jiva / Atman ====
The schools of Vedanta differ in their conception of the relation they see between ''Ātman'' / ''Jivātman'' and ''Brahman'' / ''Ishvara'':{{sfn|Raju|1972|p=177}}
* According to Advaita Vedanta, ''Ātman'' is identical with ''Brahman'' and there is no difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raju|1972|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Vishishtadvaita, ''Jīvātman'' is different from ''Ishvara'', though eternally connected with Him as His mode.{{sfn|Ādidevānanda|2014|pp=9-10}} The oneness of the Supreme Reality is understood in the sense of an organic unity (''vishistaikya''). ''Brahman'' / ''Ishvara'' alone, as organically related to all ''Jīvātman'' and the material universe is the one Ultimate Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Betty|2010|pp=215–224}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=2,383}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Dvaita, the ''Jīvātman'' is totally and always different from ''Brahman'' / ''Ishvara''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Craig|2000|pp=517–18}}; {{harvnb|Stoker|2011}}; {{harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=361–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Shuddhadvaita (pure monism), the ''Jīvātman'' and ''Brahman'' are identical; both, along with the changing empirically-observed universe being [[Krishna]].{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=479–481}}

===Epistemology===
{{main article|Pramana}}
[[File:3 Pramana Epistemology Dualistic Dvaita Vishishtadvaita Hindu schools.svg|thumb|180px|Epistemology in Dvaita and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. Advaita and some other Vedanta schools recognize six epistemic means.]]

==== Pramana ====
''Pramāṇa'' ([[Sanskrit]]: प्रमाण) literally means "proof", "that which is the means of valid knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lochtefeld|2000|pp=520–521}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=73–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to [[epistemology]] in Indian philosophies, and encompasses the study of reliable and valid means by which human beings gain accurate, true knowledge.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2000|pp=520–521}} The focus of [[Pramana]] is the manner in which correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows or does not know, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2002|pp=25–26}}; {{harvnb|Bhawuk|2011|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient and medieval Indian texts identify six{{Refn|group=note|A few Indian scholars such as Vedvyasa discuss ten, Krtakoti discusses eight, but six is most widely accepted; see {{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|pp=149–150}}}} ''pramanas'' as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bhawuk|2011|p=172}}; {{harvnb|Chari|1988|pp=73–76}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception)
# ''Anumāṇa'' (inference)
# ''[[Upamāṇa]]'' (comparison and analogy)
# ''Arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances)
# ''Anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof)
# ''[[Śabda]]'' (scriptural testimony/ verbal testimony of past or present reliable experts).
The different schools of Vedanta have historically disagreed as to which of the six are epistemologically valid. For example, while Advaita Vedanta accepts all six ''pramanas'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimes|2006|p=238}}; {{harvnb|Puligandla|1997|p=228}}; {{harvnb|Clayton|2006|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita accept only three ''pramanas'' (perception, inference and testimony).{{sfn|Grimes|2006|p=238}}

Advaita considers ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception) as the most reliable source of knowledge, and ''[[Śabda]]'', the scriptural evidence, is considered secondary except for matters related to Brahman, where it is the only evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Indich|1995|pp=65}}; {{harvnb|Gupta|1995|pp=137–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|Anantanand {{harvtxt|Rambachan|1991|pp=xii–xiii}} states, "According to these [widely represented contemporary] studies, Shankara only accorded a provisional validity to the knowledge gained by inquiry into the words of the [[Śruti]] (Vedas) and did not see the latter as the unique source (''pramana'') of ''Brahmajnana''. The affirmations of the Śruti, it is argued, need to be verified and confirmed by the knowledge gained through direct experience (''anubhava'') and the authority of the Śruti, therefore, is only secondary." Sengaku {{harvtxt|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–47}} concurs, adding Shankara maintained the need for objectivity in the process of gaining knowledge (''vastutantra''), and considered subjective opinions (''purushatantra'') and injunctions in Śruti (''codanatantra'') as secondary. Mayeda cites Shankara's explicit statements emphasizing epistemology (''pramana–janya'') in section 1.18.133 of Upadesasahasri and section 1.1.4 of Brahmasutra–bhasya.}} In Vishistadvaita and Dvaita, ''[[Śabda]]'', the scriptural testimony, is considered the most authentic means of knowledge instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2002|p=304}}; {{harvnb|Puligandla|1997|pp=208–211, 237–239}}; {{harvnb|Sharma|2000|pp=147–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Theories of cause and effect ====
All schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of ''Satkāryavāda'',{{sfn|Nicholson}} which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are two different views on the status of the "effect", that is, the world. Most schools of Vedanta, as well as Samkhya, support ''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Parinamavada]]'', the idea that the world is a real transformation (''parinama'') of Brahman.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} According to {{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}, "the ''Brahma Sutras'' espouse the realist Parinamavada position, which appears to have been the view most common among early Vedantins". In contrast to Badarayana, Adi Shankara and Advaita Vedantists hold a different view, ''[[Vivartavada]]'', which says that the effect, the world, is merely an unreal (''vivarta'') transformation of its cause, Brahman.{{Refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} writes of Advaita Vedantin position of cause and effect - Although Brahman seems to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are essentially unreal, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts.}}

==Influence==

=== Hindu traditions ===
Vedanta, adopting ideas from other [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox (''āstika'')]] schools, became the most prominent school of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hiriyanna|1948|pp=19,21–25,150–152}}; {{harvnb|Clooney|2000|pp=96–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vedanta traditions led to the development of many traditions in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooks|1990|pp=20–22,77–79}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=231,232,238}}; {{harvnb|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Vaishnavism]] of south and southeastern India is based on Ramanuja's ''Vishishtadvaita'' Vedanta.{{Sfn|Carman|Narayanan|1989|pp=3–4}} Ramananda led to the ''Vaishnav Bhakti'' Movement in north, east, central and west India. This movement draws its philosophical and theistic basis from ''Vishishtadvaita''. A large number of devotional ''Vaishnavism'' traditions of east India, north India (particularly the Braj region), west and central India are based on various sub-schools of ''Bhedabheda'' Vedanta.{{sfn|Nicholson}} ''Advaita'' Vedanta influenced ''Krishna Vaishnavism'' in the northeastern state of [[Assam]].{{sfn|Neog|1980|pp=243–244}} The Madhva school of Vaishnavism found in coastal [[Karnataka]] is based on ''Dvaita'' Vedanta.{{sfn|Sharma|1960|pp=372–375}}

''[[Āgama (Hinduism)|Āgamas]]'', the classical literature of ''[[Shaivism]]'', though independent in origin, show Vedanta association and premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2003|pp=126–128}}; {{harvnb|Klostermaier|1984|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 92 ''Āgamas'', ten are (''[[dvaita]]'') texts, eighteen (''[[bhedabheda]]''), and sixty-four (''[[advaita]]'') texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2014|p=167 note 21}}; {{harvnb|Dyczkowski|1989|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Bhairava Shastras'' are monistic, ''Shiva Shastras'' are dualistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vasugupta|2012|pp=252, 259}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=162–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Isaeva|1995|pp=134–135}} finds the link between Gaudapada's ''Advaita'' Vedanta and ''[[Kashmir Shaivism]]'' evident and natural. [[Tirumular]], the Tamil ''Shaiva Siddhanta'' scholar, credited with creating "Vedanta–Siddhanta" (Advaita Vedanta and Shaiva Siddhanta synthesis), stated, "becoming ''Shiva'' is the goal of Vedanta and ''Siddhanta''; all other goals are secondary to it and are vain."{{sfn|Manninezhath|1993|pp=xv, 31}}

''[[Shaktism]]'', or traditions where a goddess is considered identical to ''[[Brahman]]'', has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of ''Advaita'' Vedanta and dualism premises of ''Samkhya–Yoga'' school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as ''Shaktadavaitavada'' (literally, the path of nondualistic ''Shakti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDaniel|2004|pp=89–91}}; {{harvnb|Brooks|1990|pp=35–39}}; {{harvnb|Mahony|1997|p=274 with note 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Vedanta===
{{Main article|Neo-Vedanta|Hindu nationalism|Hindu reform movements}}

Neo-Vedanta, variously called as "Hindu modernism", "neo-Hinduism", and "neo-Advaita", is a term that denotes some novel interpretations of [[Hinduism]] that developed in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1999|p=135}}; {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=258}}; {{harvnb|King|2002|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably as a reaction to the colonial British rule.{{sfn|King|1999|pp=187,135—142}} {{harvtxt|King|2002|pp=129–135}} writes that these notions accorded the Hindu nationalists an opportunity to attempt the construction of a nationalist ideology to help unite the Hindus to fight colonial oppression. Western [[Orientalism|orientalists]], in their search for its "essence", attempted to formulate a notion of "Hinduism" based on a single interpretation of Vedanta as a unified body of religious praxis.{{sfn|King|2002|p=118}} This was contra-factual as, historically, Hinduism and Vedanta had always accepted a diversity of traditions. {{harvtxt|King|1999|pp=133–136}} asserts that the neo-Vedantic theory of "overarching tolerance and acceptance" was used by the Hindu reformers, together with the ideas of [[Universalism in religion|Universalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], to challenge the polemic dogmatism of Judaeo-Christian-Islamic missionaries against the Hindus.

The neo-Vedantins argued that the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy were perspectives on a single truth, all valid and complementary to each other.{{Sfn|King|1999|p=137}}  {{harvtxt|Halbfass|2007|p=307}} sees these interpretations as incorporating western ideas{{sfn|Halbfass|2007|p=307}} into traditional systems, especially [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} It is the modern form of Advaita Vedanta, states {{harvtxt|King|1999|p=135}}, the neo-Vedantists subsumed the Buddhist philosophies as part of the Vedanta tradition{{refn|group=note|Vivekananda, clarifies Richard King, stated, "I am not a Buddhist, as you have heard, and yet I am"; but thereafter Vivekananda explained that "he cannot accept the Buddhist rejection of a self, but nevertheless honors the Buddha's compassion and attitude towards others".{{sfn|King|1999|p=138}}}} and then argued that all the world religions are same "non-dualistic position as the philosophia perennis", ignoring the differences within and outside of Hinduism.{{sfn|King|1999|pp=133–136}} According to {{harvtxt|Gier|2000|p=140}}, neo-Vedanta is Advaita Vedanta which accepts universal realism:{{quote|Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Aurobindo have been labeled neo-Vedantists (the latter called it realistic Advaita), a view of Vedanta that rejects the Advaitins' idea that the world is illusory. As Aurobindo phrased it, philosophers need to move from 'universal illusionism' to 'universal realism', in the strict philosophical sense of assuming the world to be fully real.}}

A major proponent in the popularization of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Vedanta was [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|King|2002|pp=135–142}} who played a major role in the [[Hindu nationalism|revival of Hinduism]].{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} He was also instrumental in the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the West via the [[Vedanta Society]], the international arm of the [[Ramakrishna Order]].{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}

==== Criticism of Neo-Vedanta label ====
{{harvtxt|Nicholson|2010|p=2}} writes that the attempts at integration which came to be known as neo-Vedanta were evident as early as between the 12th and the 16th century−  {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy.{{refn|group=note|The tendency of "a blurring of philosophical distinctions" has also been noted by Burley.{{sfn|Burley|2007|p=34}} Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus,{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=24–33}} and a process of "mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other",{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=27}} which started well before 1800.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=26–27}}}}}}[[Bimal Krishna Matilal|Matilal]] criticizes Neo-Hinduism as an oddity developed by West-inspired Western Indologists and attributes it to the flawed Western perception of Hinduism in modern India. In his scathing criticism of this school of reasoning, {{harvtxt|Matilal|2002|pp=403–404}} says:{{quote|The so-called 'traditional' outlook is in fact a construction. Indian history shows that the tradition itself was self-conscious and critical of itself, sometimes overtly and sometimes covertly. It was never free from internal tensions due to the inequalities that persisted in a hierarchical society, nor was it without confrontation and challenge throughout its history. Hence Gandhi, Vivekananda and Tagore were not simply 'transplants from Western culture, products arising solely from confrontation with the west.

...It is rather odd that, although the early Indologists' romantic dream of discovering a pure (and probably primitive, according to some) form of Hinduism (or Buddhism as the case may be) now stands discredited in many quarters; concepts like neo-Hinduism are still bandied about as substantial ideas or faultless explanation tools by the Western 'analytic' historians as well as the West-inspired historians of India.}}

=== Influence on Western thinkers ===
An exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia since the late 18th century as a result of colonization of parts of Asia by Western powers. This also influenced western religiosity. The first translation of ''Upanishads'', published in two parts in 1801 and 1802, significantly influenced [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who called them the consolation of his life.{{sfn|Renard|2010|pp=177—178}} He drew explicit parallels between his philosophy, as set out in ''The World as Will and Representation'',&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. ''The World as Will and Representation''. Translated from the German by EFJ Payne. Dover Publications, vol. 1, chap. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that of the Vedanta philosophy as described in the work of Sir William Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Sir William. ''On the Philosophy of the Asiatics''. Sir William Jones. Asiatic Researches, vol. 4, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}} Influenced by Śaṅkara's concepts of ''Brahman'' (God) and ''māyā'' (illusion), [[Lucian Blaga]] often used the concepts ''marele anonim'' (the Great Anonymous) and ''cenzura transcendentă'' (the transcendental censorship) in his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2007), ''Marele Anonim şi cenzura transcendentă la Blaga. Brahman şi māyā la Śaṅkara'', in ''Caiete critice'' 6–7 (236–237), Bucharest, ISSN|1220-6350, pp. 75–83.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
According to {{harvtxt|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}, the Vedanta school has had a historic and central influence on Hinduism:
{{Quote|The prevalence of Vedanta thought is found not only in philosophical writings but also in various forms of ([[Hindu]]) literature, such as the epics, lyric poetry, drama and so forth. ...the Hindu religious sects, the common faith of the Indian populace, looked to Vedanta philosophy for the theoretical foundations for their theology. The influence of Vedanta is prominent in the sacred literatures of Hinduism, such as the various Puranas, Samhitas, Agamas and Tantras...{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}}}

[[Frithjof Schuon]] summarizes the influence of Vedanta on Hinduism as follows:
{{Quote|The Vedanta contained in the Upanishads, then formulated in the ''Brahma Sutra'', and finally commented and explained by Shankara, is an invaluable key for discovering the deepest meaning of all the religious doctrines and for realizing that the ''[[Sanatana Dharma]]'' secretly penetrates all the forms of traditional spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Witz|1998|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Schuon|1975|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{harvtxt|Flood|1996|pp=231–232, 238}} states,
{{Quote|..the most influential school of theology in India has been Vedanta, exerting enormous influence on all religious traditions and becoming the central ideology of the Hindu renaissance in the nineteenth century. It has become the philosophical paradigm of Hinduism "par excellence".}}

==Similarities with Spinoza's philosophy==
German Sanskritist [[Theodore Goldstücker]] was among the early scholars to notice similarities between the religious conceptions of the Vedanta and those of the Dutch Jewish philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]], writing that Spinoza's thought was
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines [...] comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Goldstucker, ''Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker'', W. H. Allen, 1879. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Max Müller]] noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying,
{{quote|The Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'."&lt;ref&gt;Three Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy. F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay,
{{quote|sign=|source=|As to Spinoza's Deity—''natura naturans''—conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity—as ''natura naturata'' or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct outflowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple.&lt;ref&gt;H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings, Volume 13, pages 308-310. Quest Books&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3702">'''Wenceslao Díaz Gallegos''' (1834–1895) was a Chilean [[scientist]] and medical [[surgeon]], widely considered as one of the fathers of [[sanitation]] in the country, trainer of generations of medical professionals and first-time introducer of medical devices such as the [[thermometer]] and the [[hypodermic syringe]] in [[Chile]].

==Biography==

He was born in Hacienda Limache, near [[San Fernando, Chile|San Fernando]], on February 21, 1834. Studied at Colegio Taforó in Santiago and later finishing high school education at the [[Instituto Nacional]].

Díaz was graduated as a medical surgeon in 1859, at the [[Universidad de Chile]] School of Medicine, when it was located on the building in the intersection of San Francisco and Las Delicias, the current [[Alameda (Santiago)|Libertador General Bernardo O’Higgins Avenue]]. Two years later, he graduated as a Bachelor in Physical Sciences and Mathematics at the same University. He studied many diverse disciplines such as medicine, archeology, geology, seismology, climatology, ethnography and philosophy, and specialized in [[health geography]], considered a prerequisite to specialization in parasitology and tropical diseases. His specialization allowed him to lead the sanitary commission to help the victims of the [[1861 Mendoza earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museomedicina.cl/home/index.php/historia-de-la-medicina/111-wenceslao-diaz-1834-1895.html|title=Díaz, Wenceslao (1834- 1895)|first=|last=dreyer|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 he was appointed head of the chair of internal medicine at the Universidad de Chile School of Medicine. From that position he pushed the introduction of modern medical instruments like the [[thermometer]] and the [[hypodermic syringe]], which was used to administer morphine, atropine and cocaine in the treatment of patients. Both had never been used before in the country.

Between 1877 and 1880 he was dean of the Faculty of Medicine, where he worked on the design of a new building for the faculty, but he had to leave the project after the outbreak of the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879-1883).

During the conflict he took over as Director of the Army Health Service, where he also innovated in hospital systems. After the war, he was one of the leaders in controlling the [[1881–96 cholera pandemic|Asian Cholera epidemic]] that affected Chile in 1887. He described the main characteristics and consequences of the disease in the medical report “Memory of the Cholera Health Service Directive Commission 1887-1888”.

He was a founding member of the Medical Society of Santiago (1869) and one of the editors of the first issue of its journal, the Revista Médica de Chile (1872). He was also a member of the Society of Pharmacy of Chile, the Surgical Medical Society, the Society of Archeology of Santiago and physician of the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Santiago.

Díaz also stood out as a great connoisseur of the Greek, Latin and Spanish classics. Also a philologist and linguist, he possessed notions of Greek, Latin and other languages. He also studied the native Latin American languages, especially the [[Mapuche]], [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymará]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealog.cl/Apellidos/Diaz/#DiazGallegos,Wenceslao|title=Familia Díaz - www.genealog.cl|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What the Bleep Do We Know!?''''' (stylized as '''''What tнē #$*! D̄ө ωΣ (k)πow!?''''' and '''''What the #$*! Do We Know!?''''', with ''[[Bleep censor|Bleep]]'' being a pronounceable placeholder for a [[grawlix]]) is a 2004 American film that combines [[documentary film|documentary]]-style interviews, [[computer graphics|computer-animated graphics]], and a narrative that posits a [[spirituality|spiritual]] connection between [[quantum physics]] and [[consciousness]]. The plot follows the fictional story of a photographer as she encounters emotional and [[Existential crisis|existential]] obstacles in her life and begins to consider the idea that individual and group consciousness can influence the [[Nature|material world]]. Her experiences are offered by the filmmakers to illustrate the film's thesis about quantum physics and consciousness. The 2004 theatrical release was succeeded by a substantially changed, extended home media version in 2006.

''Bleep'' was conceived and its production funded by [[William Arntz]], who co-directed the film along with Betsy Chasse and Mark Vicente; all three were students of [[Ramtha's School of Enlightenment]]. A moderately low-budget [[independent film]], it was promoted using [[viral marketing]] methods and opened in art-house theaters in the western United States, winning several independent film awards before being picked up by a major distributor and eventually [[gross (economics)|grossing]] over $10 million.

The film  has been described as an example of [[quantum mysticism]], and has been criticized for both misrepresenting [[science]] and containing [[pseudoscience]]. While many of its interviewees and subjects are professional scientists in the fields of physics, chemistry, and engineering, several have noted that the film [[Fallacy of quoting out of context|quotes them out of context]].&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
Filmed in [[Portland, Oregon]], ''What the Bleep Do We Know!?'' presents a viewpoint of the [[physical universe]] and human life within it, with connections to [[neuroscience]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]]. Some ideas discussed in the film are:
* That the universe is best seen as constructed from thoughts and ideas rather than from [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]].
* That "empty space" is not empty.
* That matter is not solid, and electrons are able to pop in and out of existence without it being known where they disappear to.
* That beliefs about who one is and what is real are a direct cause of oneself and of one's own realities.
* That [[peptide]]s produced by the brain can cause a bodily reaction to emotion.

In the narrative segments of the movie, [[Marlee Matlin]] portrays Amanda, a photographer who plays the role of [[everyman|everywoman]] as she experiences her life from startlingly new and different perspectives.

In the documentary segments of the film, interviewees discuss the roots and meaning of Amanda's experiences. The comments focus primarily on a single theme: "We create our own reality." The director, William Arntz, has described ''What the Bleep'' as a movie for the "[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[leftism|left]]".&lt;ref name="beliefnet"/&gt;

==Cast==

* [[Elaine Hendrix]] as Jennifer
* [[Barry Newman]] as Frank
* [[Robert Bailey, Jr.]] as Reggie
* [[John Ross Bowie]] as Elliot
* [[Armin Shimerman]] as Man

==Production==
Work was split between Toronto-based Mr. X Inc., Lost Boys Studios in Vancouver, and Atomic Visual Effects in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;ref name="VE1"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cinefex article detailing the visual effects for the film | url=http://www.cinefex.com/weeklyupdate/mailings/40_10192004/web.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804000747/http://www.cinefex.com/weeklyupdate/mailings/40_10192004/web.html | archivedate=2007-08-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual-effects team, led by [[Evan Jacobs]], worked closely with the other film-makers to create visual metaphors that would capture the essence of the film's technical subjects with attention to aesthetic detail.&lt;ref name="VE1"/&gt;

==Promotion==
Lacking the funding and resources of the typical Hollywood film, the filmmakers relied on "[[guerrilla marketing]]" first to get the film into theaters, and then to attract audiences. This has led to accusations, both formal and informal, directed towards the film's proponents, of spamming online message boards and forums with many thinly veiled promotional posts. Initially, the film was released in only two theaters: one in [[Yelm, Washington]] (the home of the producers, which is also the home of [[Ramtha]]), and the other the [[The Bagdad Theater and Pub|Bagdad Theater]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], where it was filmed. Within several weeks, the film had appeared in a dozen or more theaters (mostly in the western United States), and within six months it had made its way into 200 theaters across the US.&lt;ref name="PW" /&gt;

According to the makers of the film, "Bleep" is an [[expurgation]] of "[[fuck]]". William Arntz has referred to the film as "WTFDWK" in a message to the film's street team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527020042/http://www.ideascoaching.co.uk/25.html|url=http://www.ideascoaching.co.uk/25.html|title=Our power is in our ability to decide - Can you?|website=Ideas Coaching|accessdate=20 August 2007|archivedate=27 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]], a [[New Age]] research organization that "explores phenomena that do not necessarily fit conventional scientific models", has supported ''What the Bleep Do We Know!?'' and published a study guide.&lt;ref&gt;[[Institute of Noetic Sciences]]. [http://media.noetic.org/uploads/files/Bleep_Study_Guide.pdf What the Bleep Do We Know!? Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
According to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', the movie was one of the sleeper hits of 2004, as "word-of-mouth and strategic marketing kept it in theaters for an entire year." The article states that the domestic gross exceeded $10 million, described as not bad for a low-budget documentary, and that the DVD release attained even more significant success with over a million units shipped in the first six months following its release in March 2005.&lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6253627.html  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811110921/http://www1.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6253627.html|archivedate=11 August 2007|title=New Age: What the Bleep? Categories conflate, confound, connect |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |author=Ron Hogan |date=2005-09-05|accessdate=2007-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign gross added another $5 million for a worldwide gross of nearly $16 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=whatthe.htm Box office results] from Box Office Mojo retrieved August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Publishers Weekly'' article, publicist Linda Rienecker of ''New Page Books'' says that she sees the film's success as part of a wider phenomenon, stating "A large part of the population is seeking spiritual connections, and they have the whole world to choose from now".&lt;ref name="PW" /&gt; Author Barrie Dolnick adds that "people don't want to learn how to do one thing. They'll take a little bit of Buddhism, a little bit of veganism, a little bit of astrology... They're coming into the marketplace hungry for direction, but they don't want some person who claims to have all the answers. They want suggestions, not formulas."&lt;ref name="PW" /&gt; The same article quotes Bill Pfau, Advertising Manager of [[Inner Traditions]], as saying "More and more ideas from the New Age community have become accepted into the mainstream."

Film critics offered mixed reviews as seen on the movie review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], where it was classified as "Rotten", with an average score of 4.6/10 based on 77 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/what_the__do_we_know/ What the Bleep Do We Know? Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the movie, [[Dave Kehr]] of the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' described the "transition from quantum mechanics to [[cognitive therapy]]" as "plausible", but stated also that "the subsequent leap—from cognitive therapy into large, hazy spiritual beliefs—isn't as effectively executed. Suddenly people who were talking about subatomic particles are alluding to alternate universes and cosmic forces, all of which can be harnessed in the interest of making Ms. Matlin's character feel better about her thighs."&lt;ref name="NYTKEHR"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/10/movies/10BLEE.html |title=A Lesson in Harnessing Good Vibes |accessdate=2008-01-06 |last=Kehr |first=Dave |date=2004-09-10 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Age community reaction===
''What the Bleep Do We Know!?'' has been described as "a kind of [[New Age]] answer to ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' and other films that adhere to traditional religious teachings."&lt;ref name="beliefnet"&gt;Benedicta Cipolla  "[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/154/story_15436_1.html 'Bleep' Film Challenges Traditional Religion, Attracts Following]", beliefnet.com. Accessed 2007-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt; It offers alternative spirituality views characteristic of New Age philosophy, including critiques of the competing claims of stewardship among traditional religions [viz., institutional Judaism, Christianity, and Islam] of universally recognized and accepted moral values.&lt;ref name="FWST"&gt;{{cite news | title = 'What the #$*!'makes 'Bleep'so popular | date = 2005-01-22 | work = [[Fort Worth Star Telegram]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic reaction===
Scientists who have reviewed ''What the Bleep Do We Know!?'' have described distinct assertions made in the film as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Physics-Today" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boggle" /&gt; [[Lisa Randall]] refers to the film as "the bane of scientists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Lisa|title=Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World|publisher=Ecco|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-172372-8|page=10|edition=1st|title-link=Knocking on Heaven's Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World|date=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the assertions in the film that have been challenged are that [[water molecule]]s can be influenced by thought (as popularized by [[Masaru Emoto]]), that meditation can reduce violent crime rates,&lt;ref name="ACS" /&gt; and that [[quantum physics]] implies that "[[consciousness]] is the [[ground of all being]]."  The film was also discussed in a letter published in ''[[Physics Today]]'' that challenges how physics is taught, saying teaching fails to "expose the mysteries physics has encountered [and] reveal the limits of our understanding". In the letter, the authors write: "the movie illustrates the uncertainty principle with a bouncing basketball being in several places at once. There's nothing wrong with that. It's recognized as pedagogical exaggeration. But the movie gradually moves to quantum 'insights' that lead a woman to toss away her antidepressant medication, to the quantum channeling of Ramtha, the 35,000-year-old Lemurian warrior, and on to even greater nonsense." It went on to say that "Most laypeople cannot tell where the quantum physics ends and the quantum nonsense begins, and many are susceptible to being misguided," and that "a physics student may be unable to convincingly confront unjustified extrapolations of quantum mechanics," a shortcoming which the authors attribute to the current teaching of quantum mechanics, in which "we tacitly deny the mysteries physics has encountered".&lt;ref name="Physics-Today"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kuttner |first=Fred |author2=Rosenblum, Bruce  |title=Teaching physics mysteries versus pseudoscience |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume=59 |issue=11 |page=14 |date=November 2006 |url=http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_59/iss_11/14_1.shtml |doi=10.1063/1.2435631|bibcode = 2006PhT....59k..14K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] stated that "the authors seem undecided whether their theme is quantum theory or consciousness. Both are indeed mysterious, and their genuine mystery needs none of the hype with which this film relentlessly and noisily belabours us", concluding that the film is "tosh". Professor Clive Greated wrote that "thinking on neurology and addiction are covered in some detail but, unfortunately, early references in the film to quantum physics are not followed through, leading to a confused message". Despite his caveats, he recommends that people see the movie, stating: "I hope it develops into a cult movie in the UK as it has in the US. Science and engineering are important for our future, and anything that engages the public can only be a good thing." [[Simon Singh]] called it pseudoscience and said the suggestion "that if observing water changes its molecular structure, and if we are 90% water, then by observing ourselves we can change at a fundamental level via the laws of quantum physics" was "ridiculous balderdash". According to [[João Magueijo]], professor in theoretical physics at Imperial College, the film deliberately misquotes science.&lt;ref name="boggle"&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1484925,00.html "The minds boggle".] ''[[Guardian Unlimited|The Guardian Unlimited]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Chemical Society]]'s review criticizes the film as a "pseudoscientific docudrama", saying "Among the more outlandish assertions are that people can travel backward in time, and that matter is actually thought."&lt;ref name="ACS"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Elizabeth |authorlink=Elizabeth Wilson |title=What the Bleep Do We Know?! |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |date=2005-01-13 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/reelscience/reviews/whatthe_bleep/ |accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernie Hobbs, a science writer with ABC Science Online, explains why the movie is incorrect about quantum physics and reality: "The [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] of quantum physics isn't about people or reality. It comes from the Heisenberg [[Uncertainty Principle]], and it's about the limitations of trying to measure the position and momentum of subatomic particles... this only applies to sub-atomic particles—a rock doesn't need you to bump into it to exist. It's there. The sub-atomic particles that make up the atoms that make up the rock are there too." Hobbs also discusses Hagelin's experiment with Transcendental Meditation and the Washington DC rate of violent crime, saying that "the number of murders actually went up". Hobbs further disputed the film's use of the [[ten percent of the brain myth]].&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/features/bleep/ What the Bleep are they On About?!] ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Albert]], a philosopher of physics who appears in the film, has accused the filmmakers of selectively editing his interview to make it appear that he endorses the film's thesis that quantum mechanics is linked with consciousness. He says he is "profoundly unsympathetic to attempts at linking quantum mechanics with consciousness".&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; These issues relate to the so-called [[Mind-body problem|Quantum mind-body problem]].

In the film, during a discussion of the influence of experience on perception, [[Candace Pert]] notes a story, which she says she believes is true, of Native Americans being unable to see [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s ships because they were outside their experience. According to an article in ''[[Fortean Times]]'' by David Hambling, the origins of this story likely involved the voyages of Captain [[James Cook]], not Columbus, and an account related by [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] which said Cook's ships were "...complex and unfamiliar as to defy the natives' understanding". Hambling says it is likely that both the Hughes account and the story told by Pert were exaggerations of the records left by Captain Cook and the botanist [[Joseph Banks]].

[[Skepticism|Skeptic]] [[James Randi]] described the film as "a fantasy [[docudrama]]" and "[a] rampant example of abuse by charlatans and cults".&lt;ref name="Pigasus" /&gt; Eric Scerri in a review for  [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] dismisses it as "a hodgepodge of all kinds of crackpot nonsense," where "science [is] distorted and sensationalized".&lt;ref name="csicop"&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/what_the_do_they_know Review] by Eric Scerri of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry&lt;/ref&gt; A [[BBC]] reviewer described it as "a documentary aimed at the totally gullible".&lt;ref name="BBC-movies"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2005/04/14/what_the_bleep_do_we_know_2005_review.shtml Review] at BBC Movies&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Margaret Wertheim]], "History abounds with religious enthusiasts who have read spiritual portent into the arrangement of the planets, the vacuum of space, electromagnetic waves and the big bang. But no scientific discovery has proved so ripe for spiritual projection as the theories of quantum physics, replete with their quixotic qualities of uncertainty, simultaneity and parallelism."  Wertheim continues that the movie "abandons itself entirely to the ecstasies of [[quantum mysticism]], finding in this aleatory description of nature the key to spiritual transformation. As one of the film's characters gushes early in the proceedings, 'The moment we acknowledge the quantum self, we say that somebody has become enlightened'.  A moment in which 'the mathematical formalisms of quantum mechanics [...] are stripped of all empirical content and reduced to a set of syrupy [[patent medicine|nostrums]]'."&lt;ref name=laweekly&gt;Margaret Wertheim, {{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/columns/quark-soup/quantum-mysticism/9195/ |title=Quantum Mysticism |accessdate=2008-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316190743/http://www.laweekly.com/columns/quark-soup/quantum-mysticism/9195/ |archivedate=March 16, 2008 |df= }}, ''LA Weekly,'' June 10, 2004.

==Book adaptation and sequel film==
In mid-2005, the filmmakers worked with HCI Books to expand on the film's themes in a book titled ''What the Bleep Do We Know!?—Discovering the Endless Possibilities of Your Everyday Reality''. HCI president Peter Vegso stated that in regard to this book, "What the Bleep is the quantum leap in the New Age world," and "by marrying science and spirituality, it is the foundation of future thought."&lt;ref name="PW" /&gt;

On August 1, 2006 ''What the Bleep! Down the Rabbit Hole - Quantum Edition'' multi-disc DVD set was released, containing two extended versions of ''What the Bleep Do We Know!?,'' with over 15 hours of material on three double-sided DVDs.
