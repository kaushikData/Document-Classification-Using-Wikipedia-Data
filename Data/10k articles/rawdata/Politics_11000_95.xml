{{nihongo|'''''An Investigation of Global Policy with the [[Yamato people|Yamato Race]] as Nucleus'''''|大和民族を中核とする世界政策の検討,|Yamato Minzoku wo Chūkaku to suru Sekai Seisaku no Kentō}} was a secret Japanese government report created by the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]]'s Population Problems Research Center, and completed on July 1, 1943.

The document, comprising six volumes totaling 3,127 pages, deals with [[race theory]] in general, and the rationale behind policies adopted by wartime Japan towards other races, while also providing a vision of [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Asia]] under Japanese control.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title= Ethnic Engineering: Scientific Racism and Public Opinion Surveys in Midcentury Japan| last=Morris-Suzuki| first= Tessa | publisher=Duke University Press| location= east asia cultures critique - Volume 8, Number 2 | year= Fall 2000| pages=499–529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document was written in an academic style, surveying [[Western philosophy]] on race from the writings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to modern German social scientists, such as [[Karl Haushofer]]. A connection between [[racism]], [[nationalism]] and [[imperialism]] was also claimed, with the conclusion, drawing by citing both British and German sources, that [[Japanese expansionism|overseas expansionism]] was essential not only for military and economic security, but for preserving racial consciousness. Concerns pertaining to the [[cultural assimilation]] of second and third generation immigrants into foreign cultures were also mentioned.&lt;ref name="Martel 2004 245-247"&gt;{{citation| title=The World War Two Reader| last=Martel| first=Gordon| publisher=Routledge| location=New York| year=2004| pages=245–247| isbn=0-415-22403-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The document was classified, had a print run of only a hundred copies, had little effect on the war, and was forgotten until 1981, when portions were discovered in a [[used bookstore]] in Japan, and subsequently publicized by being used as source material for a chapter in historian [[John W. Dower]]’s book ''War Without Mercy: Race and Power in the Pacific War''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=War Without Mercy| last=Dower| first=John W.| publisher=Pantheon Books| location=New York| year=1986| pages=262–290|isbn =0-394-50030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the Ministry of Health and Welfare re-issued the full 6 volume version along with another two volumes entitled ''The Influence of War upon Population'' as a reference work for historians.

==Impact==
Although external [[Propaganda in Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II|Japanese propaganda during World War II]] emphasized [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asianist]] and anti-colonial themes, domestic propaganda always took Japanese superiority over other Asians for granted. However, Japan never had an overarching racial theory for Asia until well into the 1930s&lt;ref name="Dower2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ways of Forgetting, Ways of Remembering: Japan in the Modern World|first=John W.|last=Dower|publisher=The New Press|year=2012|pages=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;—following the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]], military planners decided that they should raise Japanese racial consciousness in order to forestall the potential assimilation of [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese colonists]].&lt;ref name="Dower2"/&gt;

Since the document was written by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and not by the military or foreign policy establishment, it is unclear what type of political impact it would have had.

==Themes==

===Colonization and living space===
Some statements in the document coincide with the then-publicly espoused concept of [[Yamato people]]; however, much of the work borrowed heavily from [[Nazi Party|German National Socialist]] [[Nazism and race|racial]], political and economic theories, including mention of the "[[Jewish question]]" and inclusion of racist [[anti-Semitism|anti-Jewish]] political cartoons, although [[Japan]] had a rather negligible and largely overlooked Jewish minority. The term "[[Blood and Soil]]" was frequently used, though usually in quotes, as if to indicate its alien origin.&lt;ref name="Dower"&gt;Dower (1986), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors rationalized of Japanese colonization of most of the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] including [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], with projected populations by the 1950s, as "securing the living space of the Yamato race", a very clear echo of the Nazi concept of ''[[Lebensraum]]''.&lt;ref name="rhodes246"&gt;Anthony Rhodes, ''Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II'', p. 246, 1976, Chelsea House Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial supremacy===
However, where the document deviated from [[Nazi ideology]] was in its use of [[Confucianism]] and the metaphor of the patriarchical family. This metaphor, with the non-Japanese Asians serving as children of the Japanese,&lt;ref name="Dower2"/&gt; rationalized the "equitable inequality" of Japanese political, economic, and cultural dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Dower (1986), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as a family has harmony and reciprocity, but with a clear-cut hierarchy, the Japanese, as a purportedly [[racial superiority|racially superior people]], were destined to rule Asia "eternally" and become the supreme dominant leader of all humanity and ruler of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Dower (1986), p. 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "proper place" was used frequently throughout the document.&lt;ref name="Dower" /&gt;

The document left open whether Japan was destined eventually to become head of the global family of nations.&lt;ref name="Martel 2004 245-247" /&gt;

===Jinshu and Minzoku===
The document drew an explicit distinction between ''[[:wikt:jinshu|jinshu]]'' ([[:wikt:人種|人種]]) or ''Rasse'' (English: race), and {{Nihongo||民族|minzoku}} or ''Volk'' (English: people), describing a ''minzoku'' as "a natural and spiritual community bound by a common destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Dower (1986), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the authors went on to assert that blood mattered.&lt;ref&gt;Dower (1986), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;  It approved of Hitler's concern about finding the "Germanness" of his people.&lt;ref&gt;Dower (1986), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;  It made explicit calls, sometimes approaching Nazi attitudes, for [[Eugenics in Japan|eugenic improvements]], calling for the medical profession not to concentrate on the sick and weak, and for mental and physical training and selective marriages to improve the population.&lt;ref&gt;Dower (1986), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anarcho-syndicalism''' (also referred to as '''revolutionary syndicalism''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22753/anarchism/66524/Revolutionary-syndicalism Revolutionary syndicalism], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Anarchist schools of thought|theory of anarchism]] that views [[Industrial unionism#Revolutionary industrial unionism|revolutionary industrial unionism]] or [[syndicalism]] as a method for workers in [[capitalist society]] to gain control of an economy and with that control influence in broader society. Syndicalists consider their economic theories a strategy for facilitating [[Proletariat|worker]] self-activity and as an alternative [[co-operative economics|co-operative economic system]] with democratic values and production centered on meeting human needs.

The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are [[solidarity]], [[direct action]] (action undertaken without the intervention of third parties such as politicians, bureaucrats and arbitrators) and [[direct democracy]], or [[workers' self-management]]. The end goal of syndicalism is to abolish the [[wage system]], regarding it as [[wage slavery]]. Anarcho-syndicalist theory therefore generally focuses on the [[labour movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Jennings, ''Syndicalism in France'' (St Martin's Press, 1990) {{ISBN|031204027X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-syndicalists view the primary purpose of the state as being the defense of [[private property]], and therefore of economic, social and political privilege, denying most of its citizens the ability to enjoy material independence and the social autonomy that springs from it.&lt;ref name="anarcho-syndicalism101"&gt;{{cite web|title=1c. Why do anarcho-syndicalists oppose participation in statist politics?|url=http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1c.htm|work=Anarcho-Syndicalism 101. Class Struggle Online|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=April 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618075029/http://www.anarchosyndicalism.net/faq/1c.htm|archive-date=18 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the anarchist philosophy from which it draws its primary inspiration, anarcho-syndicalism is centred around the idea that [[Power (philosophy)|power]] corrupts and that any [[hierarchy]] that cannot be ethically justified must either be dismantled or replaced by decentralized egalitarian control.&lt;ref name="anarcho-syndicalism101"/&gt;

== History ==
=== Origins ===
[[File:Émile Pouget.jpg|thumb|[[Émile Pouget]]]]
[[Hubert Lagardelle]] wrote that [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] laid out fundamental ideas of anarcho-syndicalism and repudiated both capitalism and the state in the process since he viewed free economic groups and struggle, not pacifism, as dominant in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, J. F., ''The American Historical Review''  (American Historical Association, 1895), p. 731.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1903 and March 1904, [[Sam Mainwaring]] published in Britain two issues of a short-lived newspaper called ''The General Strike,'' a publication that made detailed criticisms of the "officialism" of union bureaucracy and publicized strikes in Europe making use of [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] tactics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=115022871511 "The Great Dock Strike of 1889,"] ''Direct Action'' #47, 11 August 2009. Retrieved 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Workers' Association ===
[[File:Cnt 1910.jpg|thumb|The 1910 Congress in which the Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] was established]]
In 1910, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) was founded in the middle of the restoration in Barcelona in a congress of the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] trade union ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (historical union)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' (Workers' Solidarity) with the objective of constituting an opposing force to the then-majority trade union, the socialist UGT and "to speed up the economic emancipation of the working class through the revolutionary [[Confiscation|expropriation]] of the bourgeoisie". The CNT started small, counting 26,571 members represented through several trade unions and other confederations.&lt;ref name="Geary, Dick 1989 Pg. 261"&gt;Geary, Dick (1989). Labour and Socialist Movements in Europe Before 1914. Berg Publishers. Pg. 261&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, coinciding with its first congress, the CNT initiated a general strike that provoked a Barcelona judge to declare the union illegal until 1914. That same year of 1911, the trade union officially received its name.&lt;ref name="Geary, Dick 1989 Pg. 261"/&gt; From 1918 on, the CNT grew stronger and had an outstanding role in the events of the ''[[La Canadiense]]'' general strike, which paralyzed 70% of industry in Catalonia in 1919, the year the CNT reached a membership of 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony (2006). The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, panic spread among employers, giving rise to the practice of ''[[pistolerismo]]'' (employing thugs to intimidate active unionists), causing a spiral of violence that significantly affected the trade union. These ''pistoleros'' are credited with killing 21 union leaders in 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony (2006). The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the [[International Workers' Association]] (IWA) was founded in Berlin and the CNT joined immediately, but with the rise of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]'s dictatorship the labor union was outlawed once again the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony (2006). The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. p.17&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the workers' movement resurgent following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], what was to become the modern IWA was formed, billing itself as the "true heir" of the [[First International|original International]].&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Thorpe (1989), The Workers Themselves&lt;/ref&gt; The successful [[Bolshevik]]-led revolution of 1918 in Russia was mirrored by a wave of syndicalist successes worldwide, including the struggle of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) in the United States alongside the creation of mass anarchist unions across Latin America and huge syndicalist-led strikes in Germany, Portugal, Spain, Italy and France, where it was noted that "neutral (economic, but not political) syndicalism had been swept away".&lt;ref name="VadimDamier"&gt;Vadim Damier (2009), [http://libcom.org/files/Damier-AS-A4.pdf Anarcho-syndicalism in the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt; The final formation of this new International, then known as the International Workingmen's Association, took place at an illegal conference in Berlin in December 1922, marking an irrevocable break between the international syndicalist movement and the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref name="VadimDamier"/&gt;

The first secretaries of the International included the famed writer and activist [[Rudolph Rocker]], along with [[Augustin Souchy]] and [[Alexander Schapiro]]. Following the first congress, other groups affiliated from France, Austria, Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Poland and Romania. Later, a bloc of unions in the United States, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Cuba, Costa Rica and El Salvador also shared the IWA's statutes. The biggest syndicalist union in the United States was the IWW and considered joining, but eventually ruled out affiliation in 1936 by citing the IWA's policies on religious and political affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin (1976), IWW: Its First 70 Years, 1905-1975&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Anarcho-syndicalism|not anarcho-syndicalist]], the IWW were informed by developments in the broader revolutionary syndicalist milieu at the turn of the 20th century. At its founding congress in 1905, influential members with strong anarchist or anarcho-syndicalist sympathies like [[Thomas J. Hagerty]], [[William Trautmann]] and [[Lucy Parsons]] contributed to the union's overall revolutionary syndicalist orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Salerno, ''Red November, Black November: Culture and Community in the Industrial Workers of the World'' (State University of New York Press, 1989), pp. 69–90, {{ISBN|0-7914-0089-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the terms anarcho-syndicalism and revolutionary syndicalism are often used interchangeably, the anarcho-syndicalist label was not widely used until the early 1920s: "The term ‘anarcho-syndicalist' only came into wide use in 1921–1922 when it was applied polemically as a pejorative term by communists to any syndicalists…who opposed increased control of syndicalism by the communist parties".&lt;ref&gt;David Berry, ''A History of the French Anarchist Movement, 1917–1945'', (Greenwood, 2002), p. 134. {{ISBN|0-313-32026-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, depending on the translation the original statement of aims and principles of the IWA (drafted in 1922) refers not to anarcho-syndicalism, but to revolutionary syndicalism or revolutionary unionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syndicalist.org/mission/ "Principles of Revolutionary Syndicalism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222072643/http://www.syndicalist.org/mission/ |date=22 December 2007 }}, ''Anarcho-Syndicalist Review''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwa-ait.org/?q=statutes "The Statutes of Revolutionary Unionism (IWA)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716221959/http://www.iwa-ait.org/?q=statutes |date=16 July 2012 }}, ''The International Workers Association'' (IWA)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bandera CNT-FAI.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT-FAI]]]]
The ''[[Biennio Rosso]]'' (English: "Red Biennium") was a two-year period between 1919 and 1920 of intense social conflict in Italy following the [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Dallacasa"&gt;Brunella Dalla Casa, ''Composizione di classe, rivendicazioni e professionalità nelle lotte del "biennio rosso" a Bologna'', in: AA. VV, ''Bologna 1920; le origini del fascismo'', a cura di Luciano Casali, Cappelli, Bologna 1982, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The Biennio Rosso took place in a context of economic crisis at the end of the war, with high unemployment and political instability. It was characterized by mass strikes, worker manifestations as well as self-management experiments through land and factories occupations.&lt;ref name="Dallacasa"/&gt; In [[Turin]] and [[Milan]], [[workers councils]] were formed and many [[factory occupations]] took place under the leadership of anarcho-syndicalists. The agitations also extended to the agricultural areas of the [[Padan plain]] and were accompanied by peasant strikes, rural unrests and guerilla conflicts between left-wing and right-wing militias. According to [[libcom.org]], the anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Unione Sindacale Italiana]] (USI) "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus ''[[Umanita Nova]]'', its daily paper) grew accordingly&amp;nbsp;[...] Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/history/articles/italy-factory-occupations-1920 "1918–1921: The Italian factory occupations - Biennio Rosso"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105224302/http://libcom.org/history/articles/italy-factory-occupations-1920 |date=5 November 2011 }} on [[libcom.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the largest members of the IWA were broken, driven underground or wiped out in the 1920s–1930s as [[fascists]] came to power in states across Europe and workers switched away from anarchism towards the seeming success of the Bolshevik model of socialism. In Argentina, the FORA had already begun a process of decline by the time it joined the IWA, having split in 1915 into pro and anti-Bolshevik factions. From 1922, the anarchist movement there lost most of its membership, exacerbated by further splits, most notably around the [[Severino Di Giovanni]] affair. It was crushed by [[José Félix Uriburu|General Uriburu's]] military coup in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/VIII_1/oved.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's FAUD struggled throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s as the [[Sturmabteilung|Brownshirts]] took control of the streets.

Portugal's CGT was driven underground after an unsuccessful attempt to break the newly installed dictatorship of [[Gomes da Costa]] with a general strike in 1927 that led to nearly 100 deaths. It survived underground with 15,–20,000 members until January 1934, when it called a general revolutionary strike against plans to replace trade unions with fascist corporations, which failed. It was able to continue in a much reduced state until World War II, but was effectively finished as a fighting union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/iwa-today-south-london-dam-1985|title=The IWA today – South London DAM |year=1985|publisher=DAM-IWA|accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massive government repression repeated such defeats around the world as anarcho-syndicalist unions were destroyed in Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Cuba, Bulgaria, Paraguay and Bolivia. By the end of the 1930s, legal anarcho-syndicalist trade unions existed only in Chile, Bolivia, Sweden and Uruguay.&lt;ref name="VadimDamier"/&gt; However, perhaps the greatest blow was struck in the [[Spanish Civil War]], which saw the CNT, then claiming a membership of 1.58 million, driven underground with the defeat of the Spanish Republic by [[Francisco Franco]]. The sixth IWA congress took place in 1936, shortly after the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] had begun, but was unable to provide serious material support for the section. The IWA held its last pre-war congress in Paris in 1938, with months to go before the German invasion of Poland it received an application from ZZZ,&lt;ref&gt;http://libcom.org/history/anarchism-zzz-poland-1919-1939&lt;/ref&gt; a syndicalist union in the country claiming up to 130,000 workers—ZZZ members went on to form a core part of the resistance against the Nazis and participated in the Warsaw uprising. However, the International was not to meet again until after World War II had finished in 1951. During the war, only one member of the IWA was able to continue to function as a revolutionary union, the SAC in Sweden.&lt;ref name="libcom" /&gt; In 1927, with the "moderate" positioning of some ''cenetistas'' (CNT members) the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI), an association of anarchist [[affinity group]]s, was created in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. The FAI would play an important role during the following years through the so-called ''trabazón'' (connection) with the CNT; that is, the presence of FAI elements in the CNT, encouraging the labor union not to move away from its anarchist principles, an influence that continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roca Martínez|2006|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish Revolution ===
{{main|Spanish Revolution of 1936|Anarchist Catalonia}}
[[File:Cnt afiliats.png|thumb|left|300px|Evolution of the number of affiliates in the CNT from 1911 to 1937]]
On 1 June 1936, the CNT joined the UGT in declaring a strike of "building workers, mechanics, and lift operators". A demonstration was held, 70,000 workers strong. Members of the [[Falange]] attacked the strikers. The strikers responded by looting shops, and the police reacted by attempting to suppress the strike. By the beginning of July, the CNT was still fighting while the UGT had agreed to arbitration. In retaliation to the attacks by the Falangists, anarchists killed three bodyguards of the Falangist leader [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]]. The government then closed the CNT's centers in [[Madrid]] and arrested David Antona and Cipriano Mera, two CNT militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] wrote of the nature of the new society that arose in the communities:
{{quote|I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragón one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilised life– snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.– had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master.|George Orwell|''Homage to Catalonia'', ch. VII}}

Some of the most important communities in this respect were those of [[Alcañiz]], [[Calanda, Spain|Calanda]], [[Alcorisa]], [[Valderrobres]], [[Fraga]] or [[Alcampel]]. Not only were the lands collectivized, but collective labours were also undertaken, like the retirement home in Fraga, the collectivization of some hospitals (such as in [[Barbastro]] or [[Binéfar]]) and the founding of schools such as the School of Anarchist Militants. These institutions would be destroyed by the Nationalist troops during the war.

The Committee held an extraordinary regional plenary session to protect the new rural organization, gathering all the union representatives from the supporting villages and backed by [[Buenaventura Durruti]]. Against the will of the mainly [[Catalonia|Catalan]] CNT National Committee, the [[Regional Defence Council of Aragon]] was created. Following [[Francisco Largo Caballero|Largo Caballero]]'s assumption of the position of [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] of the government, he invited the CNT to join in the coalition of groups making up the national government. The CNT proposed instead that a National Defense Council should be formed, led by Largo Caballero; and containing five members each from the CNT and UGT and four "liberal republicans". When this proposal was declined, the CNT decided not to join the government. However, in Catalonia the CNT joined the Central Committee of the Anti-Fascist Militias, which joined the [[Generalitat]] on 26 September. For the first time, three members of the CNT were also members of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2006|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, Caballero once again asked the CNT to become part of the government. The leadership of the CNT requested the finance and war ministries as well as three others, but were given four posts, the ministries of health, justice, industry and commerce. [[Federica Montseny]] became Minister of Health, the first female minister in Spain. As minister of justice, [[Juan García Oliver]] abolished legal fees and destroyed all criminal files. Shortly afterwards, despite the disapproval of the anarchist ministers the capital was moved from Madrid to [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 December 1936, after receiving in Madrid a retinue formed by Joaquín Ascaso, Miguel Chueca and three republican and independent leaders, the government of Largo Caballero, which by then had four anarchists as ministers (García Oliver, Juan López, Federica Montseny and [[Joan Peiró]]), approved the formation of the National Defense Committee. It was a revolutionary body that represented anarchists as much as socialists and republicans. Halfway through February 1937, a congress took place in [[Caspe]] with the purpose of creating the Regional Federation of Collectives of Aragon. 456 delegates, representing more than 141,000 collective members, attended the congress. The congress was also attended by delegates of the National Committee of the CNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|1999|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a plenary session of the CNT in March 1937, the national committee asked for a motion of [[censure]] to suppress the Aragonese Regional Council. The Aragonese regional committee threatened to resign, which thwarted the censure effort. Although there had always been disagreements, that spring also saw a great escalation in confrontations between the CNT-FAI and the Communists. In Madrid, [[Melchor Rodríguez García|Melchor Rodríguez]], who was then a member of the CNT and director of prisons in Madrid, published accusations that the Communist José Cazorla, who was then overseeing public order, was maintaining secret prisons to hold anarchists, socialists and other republicans; and either executing, or torturing them as "traitors". Soon after, on this pretext Largo Caballero dissolved the Communist-controlled Junta de Defensa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cazorla reacted by closing the offices of ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Textil.jpg|thumb|200px|CNT poster informing about the [[Socialization (economics)|socialization]] of the Textiles industry]]
The next day, CNT's regional committee declared a [[general strike]]. The CNT controlled the majority of the city, including the heavy artillery on the hill of [[Montjuïc]] overlooking the city. CNT militias disarmed more than 200 members of the security forces at their barricades, allowing only CNT vehicles to pass through.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|pp=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; After unsuccessful appeals from the CNT leadership to end the fighting, the government began transferring Assault Guard from the front to Barcelona, and even destroyers from Valencia. On 5 May, the [[Friends of Durruti]] issued a pamphlet calling for "disarming of the paramilitary police… dissolution of the political parties…" and declared "Long live the social revolution! – Down with the counter-revolution!", though the pamphlet was quickly denounced by the leadership of the CNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|pp=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the government agreed to a proposal by the leadership of the CNT-FAI that called for the removal of the Assault Guards and no reprisals against libertarians that had participated in the conflict in exchange for the dismantling of barricades and end of the general strike. However, neither the PSUC or the Assault Guards gave up their positions and according to historian [[Antony Beevor]] "carried out violent reprisals against libertarians".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 8 May, the fighting was over.

[[Barcelona May Days|These events]], the fall of [[Largo Caballero]]'s government and the new prime ministership of [[Juan Negrín]] soon led to the collapse of much that the CNT had achieved immediately following the rising the previous July. At the beginning of July, the Aragonese organizations of the Popular Front publicly declared their support for the alternative council in Aragon, led by their president, [[Joaquín Ascaso]]. Four weeks later, the 11th Division under [[Enrique Líster]] entered the region. On 11 August 1937, the Republican government, now situated in Valencia, dismissed the Regional Council for the Defense of Aragon.&lt;ref name="Beevor"&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Líster's division was prepared for an offensive on the Aragonese front, but they were also sent to subdue the collectives run by the CNT-UGT and in dismantling the collective structures created the previous twelve months. The offices of the CNT were destroyed and all the equipment belonging to its collectives was redistributed to landowners.&lt;ref name="Beevor" /&gt; The CNT leadership not only refused to allow the anarchist columns on the Aragon front to leave the front to defend the collectives, but they failed to condemn the government's actions against the collectives, causing much conflict between it and the rank and file membership of the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1938, Juan Negrín was asked to form a government and included [[Segundo Blanco]], a member of the CNT, as minister of education; and by this point, the only CNT member left in the cabinet. At this point, many in the CNT leadership were critical of participation in the government, seeing it as dominated by the Communists. Prominent CNT leaders went so far as to refer to Blanco as "sop of the libertarian movement"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|1999|p=976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "just one more Negrínist".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|1999|p=977}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, Blanco was responsible for installing other CNT members into the ministry of education and stopping the spread of "Communist propaganda" by the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|1999|p=978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1939, with the war nearly over, CNT leaders participated in the National Defense Council's coup overthrowing the government of the Socialist Juan Negrín.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|1999|p=1055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved included the CNT's Eduardo Val and José Manuel González Marín serving on the council, while [[Cipriano Mera]]'s 70th Division provided military support, and Melechor Rodríquez became mayor of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council attempted to negotiate a peace with Franco, though he granted virtually none of their demands.

=== Post-World War II era ===

[[File:Anarchist black cat.svg|thumb|The [[black cat]] of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] is also adopted as a symbol by anarcho-syndicalists]]
After World War II, an appeal in the ''[[Fraye Arbeter Shtime]]'' detailing the plight of [[Anarchism in Germany|German anarchists]] and called for Americans to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|doi=10.1177/002200947300800304|last=Vallance|first=Margaret|date=July 1973|title=Rudolf Rocker – a biographical sketch|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=8|issue=3|pages=75–95|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London/Beverly Hills|issn=0022-0094|oclc=49976309|ref=harv}} {{Harvnb|Vallance|1973|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. In 1947, [[Rudolf Rocker]] published ''Zur Betrachtung der Lage in Deutschland'' (''Regarding the Portrayal of the Situation in Germany'') about the impossibility of another anarchist movement in Germany. It became the first post-World War II anarchist writing to be distributed in Germany. Rocker thought young Germans were all either totally cynical or inclined to fascism and awaited a new generation to grow up before anarchism could bloom once again in the country. Nevertheless, the Federation of Libertarian Socialists (FFS) was founded in 1947 by former FAUD members. Rocker wrote for its organ, ''Die Freie Gesellschaft'', which survived until 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vallance|1973|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Rocker published another well-known work. On 10 September 1958, Rocker died in the Mohegan Colony. The [[Syndicalist Workers' Federation]] was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain&lt;ref name="Political Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'|year=2000|publisher=Pinter Publishers|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1855672642|url=https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-British-Irish-Political-Organizations/dp/1855672642}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the Solidarity Federation's earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain.&lt;ref name="Political Encyclopedia"/&gt; Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely [[syndicalism|syndicalist]], worker-centred strategy from the outset.&lt;ref name="Political Encyclopedia"/&gt; The [[Confédération nationale du travail]] (CNT, or National Confederation of Labour) was founded in 1946 by Spanish anarcho-syndicalists in exile with former members of the CGT-SR. The CNT later split into the CNT-Vignoles and the CNT-AIT, which is the French section of the IWA.

At the seventh congress in Toulouse in 1951, a much smaller IWA was relaunched again without the CNT, which would not be strong enough to reclaim membership until 1958 as an exiled and underground organization. Delegates attended, though mostly representing very small groups, from Cuba, Argentina, Spain, Sweden, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Britain, Bulgaria and Portugal. A message of support was received from Uruguay, but the situation remained difficult for the International as it struggled to deal with the rise of state-sanctioned economic trade unionism in the West, heavy secret service intervention as [[Cold War]] anti-communism reached its height and the banning of all strikes and free trade unions in the Soviet Union bloc of countries.&lt;ref name="libcom" /&gt; At the tenth congress in 1958, the SAC's response to these pressures led it into a clash with the rest of the international. It withdrew from the IWA following its failure to amend the body's statutes to allow it to stand in municipal elections&lt;ref&gt;SAC had begun contesting municipal elections under the candidatures of [[Libertarian Municipal People]]&lt;/ref&gt; and amid concerns over its integration with the state over distribution of unemployment benefits.&lt;ref name="MichaelSchmidt"&gt;Michael Schmidt and Lucien Van Der Walt (2009), Black Flame&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the next two decades, the international struggled to prebuild itself. In 1976 at the 15th congress, the IWA had only five member groups, two of which (the Spanish and Bulgarian members) were still operating in exile (though following Franco's death in 1975, the CNT was already approaching a membership of 200,000).&lt;ref name="selfed" /&gt;

The [[Direct Action Movement]] was formed in 1979, when the one remaining SWF branch, along with other smaller anarchist groups, decided to form a new organisation of anarcho-syndicalists in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/x69qfd&lt;/ref&gt; The DAM was highly involved in the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|Miners' Strike]] as well as a series of industrial disputes later in the 1980s, including the Ardbride dispute in [[Ardrossan]], [[Scotland]], involving a supplier to [[Laura Ashley]], for which the DAM received international support. From 1988 in Scotland, then England and Wales, the DAM was active in opposing the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Poll Tax]].&lt;ref name="Golden Angels"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meltzer|first=Albert|title=I Couldn't Paint Golden Angels|year=2001|publisher=AK Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1873176931|url=http://libcom.org/library/25-lucky-strike-direct-action-years-poll-tax-battle-trafalgar-square-class-war-leo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1994, DAM changed to its current name, the [[Solidarity Federation]], having previously been the Direct Action Movement since 1979 and before that the Syndicalist Workers' Federation since 1950. Presently, the Solidarity Federation publishes the quarterly magazine ''Direct Action'' (presently on hiatus) and the newspaper ''[http://www.solfed.org.uk/catalyst Catalyst]''.

In 1979, a split over representative unionism, professional unionism and state-funded schemes saw the CNT divided into two sections, the CNT as it is today and the [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de España|Confederacion General del Trabajo]]. After [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s death in November 1975 and the beginning of [[Spanish transition to democracy|Spain's transition to democracy]], the CNT was the only social movement to refuse to sign the 1977 [[Moncloa Pact]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roca Martínez|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; an agreement amongst politicians, political parties and trade unions to plan how to operate the economy during the transition. In 1979, the CNT held its first congress since 1936 as well as several mass meetings, the most remarkable one in [[Montjuïc]]. Views put forward in this congress would set the pattern for the CNT's line of action for the following decades: no participation in union elections, no acceptance of state subsidies,&lt;ref name="Roca Martínez 2006 109"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roca Martínez|2006|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; no acknowledgment of [[works council]]s and support of union sections.

In this first congress, held in Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aguilar Fernández|2002|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; a minority sector in favor of union elections split from the CNT, initially calling themselves CNT Valencia Congress (referring to the alternative congress held in this city) and later [[Confederación General del Trabajo (Spain)|Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) after an April 1989 court decision determined that they could not use the CNT initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnt.es/Documentos/faq.htm#diferencia |title=FAQ |quote="Un sector minoritario que es partidario de las elecciones sindicales se escinde y pasa a llamarse CNT congreso de valencia (en referencia al Congreso alternativo realizado en esa ciudad) y posteriormente, perdidas judicialmente las siglas, a CGT." |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209191050/http://www.cnt.es/Documentos/faq.htm |archivedate=9 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, a group of CGT members left this union because they rejected the CGT's policy of accepting government subsidies, founding ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (union)|Solidaridad Obrera]]''.

An explosion killed three people in a Barcelona night club.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alexander|1999|p=1094}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities alleged that striking workers "blew themselves up" and arrested surviving strikers, implicating them in the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meltzer|1996|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNT members declared that the prosecution sought to criminalize their organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} A series of three articles about the Scala Case from the CNT point of view: (1) [http://www.polemica.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=95 El Caso Scala.

[[File:CNT-1mayo2010.jpg|thumb|Members of the Spanish anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT marching in Madrid in 2010]]
After its legalization, the CNT began efforts to recover the expropriations of 1939. The basis for such recovery would be established by Law 4/1986, which required the return of the seized properties and the unions' right to use or yield the real estate. Since then, the CNT has been claiming the return of these properties from the State. In 1996, the [[Spanish Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] facilities in Madrid were squatted by 105 CNT militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/papel/hemeroteca/1996/12/07/economia/186681.html |title=Los 117 detenidos de la CNT, en libertad tras prestar declaración |date=1996-12-07 |work=El Mundo |language=Spanish |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This body is in charge of the repatriation of the accumulated union wealth. In 2004, an agreement was reached between the CNT and the District Attorney's Office, through which all charges were dropped against the hundred prosecuted for this occupation.

On 3 September 2009, six members of the Serbian IWA section (ASI-MUR), including then-IWA General Secretary Ratibor Trivunac, were arrested&lt;ref&gt;http://libcom.org/news/belgrade-anarchists-arrested-state-attorney-international-terrorism-04092009&lt;/ref&gt; on suspicion of international terrorism, a charge that was heavily disputed by the international and other anarchist groups. Shortly after their arrest, an open letter was circulated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asi.zsp.net.pl/belgrade-professors-send-open-letter-in-defense-of-arrested/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014174824/http://asi.zsp.net.pl/belgrade-professors-send-open-letter-in-defense-of-arrested/ |archivedate=14 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Serbian academics criticizing the charges and the attitude of Serbian police. The six were formally indicted on 7 December and after a lengthy trial procedure Trivunac, along with other five anarchists, were freed on 17 February 2010. On 10 December 2009, the FAU local in [[Berlin]] was effectively [[Freie Arbeiterinnen- und Arbeiter-Union#Free Workers' Union Berlin|banned]] as a union following a public industrial dispute at the city's Babylon cinema. At the XXIV annual congress of the IWA which was held in [[Brazil]] in December 2009, the first time the congress had been held outside Europe, motions of support were passed for the "Belgrade Six" and FAU while members of the [[Solidarity Federation]] temporarily took over duties as Secretariat. The International's Norwegian section subsequently took on the Secretariat role in 2010. As part of the anti-austerity movement in Europe, various IWA sections have been highly active in the 2008–2012 period, with the CNT taking a leading role in agitating for the general strikes that have occurred in Spain, the USI in Milan taking on anti-austerity campaigns in the health service and the ZSP organizing tenants against abuses in rented accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://internationalworkersassociation.blogspot.com|title=The unofficial IWA blog|year=2011|publisher=ASI-MUR|accessdate=2011-10-14}} keeps an updated list of recent IWA member activities&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain in the form of the [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de España|Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the CNT.

== Theory and politics ==
[[File:Syndicalism Outline.gif|thumb|Basic outline of syndicalism as an economic system]] 
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that [[direct action]]—action carried out by workers as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position—would allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Rocker, ''Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice'' (AK Press, 2004), p. 73, {{ISBN|1-902593-92-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations that oppose the wage system will eventually form the basis of a new society and should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers alone should decide on that which affects them.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Rocker, ''Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice'' (AK Press, 2004), p. 62-63, {{ISBN|1-902593-92-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Rocker]] is one of the most influential figures in the anarcho-syndicalist movement.

[[Noam Chomsky]], who was influenced by Rocker, wrote the introduction to a modern edition of ''[[Anarcho-Syndicalism (book)|Anarcho-syndicalism: Theory and Practice]]''. A member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), Chomsky is a self-described anarcho-syndicalist, a position that he sees as the appropriate application of [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] political theory to contemporary industrial society:
{{quotation|Now a federated, decentralised system of free associations, incorporating economic as well as other social institutions, would be what I refer to as anarcho-syndicalism; and it seems to me that this is the appropriate form of social organisation for an advanced technological society in which human beings do not have to be forced into the position of tools, of cogs in the machine. There is no longer any social necessity for human beings to be treated as mechanical elements in the productive process; that can be overcome and we must overcome it to be a society of freedom and free association, in which the creative urge that I consider intrinsic to human nature will in fact be able to realize itself in whatever way it will.&lt;ref&gt;The Chomsky-Foucault Debate on Human Nature, The New Press, 2006, p.38-9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Barcelonacntait (110).JPG|thumb|The CNT's Barcelona offices]]

== Criticisms and responses ==
Anarcho-syndicalism has been criticised as anachronistic by some contemporary anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike and Bode, Ulrike, ''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'' (San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994), p. 4. {{ISBN|0-87286-289-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Murray Bookchin]] spoke against its reliance on an outdated view of work:
{{quotation| As "practical" and "realistic" as anarcho-syndicalism may seem, it represents in my view an archaic ideology rooted in a narrowly economistic notion of bourgeois interest, indeed of a sectorial interest as such. It relies on the persistence of social forces like the factory system and the traditional class consciousness of the industrial proletariat that are waning radically in the Euro-American world in an era of indefinable social relations and ever-broadening social concerns. Broader movements and issues are now on the horizon of modern society that, while they must necessarily involve workers, require a perspective that is larger than the factory, trade union, and a proletarian orientation.&lt;ref name="Bookchin"&gt;Murray Bookchin, '' The Ghost of Anarcho-Syndicalism'', [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/ghost2.html online at Anarchy Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103015617/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/ghost2.html |date=3 January 2009 }}. Retrieved 27 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bookchin has said that it prioritizes the interests of the working class, instead of communal freedom for society as a whole; and that this view ultimately prevents a true revolution. He argues that in instances like the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], it was in spite of the syndicalist-minded CNT leadership that the revolution occurred.&lt;ref name="Bookchin"/&gt;

Direct action, being one of the main staples of anarcho-syndicalism, would extend into the political sphere according to its supporters. To them, the labour council is the federation of all workplace branches of all industries in a geographical area "territorial basis of organisation linkage brought all the workers from one area together and fomented working-class solidarity over and before corporate solidarity".&lt;ref&gt;Romero Maura, "The Spanish Case", contained in Anarchism Today, D. Apter and J. Joll (eds.), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf Rocker argued:
{{quotation|The organisation of Anarcho-Syndicalism is based upon the principles of Federalism, on free combination from below upwards, putting the right of self-determination of every member above everything else and recognising only the organic agreement of all on the basis of like interests and common convictions.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Rocker, ''Anarcho-Syndicalism'', op. cit., p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anarcho-syndicalism therefore is not apolitical but instead sees political and economic activity as the same. Unlike the propositions of some of its critics, anarcho-syndicalism is different from reformist union activity in that it aims to obliterate capitalism as "[anarcho-syndicalism] has a double aim: with tireless persistence, it must pursue betterment of the working class's current conditions. But, without letting themselves become obsessed with this passing concern, the workers should take care to make possible and imminent the essential act of comprehensive emancipation: the expropriation of capital".&lt;ref&gt;Emile Pouget in ''No Gods, No Masters: An Anthology of Anarchism'', edited by Daniel Guerin (AK Press, 2005), p. 71. {{ISBN|1-904859-25-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CGT demonstration.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Confederacion General del Trabajo de España|Confederacion General del Trabajo]] demonstration in [[Barcelona]], October 2005]]
While collectivist and communist anarchists criticise syndicalism as having the potential to exclude the voices of citizens and consumers outside of the union, anarcho-syndicalists argue that labour councils will work outside of the workplace and within the community to encourage community and consumer participation in economic and political activity (even workers and consumers outside of the union or nation) and will work to form and maintain the institutions necessary in any society such as schools, libraries, homes and so on. Bookchin argues:
{{quotation|At the same time that syndicalism exerts this unrelenting pressure on capitalism, it tries to build the new social order within the old. The unions and the 'labour councils' are not merely means of struggle and instruments of social revolution; they are also the very structure around which to build a free society. The workers are to be educated [by their own activity within the union] in the job of destroying the old propertied order and in the task of reconstructing a stateless, libertarian society. The two go together.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, M 1998, ''[[The Spanish Anarchists]]'', AK Press, California. p 121&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''''Arc of Instability''''' is a proposed, interconnected chain of politically unstable nation states in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. The term came into vogue in the late 1990s, proving especially popular with Australian politicians and journalists. The Arc is also sometimes to referred to as [[Balkanization|balkanisation]] in a modern, Asia-Pacific context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | first = Clive
  | title = Happy Isles in Crisis
  | publisher = Asia Pacific Press
  | date = 2004
  | location = Canberra
  | pages = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "Arc of Instability" has separately also been used by the [[National Intelligence Council]] to describe "a great arc of 
instability stretching from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] through [[North Africa]], into the Middle East, the Balkans, the Caucasus, and South and Central Asia, and parts of Southeast Asia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Reports%20and%20Pubs/2025_Global_Trends_Final_Report.pdf ''Global Trends 2025''] - [[Director of National Intelligence]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and member states==
The term is used to suggest that the members of the Arc are interconnected to the point that destabilisation within one country can have major political, military and economic repercussions in neighbouring countries. For example, Australian media and politicians claimed the [[History of Solomon Islands#Civil war|destabilisation of Solomon Islands]] was the result of a copycat or [[domino effect]] of the [[2000 Fijian coup d'état]]. 

In August 2006 [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Australian Defence Minister]] [[Brendan Nelson]] gave a speech to parliament on the topic of the Arc. Along with dropping Indonesia from the list of states in the Arc, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We cannot afford to have failing states in our region. The so-called 'arc of instability', which basically goes from East Timor through to the south-west Pacific states, means that not only does Australia have a responsibility in preventing and indeed assisting with humanitarian and disaster relief, but also that we cannot allow any of these countries to become havens for transnational crime, nor indeed havens for terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | url = http://www.abc.net.au/correspondents/content/2006/s1719019.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

There is no official list of member states in the Arc, however it has traditionally been accepted to include South-East Asian and Oceanic nations such as [[Papua New Guinea]], The [[Solomon Islands]], [[East Timor]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Fiji]].

==Events in an Arc==
This is a partial list of some events within an Arc which have typically been seen as contributing to the region's instability:

*Fijian [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|coup d'état]]
*East Timor [[History of East Timor#Towards independence|independence]]
*[[Bougainville conflict]]
*Solomon Islands [[RAMSI|intervention]]
*[[2012 Papua New Guinea Defence Force mutiny]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">The '''Asian–African Legal Consultative Organization''' ('''AALCO''') is an international governmental organization formed in 1956, initially to serve as an advisory board to member states on matters on international law. It was an outgrowth of the [[Bandung Conference]], held in [[Indonesia]] during April, 1955, which led to the establishment of the '''Asian Legal Consultative Committee''' (ALCC). In April, 1958, it changed its name to the '''Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee''' ('''AALCC''') to reflect the growth of its membership beyond the African side of the [[United Arab Republic]]. Since 2001, it has been known by its current name, the AALCO, reflecting the growth of its international status; currently an [[intergovernmental organization]] having received a standing [[United Nations]] invitation to participate as an observer in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly and maintaining a permanent office at Headquarters.

In 2014, the AALCO established an Informal Expert Group on Customary International Law. That group adopted a set of comments on the work of the International Law Commission on identification of customary international law. Those comments and the report of the AALCO Special Rapporteur Sienho Yee are published on the website of the AALCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aalco.int/54thsession/AALCOIEG%20Chairman's%20Statement%20and%20Special%20Rapporteur's%20Report%2020150324.pdf|title=AALCOIEG Chairman's Statement and Special Rapporteur's Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2746">The '''spy scandal on the City of Buenos Aires''' refers to the scandal of illegal spying events, possibly for political purposes, made using government research structures and connected to the newly created [[Metropolitan Police (Buenos Aires)|Metropolitan Police Force]].

==Chronology==
[[Sergio Burstein]] is one of the leaders of the Jewish community who had led the opposition against the appointment of [[Jorge Alberto Palacios|Fino Palacios]] as Chief of Police of [[Buenos Aires]], because of their connections to the [[1994 AMIA bombing]].&lt;ref name="ln1181177"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1181177 ''Satisfacción de los familiares de las víctimas por la decisión judicial'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2009, Burstein was warned by an anonymous phone call, that one of its phone lines were being taped, so he made the complaint.&lt;ref name="ln1188903"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1188903 ''Uno de los líderes de familiares de víctimas de AMIA apuntó contra Palacios por las escuchas'']&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the Justice observed that in fact, Burstein was being spied upon by a band that would be part Fino Palacios and his successor [[Osvaldo Chamorro]], [[Ciro James]] (a Federal Police lawyer working for the Ministry of Education of Buenos Aires), two judges of the Province of Misiones, among others.&lt;ref name="ln1188903"/&gt;

Macri said that the case, headed by the Kirchnerite judge [[Norberto Oyarbide]], was an attempt by Néstor Kirchner to frame him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1265034-oyarbide-proceso-a-macri-por-integrar-una-asociacion-ilicita|title= Oyarbide procesó a Macri por integrar una asociación ilícita|trans-title=Oyarbide filled a case against Macri for illicit association|language= Spanish|author= Paz Rodríguez Niell|date= May 15, 2010|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Sebastián Casanello]] cleared Macri from charges, stating that there was not enough proof of a crime to involve Macri in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infobae.com/2014/07/17/1581454-la-camara-federal-confirmo-que-macri-no-va-juicio-las-escuchas-telefonicas-ilegales|title= La Cámara Federal confirmó que Macri no va a juicio por las escuchas telefónicas ilegales|trans-title=The Federal Chamber confirmed that Macri will not be judged for the illegal phone tapping|language= Spanish|author= |date= July 17, 2015|publisher= Infobae|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people involved included Buenos Aires' security minister [[Guillermo Montenegro]].

The '''Canadian Peace Congress''' is an [[anti-imperialist]] group founded in 1949 by Canadian minister [[James Gareth Endicott]] in response to the new dangers to peace posed because of the Cold War. It described itself as "a place where people of different views and faiths can meet and discuss world affairs... and work together as effectively as possible to improve international relations and step by step [move] towards the goal of universal disarmament and a lasting peace"&lt;ref name="mac" &gt;http://pw20c.mcmaster.ca/canadian-peace-congress-leaflet-197&lt;/ref&gt; The CPC was the Canadian affiliate of the [[World Peace Council]] and a leading player in the [[peace movement]] in Canada, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. The CPC was active in the [[nuclear disarmament]] and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] movements such as the movement against the [[Vietnam War]] and promoted the concept of [[peaceful co-existence]] between the [[Communist bloc]] and the [[Western bloc]].

The CPC was made up of affiliated local peace councils from across Canada as well as associate members including the Trade Union Peace Committee, the [[Labor-Progressive Party]] (as the [[Communist Party of Canada]] was then known), the [[Federation of Russian Canadians]] and the [[United Jewish Peoples' Order]]. Its founding meeting was attended by representatives of 47 different organizations and groups, including women's, youth and church groups, trade unions, and ethnic associations. The organization also worked closely with many [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|CCF]] activists.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.mcmaster.ca/archives/findaids/fonds/c/canpeace.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Active councils of the CPC were established in: British Columbia, Calgary, Edmonton, Fraser Valley, Guelph, Halifax, Hamilton, Kamsack, London, Niagara, Peterborough, Saskatoon, Sydney, Thunder Bay, Vernon, Victoria, and Windsor. These councils were active in campaigns against the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]], the military coup in Chile, South African Apartheid, Zionism, US interventions into Nicaragua and Panama, NORAD and NATO as well as the arms race and nuclear build-up. 

The CPC was perceived as being close to the Labor-Progressive Party and its successor the Communist Party of Canada, though Endicott, himself, was not a party member. Endicott remained the CPC's chairman until 1971 when, according to his biography, he was pressured to resign by the leadership of the Communist Party for his pro-[[People's Republic of China|China]] views during the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Endicott was succeeded by John Hanly Morgan who led the Congress as president until 1986. A Quebec Peace Congress, Conseil québécois de la paix, also established a nationally autonomous group separate from the Canadian Peace Congress in the 1970s. By the late 1970s, members who had authored publications for the Peace Congress included scientists, artists, musicians and writers from across the country.

During the 1980s struggles for nuclear disarmament, the Congress helped found the much broader [[Canadian Peace Alliance]] in 1985 as a more inclusive and less centralized network of peace organizations, including many newly formed groups (as opposed to the CPC which was seen as aligned with the [[Soviet Union]]). The CPA has since developed essentially into a coalition.

After 1986 Lari Prokop led the Congress until it became inactive in the early 1990s. At its 1991 conference, the CPC decided to disaffiliate from the World Peace Council but the organization never formally dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perc.ca/PEN/1991-07-08/rankin.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Regina Peace Council continued its activity, publishing a regular newsletter and paying dues to the World Peace Council. 

While the Canada-wide council became inactive with the world crisis in the socialist and Communist movement around 1992, by the mid-2000s an effort was made to re-establish Peace Councils in Edmonton and the BC Lower Mainland, in addition to Regina. The Peace Council was then re-established in April 2006 at an Edmonton conference attended by 20 delegates from across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/3425/?PrintableVersion=enabled "Canadian Peace Congress Reconstituted"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Political Affairs Magazine'', May–June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A "Special Renewal Conference" was held in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] in 2008 which ratified the organization's constitution and politics and elected as president David McKee, a trade unionist, past co-chair of the Canadian Peace Alliance, and current leader of the Ontario Communist Party. Currently there are active Peace Councils in Surrey (Fraser Valley), BC; Edmonton, AB; Regina, SK; Winnipeg, MB; and Toronto, ON. The revived Canadian Peace Congress has affirmed its continuity with the original organization, again the Canadian affiliating with the World Peace Council. Canadian delegates have attended various international meetings, and the Peace Congress hosted a tri-lateral meeting of Peace Congress's from Mexico, USA and Cuba in October 2009. In 2017, former Communist Party of Canada leader [[Miguel Figueroa]] became acting president of the Canadian Peace Congress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2839">'''Cymru Goch''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈkəmrɨ ˈɡoːχ}}, ''[[Red (political adjective)|Red]] [[Wales]]'') was a [[left-wing]] [[Welsh nationalism|Welsh nationalist]] political party, founded in 1986 and fought for what it described as a ''Free [[Socialist]] Wales''.

== Background ==
Following the collapse of the [[Welsh Socialist Republican Movement]], a number of former members, along with some who had previously been active in other parties including [[Plaid Cymru]] formed Cymru Goch. By the mid 1990s the party had over 300 members and 13 branches throughout Wales. It produced a journal, ''Y Faner Goch'' ('The Red Flag'), which had previously been published by the Welsh Socialist Republican Movement, a newsletter '''Y Fflam''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (The Flame) and various booklets and pamphlets explaining its aims and discussing the relationship between Marxism and Welsh nationalism.It was one of the founders of the [[Welsh Socialist Alliance]] but left in 2002. In late 2003, it subsumed itself into the new [[Forward Wales]] party formed around [[John Marek (politician)|John Marek]] AM in [[Wrexham]].

== Campaigns and elections ==
In the Welsh [[United Kingdom local elections, 1995|local government elections in 1995]], 3 Cymru Goch candidates were elected as councillors and the part stood a candidate in the elections to the [[Elections to the European Parliament|European Parliament in 1994]] in the [[South Wales East (European Parliament constituency)|South Wales East constituency]] against [[Glenys Kinnock, Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead|Glenys Kinnock]]. The party stood on an abstentionist platform and would have refused to take the seat if elected, seeing the European Parliament and the UK Parliament as foreign parliaments. It decided not to contest the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]].

Following the election of the [[Blair ministry|Blair government]] in 1997, Cymru Goch joined with other organisations to campaign for the [[Welsh devolution referendum, 1997|devolution proposals]] under the banner 'Socialists Say Yes"

During the 1980s and 1990s Cymru Goch was also heavily involved in campaigns against the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (the 'Poll Tax') and [[Welsh Water]] PLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40423488|title=Encyclopedia of British and Irish political organizations : parties, groups, and movements of the twentieth century|date=2000|publisher=Pinter|others=Barberis, Peter, 1948-|isbn=1855672642|location=London|oclc=40423488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey's early work, beginning with his PhD (on hops production in 19th century Kent), was historical in nature, emerging from a regional-historical tradition of inquiry widely used at Cambridge and in Britain at that time. Historical inquiry runs through his later works (for example on Paris). 

Harvey resides in New York. He has a daughter Delfina born in January, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;https://soundcloud.com/freshed-podcast/freshed-100-a-marxist-critique-of-higher-education-david-harvey&lt;/ref&gt;

{{American socialism |expanded=Theorists}}

[[File:David Harvey on Subversive Festival.jpg|thumb|right|David Harvey at [[Subversive Festival]]]]
By the mid-1960s, Harvey followed trends in the social sciences to employ quantitative methods, contributing to spatial science and [[Positivism|positivist]] theory. Roots of this work were visible while he was at Cambridge: the [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|Department of Geography]] also housed [[Richard Chorley]], and [[Peter Haggett]]. His ''[[Explanation in Geography]]'' (1969) was a landmark text in the methodology and philosophy of geography, applying principles drawn from the philosophy of science in general to the field of geographical knowledge. But after its publication Harvey moved on again, to become concerned with issues of [[social inequality|social injustice]] and the nature of the capitalist system itself. He has never returned to embrace the arguments made in ''Explanation'', but still he conforms to the critique of absolute space and exceptionalism in geography of the regional-historical tradition that he saw as an outcome of Kantian ''synthetic [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' knowledge.

Moving from [[Bristol University]] to [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]] in the USA, he positioned himself centrally in the newly emerging field of radical and [[Marxist geography]]. [[social injustice|Injustice]], [[racism]], and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] were visible in Baltimore, and activism around these issues was tangible in early 1970s [[Northeastern United States|East Coast]], perhaps more so than in Britain. The journal ''Antipode'' was formed at [[Clark University]]; Harvey was one of the first contributors. The Boston [[Association of American Geographers]] meetings in 1971 were a landmark, with Harvey and others disrupting the traditional approach of their peers. In 1972, in a famous essay on ghetto formation, he argued for the creation of "revolutionary theory", theory "validated through revolutionary practice".

''[[Social Justice and the City]]'' (1973) expressed Harvey's position that geography could not remain 'objective' in the face of urban poverty and associated ills. It has been cited widely (over 6600 times, by 2017, in a discipline where 50 citations are rare), and it makes a significant contribution to Marxian theory by arguing that capitalism annihilates space to ensure its own [[social reproduction|reproduction]]. [[Dialectical materialism]] has guided his subsequent work, notably the theoretically sophisticated ''[[Limits to Capital]]'' (1982), which furthers the radical geographical analysis of capitalism, and several books on urban processes and urban life have followed it. ''[[The Condition of Postmodernity]]'' (1989), written while a Professor at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], was a best-seller (the London ''[[The Independent]]'' named it as one of the fifty most important works of non-fiction to be published since 1945, and it is cited 30,000 times by 2017). It is a materialist critique of [[postmodernism|postmodern]] ideas and arguments, suggesting these actually emerge from contradictions within capitalism itself. ''[[Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference]]'' (1996) focuses on [[social justice|social]] and [[environmental justice]] (although its dialectical perspective has attracted the ire of some Greens). ''[[Spaces of Hope]]'' (2000) has an utopian theme and indulges in speculative thinking about how an alternative world might look. His study of Second Empire Paris and the events surrounding the [[Paris Commune]] in ''[[Paris, Capital of Modernity]]'', is undoubtedly his most elaborated historical-geographical work. The onset of US military action since 2001 has provoked a blistering critique – in ''[[The New Imperialism]]'' (2003) he argues that the war in Iraq allows US neo-conservatives to divert attention from the failures of capitalism 'at home'. His next work, ''[[A Brief History of Neoliberalism]]'' (2005), provides an historical examination of the theory and divergent practices of neoliberalism since the mid-1970s. This work conceptualises the neoliberalised global [[political economy]] as a system that benefits few at the expense of many, and which has resulted in the (re)creation of class distinction through what Harvey calls "[[accumulation by dispossession]]". His book ''The Enigma of Capital'' (2010) takes a long view of the contemporary economic crisis. Harvey explains how capitalism came to dominate the world and why it resulted in the financial crisis. He describes that the essence of capitalism is its amorality and lawlessness and to talk of a regulated, ethical capitalism is to make a fundamental error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David Harvey |title=The enigma of capital: and the crises of capitalism |publisher=Profile Books |year=2010 |isbn=1-84765-201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of events linked to this book across London academic forums, such as the LSE, proved hugely popular and sparked a new interest in Harvey's work.

Harvey returned to Johns Hopkins from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1993, but spent increasing time elsewhere as a speaker and visitor, notably as a salaried Miliband Fellow at the [[London School of Economics]] in the late 1990s. In 1996, he delivered the [[Ellen Churchill Semple]] lecture at [[Department of Geography, University of Kentucky|UK Geography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.as.uky.edu/semple-day Ellen Churchill Semple Day] (accessed 30 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the [[City University of New York]] in 2001 as a Distinguished Professor, now residing in its Department of Anthropology. He has spent most of his academic career in Anglo-America, with brief sojourns in France and a range of foreign visiting appointments (currently as acting Advisory Professor at Tongji University in Shanghai). He has supervised many PhD students. Several of these, such as [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]], Richard Walker, [[Erik Swyngedouw]], Michael Johns, Maarten Hajer, Patrick Bond, Melissa Wright, and Greg Ruiters now hold or held important academic positions themselves. In 2013 Harvey was asked by the Republic of Ecuador to help set up the National Strategic Center for the Right to the Territory (CENEDET),&lt;ref&gt;CEDENET Ecuador [https://cenedet.wordpress.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; which he directed with the urbanist [[Miguel Robles-Durán]] until its alleged forced closure in 2017. 

Critical response to Harvey's work has been sustained. In the early years, there was competition between Harvey and proponents of quantitative and non-politicized geography, notably [[Brian Berry]]. A recent critical appraisal (Castree &amp; [[Derek Gregory|Gregory]], 2006) explores some critiques of Harvey in detail. 

===Reading Marx's ''Capital''===
Two constants in Harvey's life and work have been teaching a course on Marx's ''Capital''&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, D. 2008 [http://davidharvey.org/ "Reading Marx's Capital"] An open course consisting of a close reading of the text of Marx's Capital Volume I in 13 video lectures by David Harvey.&lt;/ref&gt; and his support for student activism and community and labour movements (notably in Baltimore). His course was put into a Youtube lecture series,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBazR59SZXk&lt;/ref&gt; which gained immense popularity and resulted in two companion books for the two volumes of Marx's ''Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=David|title=A Companion to Marx's Capital|date=2010|publisher=Verso Books|isbn=1844673596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
David Harvey is widely recognized as a foundational scholar in [[urban geography]].&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. and Gregory, D. eds., 2008. David Harvey: a critical reader. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey's books have been widely translated. He holds honorary doctorates from Roskilde (Denmark), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Faculty of Social Sciences at [[Uppsala University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt; (Sweden), Ohio State University (USA), Lund University (Sweden) and the University of Kent (UK). Among other awards he has received the Anders Retzius Gold Medal of the [[Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography]], the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Lauréat Prix International de Géographie Vautrin Lud|Vautrin Lud International Prize]] in Geography (France). He was made a fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1998, and was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2007. He is a member of the Interim Committee for the emerging International Organization for a Participatory Society.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.iopsociety.org/interim-committee International Organization for a Participatory Society – Interim Committee] Retrieved 2012-3-31&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Belarus''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Министерство обороны Республики Беларусь; [[Belarusian language]]: Мiнiстэрства абароны Рэспублікі Беларусь) is the government organisation that is charged with the duties of raising and maintaining the [[Armed Forces of Belarus]]. The formation of the ministry began in March 1992, after the events of 1991 in which the [[Soviet Union]] had effectively dissolved. The ministry was formed on the basis of the former Headquarters of the [[Soviet Army]]'s [[Belorussian Military District]].

'''ESDS Government''' is a national data service which provides large-scale government surveys, such as the [[General Household Survey]] and the [[Labour Force Survey]], as well as other key data resources for understanding population structure and change in the UK and its constituent countries. It is jointly funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) and the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC). 

In July 2012, the ESRC announced that all of ESDS will join the UK Data Service, to be established as of October 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New national digital repository for social and economic data|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-and-events/press-releases/22231/new-national-digital-repository-for-social-and-economic-data.aspx|publisher=Economic and Social Data Service|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Service overview==

Some examples of the research supported by the surveys include: 

* resources, health and living conditions of older people 
* ethnic differences in family and household composition
* patterns of consumption, including drinking and smoking
* gender and ethnic differences in employment earnings
* lifestyle, consumption and health patterns
* social capital and its relationship to health, employment and earnings
* comparisons across different UK regions and across different time periods

ESDS Government is led by the [[Cathie Marsh Centre for Census and Survey Research]] (CCSR) and provides user support, facilitates user meetings on specific surveys, organises training courses on topics of interest, on specific statistical software packages and on statistical analysis methods as well as provides topic-related online course materials and a range of teaching datasets. 

One of the central aims of the service is to promote and facilitate increased and more effective use of government datasets in research, learning and teaching across a range of disciplines. 

The acquisition, processing and delivery of the large-scale government datasets under this service is undertaken by the [[UK Data Archive]]. Data is available both via download and online exploration and visualisation via [http://nesstar.esds.ac.uk/webview/index.jsp Nesstar].

The '''Farmers' Assemblies''' ({{lang-et|Põllumeeste Kogud}}) was a conservative political party in [[Estonia]]. Led by [[Konstantin Päts]], it was the ruling party for most of the inter-war period.

==History==
The '''Rural League''' (''Maarahva Liit'') was formed in 1917 following an article in the ''[[Postimees]]'' newspaper by members of the Southern Estonian Farmers' Central Society, which called for the rural population to form political groups to represent themselves.&lt;ref name=VM&gt;Vincent E McHale (1983) ''Political parties of Europe'', Greenwood Press, p378 {{ISBN|0-313-23804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new party published the ''Maaliit'' newspaper.&lt;ref name=VM/&gt; In the [[Estonian Provincial Assembly election, 1917|Provincial Assembly elections]] later in the year the League received 22% of the vote and emerged as the largest party in the Assembly, holding 13 of the 62 seats.&lt;ref name=VM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Revenge of the Past |last=Suny |first=Ronald Grigor |page=54 |year=1993 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-8047-2247-6 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4efW7SvG0YC&amp;pg=PA54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the elections the party became part of the [[Democratic Bloc (Estonia)|Democratic Bloc]] alongside the [[Estonian Democratic Party]] and the [[Estonian Radical Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name=VM/&gt; The Bloc received around 23% of the vote in the February 1918 [[Estonian Constituent Assembly election, 1918|Constituent Assembly elections]], which was cancelled. At the time the League was considering inviting the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] to occupy Estonia to ward off Russian Bolsheviks.&lt;ref name=VM/&gt; [[Konstantin Päts]] then joined the League to prevent this idea being implemented, and became its leader.&lt;ref name=VM/&gt;

In the [[Estonian Constituent Assembly election, 1919|1919 Constituent Assembly elections]], the League performed poorly, winning only eight of the 120 seats and finishing in fourth place. The [[Estonian Labour Party]] government subsequently enacted radical land reforms that redistributed land to landless farmers. This policy was opposed by the Rural League, who saw a large increase in support in the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1920|1920 elections]] amongst the new landowners who had drifted to the right following their gains.&lt;ref name=V1/&gt; The results saw the League finish second with 21 of the 100 seats in the [[Riigikogu]], and Päts became [[Head of State of Estonia|Head of State]].

In 1921 the party was reorganised, and renamed the '''Farmers' Assemblies''', with the ''Maaliit'' newspaper renamed ''Kaja''.&lt;ref name=V1&gt;McHale, p379&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 a split saw some liberal members leave the party to form the [[Settlers' Party]].&lt;ref name=V1/&gt; The [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1923|1923 elections]] saw the party become the largest in the Riigikogu, winning 23 seats. Päts remained Head of State.

The [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1926|1926 elections]] saw the party retain its 23 seats. Although the [[Estonian Socialist Workers' Party]] become the largest faction in the Riigikogu, Farmers' Assemblies member [[Jaan Teemant]] remained Head of State, having taken office in December 1925. The party remained the second largest faction in the Riigikogu following the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1929|1929 elections]], in which it won 24 seats.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p586 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Otto Strandman]] of the [[Estonian Labour Party|Labour Party]] was able to form a government.

Prior to the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1932|1932 elections]] the party merged with the [[Settlers' Party]] to form the [[Union of Settlers and Smallholders]],&lt;ref name=N2&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p579&lt;/ref&gt; with the new party winning 42 of the 100 seats.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p587&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 a large conservative faction of the Farmers' Assemblies left the Union to re-establish the party. All parties were banned on 6 March 1935,&lt;ref&gt;McHale, p371&lt;/ref&gt; but during the Soviet occupation the party continued in exile in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;McHale, p380&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978''' ("'''FISA'''" {{USStatute|95|511|92|1783}}, {{usctc|50|36}}) is a [[Law of the United States|United States federal law]] which establishes procedures for the physical and electronic [[surveillance]] and collection of "foreign intelligence information" between "foreign powers" and "agents of foreign powers" suspected of [[espionage]] or [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="fisa"&gt;50 USC §1801(b)
"'Agent of a foreign power' means—&lt;br /&gt;
(1) any person other than a United States person, who—
(A) acts in the United States as an officer or employee of a foreign power, or as a member of a foreign power as defined in subsection (a)(4), irrespective of whether the person is inside the United States;
(B) acts for or on behalf of a foreign power which engages in clandestine intelligence activities in the United States contrary to the interests of the United States, when the circumstances indicate that such person may engage in such activities, or when such person knowingly aids or abets any person in the conduct of such activities or knowingly conspires with any person to engage in such activities;
(C) engages in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefore;
(D) engages in the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or activities in preparation therefor; or

(2) any person who—
(A) knowingly engages in clandestine intelligence gathering activities for or on behalf of a foreign power, which activities involve or may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States;
(B) pursuant to the direction of an intelligence service or network of a foreign power, knowingly engages in any other clandestine intelligence activities for or on behalf of such foreign power, which activities involve or are about to involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States;

(E) knowingly aids or abets any person in the conduct of activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) or knowingly conspires with any person to engage in activities described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).&lt;/ref&gt; The Act created the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC) to oversee requests for surveillance warrants by [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement]] and [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence agencies]]. It has been repeatedly amended since the [[September 11 attacks]].

==History==
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was introduced on May 18, 1977, by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] and was signed into law by President Carter on 25 October 1978. The bill was cosponsored by nine Senators: [[Birch Bayh]], [[James O. Eastland]], [[Jake Garn]], [[Walter Huddleston]], [[Daniel Inouye]], [[Charles Mathias]], [[John L. McClellan]], [[Gaylord Nelson]], and [[Strom Thurmond]].

The FISA resulted from extensive investigations by [[United States Senate#Committees|Senate Committees]] into the legality of domestic [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] activities. These investigations were led separately by [[Sam Ervin]] and [[Frank Church]] in 1978 as a response to President [[Richard Nixon]]’s usage of federal resources, including law enforcement agencies, to spy on political and activist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=15892 |title=FISA Debate Involves More Than Terrorism – Daily Nexus |accessdate=2009-01-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123213757/http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=15892 |archivedate=January 23, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arrigo2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce A.

The act was created to provide judicial and congressional oversight of the government's covert surveillance activities of foreign entities and individuals in the United States, while maintaining the secrecy needed to protect national security.

===Warrantless domestic wiretapping program===
{{Main|NSA warrantless surveillance controversy}}
The Act came into public prominence in December 2005 following publication by ''[[The New York Times]]'' of an article&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/1216-01.htm "Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts" (Dec. 16, 2005)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206162614/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/1216-01.htm |date=February 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that described a program of [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless domestic wiretapping]] ordered by the Bush administration and carried out by the [[National Security Agency]] since 2002; a subsequent [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] article&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=abIV0cO64zJE Spy Agency Sought U.S. Call Records Before 9/11, Lawyers Say] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719031932/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=abIV0cO64zJE |date=July 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that this may have already begun by June 2000.

==Provisions==
The subchapters of FISA provide for:
* Electronic surveillance ({{usctc|50|36|I}})
* Physical [[Search and seizure|searches]] ({{usctc|50|36|II}})
* [[Pen register]]s and trap &amp; trace devices for foreign intelligence purposes ({{usctc|50|36|III}})
* Access to certain business records for foreign intelligence purposes ({{usctc|50|36|IV}})
* Reporting requirement ({{usctc|50|36|V}})

===Electronic surveillance===
Generally, the statute permits electronic surveillance in two different scenarios.

====Without a court order====
The President may authorize, through the [[Attorney General]], electronic surveillance without a court order for the period of one year, provided that it is only to acquire foreign intelligence information,&lt;ref name="fisa1801" /&gt; that it is solely directed at communications or property controlled exclusively by foreign powers,&lt;ref name="foreignpower"&gt;{{usc|50|1801}}(a) Definition of Foreign power&lt;/ref&gt; that there is no substantial likelihood that it will acquire the contents of any communication to which a [[United States person]] is a party, and that it be conducted only in accordance with defined minimization procedures.&lt;ref name="warrantless"&gt;{{USC|50|1802(a)(1)}}, Conditions under which the President, through the Attorney General, may authorize electronic surveillance without a court order&lt;/ref&gt;

The code defines "foreign intelligence information" to mean information necessary to protect the United States against actual or potential grave attack, [[sabotage]] or [[international terrorism]].&lt;ref name="fisa1801"&gt;{{usc|50|1801}}(e) Definition of Foreign intelligence information&lt;/ref&gt;

"Foreign powers" means a foreign government, any faction of a foreign nation not substantially composed of [[US person|U.S. persons]], and any entity directed or controlled by a foreign government.&lt;ref&gt;§§1801(a)(1)–(3)&lt;/ref&gt; The definition also includes groups engaged in international terrorism and foreign political organizations.&lt;ref&gt;§§1801(a)(4) and (5)&lt;/ref&gt; The sections of FISA authorizing electronic surveillance and physical searches without a court order specifically exclude their application to groups engaged in international terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' §1802(a)(1) (referring specifically to §1801(a)(1), (2), and (3)).&lt;/ref&gt;

A "U.S. person" includes citizens, lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens, and corporations incorporated in the United States.

"Minimization procedures" limit the collection of information concerning United States persons by protecting their identities and requiring a court order to retain the communications for longer than 72 hours. The communications can be retained without court order if there is evidence of a crime. Identification of a US person, known as "unmasking", may also be authorized if an agency believes it is necessary in order to understand the intelligence or believes that the person was committing a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watkins|first1=Eli|title='Unmasking,' FISA and other terms to help you understand the wiretapping story|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/23/politics/nsa-terms-glossary/|accessdate=April 4, 2017|work=CNN.com|agency=Cable News Network|issue=March 23, 2017|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Attorney General is required to make a certification of these conditions under seal to the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]],&lt;ref name="reportfiscunderseal"&gt;{{USC|50|1802(a)(3)}}, Requirement of the Attorney General's to file reports under seal on warrantless surveillance to the FISC&lt;/ref&gt; and report on their compliance to the [[U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] and the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]].&lt;ref name="reportcongresscompliance"&gt;{{USC|50|1802(a)(2)}}, Requirement of the Attorney General's to report on compliance with warrantless surveillance requirements to Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

Since {{usc|50|1802}}(a)(1)(A) of this Act specifically limits warrantless surveillance to foreign powers as defined by 50 U.S.C. §1801(a) (1),(2), (3) and omits the definitions contained in 50 U.S.C. §1801(a) (4),(5),(6) the act does not authorize the use of warrantless surveillance on: groups engaged in international terrorism or activities in preparation thereof; foreign-based political organizations, not substantially composed of United States persons; or entities that are directed and controlled by a foreign government or governments.&lt;ref name="excludeddefinitions"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1802-#a_1_A 50 U.S.C. §1802 (a)(1)(A)] The limitation of warrantless surveillance to foreign powers as defined in 50 U.S.C § 1801 (a) (1),(2), and (3)&lt;/ref&gt; Under FISA, anyone who engages in electronic surveillance except as authorized by statute is subject to both criminal penalties&lt;ref name="criminal"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1809- 50 U.S.C. §1809] – Criminal sanctions&lt;/ref&gt; and civil liabilities.&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1810- 50 U.S.C. §1810] – Civil liability&lt;/ref&gt;

Under 50 U.S.C. § 1811, the President may also authorize warrantless surveillance at the beginning of a war. Specifically, he may authorize such surveillance "for a period not to exceed fifteen calendar days following a declaration of war by the Congress".&lt;ref name="war exception"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1811- 50 U.S.C. § 1811] – Authorization during time of war&lt;/ref&gt;

====With a court order====
{{see also|Masking and unmasking by intelligence agencies}}
Alternatively, the government may seek a court order permitting the surveillance using the FIS court.&lt;ref name="warrant"&gt;{{usc|50|1805}}(a) Electronic surveillance with a court order&lt;/ref&gt; Approval of a FISA application requires the court find [[probable cause]] that the target of the surveillance be a "foreign power" or an "agent of a foreign power", and that the places at which surveillance is requested is used or will be used by that foreign power or its agent.[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/IC-book-finalasof12JUNE.pdf]&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbach, Eric, and Aki J. Peritz. Confrontation or Collaboration? Congress and the Intelligence Community. Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. June 12, 2009. Harvard Kennedy School. July 21, 2009 [http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/IC-book-finalasof12JUNE.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the court must find that the proposed surveillance meet certain "minimization requirements" for information pertaining to U.S. persons.&lt;ref name="minimization"&gt;{{usc|50|1801}}(h) Minimization procedures definition&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the type of surveillance, approved orders or extensions of orders may be active for 90 days, 120 days, or a year.&lt;ref name="duration"&gt;{{usc|50|1805}}(d) Duration of order; extensions; review of circumstances under which information was acquired, retained or disseminated&lt;/ref&gt; FISA warrants require renewal depending on the type of surveillance and type of warrant either every 90 days (if targeting a U.S. person) or 120 days (if targeting a non-U.S. person).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.justsecurity.org/45255/fisa-warrants-paul-manafort-muellers-investigation/|title=What the FISA Warrants Against Paul Manafort Tell Us About Mueller’s Investigation|date=2017-09-23|work=Just Security|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FISA court===
{{Main|United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court}}
The Act created the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISC) and enabled it to oversee requests for surveillance warrants by [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement]] and [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence agencies]] (primarily the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[National Security Agency]]) against suspected foreign [[secret agent|intelligence agents]] inside the U.S. The court is located within the [[E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The court is staffed by eleven judges appointed by the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] to serve seven-year terms.

Proceedings before the FISA court are ''[[ex parte]]'' and non-adversarial. The court hears evidence presented solely by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. There is no provision for a release of information regarding such hearings, or for the record of information actually collected.  The [[USA Freedom Act]] (Section 402), however, requires the government to  declassify and publicly release "to the greatest extent practicable" each order, decision and opinion of the court if it contains a "significant construction or interpretation of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2048/text|title=Text - H.R.2048 - 114th Congress (2015-2016): USA FREEDOM Act of 2015|last=F.|first=Sensenbrenner,|date=2015-06-02|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review}}
Denials of FISA applications by the FISC may be appealed to the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review]]. The Court of Review is a three judge panel. Since its creation, the court has come into session twice: in 2002 and 2008.

FISC meets in secret, and approves or denies requests for [[search warrants]]. Only the number of warrants applied for, issued and denied, is reported. In 1980 (the first full year after its inception), it approved 322 warrants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/1980rept.html Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 1980 Annual Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This number has steadily grown to 2,224 warrants in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/2006rept.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the period 1979–2006, a total of 22,990 applications for warrants were made to the Court of which 22,985 were approved (sometimes with modifications; or with the splitting up, or combining together, of warrants for legal purposes), and only 5 were definitively rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/stats/fisa_stats.html EPIC: FISA Orders 1979–2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical searches===
In addition to electronic surveillance, FISA permits the "physical search" of the "premises, information, material, or property used exclusively by" a foreign power. The requirements and procedures are nearly identical to those for electronic surveillance.

===Remedies for violations===
Both the subchapters covering physical searches and electronic surveillance provide for criminal and civil liability for violations of FISA.

Criminal sanctions follows violations of electronic surveillance by ''[[intent (law)|intentionally]]'' engaging in electronic surveillance under the [[color of law]] or through disclosing information known to have been obtained through unauthorized surveillance. The penalties for either act are fines up to US$10,000, up to five years in jail, or both.&lt;ref name="criminal" /&gt;

In addition, the statute creates a [[cause of action]] for private individuals whose communications were unlawfully monitored. The statute permits actual [[damages]] of not less than $1,000 or $100 per day. In addition, that statute authorizes [[punitive damages]] and an award of [[attorney's fees]].&lt;ref name="civil" /&gt; Similar liability is found under the subchapter pertaining to physical searches. In both cases, the statute creates an [[affirmative defense]] for law enforcement personnel acting within their official duties and pursuant to a valid court order. Presumably, such a defense is not available to those operating exclusively under presidential authorization.

===Lone wolf amendment===
In 2004, FISA was amended to include a "lone wolf" provision. {{USC|50|1801(b)(1)(C)}}. A "lone wolf" is a non-U.S. person who engages in or prepares for international terrorism. The provision amended the definition of "foreign power" to permit the FISA courts to issue surveillance and physical search orders without having to find a connection between the "lone wolf" and a foreign government or terrorist group. However, "if the court authorizes such a surveillance or physical search using this new definition of 'agent of a foreign power', the FISC judge has to find, in pertinent part, that, based upon the information provided by the applicant for the order, the target had engaged in or was engaging in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor".&lt;ref name="lonewolf"&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/crs/RS22011.pdf "Lone Wolf" Amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act], via fas.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutionality==

===Before FISA===
In 1967, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the requirements of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] applied equally to electronic surveillance and to physical searches. ''[[Katz v. United States]]'', 389 U.S. 347 (1967). The Court did not address whether such requirements apply to issues of [[national security]]. Shortly after, in 1972, the Court took up the issue again in ''[[United States v. U.S. District Court|United States v. United States District Court, Plamondon]]'', where the court held that court approval was required in order for the domestic surveillance to satisfy the Fourth Amendment. 407 U.S. 297 (1972). Justice [[Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.|Powell]] wrote that the decision did not address this issue that "may be involved with respect to activities of foreign powers or their agents".

In the time immediately preceding FISA, a number of courts squarely addressed the issue of "warrantless wiretaps". In both ''United States v. Brown'', 484 F.2d 418 (5th Cir. 1973), and ''United States v. Butenko'', 494 F.2d 593 (3rd Cir. 1974), the courts upheld warrantless wiretaps. In ''Brown'', a U.S. citizen's conversation was captured by a wiretap authorized by the Attorney General for foreign intelligence purposes. In ''Butenko'', the court held a wiretap valid if the primary purpose was for gathering foreign intelligence information.

A plurality opinion in ''Zweibon v. Mitchell'', 516 F.2d 594 (D.C. Cir. 1975), held that a warrant was required for the domestic surveillance of a domestic organization. In this case, the court found that the domestic organization was not a "foreign power or their agent", and "absent exigent circumstances, all warrantless electronic surveillance is unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional."

===Post-FISA===
There have been very few cases involving the [[constitutional]]ity of FISA. Two lower court decisions found FISA constitutional. In ''United States v. Duggan'', the [[defendant]]s were members of the [[Irish Republican Army]]. 743 F.2d 59 (2nd Cir., 1984). They were convicted for various violations regarding the shipment of [[explosive]]s and [[firearm]]s. The court held that there were compelling considerations of national security in the distinction between the treatment of U.S. citizens and non-resident aliens.

In the ''United States v. Nicholson'', the defendant moved to suppress all [[evidence (law)|evidence]] gathered under a FISA order. 955 F.Supp. 588 (Va. 1997). The court affirmed the denial of the motion. There the court flatly rejected claims that FISA violated [[Due process clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], [[Equal protection]], [[Separation of powers]], nor the [[Right to counsel]] provided by the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]].

However, in a third case, the special review court for FISA, the equivalent of a Circuit Court of Appeals, opined differently should FISA limit the President's inherent authority for warrantless searches in the foreign intelligence area. In ''In re Sealed Case'', 310 F.3d 717, 742 (Foreign Intel. Surv. Ct. of Rev. 2002) the special court stated "[A]ll the other courts to have decided the issue [have] held that the President did have inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information . ... We take for granted that the President does have that authority and, assuming that is so, FISA could not encroach on the President's constitutional power."

Rev. L. &amp; Sec., No. VII Supl. (Spring 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

John R. Schmidt, associate attorney general (1994–1997) in the Justice Department under President Bill Clinton, expressed a need for programmatic approval of technology-enabled surveillance programs.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0602120419feb12,0,6895976.story?coll=chi-newsopinioncommentary-hed A historical solution to the Bush spying issue],"  ''Chicago Tribune'' (February 12, 2006)  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled early arguments made by then-Attorney General [[Edward Levi]] to the [[Church Committee]] that foreign intelligence surveillance legislation should include provisions for programmatically authorizing surveillance programs because of the particular needs of foreign intelligence where "virtually continuous surveillance, which by its nature does not have specifically predetermined targets" may be required. In these situations, "the efficiency of a warrant requirement would be minimal."

In a 2006 opinion, Judge [[Richard Posner]] wrote that FISA "retains value as a framework for monitoring the communications of known terrorists, but it is hopeless as a framework for detecting terrorists. [FISA] requires that surveillance be conducted pursuant to warrants based on probable cause to believe that the target of surveillance is a terrorist, when the desperate need is to find out who is a terrorist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard A.

==Subsequent amendments==
The Act was amended in 2001 by the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], primarily to include terrorism on behalf of groups that are not specifically backed by a foreign government.

An overhaul of the bill, the [[Protect America Act of 2007]] was signed into law on August 5, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15419879|title=The Foreign Service Intelligence Act: A Primer |first=Eric |last=Weiner |publisher=National Public Radio|date=October 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It expired on February 17, 2008.

==Amendments==

===Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006===
On March 16, 2006, Senators [[Mike DeWine]] (R-OH), [[Lindsey Graham]] (R-SC), [[Chuck Hagel]] (R-NE), and [[Olympia Snowe]] (R-ME) introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 (S.2455),&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/congress/2006_cr/dewine031606.html Press Release of Senator DeWine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdt.org/security/20060324dewinebill.pdf Dewine Bill as introduced]&lt;/ref&gt; under which the President would be given certain additional limited statutory authority to conduct electronic surveillance of suspected terrorists in the United States subject to enhanced Congressional oversight. Also on March 16, 2006, Senator [[Arlen Specter]] (R-PA) introduced the [[National Security Surveillance Act of 2006]] ({{USBill|110|S.|2453}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://information-retrieval.info/docs/SpecterFloorStmt.pdf Specter Floor Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://information-retrieval.info/docs/NSAfinal.pdf Specter Bill as introduced]&lt;/ref&gt; which would amend FISA to grant retroactive amnesty&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060801992.html Specter Offers Compromise on NSA Surveillance], ''The Washington Post'', June 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; for warrantless surveillance conducted under presidential authority and provide FISA court (FISC) jurisdiction to review, authorize, and oversight "electronic surveillance programs". On May 24, 2006, Senator Specter and Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA) introduced the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and Enhancement Act]] of 2006 ({{USBill|110|S.|3001}}) asserting FISA as the exclusive means to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance.

All three competing bills were the subject of Judiciary Committee hearings throughout the summer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/congress/2006_hr/index.html#fisa4 FIS linking to 2006 FISA Congressional Hearings material]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, 2006, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to approve all three mutually exclusive bills, thus, leaving it to the full Senate to resolve.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/blog/secrecy/2006/09/conflicting_bills_on_warrantle.html Conflicting Bills on Warrantless Surveillance Advance in Senate], Secrecy News, September 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, 2006, U.S. Representative [[Heather Wilson]] (R-NM) introduced the [[Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act]] ({{USBill|110|H.R.|5825}}). Wilson's bill would give the President the authority to authorize electronic surveillance of international phone calls and e-mail linked specifically to identified terrorist groups immediately following or in anticipation of an armed or terrorist attack on the United States. Surveillance beyond the initial authorized period would require a FISA warrant or a presidential certification to Congress. On September 28, 2006, the House of Representatives passed Wilson's bill and it was referred to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wilson.house.gov/NewsAction.asp?FormMode=Releases&amp;ID=1309 |title=House Passes Wilson FISA Bill |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, Press Release, September 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protect America Act of 2007===
{{Main|Protect America Act}}
On July 28, 2007, President Bush called on Congress to pass legislation to reform the FISA in order to ease restrictions on surveillance of terrorist suspects where one party (or both parties) to the communication are located overseas. He asked that Congress pass the legislation before its August 2007 recess. On August 3, 2007, the Senate passed a Republican-sponsored version of FISA ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071222101804/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s1927/show S. 1927]) in a vote of 60 to 28. The House followed by passing the bill, 227–183. The [[Protect America Act of 2007]] ({{USPL|110|55}}, {{USBill|110|S.|1927}}) was then signed into law by [[George W. Bush]] on 2007-08-05.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/RL34143.pdf|format=PDF|title=P.L. 110-55, the Protect America Act of 2007:Modifications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|last=Bazan|first=Elizabeth|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Protect America Act of 2007, communications that begin or end in a foreign country may be wiretapped by the U.S. government without supervision by the FISA Court. The Act removes from the definition of "electronic surveillance" in FISA any surveillance directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. As such, surveillance of these communications no longer requires a government application to, and order issuing from, the FISA Court.

The Act provides procedures for the government to "certify" the legality of an acquisition program, for the government to issue directives to providers to provide data or assistance under a particular program, and for the government and recipient of a directive to seek from the FISA Court, respectively, an order to compel provider compliance or relief from an unlawful directive. Providers receive costs and full immunity from civil suits for compliance with any directives issued pursuant to the Act.

A summary of key provisions follows. The Act empowers the Attorney General or Director of National Intelligence ("DNI") to authorize, for up to one year, the acquisition of communications concerning "persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States" if the Attorney General and DNI determine that each of five criteria has been met:
* There are reasonable procedures in place for determining that the acquisition concerns persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States;
* The acquisition does not constitute electronic surveillance (meaning it does not involve solely domestic communications);
* The acquisition involves obtaining the communications data from or with the assistance of a communications service provider who has access to communications;
* A significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information; and
* Minimization procedures outlined in the FISA will be used.

This determination by the Attorney General and DNI must be certified in writing, under oath, and supported by appropriate affidavit(s). If immediate action by the government is required and time does not permit the preparation of a certification, the Attorney General or DNI can direct the acquisition orally, with a certification to follow within 72 hours. The certification is then filed with the FISA Court.

Once the certification is filed with the FISA Court, the Attorney General or DNI can direct a provider to undertake or assist in the undertaking of the acquisition.

If a provider fails to comply with a directive issued by the Attorney General or DNI, the Attorney General may seek an order from the FISA Court compelling compliance with the directive. Failure to obey an order of the FISA Court may be punished as a contempt of court.

Likewise, a person receiving a directive may challenge the legality of that directive by filing a petition with the FISA Court. An initial review must be conducted within 48 hours of the filing to determine whether the petition is frivolous, and a final determination concerning any non-frivolous petitions must be made – in writing – within 72 hours of receipt of the petition.

Determinations of the FISA Court may be appealed to the Foreign Intelligence Court of Appeals, and a petition for a [[writ of certiorari]] of a decision from the FICA can be made to the U.S. Supreme Court.

All petitions must be filed under seal.

The Act allows providers to be compensated, at the prevailing rate, for providing assistance as directed by the Attorney General or DNI.

The Act provides explicit immunity from civil suit in any federal or state court for providing any information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with a directive under the Act.

Within 120 days, the Attorney General must submit to the FISA Court for its approval the procedures by which the government will determine that acquisitions authorized by the Act conform with the Act and do not involve purely domestic communications. The FISA Court then will determine whether the procedures comply with the Act. The FISA Court thereafter will enter an order either approving the procedures or directing the government to submit new procedures within 30 days or cease any acquisitions under the government procedures. The government may appeal a ruling of the FISA Court to the FICA and ultimately the Supreme Court.

On a semiannual basis, the Attorney General shall inform the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate of incidents of noncompliance with a directive issued by the Attorney General or the DNI, incidents of noncompliance with FISA Court-approved procedures by the Intelligence Community, and the number of certifications and directives issued during the reporting period.

The amendments to FISA made by the Act expire 180 days after enactment, except that any order in effect on the date of enactment remains in effect until the date of expiration of such order and such orders can be reauthorized by the FISA Court.&lt;ref name="DigestibleLaw.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sussmann |first=Michael |title=FISA Amended to Allow Acquisition of Cross-Border Communications Without a Court Order |publisher=DigestibleLaw.com |date=August 6, 2007 |url=http://www.digestiblelaw.com/advertising/blogQ.aspx?entry=3915&amp;id=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929032559/http://www.digestiblelaw.com/advertising/blogQ.aspx?entry=3915&amp;id=1 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act expired on February 17, 2008.

====Subsequent developments====
&lt;!-- {{split-section|FISA Amendments Act of 2008}} See talk page --&gt;
Legal experts experienced in national security issues are divided on how broadly the new law could be interpreted or applied. Some believe that due to subtle changes in the definitions of terms such as "electronic surveillance", it could empower the government to conduct warrantless physical searches and even seizures of communications and computer devices and their data which belong to U.S. citizens while they are in the United States, if the government contended that those searches and potential seizures were related to its surveillance of parties outside the United States. Intelligence officials, while declining to comment directly on such possibilities, respond that such interpretations are overly broad readings of the act, and unlikely to actually occur.

In a September 10, 2007 address at a symposium on modernizing FISA held at [[Georgetown University Law Center]]'s National Security Center, [[Ken Wainstein|Kenneth L. Wainstein]], [[Assistant Attorney General of the United States|Assistant Attorney General for National Security]], argued against the current six-month [[sunset provision]] in the Protect America Act of 2007, saying that the broadened surveillance powers the act provides for should be made permanent. Wainstein proposed that internal audits by the Office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] and the [[United States Department of Justice National Security Division|National Security Division of the Justice Department]], with reporting to select groups of Congressmen, would ensure that the expanded capability would not be abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ryan Singel |title=Government Promises to Self-Audit Spying to Make Powers Permanent |work=Wired|date=September 11, 2007 |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/09/government-prom.html |accessdate=September 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on September 10, DNI [[John Michael McConnell|Mike McConnell]] testified before the [[Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] that the Protect America Act had helped foil a major terror plot in Germany. U.S. intelligence-community officials questioned the accuracy of McConnell's testimony and urged his office to correct it, which he did in a statement issued September 12, 2007. Critics cited the incident as an example of the Bush administration's exaggerated claims and contradictory statements about surveillance activities. Counterterrorism officials familiar with the background of McConnell's testimony said they did not believe he made inaccurate statements intentionally as part of any strategy by the administration to persuade Congress to make the new eavesdropping law permanent. Those officials said they believed McConnell gave the wrong answer because he was overwhelmed with information and merely mixed up his facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Michael Isikoff |author2=Mark Hosenball |title=Spy Master Admits Error |work=Newsweek|date=September 12, 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20749773/site/newsweek/page/0/ |accessdate=September 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105014108/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20749773/site/newsweek/page/0/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=November 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at [[National Security Agency]] headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland on September 19, 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] urged Congress to make the provisions of the Protect America Act permanent. Bush also called for retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies who had cooperated with government surveillance efforts, saying, "It's particularly important for Congress to provide meaningful liability protection to those companies now facing multibillion-dollar lawsuits only because they are believed to have assisted in efforts to defend our nation, following the 9/11 attacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anne Broache |title=President Bush rallies for immortal spy law changes, telco protection |publisher=CNET News.com |date=September 12, 2007 |url=http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9781991-7.html |accessdate=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2007, the bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee of the [[Constitution Project]], co-chaired by [[David Keene]] and [[David D. Cole]], issued its "Statement on the Protect America Act".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Statement%20on%20PAA1.pdf May 21, 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Statement urged Congress not to reauthorize the PAA, saying the language of the bill "runs contrary to the tripartite balance of power the Framers envisioned for our constitutional democracy, and poses a serious threat to the very notion of government of the people, by the people and for the people". Some in the legal community have questioned the constitutionality of any legislation that would retroactively immunize telecommunications firms alleged to have cooperated with the government from civil liability for having potentially violated their customers' privacy rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anthony J. Seebok |title=Is It Constitutional for the Senate to Retroactively Immunize From Civil Liability the Telecoms That Provided the Government with Information About Customers' Communications? |publisher=FindLaw Writ Legal News and Commentary |date=January 29, 2008 |url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=/sebok/20080129.html |accessdate=February 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302033755/http://writ.news.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=%2Fsebok%2F20080129.html |archivedate=March 2, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article appearing in the January/February 2008 issue of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] journal of Security and Privacy, noted technology experts from academia and the computing industry found significant flaws in the technical implementation of the Protect America Act which they said created serious security risks, including the danger that such a surveillance system could be exploited by unauthorized users, criminally misused by trusted insiders, or abused by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Steven M.

On October 7, 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that House Democrats planned to introduce alternative legislation which would provide for one-year "umbrella" warrants, and would require the Justice Department inspector general to audit the use of those warrants and issue quarterly reports to a special FISA court and to Congress. The proposed bill would not include immunity for telecommunications firms facing lawsuits in connection with the administration's [[NSA warrantless surveillance]] program. House Democrats said that as long as the administration withholds requested documents explaining the basis for the program that they cannot consider immunity for firms alleged to have facilitated it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ellen Nakashima |title=Democrats to Offer New Surveillance Rules |work=The Washington Post |date=October 7, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/06/AR2007100601265_pf.html |accessdate=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, 2007 comments on the White House South Lawn, President Bush said he would not sign any bill that did not provide retroactive immunity for telecommunications corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[David Stout]] |title=Bush Presses Congress on New Eavesdropping Law |work=The New York Times |date=October 10, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/washington/10cnd-nsa.html?pagewanted=print |accessdate=October 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2007, the House Democratic leadership put off a vote on the proposed legislation by the full chamber to avoid consideration of a Republican measure that made specific references to [[Osama bin Laden]]. At the same time, the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] reportedly reached a compromise with the White House on a different proposal that would give telephone carriers legal immunity for any role they played in the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping program approved by President Bush after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Eric Lichtblau |title=Senate Deal on Immunity for Phone Companies |work=The New York Times |date=October 18, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/washington/18nsa.html?pagewanted=print |accessdate=October 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2007, the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] voted 10–9 along party lines to send an alternative measure to the full Senate other than the one the intelligence committee had crafted with the White House. The proposal would leave to the full Senate whether or not to provide retroactive immunity to telecommunications firms that cooperated with the NSA. Judiciary Committee chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] said that granting such immunity would give the Bush administration a "blank check" to do what it wants without regard to the law. [[Arlen Specter]] of Pennsylvania, the top Republican on the committee, said that court cases may be the only way Congress can learn exactly how far outside the law the administration has gone in eavesdropping in the United States. When the full Senate takes up the bill, Specter is expected to offer a compromise that would shield the companies from financial ruin but allow lawsuits to go forward by having the federal government stand in for the companies at trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pamela Hess |title=Congress Takes Up Terrorist Surveillance |agency=Associated Press |date=November 15, 2007 |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hJKgeE0Z-SivATjok-utYBdh9wDwD8SUD33G0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116203436/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hJKgeE0Z-SivATjok-utYBdh9wDwD8SUD33G0 |archivedate=November 16, 2007 |accessdate=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2013|9|4}}

On the same day, the House of Representatives voted 227–189 to approve a Democratic bill that would expand court oversight of government surveillance inside the United States while denying immunity to telecom companies. [[House Judiciary Committee]] chairman [[John Conyers]] left the door open to an immunity deal in the future, but said that the White House must first give Congress access to classified documents specifying what the companies did that requires legal immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pamela Hess |title=House OKs Surveillance Oversight Bill |agency=Associated Press |date=November 15, 2007 |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hJKgeE0Z-SivATjok-utYBdh9wDwD8SUFI800 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118005441/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hJKgeE0Z-SivATjok-utYBdh9wDwD8SUFI800 |archivedate=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 amendment of FISA gave telecoms immunity, increased the time allotted for warrantless surveillance, and adds provisions for emergency eavesdropping. On June 20, 2008, the House of Representatives passed the amendment with a vote of 293 to 129.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/06/20/ST2008062001087.html |title=House Passes Spy Bill; Senate Expected to Follow|first=Paul|last=Kane|work=The Washington Post|date=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=House&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll437.xml|title=Final Vote Results For Roll Call 437, June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It passed in the Senate 69 to 28 on July 9, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00168|title=Vote Summary On A bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to establish a procedure for authorizing certain acquisitions of foreign intelligence, and for other purposes.|publisher=senate.gov|date=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a failed attempt to strike Title II from the bill by Senator Dodd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00164

===2015 USA Freedom Act===
On June 2, 2015, many provisions of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were changed with the passage of the [[USA Freedom Act]].&lt;ref name=iopppkk&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2048/text&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2015 law overhauled the powerful United States [[National Security Agency]] and required the US government to undergo standard court procedures in order to gather data regarding suspicious activities.&lt;ref name=iopppkk /&gt;  However, the law did not completely repeal the controversial Patriot Act and allowed some provisions to expire in later time.&lt;ref name=iopppkk /&gt;

===FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017===

The government initiated efforts in late 2016 and throughout 2017 to persuade Congress to extend the surveillance authority in Title VII of the Act, which (pursuant to the 2008 and 2012 amendments noted above) was slated to expire on December 31, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/us/politics/congress-surveillance-nsa-privacy.html|title=Fight Brews Over Push to Shield Americans in Warrantless Surveillance|last=Savage|first=Charlie|date=2017-05-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tom Cotton]], a Republican Senator from Arkansas, introduced a bill to permanently extend the provisions of Title VII with no changes, but the bill did not advance, as many in Congress were seeking reforms to address privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/congress-braces-for-tense-debate-on-surveillance-law|title=Congress Braces for Tense Debate on Surveillance Law|last=Ratnam|first=Gopal|date=2017-09-11|work=Roll Call|access-date=2018-05-05|last2=Ratnam|first2=Gopal|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] introduced an extension bill with significant proposed reforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/us/politics/fisa-warrantless-surveillance-law-reauthorization-debate.html|title=Lawmakers Want Limits on Wiretaps Despite Trump Administration Objections|last=Savage|first=Charlie|date=2017-09-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/bipartisan-group-of-lawmakers-seek-to-impose-new-limit-on-nsa-spy-power/2017/10/04/7296989a-a873-11e7-92d1-58c702d2d975_story.html|title=Bipartisan group of lawmakers seeks to impose new curb on U.S. government spy power|last=Nakashima|first=Ellen|date=2017-10-04|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]], but ultimately a version of the extension with less significant reforms was advanced by [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], and in effect that version, through a complex series of amendments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/139/actions?q=%7B%22search%22:%5B%22FISA+amendments%22%5D%7D&amp;r=5|title=Actions - S.139 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): An Act to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to improve foreign intelligence collection and the safeguards, accountability, and oversight of acquisitions of foreign intelligence, to extend title VII of such Act, and for other purposes.|last=Orrin|first=Hatch,|date=2018-01-19|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was ultimately enacted into law .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/politics/fisa-surveillance-congress-trump.html|title=House Extends Surveillance Law, Rejecting New Privacy Safeguards|last=Savage|first=Charlie|date=2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-05|last2=Sullivan|first2=Eileen|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Fandos|first3=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senate agreed to a House amendment on January 18, 2018 and the President signed the legislation, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-118), into law on January 19, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/139/text|title=Text - S.139 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): An Act to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to improve foreign intelligence collection and the safeguards, accountability, and oversight of acquisitions of foreign intelligence, to extend title VII of such Act, and for other purposes.|last=Hatch|first=Orrin|date=2018-01-19|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law extends Title VII of the Act for six years, to December 31, 2023, and most notably included new restrictions on querying surveillance databases, prohibited the resumption of certain types of collection about a target that were not directly addressed to or from that target, unless Congress approved such collection within 30 days of having been notified of the resumption, and provided for additional reporting by the Executive Branch of surveillance activities.[https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/139/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22FISA+amendments%22%5D%7D&amp;r=5]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/summary-fisa-amendments-reauthorization-act-2017|title=FISA: 702 Collection - Summary: The FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017|date=2018-01-18|work=Lawfare|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122214954/https://www.lawfareblog.com/summary-fisa-amendments-reauthorization-act-2017|archivedate=2018-11-22|author=Emma Kohse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many privacy and civil liberties advocates argued that the reforms enacted by the extension bill were inadequate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-letter-opposing-fisa-amendments-reauthorization-act-2017|title=Coalition Letter Opposing the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017|work=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their arguments were rebutted by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-governments-ability-to-fight-terrorism-is-in-peril/2017/12/14/e4da9dd6-e0e8-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The government’s ability to fight terrorism is in peril|last=Brand|first=Rachel|date=2017-12-14|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/this-surveillance-law-needs-reauthorizing--and-tightening-too/2017/10/08/796a74a8-aa11-11e7-b3aa-c0e2e1d41e38_story.html|title=Opinion {{!}} This surveillance law needs reauthorizing — and tightening, too|last=Board|first=Editorial|date=2017-10-08|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Habineza''' is the founder and chairman of the [[Democratic Green Party of Rwanda]], a political party formed in August 2009 in [[Rwanda]].
In its first year, the party made six unsuccessful attempts to register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As of mid-August 2010 the party was still not registered, and therefore was unable to submit a candidate for the [[Rwandan presidential election, 2010|August 2010 Presidential elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Background==

Habineza was born in [[Mityana]], [[Uganda]] in a Hutu family on 22 February 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwandagreendemocrats.org/frank-habineza%E2%80%99s-profile|title=Frank Habineza’s Profile|publisher=Democratic Green Party of Rwanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He attended the [[National University of Rwanda]] from 1999 to 2004, graduating in Political and Administrative Sciences with a major in Public Administration. While at University he started a student association campaigning for environment protection.
He later became a personal assistant to the Minister of Lands, Environment, Water, Forestry and Mines, [[Drocella Mugorewera]]. He was the official correspondent of Rwanda Newsline and UMUSESO while he was a student in Butare. He also worked for the former ''Rwanda Herald Newspaper'', whose publisher Asuman Bikika was declared 'persona non grata' in mid-2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Habineza was for three years (2006–2009), National Coordinator for the Nile Basin Discourse Forum in Rwanda (NBDF), a civil society platform that had over 50 NGOs involved in the conservation of river Nile. He resigned in May 2009. He was also President of the Rwanda NGOs Forum on Water, Sanitation and Environment-RWASEF and founder Chairman for the Rwandan Environment Conservation Organisation (RECOR). He resigned from all the NGOs when he joined active opposition politics.
In June 2010 these two organizations distanced themselves from him after a report alleged that donor funds had been diverted for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The report, issued by the Ministry of Local Government, named Habineza as one of the people behind "briefcase" NGO's that fleece donors, and named five NGOs as vehicles used by him to obtain funding for political activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Political career==

Habineza founded the Democratic Green Party (DGP) in August 2009 as an alternative to the dominant [[Rwanda Patriotic Front]].&lt;ref name=rnews1764/&gt;
In April 2010 three leading members of the DGP resigned due to disagreements over Habineza's activities. They said that the party was being manipulated by foreigners, and denied statements made by Habineza that Rwanda was helping the UK and the US plunder timber from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC) and that Rwanda had deployed troops in the DRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In July 2010 the vice-president of the DGP, [[Andre Kagwa Rwisereka]], was found dead near a wetland in [[Butare]] with his head cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He had been repeatedly stabbed.
Habineza was among opposition leaders who called for an independent international investigation into the murder, which may have had a political motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
At the end of 2006 [[Max Nisol]] created [[Les Drag Kings de Bruxelles]] (DKB) to organize [[drag king]] monthly workshops. During his time working with DKB, Nisol became aware of the lack of information on the subject of [[Transgender inequality|transidentity]], and decided to create an association with the aim of providing useful information to persons affected by the issue. Nisol, along with Londé Ngosso and Tanguy Pinxteren, founded the association Genres Pluriels on October 16, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_tsv/tsv_rech.pl?language=fr&amp;btw=0892826107&amp;liste=Liste|title=HV - SC|website=www.ejustice.just.fgov.be|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their website is available in English, French, and Dutch, and is hosted by Domaine Public [archive], a Belgian association in favor of open source software.

The DKB became independent in 2012, and continues to organize drag king events and performances. Their drag king workshops often include discussions about [[gender identity]] and [[gender performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendels Flandre|first=Emilie|date=2010|title=Du genre binaire aux genres pluriels : Les Drag Kings de Bruxelles|url=https://cdn.uclouvain.be/public/Exports%20reddot/formationcontinue/documents/TFC_-_Du_genre_binaire_aux_genres_pluriels_Les_Drag_Kings_de_Bruxelles_version_finale_finale.pdf|journal=Université Catholique de Louvain Service de Santé Mentale Le Méridien|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Genres Pluriels experienced a financial crisis, and thee members of the staff were made redundant for lack of finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://plus.lesoir.be/56110/article/2016-08-24/lasbl-genres-pluriels-en-peril|title=L’ASBL Genres Pluriels en péril|work=Le Soir Plus|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017 [http://igvm-iefh.belgium.be/en the Institute for the Equality of Women and Men] chose Genres Pluriels to participate on a team of equal opportunity representatives to commemorate the 15 year anniversary of the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://igvm-iefh.belgium.be/fr/actualite/marraines_et_parrains_de_linstitut|title=Marraines et parrains de l'Institut|work=Institut pour l'égalité des femmes et des hommes|access-date=2018-01-03|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Héloïse Guimin-Fati]] became a co-leader as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://focus.levif.be/culture/arts/tous-les-genres-sont-dans-la-culture-sense8-et-transparent-devraient-etre-la-norme/article-longread-756221.html|title=Tous les genres sont dans la culture?

== Main objectives ==
Genres Pluriels serves as an advocacy group for transgender, gender fluid, and intersex persons. The association organizes different activities in [[Brussels]] and [[Wallonia]] in order to counter [[discrimination]] against trans, intersex and gender fluid persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/culture/medias-tele/transidentite-comment-depasser-les-stereotypes-58cae106cd705cd98dfb690d|title=Transidentité : comment dépasser les stéréotypes ?|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=2018-01-03|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://focus.levif.be/culture/arts/tous-les-genres-sont-dans-la-culture-sense8-et-transparent-devraient-etre-la-norme/article-longread-756221.html|title=Tous les genres sont dans la culture?

It is also used as an ingredient in the production of chewing-gum and ice cream. Similar, less pure materials (glycerol ester of gum rosin) are used as a component of certain low-cost adhesives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastman.com/Markets/Tackifier_Center/Tackifier_Families/Rosin_Resins/Pages/Rosin_Esters.aspx› Rosin Resins]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{deadlink|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the glycerol ester of wood rosin, refined [[Rosin#Production|wood rosin]] is reacted with [[Glycerol|glycerin]] to produce the glycerol [[ester]]. 

Glycerol ester of wood rosin is an alternative to [[brominated vegetable oil]] in citrus oil-flavored soft drinks. In some cases, both ingredients are used together.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12155">'''The Grand Model''' (or "'''Grand Modell'''" as it was spelled at the time) was a utopian plan for the [[Province of Carolina]], founded in 1670. It consisted of a constitution coupled with a settlement and development plan for the colony. The former was titled the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]. The word "constitutions" (in the plural) was synonymous with "articles." The document was composed of 120 constitutions, or articles. The settlement and development plan for the colony consisted of several documents, or "instructions," for guiding town and regional planning as well as economic development.

Both the Fundamental Constitutions and the development plan were drafted by the English liberal philosopher [[John Locke]] while working for the [[Lords Proprietors]] of Carolina, the eight noblemen who held the royal charter to settle the colony. Locke was also a personal assistant to [[1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]], the Proprietor who became the Earl of Shaftesbury soon after the principal elements of the Grand Model were drafted. Ashley Cooper is considered the founder of Carolina, thus the Grand Model may also be called the Ashley Cooper Plan.&lt;ref&gt;Famous plans are often named after the person who conceived them, e.g., the [[Oglethorpe Plan]], the [[L'Enfant Plan]]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the term Grand Model is used more restrictively in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to refer to the original planned area of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Steedman, "How the City Grew".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vision ==

Anthony Ashley Cooper oversaw Locke's drafting of the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]] during the first decade of the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]], a time when the failure of the [[Commonwealth of England]] was fresh in mind. During the Commonwealth period he had served in the government of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and participated in reviewing English laws and drafting the nation's first formal constitution. Before that, English constitutional law was based on ancient constitutional documents such as the [[Magna Carta]]. The experience led Ashley Cooper to see value in adopting a formal constitution for the Province of Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;For a contemporary perspective on Ashley Cooper's career, see, Spurr, John, Chapter 1; Marshall, Alan, Chapter 2; and Leng, Thomas, Chapter 5 in Spurr, ''Anthony Ashley Cooper, First Earl of Shaftesbury, 1621–1683''. For a complete and authoritative biography, see, Haley, ''The First Earl of Shaftesbury''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ashley Cooper aided the restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to the throne in 1660, for which service he and the other [[Lords Proprietors]] were granted the charter for Carolina, he strongly believed in the English tradition of common law and balanced government (a system sometimes called the "[[Ancient constitution of England|Ancient Constitution]]" wherein the nobility played an essential role. The Fundamental Constitutions was designed to formalize a "[[Gothic Society|Gothic]]" system of balanced government in the new province. Although described as [[feudalism]] by some authorities, the system was arguably more advanced by virtue of its constitution and emphasis on basic rights and reciprocal benefits among classes. It was nevertheless a pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] system predicated on class hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;See Pocock, p. 94, for use of the word "gothic"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Settlement and development plan ==

The Fundamental Constitutions provided a framework for urban and regional development consistent with and supportive of the plan for governance and economic development. Once settlement began in 1670 a series of "instructions" were transmitted to the colonists with details that fleshed out areas that were not addressed by the Fundamental Constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;Shaftesbury, 322, 367, 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of towns in Carolina was influenced by the intensive planning that went on in London after the [[Great Fire of 1666]]. The government of Charles II solicited plans to rebuild the city, and inspired designs were submitted by architect [[Christopher Wren]], scientist [[Robert Hooke]], cartographer [[Richard Newcourt (cartographer)|Richard Newcourt]], and landscape planner and [[polymath]] [[John Evelyn]]. Their designs influenced city planning in the areas of public health and safety, land use efficiency, and urban aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 100-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For background on Hooke's role, see Cooper, Michael, ''A More Beautiful City: Robert Hooke and the Rebuilding of London after the Great Fire''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of John Locke ==

Locke first became involved with Carolina as a personal assistant to Anthony Ashley Cooper, a relationship that began in 1666. Soon afterward he became secretary to the Lords Proprietors and began drafting the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina and associated planning materials. The precise extent to which Locke shaped the substance of the Fundamental Constitutions is unknown, but he was undoubtedly guided at least on a general level by Ashley Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 44-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's position with the Lords Proprietors might be described as that of "chief planner" for Carolina. He drafted development standards for towns as well as an illustrative plan that he included in his instructions to the colonists. His urban plan provided detailed standards for block size, lot size, street width, waterfront setbacks, and other standards similar to modern planning and zoning ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 44-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke also wrote guiding principles for regional development that were remarkably similar to principles of modern planning, including aspects of [[sustainable development]] and [[smart growth]]. Such aspects include, a) ''consistency'' of development practices with the general plan (Fundamental Constitutions); b) ''concurrent'' provision of infrastructure with land development; and ''compactness'' of development to promote efficient use of land and access to markets.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 44-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery and the Grand Model==

Locke famously denounced slavery in the first sentence of his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', then proceeded to develop the new idea of natural equality. Since the Grand Model anticipated slavery, Locke has been labeled a hypocrite by some scholars for designing Carolina and then continuing to be associated with the venture after writing the famous indictment of slavery. While the Fundamental Constitutions contains an article establishing slavery, one can find no references to slavery in the detailed planning documents over which Locke had the most control. Thus while Locke and Ashley Cooper anticipated that Carolina would have slaves, as did most other colonies, it is unlikely that they anticipated that it would become fundamentally dependent on slavery (i.e., a "slave society") as later happened.

On the other hand, it must be admitted that Locke did have a certain financial interest in the institution of slavery. He invested in the notorious [[Royal African Company]] (chartered in 1660 under King Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland),&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Spellman, ''John Locke'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; which is said to have shipped tens of thousands of slaves from West Africa to the British colonies in North America.

The Grand Model allocated more land (60 percent) and representation to "the people" than to the nobility, suggesting that yeoman farmers were envisioned ultimately to become the backbone of the colony. Nevertheless, a slave-owning elite was also part of the formula from the beginning. Where Ashley Cooper saw slavery as playing a vital role was in the establishment of the principal estates. In December, 1671, he advised against bringing too many of "the poorer sort" to the colony until "men of estates" could first "stock the country with Negroes, cattle, and other necessarys." &lt;ref&gt;''Shaftesbury Papers'', 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The transformation of Carolina from a colony with slaves to a slave colony, and later a slave society, began when slaveowners from Barbados became the dominant force in Carolina politics during the 1780s. Barbados had evolved into a slave colony with a majority slave population during that period. The Grand Model was informally modified by the Barbadians, who took the titles of nobility, but replaced Ashley Cooper's enlightened aristocracy with a self-serving oligarchy. The new plantation elite exercised little regard for balanced government, class reciprocity, or humane treatment of the servant and slave classes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Grand Model and America's planning tradition==

The following components of the Grand Model influenced subsequent colonial town planning.:&lt;ref&gt;Home, ''Of Planting and Planning'', 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

1.	Regular settlement rather than scattered pattern of development
2.	Town, suburban, and country lot allocation
3.	Town planned and laid out in advance
4.	Wide streets laid out in geometric form usually within a square mile grid
5.	Public squares
6.	Standardized, rectangular lots
7.	Reserved lots for civic purposes
8.	Separation of town and country with a common or greenbelt

Philadelphia and Savannah were among the American cities adopting these components of the Grand Model.&lt;ref&gt;Home, ''Of Planting and Planning'', 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgia Trustees acknowledged the influence of the Grand Model: "We are indebted to the Lord Shaftsbury, and that truly wise man Mr. Locke," they wrote, "for the excellent laws which they drew up for the first settlement of Carolina."&lt;ref&gt;Martyn, "Reasons for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America," 1732.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Locke's plan for Charles Town (Charleston, SC) and other cities of Carolina was only partially implemented, its grid, civic spaces, and wide streets became common features of American city planning, due in large part to the examples of Philadelphia and Savannah (see [[Oglethorpe Plan]]).

==Influence on American political culture==

The Grand Model influenced the formation of southern, traditionalistic [[Political culture of the United States|political culture]]. The model, modified by slaveowners from the Caribbean, created a formal slave society that became a model for the future states of the Deep South. The Grand Model contributed a stable plantation land use pattern and a formal social hierarchy led by nobility. The Barbadian slaveowners added large scale monoculture (sugar cane in Barbados, rice in Carolina) and a more rigid system of government and social control by a slaveowning elite. The blended system in Carolina established a pattern that was followed throughout the eighteenth century, and ultimately proved well-suited to [[King Cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2049">'''Ground Zero''' was a [[United States]] advocacy and education organization devoted to [[nuclear weapons]]. Founded by former White House [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] official [[Roger Molander]], it did not explicitly support the [[nuclear freeze]], but worked to raise awareness of the nuclear threat during the period of the freeze campaign in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=ny12&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/us/roger-c-molander-dies-at-71-stirred-nuclear-protests.html?_r=1 |title=Roger C. Molander, Nuclear Protest Leader, Dies at 71 |author=Douglas Martin |date=March 31, 2012  |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 1982, Molander published a prominent piece in the [[Washington Post]] discussing the nuclear threat, and from April 18 to April 25, 1982 the organization sponsored a '''Ground Zero Week''' of nationwide events to demonstrate that American cities had no defenses in the event of [[nuclear war]].&lt;ref name=ny12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, April 1982, Vol. 38, No. 4, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; These events were sponsored by the [[National Education Association]], [[United Auto Workers]], the [[National Council of Churches]], and an array of other organizations. Some have suggested that these events helped build the momentum for the large freeze demonstration in New York City that took place on June 12, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Katsiaficas, G. N. (1987). The imagination of the New Left: A global analysis of 1968. Boston, Mass: [[South End Press]], p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground Zero also published a mass market paperback entitled ''Nuclear War: what's in it for you?'' Printed by Pocket Books of New York, the book included four scenarios "for killing 500 million people," statistics on the likely death totals of United States and Soviet Union nuclear exchanges and a layman's understanding of how nuclear weapons are designed and built.

A '''half-arch''' is the piece of [[gold]], [[silver]] or [[platinum]], usually decorated with [[Gemstone|jewel]]s, that links the [[circlet]] (circular base) of a [[hoop crown]] to the [[monde]] at the top of the crown.

==Number of Arches==

===British tradition of 4 half-arches===
In the image of the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth]] (1938), there are four half-arches, reflecting the examples of [[St. Edward's Crown]], the [[State Crown of George I]], the [[Coronation Crown of George IV]] and the [[Imperial State Crown]]s of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] (1838) and [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] (1937).

Similarly other consort crowns of queens consort [[Mary of Modena]] and [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]], the [[Crown of Mary of Modena]] and the [[Crown of Queen Adelaide]], were made up of four half-arches, following British tradition.

The only example of a crown of a [[reign]]ing British monarch possessing more than four half-arches is the  [[Imperial Crown of India]], made for King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] as [[Emperor of India]] to wear at the [[Delhi Durbar]] of 1911, and which had eight half-arches.

===Crown of the Prince of Wales's 1 arch===
The three crowns in existence of the [[Prince of Wales]], the [[Heir Apparent]] to the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[throne]], all have one full arch, with a globe centred on the single arch rather than being the element to which each arch separately is joined, following an instruction laid down by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1677. Unlike the princely crowns of 1902 and 1969 however, where the single arch rises, in the [[Crown of Frederick, Prince of Wales]] (1728) the single arch dips in the centre, with the globe located in the centre of the dip.

===European tradition of 8 half-arches===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Louis15.jpg|thumb|Crown of Louis XV &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;It has eight half-arches.&lt;/small&gt;]] --&gt;

In contrast many [[Europe]]an crowns traditionally contained many more, as did some other [[United Kingdom|British]] [[consort crown]]s. For example, The crowns of two 20th century British [[Queen consort|Queens consort]], the [[Crown of Queen Alexandra]] (1902) and the [[Crown of Queen Mary]] (1911), reflecting their origins as   European princesses from [[Denmark]] and [[Germany]] respectively, each had eight half-arches. In addition, the British [[Imperial Crown of India]] was designed with eight half-arches to indicate the British monarch's claim to [[Emperor of India|imperial title in India]].

The [[Crown of Louis XV|Crown of Louis XV of France]] (1722), reflecting the European norm, has eight half-arches.

==Shape of arch==

Different crowns possess different shaped half arches. In some crowns, the half-arches dip down at the centre of the crown where they meet the globe. The most widely recognized example of this is [[St. Edward's Crown]], the British [[coronation crown]], while in others, such as Queen Elizabeth's consort crown, all four half-arches rise at a somewhat right angle, with no central dip.

However, in the case of the [[State Crown of George I]], while the crown as originally designed had dipping arches, they were pulled up to a right angle for the [[coronation]] of King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and have remained in that position.

==Detachable arches==

===Imperial Crown===
In some crowns, such as the British [[Imperial State Crown]], the half-arches are detachable, allowing the crown to be worn as a circlet. [[Alexandra of Denmark]], [[Mary of Teck]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] (British queens consort Alexandra, Mary and Elizabeth) all at various stages wore their own crowns as circlets, particularly after the deaths of the husbands, when one of their children was on the throne and they were the [[Queen Mother]].

==Velvet inlay==

Where a crown possesses arches or half-arches, the circlet of the crown below the arches or half-arches are usually filled with velvet or other [[cloth]], or with a jewelled metal cap. Different states and different crowns may possess different coloured cloth inlays.

The most widely used colours for cloth infils are [[purple]], as in the Crown of Queen Elizabeth and in St. Edward's Crown, and dark [[red]], as in the Imperial Crown of Austria. 
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Greekcrown.jpg|thumb|Crown of King Otto of Greece&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;A view of the Greek Crown, showing the arrangement of the half-arches.&lt;/small&gt;]] --&gt;

==No arches==

However, not all crowns possess arches. The Danish Crown of [[Christian IV]] that was used for the coronation of elected monarchs prior to the introduction of absolutism in 1660 has no covering at all but exists in circlet form, while the [[Papal Tiara]] rises as one solid silver (or in one occasion gold) unit. Nor are arches to be found on the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], any of the [[Iranian Crown Jewels]]. The [[Russia]]n coronation crown possesses two central half arches, with most of the rest of the crown covered in. A same feature occurs on the [[mediaeval]] [[Crown of Rudolf II]] used by the [[Austrian Empire]] in the 19th century.

'''Hugh Boyd M‘Neile'''&lt;ref&gt;"M‘Neile", which was M‘Neile's preferred [[orthography]], with conventional inverted comma, like a filled in "6"; not "M’Neile" with erect comma like a filled in "9". Despite the modern belief that "Mac" and "Mc" indicate names of Scottish and Irish origin respectively, "M‘Neile", "McNeile" and "MacNeile" were 100% equal in M‘Neile’s time. In some places his family name is given as "MacNeile", "Mac Neile" or "McNeile".&lt;/ref&gt; (18 July 1795 &amp;ndash; 28 January 1879) was a well-connected and controversial Irish-born Calvinist [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] of Scottish descent.&lt;ref&gt;M‘Neile was descended from Scots who came to Ireland in 1610, with [[Randal MacDonnell, 1st Earl of Antrim|Randal MacDonnell (?-1636), First Earl of Antrim]], to settle in King James I’s [[Plantation of Ulster]] (''Dublin University Magazine'', 1847, p. 462).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiercely anti-[[Oxford Movement|Tractarian]] and anti-Roman Catholic (and, even more so, anti-[[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]]) and an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] cleric,&lt;ref&gt;In 1838, Mourant Brock (1802-1856) had estimated that there were at least seven hundred of the English clergy were pre-milenialists (''Advent Tracts'', Vol. II, (1844), p.135); and, in 1855, "a commentator in the ''British and Foreign Evangelical Review'' … estimated that more than half of the evangelicals in the church favored millenarian views" (Sandeen, E.R., ''The Roots of Fundamentalism: British and American Millenarianism, 1800-1930'', University of Chicago Press, p.40)&lt;/ref&gt; who was also a devoted advocate of the [[Year-day principle#1260 day period|year-for-a-day principle]], M‘Neile was the perpetual curate of St Jude's Liverpool (1834-1848), the perpetual curate of St Paul's Princes Park (1848-1867), an honorary canon of [[Chester Cathedral]] (1845-1868) and the [[Dean of Ripon]] (1868-1875).

He was a member of the Protestant Association (in its 19th-century incarnation),&lt;ref&gt;The Protestant Association had been inactive since the time of the [[Gordon Riots|"No Popery" Gordon Riots of 1780]]. This unrest, fomented by [[Lord George Gordon|Lord George Gordon (1751–1793)]], was directed against the Irish in general, Roman Catholics in particular, the Government in general and, most particularly the [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Chief Justice William Murray (1705-1793)]]. The riots were in reaction to the passing of the first [[Roman Catholic relief bills|“Catholic Relief Act”]], the [[Papists Act 1778|Papists Act (1788)]], that had attenuated some of the restrictions of the Popery Act (1698). The riots involved up to 60,000 people and resulted in widespread looting, significant destruction of churches and other property, including the private residence of the Lord Chief Justice, and many deaths. Ironically, Gordon later converted to Judaism (in 1787), adopting the name Israel Abraham George Gordon and remained a devout Jew for the remainder of his life.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inactive since Lord George Gordon’s "No Popery" riots in London in 1780, the Protestant Association re-emerged as an active force in 1835. M’Neile, one of its most active clerical participants, founded its Liverpool branch in 1837 or 1838 (Paz, 1992, p. 200).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People|the London Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews]],&lt;ref&gt;The Society, founded in 1809, emerged from a committee formed by the [[London Missionary Society]] two years earlier, in 1807, to work exclusively amongst London’s Jews. M‘Neile delivered the society’s annual sermon in both 1826 and 1846, as well as publishing a number of lectures and sermons related to Jews and Jewish matters: e.g., his ''Popular Lectures on the Prophecies Relative to the Jewish Nation (1830)'', revised and reissued as ''Prospects of the Jews; or, Popular Lectures on the Prophecies Relative to the Jewish Nation (1840)''. A letter written to his future wife (on 28 September 1841), by William Ballantyne Hodgson (1815-1880), describes M‘Neile’s position:

:"Bigotry, encouraged by the want of opposition, speaks out more and more boldly [here in Liverpool]. "Every Jew, dying as a Jew, is irretrievably lost", said the Rev. Hugh McNeile the other day; "it is godlike love to tell them of their miserable condition; godless liberalism to conceal it from them". The tyranny of the priesthood is said to be great in Scotland, but really I think it is much worse here." (Meiklejohn, 1883, p.36).&lt;/ref&gt; the Irish Society,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Irish Society for Promoting the Education of the Native Irish through the Medium of Their Own Language]]. According to an advertisement placed by the Society in the end papers of Crockford (1868), the Society was established in 1818 and, in 1868, M‘Neile was one of its Vice Presidents.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church Mission Society|Church Missionary Society]], and the [[Church Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Scotland (1997):
"The Church Association … formed in 1865 … had as one of its avowed aims to fight ritualism in the courts by means of legal action. Many, such as [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], who had tried to introduce various bills into Parliament to curb ritualism were growing frustrated at their inability to do anything. The Church Association had a number of influential members including the Rev Dr William Wilson (Vicar of [[Holyrood Church|Holy Rood, Southampton]]), brother-in-law to [[Charles Sumner (bishop)|the Bishop of Winchester]]. [[William Champneys|Canon Champneys]], who was made [[Dean of Lichfield]] … [and M‘Neile].

"The purpose of the Association was "to uphold the doctrines, principles, and order of the United Church of England and Ireland, and to counteract the efforts now being made to pervert her teaching on essential points of Christian faith, or to assimilate the services to those of the Church of Rome, and to further encourage concerted action for the advancement and progress of spiritual religion". "The Church Association [sought] to effect these objects by publicity through lectures, meetings, and the use of the Press, by Appeals to the Courts of Law...’ in an effort to secure episcopal and other authoritative suppression of ceremonies, vestments and ornaments which had departed from the Church at the time of the Reformation."&lt;/ref&gt;

M‘Neile was an influential, well-connected [[demagogue]], a renowned public speaker, an evangelical cleric and a relentless opponent of “[[Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom#19th century and early 20th century|Popery]]”,&lt;ref&gt;"It is our intention to call the religion of the Church of Rome by the name of ''Popery'', or ''Romanism'', and not of Catholicism, and to designate the subjects of the Pope as ''Papists'', or ''Romanists'', and not as Catholics. As we reckon this a topic of some importance, and as it is one on which Papists are much in the habit of complaining and declaiming, we think it proper to explain, once for all, the grounds of the course we mean to pursue in this matter. The adherents of the Church of Rome always call themselves ''Catholics'', and refuse this designation to all other professing Christians, while they resent it as an insult and an injury when they are styled ''Papists'' or ''Romanists''. The grounds of the course we mean to follow in this matter of names may be embodied in these two positions:—1st, The adherents of the Church of Rome have no right to the designation of Catholics, they insult and injure Protestants by assuming it, and therefore it ought never to be conceded to them; and, 2d, Protestants do not insult and injure the adherents of the Church of Rome by calling them Papists or Romanists, but, on the contrary, employ, in doing so, a perfectly just, fair, and accurate designation…" (p. 22, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fSgEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On the Use of the Names "Popery", and "Romanism", and "Papist" and "Romanist"", ''The Bulwark or, Reformation Journal: In Defence of the True Interests of Man and of Society, Especially in Reference to the Religious, Social and Political Bearings of Popery'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (August 1851), pp. 22-25.]&lt;/ref&gt; who was permanently inflamed by the ever-increasing number of Irish Roman Catholics in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;In a private letter to Queen Victoria in 1869, advocating M‘Neile’s elevation to [[Dean of Ripon]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]], mentioned that "[M‘Neile] is a great orator, and one of those whose words, at periods of national excitement, influence opinion". The response, written on the Queen’s behalf, by [[Thomas Myddelton Biddulph|Major General Sir Thomas Myddleton Biddulph]], the joint [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]], spoke directly of the Queen’s reluctance:

"However great Dr. McNeile's attainments may be, and however distinguished he may be as speaker, the Queen believes he has chiefly rendered himself conspicuous by his hostility to the Roman Catholic Church. The Queen would ask whether his appointment is not likely to stir up a considerable amount of ill-feeling among the Roman Catholics, and in the minds of those who sympathise with them …" (Buckle (1926a), pp.533-534).&lt;/ref&gt; He was infamous for his stirring oratory, his immoderate preaching, his prolific publications,&lt;ref&gt;Whilst none of them are considered to have even the slightest theological value today, more than 100 of his works are listed at [[List of works by Hugh Boyd M‘Neile]].&lt;/ref&gt; and his inability to accurately construe the meaning of the scripture upon which his diatribes were based (see below). He was just as deeply loved, admired and respected by some,&lt;ref&gt;"Unquestionably the greatest Evangelical preacher and speaker in the Church of England during this century" (Stock, 1899, p.376); "universally known… as one of the most powerful instruments ever raised up to arm the church in troublous days… No man living has been so grossly, so impudently, calumniated in the face of all evidence; no man is so notoriously dreaded by the workers of seditious evil in church and state; and perhaps no man on earth is so ardently, so extensively loved by all classes of right-minded people." ([https://books.google.com/books?id=T-AeAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Charlotte Elizabeth", (1840), p.143.])&lt;/ref&gt; as he was an object of derision and scorn for others.&lt;ref&gt;“A bold bad Irishman”; “this politico-religious firebrand”; “the factitious bigotry [evoked by] this dangerous man” (Thomas Earnshaw Bradley (1820-1866) in Bradley, 1852, p.393). “Probably the most eloquent, the most able and the most consistent religious agitator of his day” (James Murphy, 1959, p.51). “A bigoted divine, who enjoys unfortunately a very extensive popularity” ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8xMEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false William North (1825-1854), 1845, I, p.174.]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family ==
Hugh Boyd M‘Neile, the younger son of Alexander M'Neile (1762-1838) and Mary M'Neile, née McNeale (?-1852), was born at [[Ballycastle, County Antrim]] on 17 July 1795, just three years before the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]; and, in 1798, M‘Neile was taken by his mother from Ballycastle to relatives in Scotland, in an open boat, to escape the dangers and atrocities of “the troubles” associated with the Irish Rebellion (Boyd, 1968).

M‘Neile's father owned considerable property (including the large farm at Collier's Hall), was a Justice of the Peace and served as the [[High Sheriff of Antrim|High Sheriff of the County of Antrim]].&lt;ref&gt;In the latter part of the 1870s the Revd Hugh M‘Neile of Ripon was registered as owning 699 acres in County Antrim, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, John M‘Neile (1788-1855), having made his fortune in South America, returned to Ireland and was one of the founding members of the [[Danske Bank (Northern Ireland)|Northern Bank]], the first bank in Belfast. John M‘Neile married Charlotte Lavinia Dallas (1803-1859) on 11 June 1823 and had two sons, Henry Hugh (1829-?) and Alexander John (1842-?) and one daughter, Mary Harriet (1833-1919), who married [[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|Hugh McCalmont Cairns (1810–1885)]], the First Earl Cairns, who served as Attorney General in the [[third Derby–Disraeli ministry]] (10 July 1866 – 29 October 1866), as Lord Chancellor in the first and second Disraeli ministries,&lt;ref&gt;He served from February to December 1868 and February 1874 to April 1880 respectively. It was during this time that he exerted sufficient pressure on the Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli (1804–1881), to have his uncle-by-marriage, Hugh M‘Neile, appointed as Dean of Ripon and his nephew, William Connor Magee (1821-1891), appointed as to Bishop of Peterborough.&lt;/ref&gt; and as (opposition) Conservative Leader in the House of Lords (1869-1870).

M‘Neile was {{convert|6|ft|3|in|cm}} tall, extremely strong, intelligent, a good horseman and considered by most to be extremely handsome.&lt;ref&gt;An American travel writer, David W. Bartlett (1828-1912), described M‘Neile, then in his 50s, as follows: "In the pulpit he looks more like a son of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] than a minister of the Prince of Peace, and one is reminded while looking at him of the celebrated Methodist Minister, Peter Cartwright, of Illinois, who often left his pulpit to silence disturbances with his brawny fists. When [M‘Neile] rises to speak, you are awed by his powerful physical appearance; he is tall and stout, with broad shoulders and muscular arms, while his great, sloping forehead, white as snow, contrasts finely with his dark hair. His eyes are expressive of genius, while his whole face has the look of a man whom all the powers of Europe could not drive from a position he had taken conscientiously." (Bartlett (1853, pp.275-276). ([[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Peter Cartwright (1785-1872)]], was a tough, menacing, travelling Methodist Episcopal Church Minister, "The Backwoods Preacher", renowned for his physical strength and aggression, who operated over vast frontier areas in Kentucky and Tennessee, before moving to Illinois in 1824.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822 M‘Neile married Anne Magee (1803-1881), the fourth daughter of [[William Magee (archbishop of Dublin)|William Magee (1766–1831)]], the Archbishop of Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;William Magee, who was strongly anti-Catholic, was Assistant Professor of Oriental Tongues (1800-1806) and Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin (1806-1812), the Church of Ireland’s Dean of Cork (1813-1819), Bishop of Raphoe (1819-1822) and Archbishop of Dublin (1822-1831). His grandson (also M‘Neile’s nephew), William Connor Magee (1821-1891), was appointed Bishop of Peterborough by Disraeli in 1868; he served until 1891 when he was appointed as Archbishop of York, dying four months later.&lt;/ref&gt; They had sixteen children (four of whom died early in life): three daughters, two of whom remained unmarried, and thirteen sons.&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; As a testament to his influence, a number of his children went on to have distinguished careers, including:
*Alexander M‘Neile (1823-1912)
*Colonel William M‘Neile (1824–1870), Commissioner of Punjab.
*Elizabeth M‘Neile (1827–1910)
*Hugh M‘Neile (1828–1842), who was killed, aged 14, in an accident with a loaded pistol.
*Mary M‘Neile (1831– ?)
*Daniel James M‘Neile (1835–1874), of the Bengal Civil Service.&lt;ref&gt;He married Julia Savage in 1869. They had three children. Whilst on twelve months’ home leave with his family, staying with his father at Ripon, he went fishing in the [[river Ure]] on the morning of 31 August 1874 near [[West Tanfield]]. Whilst he was in the river fishing the level of the river suddenly rose some four feet and he was swept away. Despite extensive searches along the river, his body was not found until twelve days later, floating face up in the river near [[Boroughbridge]].&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Revd Edmund Hugh M‘Neile (1840–1893), an honorary canon of Liverpool (1880-1893), also served at St Paul's, Prince's Park, Liverpool (1867-1893) and as chaplain to the Bishop of Chester (1877-1884). He married Cecilia Elizabeth (1841-1929), daughter of Sir Thomas Francis Fremantle, Lord Cottesloe (1798-1890).

*The Revd Hector M‘Neile (1843–1922), a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge (1865-1871), the vicar of Bredbury, Cheshire (1893-1900), a missionary of the Church Missionary Society in Bombay (1900-1907) and vicar of Bishop's Sutton, Hampshire (1907-1922). He married Mary Rosa Lush. One of his three sons, the Revd Robert Fergus M‘Neile, and two of his daughters, Annie Hilda M‘Neile and Jessie Margaret M‘Neile, served as missionaries in Egypt and Palestine. His third daughter, Ethel Rhoda M‘Neile (1875-1922), served as a missionary in India.&lt;ref&gt;Ethel became the headmistress of the CMS School in Agra in 1912. Having spent some time in England, Ethel was returning to India on the British P &amp; O steamer ''[[SS Egypt|S.S. Egypt]]''. On the evening of 20 May 1922, near Ushant, off the coast of Brittany, in a heavy sea fog, the ''S.S. Egypt'', en route to Bombay, with 38 passengers and 290 crew, was rammed at 7:30PM, whilst many of the passengers were still on deck, the dinner gong having just sounded, [[SS Egypt#The Final Voyage|sliced in two, and sunk by the French cargo steamer ''Seine'']]. 98 died and 230 were saved. According to the ''New York Times'' of 22 May 1922, whilst there were more than enough lifeboats for all to safely leave the ship, the majority of the lascar (Indian) crew had taken to the lifeboats immediately. This meant that there was not enough lifeboat-launching manpower left on deck. Ethel refused to enter a lifeboat, giving her seat to a woman whose children would have been orphaned and, kneeling on the deck in prayer, she went down with the ship; she was one of the 10 passengers and 88 crew that perished. A memorial to her is inscribed on her father’s grave in the churchyard of St Nicholas’ Church, Bishop’s Sutton.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Norman Frederick M‘Neile (1846–1929), Known as "the blind vicar", he was born on 14 August 1846 and served at St Peter's Brafferton Parish Church in Helperby, Yorkshire for 50 years. Married to Clara Cecilia Willink (1852-1929) in July 1881. He was completely blind from the age of 12.&lt;ref&gt;He had been taught by the Revd Robert Hugh Blair, Rector of St Michael’s, Worcester, first at a Liverpool school and later at The King’s School, Worcester. It was Blair who founded the Worcester College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen in 1866 (the first such public school in England, as distinct from earlier vocational and industrial training establishments), under the auspices of the Bishop of Worcester, where M‘Neile would go for assistance with his studies at Trinity College, Dublin and for additional coaching and preparation on each of his vacations between 1867 and 1871 (Bell, 1967, p.16). He received his B.A. in 1868, and M.A. in 1871. He had been trained to read the services from a special prayer book, created for him by Blair, that had raised print on each page ("Personal", ''Oswego Daily Palladium'', 15 June 1876).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Hugh Boyd M'Neile (1840).jpg|thumb|240px|M‘Neile in 1840]]
M‘Neile received a private education. He entered [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in 1810, and graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|Artium Baccalaureus (AB)]], with a good degree in classics in 1815. He also began legal studies at [[King's Inns|The King's Inns in Dublin]] and, having served all his terms there, transferred to London's [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1814. He almost completed his terms there as well when, around 1819, he decided to abandon the law as well as the political career that his family had anticipated for him and return to his studies in order to qualify for ordination. He graduated ''[[Master of Arts|Magister Artium]]'', at Dublin University in 1822.

In 1847, M‘Neilee graduated [[Bachelor of Divinity|Bachelor of Divinity (BD)]] and [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctor of Divinity (DD)]] from Dublin University.&lt;ref&gt;"Domestic Intelligence: Ireland", ''The Aberdeen Journal, and General Advertiser for the North of Scotland'', No.5182, (5 May 1847), p.7, col.B.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the BD degree was a coursework and postgraduate degree only available to those who had graduated MA at least 10 years earlier; the DD was conventionally awarded simultaneously on the basis of published work. In M‘Neile's case the published work would have been ''The Church and the Churches'' (1846).&lt;ref&gt;''Crockford'' (1868, p. 432) mistakenly asserts that M‘Neile’s two divinity degrees were awarded to him "''[[Honorary degree|honoris causa]]''". They were not ''honoris causa'' and they were not "token" degrees. They were awarded simultaneously on the basis of coursework (BD) and published work (DD). They were, essentially, Trinity College’s equivalent of the Oxford University’s current '''Bachelor and Doctor in Divinity by Accumulation'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 1860, an Incorporate DD — i.e., a doctorate ''ad eundem gradum'' ("to the same degree"), admitting M‘Neile as a member of Cambridge University by virtue of his possession of a DD from another university (Trinity College, Dublin) — was conferred upon him at Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;"University Intelligence", ''Morning Chronicle'', 18 June 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early adulthood==
Whilst a student, and preparing for a career in the law, M‘Neile loved the theatre even more than the fashionable society in which he moved.&lt;ref&gt;Much of this section is based upon the article "The Rev. Hugh M‘Neile, A.M." in '' Dublin University Magazine'' of April 1847.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the theatre in Dublin, London and Bath as often as he could. In those days, [[Sarah Siddons]], her brother [[John Philip Kemble|John]], and [[Eliza O'Neill]] (later Lady Wrixon-Becher) — all favourites of M‘Neile — were at their peak; and his later platform and pulpit performances drew very heavily on their example.&lt;ref&gt;"… [and] it might also be considered whether much of that grace and elegance of enunciation and manner for which he has always been remarkable, may not be owing to impressions unconsciously stamped upon a plastic mind, by the contemplation of those brilliant models…" p.463.&lt;/ref&gt;

When M‘Neile was 20, his father's unmarried brother, Lieutenant-General Daniel M’Neile (1754-1826), returned to Ireland following distinguished service with the East India Company. His uncle, who settled in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], delighted in M’Neile's company, and his uncle virtually adopted him; and, it seemed, he was the [[heir presumptive]] to his uncle's considerable fortune.&lt;ref&gt;McNeile (1911), p.265.&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle, whose wealth and influence would have easily have procured M‘Neile a seat in parliament, and who understood that success at the bar would be a stepping-stone for the talented lad into a productive political career, encouraged him to pursue a legal career. He took his A.B. in 1815, and continued his legal studies.

Most of his time between 1815 and 1819 was spent with his uncle in Bath. In 1816 he and his uncle travelled extensively on the continent, enjoying the social advantages of his uncle's influence.&lt;ref&gt;There is no doubt, so soon after the victory of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (18 June 1815), the [[Bourbon Restoration#Second Restoration .281815.29|Restoration of Louis XVIII]] (28 June 1815), and the [[Napoleon#Exile on Saint Helena|permanent exiling of Napoleon Bonaparte to the island of St. Helena]] (16 October 1815), "[that] on the continent… the name of an English general was sure to meet with… more than an ordinary degree of respect and attention" (''Dublin University Magazine'', 1847, p.464).&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, M’Neile spent time with mixing with influential people, such as [[Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël (1766–1817)]] and [[Lord Byron|Lord Byron (1788–1824)]].

In the middle of 1816, whilst staying with his uncle in a Swiss village inn, M’Neile fell very seriously ill. His life was saved by the medical intervention of [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham (1778–1868)]], a stranger to M’Neile at the time, who had called at the inn for refreshment (or a change of horses). Upon his return to England, a changed M’Neile began reading the Bible daily and, around 1819, he experienced a conversion to Christianity within the Evangelical Anglican tradition. To his uncle's dismay, he hinted that he might give away law and politics and dedicate his life to the church. According to most accounts, when he finally announced that he was embracing church ministry as a profession, his greatly disappointed uncle "disinherited" him.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see McNeile (1911), p.265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clerical career==
Following his theological studies, M‘Neile was ordained in 1820 by his future father-in-law, William Magee (1766–1831) - who, at that time, was the Church of Ireland's [[Bishop of Raphoe#Church of Ireland succession|Bishop of Raphoe]] - and served as a curate in [[Stranorlar|Stranorlar, County Donegal]] from 1820 to 1821. Early in 1822, his preaching in London so impressed the banker and parliamentarian [[Henry Drummond (1786–1860)]] that Drummond appointed M‘Neile to the [[Benefice#Church of England|living]] of the parish of [[Albury, Surrey]], from where M‘Neile's first collection of sermons, ''Seventeen Sermons, etc.'', were published in 1825.

From 1826 to 1830, Drummond hosted the annual [[Albury Conferences]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albury.org.uk Albury parish website: Brief History of Albury.]&lt;/ref&gt; held in Albury for the Union of the Students of Prophecy moderated by M‘Neile.&lt;ref&gt;According to Flegg (1992, pp.3 7-38), apart from M‘Neile, the participants included the clerics [[Henry Forster Burder|Henry Forster Burder (1783–1864)]], William Hodgson Cole (1806-1852),  [[William Dodsworth]] (1798-1861), William Dow (1800-1855), [[Edward Irving|Edward Irving (1792–1834)]], [[William Marsh (priest)|William Marsh (1775-1864)]], Henry John Owen (1795-1862), John Simons (1754-1836), John Haldane Stewart (1766-1854), [[Robert Story (minister)|Robert Story]] (1790-1859), Edward Thomas Vaughan (1777-1829), [[Daniel Wilson (bishop)|Daniel Wilson (1778-1858)]] and [[Joseph Wolff|Joseph Wolff (1795-1862)]]; and the laymen, John Bayford (1774-1844), Thomas William Chevalier (1799-1835), [[Henry Drummond (1786–1860)]], [[John Hookham Frere]] (1769-1846), [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|James Gambier]] (1756-1833), [[Charles Robert Malden]] (1797–1855), [[George Montagu, 6th Duke of Manchester|Viscount Mandeville]] (1799-1855), [[Spencer Perceval (junior)|Spencer Perceval]] (1795-1859), John James Strutt (1796–1873) and John Owen Tudor (1783-1861).&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the Albury Conferences involved days full of close and laborious study of the prophetical books of the Bible; attempting to seek out as-yet-unfulfilled prophecies within them. As they progressed, "[their] prophetic speculations became more and more extreme".&lt;ref&gt;Carter (2001), p.179.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Albury that M‘Neile first met [[Edward Irving|Edward Irving (1792-1834)]]. Irving was a strong believer in the "gifts" of "speaking in tongues" (''[[glossolalia]]'') and spiritual healing. It was through Irving that M‘Neile first encountered the Irish-born Okey Sisters. His experience of the deception of Okey Sisters’ reputed speaking in tongues with Irving, and his knowledge of their later association with [[John Elliotson|Elliotson]] and his mesmerism, and their well-attested fraudulent deception of Elliotson, must have strongly informed his later views of the activities of magnetists such as [[Charles Lafontaine|Lafontaine]].&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed treatment of Jane and Elizabeth Okey, see [https://archive.org/stream/autobiographica01clargoog#page/n175/mode/1up pp.155-194] in [[James Fernandez Clarke|Clarke, J. F.]], ''Autobiographical Recollections of the Medical Profession'', J. &amp; A. Churchill, (London), 1874.&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to the reputed prophecy, glossolalia and healing, M‘Neile became increasingly torn between his own developing view that they were not of the Holy Spirit of and his desire to remain loyal to Drummond who thought that they were. In the early 1830s, whilst still within the "Prophetic Circle", M‘Neile had dabbled with spiritual healing and speaking with tongues himself.

By July 1832, M‘Neile was preaching at Albury against the reputed spiritual gifts and was protesting about Drummond's private prayer meetings, because, equating Drummond's residence to a church, M‘Neile "would not suffer laymen to pray in his presence". Further, he most strongly objected "[that] it was not of God" when a female at one of Drummond's prayer sessions, which M‘Neile had "attended reluctantly", spoke in tongues — and, thus, "contradicting the biblical injunction against women teaching in church". This caused such a rift that Drummond said "if [M‘Neile] persisted in preaching against the work of the Lord and against all who believed in it" he would be unable to remain within the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;Carter (2001), p.186).&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Drummond ceased attending services at Albury. Their relationship became so unworkable that M‘Neile resigned his post in June 1834.

In October 1834, at the suggestion of a friend, the Revd William Dalton (1801-1880), he was appointed to St Jude's Church, Liverpool. The church, which had been built by subscription expressly for Dalton in 1831, could comfortably hold 1,500 people (it was demolished in 1966). At St Jude's, M‘Neile had "a handsome salary" and "a very large and opulent congregation".&lt;ref&gt;Grant (1841), p.239.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once installed at St Jude's, M‘Neile's eloquence attracted the attention of the [[Bishop of Chester]] — [[John Sumner (bishop)|John Sumner]] (1780-1862), later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] — who appointed him as an honorary canon of his cathedral. The next Bishop of Chester, [[John Graham (bishop)|John Graham]] (1794-1865), also held the important and influential ecclesiastical position of [[Clerk of the Closet]] to Queen Victoria. Graham was equally impressed with M‘Neile and possibly used his connections to facilitate the conferral of the Incorporate D.D. upon him in 1860.

Later, at St Paul's, a 2,000 plus seat church specifically built for him and consecrated on 2 March 1848 by John Bird Sumner, then Archbishop of Canterbury elect (it closed in 1974) he enjoyed a large income. Over time, M‘Neile became a rich man and his financial independence meant that he answered to none: "McNeile was a fighter by instinct and a political parson by principle and, supported by a confidence derived from considerable personal wealth, he was his own man."&lt;ref&gt;Neal (1998), p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box
 |title = 
 |quote =&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The impelling force behind [M‘Neile’s] actions and utterances was&lt;br /&gt;
two basic propositions, the truth of which he believed in totally. First&lt;br /&gt;
that the Roman Catholic Church was the enemy of Christianity and&lt;br /&gt;
the Pope the Antichrist. [M‘Neile] had difficulty in bringing himself&lt;br /&gt;
even to use the word "religion" when referring to Roman Catholicism.&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, in his view, it was the duty of a Christian to oppose the Roman&lt;br /&gt;
Church at all times and in all places. Individual Roman Catholics were&lt;br /&gt;
not to be persecuted, because, in his view, they were victims of a cruel&lt;br /&gt;
deception who needed the love and compassion of Christians to help&lt;br /&gt;
them find true religion. Second was his belief that the Roman Catholic&lt;br /&gt;
Church was engaged in a political conspiracy. It did not, in his view,&lt;br /&gt;
recognise the supremacy of temporal rulers and would, whenever&lt;br /&gt;
possible, grasp political power and use it to crush heresy. Any&lt;br /&gt;
political concessions to Roman Catholicism had to be opposed because,&lt;br /&gt;
in his view, the Roman Church was evil and, to the extent that it&lt;br /&gt;
obtained political power and influence, true religion would suffer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OyW9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Neal (1988), pp.45-46.]&lt;/ref&gt;

His stipend at St Paul's was £1,000 per annum, more than twelve times that of an average curate. He also received £1,500 per annum in pew rents: "He had a large following, and his capacity to imbue popular prejudice against Roman Catholicism with the dignity of a spiritual crusade gave him enormous and explosive influence on Merseyside."&lt;ref&gt;Wolff (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman Catholicism and the Anglo-Catholics ==
In the simplest terms, the doctrines and the rituals peculiar to the [[Anglo-Catholics]] were considered, by Evangelicals such as M‘Neile,&lt;ref&gt;This view was also held by Queen Victoria; at whose urging the [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874|Public Worship Regulation Act (1874)]] was passed. (See below)&lt;/ref&gt; to be a blatant violations of the promise that all of the Anglican clergy routinely made: viz., to adhere to the forms of service as specified in the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' — in particular, to what it demanded and what it disallowed — and to adhere to the "[[Thirty-Nine Articles|Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion]]".

For M‘Neile, [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] endangered "Britain’s providential mission to defend and propagate reformed Christianity": this "providential mission" was a mission of "nationalism" — a concept "contain[ing] an inherent conviction of objective national superiority" — rather than one of "patriotism" (Wolffe, 1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;308–309).&lt;ref&gt;M‘Neile was one of the first to use the term "nationalism". He did so when he delivered a speech, "Nationalism in Religion", to the England Protestant Association at the Exeter Hall in London on 8 May 1839.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Roman Catholic Relief Act]], enacted in 1829 principally to avert the threat of religious civil war in Ireland, abolished many of the restrictions on Roman Catholics that had operated in the United Kingdom for more than a century. This distressed many Anglicans such as M‘Neile, who were already fighting against the influence of Anglo-Catholics in the Church of England.
::"As the [[Tractarian movement]] in the Church of England developed, M‘Neile became one of its most zealous opponents and the most conspicuous leader of the evangelical party. In 1840, he published ''Lectures on the Church of England'' and in 1846 (the year after [[John Henry Newman#Conversion to Roman Catholicism|John Henry Newman's secession to Rome]]), ''The Church and the Churches'', in which he maintained with much dialectical skill the evangelical doctrine of the "invisible Church" in opposition to the teaching of [[John Henry Newman|Newman]] and [[Edward Bouverie Pusey|Pusey]]" (McNeile, 1911, p. 265).

In April 1845, when speaking in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on the [[Maynooth Grant|Maynooth Endowment Bill]], [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Macaulay]] characterized M‘Neile as "the most powerful representative of uncompromising Protestant opinion in the country" (McNeile, 1911, p.&amp;nbsp;265).

Queen Victoria, clearly shared M‘Neile's view:
::The Queen feels, '''more strongly''' than words '''can''' express, the duty which is imposed upon her and her family, to maintain the '''true''' and '''real principles''' and spirit of the '''Protestant''' religion; for her family was brought over [from the Netherlands] and placed on the throne of these realms '''solely''' to maintain it; and the Queen will not stand the attempts [that are being] made to… bring the Church of England as near the Church of Rome as they possibly can.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Queen Victoria (Friday, 23 November 1866).&lt;ref&gt;From a letter written to [[Gerald Wellesley|Gerald Valerian Wellesley (1809–1882)]], [[Dean of Windsor]], nephew of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], her resident chaplain, and one of Queen Victoria's most valued advisors, on 23 November 1866 (Buckle, 1926a, p. 877, emphasis in original).&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1850, the Pope issued a bull, ''[[Universalis Ecclesiae|Universalis Ecclesiæ]]'', unilaterally (a) reviving the Roman Catholic hierarchy in England, (b) appointing twelve bishops and, also, (c) appointing the first English cardinal since the Reformation. This generated strong anti-Catholic sentiment among some English people.&lt;ref&gt;Altholz, J.L., ''The Political Behavior of the English Catholics, 1850-1867'', ''Journal of British Studies'', Vol.4, No.1, (November 1964), pp.89-103; Ralls, W., "The Papal Aggression of 1850: A Study in Victorian Anti-Catholicism", ''Church History'', Vol.43, No.2, (June 1974), pp. 242-256; "Men are called upon to combine to prevent foreign interference with the prerogatives of the Queen, and to resist jurisdiction by the Pope in Her Majesty's dominions" ([[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]]: "Papal Aggression" (Letter to the Editor), ''The Times'', 9 November 1850, p.4, col.F.&lt;/ref&gt; There were widespread "No Popery" processions and anti-"Papal Aggression" meetings, many of which were addressed by M‘Neile, protesting against this perceived attack on British sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;M‘Neile, H., ''The Rev. Dr. M'Neile's Speech on the Papal Aggression: Delivered at Exeter Hall, on Tuesday, December 17th, 1850'', C. Westerton, (London), 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1873, Queen Victoria expressed alarm at the increase of the "Romanising tendencies" in the Church of England. She declared that, in the absence of "a '''complete Reformation'''" (her preferred solution), the only remedy seemed to be for the British Parliament to give the Archbishop of Canterbury "the '''power'''… to '''stop all''' these Ritualistic practices, dressings, bowings, etc. and every thing of that kind and, '''above all''', all attempts at '''confession'''". Further, she lamented “the terrible amount of '''bigotry''', and '''self-sufficiency''' and '''contempt''' of all '''other Protestant Churches'''… [shown by the Church of England, and felt] the English Church should stretch out its arms to other Protestant Churches … and bethink itself of its dangers from '''Papacy''', instead of trying to widen the breach with all other Protestant churches, and to magnify small differences of form”.&lt;ref&gt;From a letter written to Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (1815-1881), Dean of Westminster, on 13 November 1873 (Buckle, 1926b, pp. 290-291, with the emphases in original).&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ritualism of the Anglo-Catholics and the rise of the [[Oxford Movement]] had become so intolerable to Queen Victoria&lt;ref&gt;In the same letter to Stanley (p.291), Queen Victoria urged that the Bishops, in the House of Lords, "ask for power to put a stop to all these '''new''' and '''very''' dangerous as well as absurd practices…" (emphasis in original).&lt;/ref&gt; that, at her urging, and on her behalf, the Archbishop of Canterbury introduced a bill to the House of Lords on 20 April 1874, to limit the use of ritual, vestments, ornaments, etc., and to ensure all ceremonies were conducted according to the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"[The] Public Worship Regulation Bill, for restraining ritualistic excesses in the Church of England … was introduced in the House of Lords by [[Archibald Tait|Archbishop Tait]] on behalf of the bench of Bishops, '''and warmly recommended to her Ministers by the Queen'''. Though viewed with much suspicion by the High Church party, who were strongly represented in the Ministry, the Bill proved to be very popular as one "to put down Ritualism", and passed, with certain agreed amendments, all its important stages in both Houses without a division" (Buckle, 1926b, pp. 299, emphasis added). In a letter to Queen Victoria, written on 7 October 1879, Disraeli, by then the [[Earl of Beaconsfield]], in asking a favour of the Queen, makes it quite clear that the Bill was only passed after considerable effort on his part: "Your Majesty is aware of the great hostility Lord Beaconsfield excited against himself by carrying the Public Worship Bill "'''in obedience to your Majesty's commands'''"." (Buckle, 1928, p.51, emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt; Once enacted, many Anglo-Catholic clergy were charged with breaches of the [[Public Worship Regulation Act 1874|Public Worship Regulation Act (1874)]]; a number were placed on trial and at least five were imprisoned.

In a political speech in 1834, M‘Neile expressed his opinion on the oft-expressed view that clerics should stand aside from politics: "It was said that ministers of religion should not mingle in politics; but God, when he made the minister, did not unmake the citizen."&lt;ref&gt;"Tory meeting at the Amphitheatre", ''The Liverpool Mercury and Lancashire General Advertiser'', (28 November 1834), p.392, col.D.&lt;/ref&gt; A "big, impetuous, eloquent Irishman with a marvellously attractive personality and a magnificent voice",&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/a546164600balluoft#page/n218/mode/1up Balleine, 1908, p.201.]&lt;/ref&gt; he had a considerable influence on the developing religious and political life of Liverpool:
{{Quotation|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When he came to be Curate-in-charge of St. Jude's in 1834, the Town Council had just decided that the Corporation schools should no longer be opened with prayer, that the Bible should be banished, and a book of Scripture Extracts substituted, taken largely from the [[Douay–Rheims Bible|Douay]] [rather than the [[King James Version|King James]]] Version, and that no further religious instruction should be given during schoolhours. McNeile flung himself into the fray, and led the opposition. At a great meeting in the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool|Amphitheatre]] he boldly appealed for funds to open rival schools, and £3000 was promised on the spot — an amount which in a few days increased to £10,000. A circular to the parents next persuaded them to withdraw their children; and north and south the Corporation schools were left almost empty, while the temporary buildings which the Churchmen had taken were crowded to the doors. New schools began to arise as fast as sites could be found, and the Town Council with its great majority had to own itself defeated by one who was almost a perfect stranger to the city. From that moment his power in municipal life was absolute. No Town Council again dared to dispute his will … &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/a546164600balluoft#page/n218/mode/1up Balleine, (1908), pp.201-202.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1835,&lt;ref&gt;See McNeile (1911), p.265.&lt;/ref&gt; M‘Neile entered a long dispute, in which he was eventually successful, with the Liverpool corporation, which had been captured by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], after the passing of the [[Municipal Reform Act]]. A proposal was carried that the [[elementary school]]s under the control of the corporation should be secularised by the introduction of what was known as the Irish National System. The threatened withdrawal of the [[Bible]] as the basis of denominational religious teaching was met by agitation led by McNeile, who so successfully enlisted public support that before the new system could be introduced every child was provided for in new Church of England schools established by public subscriptions. At the same time, M‘Neile conducted a campaign that gradually reduced the Whig element in the council until it virtually disappeared in 1841. The defeat of the Liberal parliamentary candidates in the general election of 1837, followed by a long period of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] predominance in Liverpool politics, was largely due to his influence.

==Orator==

 |quote =&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But with all our respect and admiration for Dr. M‘Neile, we do not consider him to be a deep thinker: there is great talent, but little profundity, in his verbal discourses; and, popular as he is, we venture to say that he shines less in the pulpit than on the platform.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[On the platform] he is at home; for, released from those trammels which the clergyman ''must'' feel around him in the pulpit, he can give a loose rein to his impetuous temper, and allow his eloquence to take broader and bolder flights.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Who that has seen him on the platform of Exeter Hall, and there witnessed his form dilate, and his eye kindle, as he launched forth the thunderbolts of his eloquent indignation against the Romish Church, will not agree with us in thinking that, great as he is in his church at Liverpool, he is still greater as the orator of the public meeting …

"His eloquence was grave, flowing, emphatic — had a dignity in delivery, a perfection of elocution, that only [[John Bright]] equalled in the latter half of the 19th century. Its fire was solemn force. McNeile's voice was probably the finest organ ever heard in public oratory. His action was as graceful as it was expressive".&lt;ref&gt;([[Edward Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Liverpool|Sir Edward Russell]], "The Religious Life of Liverpool", ''The Sunday Magazine'', (June 1905); quoted in McNeile, R.J. (1911, pp.265-266).&lt;/ref&gt; According to one observer, M‘Neile was “the most brilliant and highly-polished compound of natural and artificial advantages which I have ever beheld”; and, “as a specimen of appropriate action, refined oratory, stern, judicious argument, and commanding talent, all combined in one majestic whole, I may say M‘Neile is incomparable and perfectly unique” (Anon, 1838d).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/randomrecollect00hallgoog#page/n122/mode/1up ''Random Recollections of Exeter Hall, in 1834-1837; by One of The Protestant Party'', James Nisbet and Co., (London), 1838, p.110.]&lt;/ref&gt;

M‘Neile was a tenacious, dogged, relentless, and formidable foe; and, along with his extreme verbal aggression, he was a man of the most imposing physicality. He was at least 6&amp;nbsp;ft 3in tall, thick-set, and broad shouldered. He walked with a slight stoop:
::He has all the appearance of a man of surpassing muscular power. The very aspect of his countenance bespeaks a person of great mental decision, and of unbounded confidence in his bodily strength. He is just such a person as, were a stranger meeting him in the streets, would be at once set down as a man who could, should ever the occasion arise, distinguish himself in any physical-force exhibition. No footpad would ever think of encountering the reverend gentleman, lest he should come off second best in the scuffle that would be sure to ensue. (Grant, 1841, pp.244-245)

==Preacher==
{{Quotation|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We have before had occasion to allude to the extraordinary oratory of Dr. McNeill. He was eloquent beyond even Irish eloquence, Protestant even beyond Irish Protestantism. Several times he has been carried away into confessedly injudicious acts and words, which many would wish unsaid, undone … &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ourbishopsandde00arnogoog#page/n323/mode/1up Arnold, (1875), p.307.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
There were several extraordinary aspects of his preaching, and of the pulpit from which he preached. Almost without exception, and entirely removed from the firmly established Anglican convention, M‘Neile never preached from notes; and always preached extemporaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TcNlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Grant, 1841, p.247.]&lt;/ref&gt; His sermons routinely lasted 90 minutes;&lt;ref&gt;The contemporary standard was something like 25-30 minutes at most; and never more than 40 minutes, even on some extraordinary special occasion.&lt;/ref&gt; and were never measured, structured appeals to reason — they were outright, impassioned histrionic performances intentionally directed at the emotions of his audience:
::“I shall never go to hear Mr. M‘Neile again”, said a religious friend of ours, returning from St. Jude’s.
::“Why not?”, we inquired.
::“Because”, replied he, “if I '''''agree''''' with him, I must come away with feelings of ill-will against parties he has been assailing and who are quite as respectable and intelligent as himself; or, otherwise, I must come away with sentiments of anger towards himself for his intolerance, if I do '''''not''''' agree with him; and I do not choose to go to a place of worship with the liability of leaving it in such an unchristian-like state of mind in either case.”&lt;ref&gt;“The Rev Hugh M‘Neile + Malignity x Agitation = Mischief”, ''The Liverpool Mercury'', Vol.35, No.1766, (Friday, 14 March 1845), p.92, col.B.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== M‘Neile's flawed hermeneutics===
M‘Neile was well known for his flawed [[hermeneutics]]; viz., his inaccurate interpretation of Biblical texts. He was renowned for both his inaccurate [[exegesis]],&lt;ref&gt;''Exegesis'' ('drawing out'); an ''exegetical'' interpretation brings out the “real” meaning of a word or passage through an examination of the spiritual/literary heritage, and the textual, allegorical, historical, and cultural context of the word or passage by going beyond its literal meaning.&lt;/ref&gt; and for his [[Eisegesis|eisegetical]] projections of Biblical texts onto current events.&lt;ref&gt;''Eisegesis'' ("reading into"); an ''eisegetical'' interpretation involves the deliberate imposition of one’s idiosyncratic impression of the moment upon the word/passage entirely on its own and in complete isolation from the actual context of the chosen word or passage.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in July 1846, Queen Victoria's husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], visited Liverpool and, among other duties on 31 July 1846, he officially opened the [[Albert Dock]] and laid the foundation stone for one of M‘Neile's pet projects, the [[Liverpool Sailors' Home]].

Two days later, on 2 August 1846, M‘Neile preached a sermon, "Every eye shall see Him";&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 1:7: "Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him …".&lt;/ref&gt; the text of which was immediately published.&lt;ref&gt;M'Neile, H., "Every Eye Shall See Him"; or Prince AIbert's Visit to Liverpool used in Illustration of the Second Coming of Christ. A Sermon, preached [in Saint Jude's Church, on the second day of August, 1846, the Sunday next after the Prince's visit (the Sunday After Prince Albert Laying the Foundation Stone of the Liverpool Sailor's Home). By the Rev. Hugh M'Neile, M.A., Hon. Canon of Chester, and Incumbent of St. Jude's, Liverpool, J. Hatchard &amp; Son, (London), 1846.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within his sermon — regarded, overall, as a "most melancholy, wretched, and most degrading composition”&lt;ref&gt;"The Prince "In His Beauty", and the Parson (From ''Douglas Jerrola’s Weekly Newspaper'')", ''The Moreton Bay Courier'', Vol.1, No.41, (Saturday, 27 March 1847), p.4, col.C.; ''Hampshire Telegraph and Sussex Chronicle'', Saturday, 12 August 1846; and ''The Bengal Catholic Herald'', 17 October 1846.&lt;/ref&gt; — M‘Neile moved to speak of “The Prince in all his beauty”, mapping Prince Albert's laying of a foundation stone onto a text from Isaiah (33:17) “Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f9x5xPst2XUC&amp;pg=PA292#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Church Parties", (1853), pp.292-293.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many protests at his equation of "the Saviour of the world" with a "colonel of hussars" and his implicit assertion that Albert held "title-deeds to… divinity" (Anon, 1847h). It was clear his "fearful irreverence" — implying that "an earthly prince" visiting Liverpool had some link to "the awful coming of the Prince of Heaven and Earth to Judgment" — was something that "must be [immediately] apparent to every reverent mind"; and, further, that a "piece of gross and rank blasphemy [was perpetrated] by making the third Person of the Holy Trinity a type of Prince Albert".&lt;ref&gt;"The Prince, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"We were [shocked] on reading the title of Mr. M‘Neile's recently published sermon. We could scarcely believe our eyes when we saw such language as the following:— "Every eye shall see Him, or Prince Albert's visit to Liverpool, used in illustration of the second coming of Christ". Many excellent persons have pronounced this as something worse that astounding irreverence, and are of the opinion that it would be just as proper to make use of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales's]] visit to Liverpool, in 1806, as an illustration of the first coming of our Savior. We never met before, the equal of this perversion of all propriety. "To illustrate", be it remembered, is "to throw light upon"." ("Astounding Irreverence", ''Liverpool Mercury and Lancashire General Advertiser'', 14 August 1846, p. 394.)&lt;br /&gt;
"[Its title] has been universally condemned; because no critic has yet been able to discover that the Prince's visit to Liverpool can in any way be regarded as a type of the Second Coming, or even, in the remotest degree, as an 'illustration' of that great mystery" ("Religious Gleanings (From ''The Bath Herald'')", ''The South Australian Register'', Vol.11, No.706, 17 February 1847), p.3, col.A.&lt;br /&gt;
"The words "every eye shall see him" were applied to Prince Albert, and to those Liverpudlians who should stare at him. "From the sublime to the ridiculous there is but one step", and from the sublime to the blasphemous we fancy there is about the same distance. The Press, with one voice, protested against the selection of such a text on such an occasion, and the Prince himself was not flattered by it. Doubtless the doctor's loyal enthusiasm led him astray in this instance, as his Orange predilections have hurried him into opinions and observations, which, a few hours after he uttered them in the pulpit, he publicly retracted, and properly stigmatised as "atrocious"…" (Dix, 1852, p.95).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== M‘Neile's immoderate preaching===
Another extraordinary aspect was his propensity for "[being] carried away into confessedly injudicious acts and words, which many would wish unsaid,
undone" (Arnold, 1875, p.&amp;nbsp;307). On 28 February 1847, he preached that the Irish Famine was an act of God's retribution, punishing the Irish for their collective sins and their tolerance of Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;The sermon was published privately by M‘Neile in 1847 and was widely distributed throughout his network of admirers. It also appeared later, as: [https://books.google.com/books?id=T_IEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Famine a Rod of God; Its Provoking Cause — Its Merciful Design (A Sermon (on Micah 6:9) Preached in St. Jude’s Church, Liverpool, on Sunday 28th of February, 1847, during the Irish Famine)", pp.67-100 in ''Sermons by Eminent Living Divines of the Church of England, Contributed by the Authors, With an Introductory Charge on Preaching, by the Venerable Archdeacon Sinclair'', Richard Griffin and Company, (London),1856.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 8 December 1850, when throwing "thunderbolts" at one of his favourite targets, the evils of the Roman Catholic confessional,&lt;ref&gt;M‘Neile’s issue was that, unlike the "general confession", that was part of every standard Anglican service, where each individual confessed silently and privately, direct to God, followed by a general "absolution" or "remission of sins" by the officiating cleric, the Roman Catholic practice was that of "auricular confession", audibly addressed directly to the ear of a priest. M‘Neile strongly criticized the conflation, within the "Romish Confessional", of spiritual sins and criminal acts. Perhaps, his last ever communication was on this topic: M‘Neile, H., "Confession in the Church of England (Letter to the Editor of ''The Times'')", ''The Times'', No.27966, (Thursday, 2 April 1874), p.4, col.F.&lt;/ref&gt; M‘Neile made a series of outrageous statements of which, immediately after his sermon had been delivered, he denied any knowledge of ever having uttered;
and, for which he specifically apologized at the evening service, and withdrew without reservation, as the following newspaper account relates:

{{Quote box
 |title = The Anti-Popery Agitation — Dr. M‘Neile
 |quote =&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The frenzied vehemence of bigotry has reached its climax. At Liverpool, the Rev. Dr. M‘Neile, the notorious platform orator, uttered a sentence last Sunday morning, in the pulpit in St. Paul’s Church, Prince’s Park, which, we are sure, was never surpassed by the cruel ferocity of Popish intolerance, in the worst days of the Inquisition. To be sure, Dr. M‘Neile did not mean it,— he would shudder to be taken at his word; but why does he, a Christian minister, not bridle his tongue, unruly evil that it is? Here is the sentiment, at which '''[[Edmund Bonner|Bonner]]''' might have blushed, in the bloody reign of persecuting '''[[Mary I of England|Mary]]:—&lt;br /&gt;
::&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"I would make it a capital offence to administer the confession in this country. Transportation [to the colonies] would not satisfy me; for that would merely transfer the evil from one part of the world to the other. '''''Capital punishment alone would satisfy me. Death alone would prevent the evil.''''' That is my solid conviction."
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No, thank '''God''', it is not your solemn conviction, Dr. M‘Neile nor is it the conviction of '''''any''''' English mind, however narrowed by sectarian jealousies, in this age of mild humanity! No bigot, no fanatic, now exists in England, who would, in deed and in fact, erect the gallows or the stake, for the punishment of an erring act of religious custom.&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. M‘Neile, on the same Sunday evening, went into his reading desk, and pronounced before his congregation the following apology:—
::&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"In the excitement of an extemporaneous discourse delivered by me this morning, I used, I believe, a most atrocious expression. That expression I have already withdrawn in the sight of God; I have, I trust, made my peace with him; and I now beg to withdraw that expression in the sight of this congregation, and to make my peace with you. I will not repeat the expression which I have referred to; for those who heard it will sufficiently well remember it; whilst I will not grieve (or indict pain upon) those who did not hear it by repeating it."&lt;ref&gt;"The Anti-Popery Agitation — Dr. M‘Neile", ''The Manchester Examiner and Times'', No.221, (Saturday, 14 December 1850), p.4, col.D; note that a more detailed account of M‘Neile’s retraction, etc. is at: M‘Neile, H., "Dr. M‘Neile and the Confessional (Letter to the Editor of ''The Times'')", ''The Times'', No.20676, (Thursday, 19 December 1850), p.2, col.E.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, these events were also presented as a classic example of "the dangers of extempore preaching" (Gilbert, 1851, p.&amp;nbsp;10).

=== M‘Neile's "Satanic Agency and Mesmerism" sermon ===
On the evening of Sunday, 10 April 1842, M‘Neile preached against [[Mesmerism]] for more than ninety minutes to a capacity congregation.&lt;ref&gt;His text was 2 Thessalonians ii. 9,10: "''Even him'', whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Yeates (2013), pp.273-308.&lt;/ref&gt; He began, speaking of "latter days" — following which, Christ would return to Earth, and peace would reign for 1,000 years — and how, as the [[Second Coming|second advent]] neared, "satanic agency amongst men" would become ever more obvious; and, then, moving into a confusing admixture of [[philippic]] (against [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] and [[Charles Lafontaine]]), and [[polemic]] (against [[animal magnetism]]), where he concluded that all mesmeric phenomena were due to "satanic agency".&lt;ref&gt;In particular, he attacked Braid as a man, a scientist, a philosopher, and a medical professional. He claimed that Braid and Lafontaine were one and the same kind. He also threatened Braid’s professional and social position by associating him with Satan; and, in the most ill informed way, condemned Braid’s important therapeutic work as having no clinical efficacy whatsoever.&lt;/ref&gt; The sermon was reported on at some length in the ''Liverpool Standard'', two days later.&lt;ref&gt;"The Rev. Hugh M‘Neile on Mesmerism", ''The Liverpool Standard'', No.970, (Tuesday, 12 April 1842), p.3, col.G: the corrected text of the article is at Yeates (2013), pp.591-598.&lt;/ref&gt; Once Braid became fully aware of the newspaper reports of the conglomeration of matters that were reportedly raised in M‘Neile's sermon, and the misrepresentations and outright errors of fact that it allegedly contained, as well as the vicious nature of the insults, and the implicit and explicit threats which were levelled against Braid's own personal, spiritual, and professional well-being by M‘Neile, he sent a detailed private letter to M‘Neile accompanied by a newspaper account of a lecture he had delivered on the preceding Wednesday evening (13 April) at Macclesfield,&lt;ref&gt;"Neurohypnology: Mr. Braid’s Lecture at Macclesfield", ''The Macclesfield Courier &amp; Herald, Congleton Gazette, Stockport Express, and Cheshire Advertiser'', No.1781, (Saturday, 16 April 1842), p.3, col.A: the corrected text of the article is at Yeates (2013), pp.599-620.&lt;/ref&gt; and a cordial invitation (plus a free admission ticket) for M‘Neile to attend Braid's Liverpool lecture, on Thursday, 21 April.

Yet, despite Braid's courtesy, in raising his deeply felt concerns directly to M‘Neile, in private correspondence, M‘Neile did not acknowledge Braid's letter nor did he attend Braid's lecture. Further, in the face of all the evidence Braid had presented, and seemingly, ''without the slightest correction of its original contents'', M‘Neile allowed the entire text of his original sermon, as it had been transcribed by a stenographer (more than 7,500 words), to be published on Wednesday, 4 May 1842.&lt;ref&gt;M‘Neile, H., "Satanic Agency and Mesmerism; A Sermon Preached at St Jude's Church, Liverpool, by the Rev. Hugh M'Neile, M.A., on the Evening of Sunday, April 10, 1842", ''The Penny Pulpit: A Collection of Accurately-Reported Sermons by the Most Eminent Ministers of Various Denominations'', Nos.599-600, (1842), pp.141-152: the corrected text of the publication is at Yeates (2013), pp.621-670.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this ‘most ungentlemanly’ act of M‘Neile towards Braid, that forced Braid to publish his own response as a pamphlet; which he did on Saturday, 4 June 1842;&lt;ref&gt;Braid, J., Satanic Agency and Mesmerism Reviewed, In A Letter To The Reverend H. Mc. Neile, A.M., of Liverpool, in Reply to a Sermon Preached by Him in St. Jude’s Church, Liverpool, on Sunday, 10 April 1842, by James Braid, Surgeon, Manchester, Simms and Dinham; Galt and Anderson, (Manchester), 1842: the corrected text of the publication is at Yeates (2013), pp.671-700.&lt;/ref&gt; a pamphlet which, in Crabtree's opinion is "a work of the greatest significance in the history of hypnotism, and of utmost rarity" (1988, p.&amp;nbsp;121).

Aside from the newspaper reports of the M'Neile's actual sermon, there were at least twelve published responses to the published version of the sermon and its contents.&lt;ref&gt;The texts of the responses are at Yeates (2013), pp.701-739.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dean of Ripon==
M'Neile was in close sympathy with the philanthropic work, as well as the religious views, of the [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]], who tried hard to persuade [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] to make him a bishop. Although Palmerston usually followed the advice of Shaftesbury in the appointment of bishops, he would not consent to the elevation to the [[House of Lords]] of so powerful a political opponent as M'Neile, whom [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] had accused of frustrating the education policy of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] for thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;McNeile (1911), p265.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 1868, [[William Goode (priest)|William Goode]], the [[Dean of Ripon]], the senior Anglican cleric in the Diocese of Ripon after the Bishop of Ripon, died suddenly.

On 14 August, Disraeli wrote to Queen Victoria, recommending that the Queen immediately appoint M'Neile to the vacancy, arguing in support of his case that, "at this critical conjuncture [M'Neile] is gaining golden opinions all over England for his eloquent, learned and commanding advocacy of [[Acts of Supremacy|the Royal supremacy]] …" (Buckle (1926a), p.&amp;nbsp;533). The Queen's detailed response, written on her behalf by [[Thomas Myddelton Biddulph|Major General Sir Thomas Myddleton Biddulph]], the joint [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]], spoke directly of her reluctance:
{{Quotation|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dear Mr. Disraeli, — I am desired by the Queen to reply to your letter of the 14th instant, respecting the appointment of a successor to the late Dr. Goode, Dean of Ripon.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You must be aware how desirous the Queen is generally to sanction the recommendations you make for the disposal of the patronage of the Crown, and that it is most unwillingly her Majesty demurs on the present occasion.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But before sanctioning the appointment of Dr. McNeile to the vacant Deanery, the Queen would wish you to consider well what the effect may be of appointing so strong a partisan to a high dignity in the English Church.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However great Dr. McNeile's attainments may be, and however distinguished he may be as speaker, the Queen believes he has chiefly rendered himself conspicuous by his hostility to the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Queen would ask whether his appointment is not likely to stir up a considerable amount of ill-feeling among the Roman Catholics, and in the minds of those who sympathise with them, which will more than counter-balance the advantage to be gained by the promotion of an able advocate of the Royal supremacy. I am, yours faithfully, Thos. Biddulph.&lt;ref&gt;Buckle (1926a), p.533.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his response, written on 19 August,&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Disraeli to Queen Victoria", Buckle (1926a), pp.533-534.&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli replied that he had only recommended M‘Neile after the most anxious and deep consideration. Further, and given that he was being subjected to considerable pressure to elevate M‘Neile from a number of quarters (including "the vast number of letters [Disraeli] daily receives on the subject"), he strongly advised the Queen to appoint M‘Neile to the Deanery of Ripon, on the basis that he (Disraeli) had consulted the Lord Chancellor ([[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|Hugh Cairns]], M‘Neile's nephew by marriage) "on this matter", and that Cairns was "very strongly in favour of the appointment".

He also indicated to the Queen that, in his view, and regardless of her declared reservations, such an appointment was prudent: "the step … would be favourably received by the High Church party [viz., 'faction'], who feel that the claims of Canon McNeile cannot be overlooked"; and, more significantly, he noted that, if he were to be "overlooked" at this time, the pressures might become such that if he were to be "passed over" at this time, he might well gain an even "higher preferment" than the Dean of Ripon.

M‘Neile was hurriedly appointed to the vacancy at Rippon,&lt;ref&gt;"The deanery of Ripon has been offered to and accepted by the Rev. Hugh M‘Neile, incumbent of St. Paul’s, Liverpool": London's ''Morning Post'', Thursday, 27 August 1868, p.4, col.D.&lt;/ref&gt; and was installed on 29 October 1868.

He served in that position until he retired due to ill health on 31 October 1875.

[[File:Statue in St George's Hall, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|240px|M‘Neile's statue in St Georges Hall]]

==M‘Neile’s statue==
Following his installation as the Dean of Ripon (on 29 October 1868), M‘Neile made his last speech in Liverpool on 4 November 1868. A group of his friends and parishioners, "having resolved to erect a full-length marble statue of him in Liverpool, in commemoration of his many valuable and long-continued services in the cause of religion and religious education", announced the next day that they were accepting donations to the Statue Fund, the maximum contributions to which were fixed at £5.&lt;ref&gt;"Public Notice: Testimonial to the Very Rev. Hugh M‘Neile, D.D., Dean of Ripon",
''The Liverpool Mercury and Lancashire General Advertiser'', No.6493, (Thursday, 5 November 1868), p.1, col.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May the following year, the statue committee announced that its target amount had been reached and that an eminent sculptor, [[George Gammon Adams]], had been commissioned to produce the work and that Adams had already had several sittings with M‘Neile.&lt;ref&gt;"Local News: The M‘Neile Testimonial", ''The Liverpool Mercury and Lancashire General Advertiser'', No.6493, (11 May 1869), p.1, col.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was carved from a pure white 8-ton block of Italian [[Carrara marble]] (the same marble as [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's ''David'']]).

Adams took 18 months to finish the {{convert|6|ft|9|in|cm|abbr=on}}, 3-ton statue; and it was finished in mid-October. On 28 October 1870, the Liverpool Council considered a request from the McNeile Statue Committee "that the statue be accepted for placement in [[St George's Hall, Liverpool|St George’s Hall]]" (Cavanagh, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;281). The suggestion it should place a statue of M‘Neile in such a conspicuous place of honour,&lt;ref&gt;The eleven other dignitaries so honoured were: [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel (1788-1850)]], twice Prime Minister, founder of the Conservative Party; [[William Roscoe|William Roscoe (1753-1831)]], Liverpool patron of the arts; [[Sir William Brown, 1st Baronet, of Richmond Hill|Sir William Brown (1784-1864)]], Liverpool cotton merchant, politician, benefactor of the Free Public Library; [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Edward Smith-Stanley (1799-1869)]], 14th Earl of Derby, three time Prime Minister; [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898)]], four time Prime Minister; [[Samuel Robert Graves|Samuel Robert Graves (1818-1873)]], merchant, ship owner, Mayor of Liverpool, M.P.; [[Edward Whitley (politician)|Edward Whitley (1825-1892)]], Mayor of Liverpool, M.P.; [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Frederick Stanley (1841-1908)]], 16th Earl of Derby, politician, Governor-General of Canada; Rev. Jonathan Brooks (1775-1855), Senior Rector and [[Archdeacon of Liverpool]]; [[George Stephenson|George Stephenson (1781-1848)]], inventor and pioneer of railways; and [[Joseph Mayer (antiquary)|Joseph Mayer (1803-1886)]], goldsmith, antiquary, collector, principal founder of Liverpool Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; "produced an acrimonious discussion"; and, given the fierce objections by a considerable number present, the subject was deferred,&lt;ref&gt;"Local and General: A proposal to place a statue of Dr. McNeile…", ''The Leeds Mercury'', No.10156, (Saturday, 29 October 1870), p.8, col.C.&lt;/ref&gt; for the simple reason that every statue that had been placed in St. George's Hall up to that time, had been accepted by a unanimous vote.

At the next meeting, on 9 November 1870, the first chaired by the new Lord Mayor, Joseph Gibbons Livingston (who was a strong supporter of M‘Neile), various motions were put, various amendments were proposed, and a number of very strongly held views were expressed.&lt;ref&gt;These strongly held views included:&lt;br /&gt;(1) His entire 34 years in Liverpool had consistently stirred up such ill-will among the classes, and such division between different sections of the Liverpool community, that any suggestion that he had a national or local claim to such a high honour simply beggared belief; (2) He was a clergyman of high status and pre-eminent in one of the Church’s largest divisions; (3) He had no national significance as a clergyman, because he only served the interests of one section of the Church of England; (4) He was an earnest, conscientious, zealous Christian, of the highest principles whose integrity was beyond question; (5) His extreme anti-Catholicism had insulted, antagonized, and alienated at least a third of the population of Liverpool; (6) His vicious attacks on those who did not share his religious views (Roman Catholics, Anglo-Catholics within the Church of England, non-Evangelicals, non-Conformists, and Dissenters, etc.) were so offensive that, if a statue must be placed in St. George’s Hall, it was better to allow considerable time to pass and the offence he had caused to dissipate; and (7) He was a well-published author on divinity and theological subjects, and a measure of his excellence was that his works had been reviewed in prestigious publications such as ''The Edinburgh Review'' and ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the convention requiring a unanimous vote, it seems the majority (the final vote was 36 "aye" to 16 "nay") were prepared to take the view that, whatever divisive conduct M‘Neile may have displayed, he deserved recognition as a writer and orator, and agreed to place the statue amongst the other eleven local and national dignitaries (Cavanagh, 1977).

The established Liverpool custom was a public unveiling, with "the most prestigious guest available invited to officiate". These were great popular occasions, wherein "extended eulogies [were] delivered by the succession of committee-members and honoured guests", reports of which were "invariably peppered with the parenthetic "cheers", "hear-hears", "applause" and, even, "loud and extended applause" from crowds that attendant reporters frequently emphasized "encompassed all classes and creeds" (Cavanagh, 1997, p.xvi). Yet, in the case of M‘Neile's statue, it was brought to Liverpool and placed on its pedestal in the dark of night, and was unveiled "without any ceremonial" in St. George's Hall, three days later, on the evening of Monday, 5 December, in the presence of the Mayor, the chairman, secretary, and other several members of the Statue Committee, several "ladies", M‘Neile's son, the Revd Edmund Hugh M‘Neile (who took over St. Paul's, Princes Park from his father) and the Revd Dyson Rycroft, Honorary Canon of Liverpool.

Often, according to the established Liverpool custom, the sculptor would be present; and, on occasion, the sculptor might even deliver a short speech. In the case of M‘Neile's statue, the sculptor was the only one to speak; and, moreover, Adams had to unveil M‘Neile's statue himself.&lt;ref&gt;In Cavanagh’s opinion view, "McNeile, with his vituperative anti-catholicism, was perhaps such a controversial figure that even those councilors who had forced through his commemoration thought it wiser to abstain from such an open declaration of affinity" (1997, p.xvii).&lt;/ref&gt;

The final irony is that, of all the statues, "the only statue in St George’s Hall to cause offence because of the character of its subject, is also the only statue to have received unanimous acclaim as a work of art" (Cavanagh, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;282):
::Mr. G.G. Adams, the artist who has given us the one good statue in St George’s Hall. … People may quarrel with the objects of the promoters of the memorial, but no one can withhold a tribute of admiration to the rare ability of the sculptor. (''Liverpool Daily Post'', 15 December 1870).&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Cavanagh (1997, p. 282).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
M‘Neile died in Bournemouth on 28 January 1879 after a short illness.

He was interred in the midst of a severe snowstorm at Bournemouth New Cemetery on 1 February 1879. The funeral ceremony was officiated by the Bishop of Peterborough (his nephew, [[William Connor Magee]] (1821–1891)), assisted by his son, the Revd Edmund M‘Neile (1840-1893).

[[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|Earl Cairns (1810–1885)]], who was related to M'Neile through his marriage to M'Neile's niece, Mary Harriet M'Neile (1833-1919), and [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury (1801–1885)]] were amongst the mourners. Throughout the day the muffled minute bell of Ripon Cathedral was tolled and the cathedral's lectern and pulpit were each covered with a black cloth.&lt;ref&gt;"The Late… ", ''Leeds Mercury'', 4 February 1879.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information security awareness''' is an evolving part of [[information security]] that focuses on raising consciousness regarding potential risks of the rapidly evolving forms of [[information]] and the rapidly evolving threats to that information which target human behavior.  As threats have matured and information has increased in value, attackers have increased their capabilities and expanded to broader intentions, developed more attack methods and methodologies and are acting on more diverse motives.  As information security controls and processes have matured, attacks have matured to circumvent controls and processes.  Attackers have targeted and successfully exploited individuals human behavior to breach corporate networks and critical infrastructure systems.  Targeted individuals who are unaware of information and threats may unknowingly circumvent traditional security controls and processes and enable a breach of the organization.  In response, information security awareness is maturing.  Cybersecurity as a business problem has dominated the agenda of most [[chief information officer]]s (CIO)s, exposing a need for countermeasures to today's cyber threat landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/02/04/the-morning-download-security-dominates-the-cios-agenda-in-era-of-risk-and-change/|title = CIOs Name Their Top 5 Strategic Priorities. The Morning Download: Security Dominates the CIO’s Agenda in Era of Risk and Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of Information security awareness is to make everyone aware that they are susceptible to the opportunities and challenges in today’s threat landscape, change human risk behaviors and create or enhance a secure organizational culture.

==Background==
Information security awareness is one of several key principles of information security.  Information security awareness seeks to understand and enhance human risk behaviors, beliefs and perceptions about information and information security while also understanding and enhancing organizational culture as a countermeasure to rapidly evolving threats.  For example, the [[OECD]]'s ''Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/22/15582260.pdf |title=oecd.org |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; include nine generally accepted principles: awareness, responsibility, response, ethics, democracy, risk assessment, security design and implementation, security management, and reassessment.  In the context of the [[Internet]], this type of awareness is sometimes referred to as [[computer security|cyber security]] awareness, which is the focus of multiple initiatives, including the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security's]] [[National Cyber Security Awareness Month]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.dhs.gov/national-cyber-security-awareness-month-2014|title = U.S. Department of Homeland Security|date = |accessdate = 2015-02-14|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[President Obama's 2015]] [[White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/13/president-obama-speaks-white-house-summit-cybersecurity-and-consumer-protection|title = President Obama Speaks at the White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer based crimes are not something new to us. Viruses have been with us for well over 20 years; spyware has clocked up more than a decade since the earliest incidents; and large-scale use of phishing can be traced back to at least 2003. One of the
reasons researchers agreed upon that the pace at information system is evolving and expanding, the [[security awareness]] program among the employees is falling way behind. Unfortunately, however, it seems that the rapid adoption of online services has not been matched with a corresponding embrace of security culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = End-user security culture: A lesson that will never be learnt?|url = http://doi.org/10.1016/S1361-3723(08)70064-2|website = doi.org|accessdate = 2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Information security awareness is evolving in response to the evolving nature of cyber attacks, increased targeting of personal information and the cost and scale of information security breaches.  Furthermore, many individuals think of security in terms of technical controls, not realizing that they as individuals are targets, and that their behavior can increase risks or provide  countermeasures to risks and threats.

Determining and measuring information security awareness has highlighted the need for accurate metrics.  In response to this need, information security awareness metrics are rapidly evolving in order to understand and measure the human threat landscape, measure and change human understanding and behavior, measure and reduce organizational risk and measure effectiveness and cost of information security awareness as a countermeasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = https://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/Insider_Threats/DHS%20-%20Risks%20to%20US%20Critical%20Infrastructure%20from%20Insider%20Threat%20-%2023%20Dec%2013.pdf|url = https://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/Insider_Threats/DHS%20-%20Risks%20to%20US%20Critical%20Infrastructure%20from%20Insider%20Threat%20-%2023%20Dec%2013.pdf|website = scadahacker.com|accessdate = 2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the organizations do not want to invest money on information security. A survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (2014) found that current employees (31%) and former employees (27%) still contribute to information security incidents. The survey results indicated that the number of actual incidents attributable to employees had risen by 25% since the 2013 survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Improving the information security culture through monitoring and implementation actions illustrated through a case study|url = http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2014.12.006|website = doi.org|accessdate = 2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The necessity of security awareness program ==
A security awareness program is the best solution that an organization can adopt to reduce the security threats caused by internal employees. A security awareness program helps employees to understand that the information security is not an individual’s responsibility; it is the responsibility of everyone. The program also explicitly mentions that the employees are responsible for all activities performed under their identifications. Furthermore, the program enforces the standard ways of handling business computers. 

Although organizations have not adopted a standard way of providing the security awareness program, a good program should include awareness about data, network, user conduct, social media, use of mobile devices and WiFi, phishing emails, social engineering and different types of viruses and malware. An effective employee security awareness program should make it clear that everyone in the organization is responsible for IT security. Auditors should pay close attention to six areas covered in the program: data, networks, user conduct, social media, mobile devices, and social engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Evaluating the Employee Security Awareness Program|url = https://iaonline.theiia.org/evaluating-the-employee-security-awareness-program|website = iaonline.theiia.org|accessdate = 2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many organizations make their privacy policies very complicated that the diverse employees always fail to understand those regulations. Privacy Policy is something that should be reminded to the employees whenever they login to the business computer. Privacy Policies should be clearer, shorter and more standardized to enable better comprehension and comparison of privacy practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The FTC's consumer privacy framework and next steps. - Free Online Library|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+FTC%27s+consumer+privacy+framework+and+next+steps.-a0290522164|website = www.thefreelibrary.com|accessdate = 2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations can create interactive sessions for all employees to attend every week to speak about security and threats. Interactive sessions may include awareness about newer threats, best practices and questions &amp; answers. 

A security awareness program may not be beneficial if the organization does not penalize the violators. Employees who have found guilty of violating the program should be reported to the higher executives for further action, otherwise the program will not be effective. Information security authorities may perform a gap analysis to find out any deficiencies in the program.

==Current state==
As of early 2015, CIOs rated information security awareness related issues as top strategic priorities.  For example, at a February 2015 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' CIO network event convened to create a prioritized set of recommendations to drive business and policy in the coming year, consensus seemed to form around cybersecurity and delivering change through effective communication with the rest of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/02/03/cios-name-their-top-5-strategic-priorities/?linkId=12171327/|title = CIOs Name Their Top 5 Strategic Priorities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While information security awareness and high-profile breaches are at the forefront of most organization's agenda, a recent study of 220 security awareness officers by Lance Spritzner has uncovered three related key findings.  First, executive and financial support are necessary for a successful security awareness program.  Second, due to the technical nature of traditional security controls and countermeasures, the soft skills necessary to understand and change human behavior are lacking and finally, in terms of a maturity model, security awareness is still in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://securingthehuman.sans.org/blog/2015/02/12/2015-security-awareness-report/|title = SANS Securing The Human Security Awareness Report }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The challenge of measurement==
Effectively measuring human risk behavior is difficult because risky behaviors, beliefs and perceptions are often unknown.  In addition attacks such as [[phishing]], [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]], incidents such as data leakage and sensitive data posted on social media sites and even breaches go undetected and unknown making it difficult to determine and measure points of failure.  Often, attacks, incidents and breaches are reacted to or reported from outside the compromised organization after attackers have covered their tracks, and thus cannot be researched and measured proactively.  In addition, malicious traffic often goes unnoticed because attackers often spy and mimic known behavior in order to prevent any intrusion detection or access monitoring alerts.

A 2016 study developed a method of measuring security awareness &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giboney|first1=Justin Scott|last2=Proudfoot|first2=Jeffrey Gainer|last3=Goel|first3=Sanjay|last4=Valacich|first4=Joseph S|title=The Security Expertise Assessment Measure (SEAM): Developing a scale for hacker expertise|journal=Computers &amp; Security|date=2016|volume=60|pages=37-51|doi=10.1016/j.cose.2016.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Specifically they measured "understanding about circumventing security protocols, disrupting the intended functions of systems or collecting valuable information, and not getting caught" (p. 38). The researchers created a method that could distinguish between experts and novices by having people organize different security scenarios into groups. Experts will organize these scenarios based on centralized security themes where novices will organize the scenarios based on superficial themes.

Where [[simulated phishing]] campaigns are run regularly, they can provide measures of user compliance.&lt;ref name=GCHQ&gt;{{cite web |last1=R |first1=Kate |title=The Trouble with Phishing |url=https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/trouble-phishing |website=National Cyber Security Centre |publisher=GCHQ |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Nepal introduced [[Constitution of Nepal|constitutional recognition]] for "gender and sexual minorities".&lt;ref name="lavers2015" /&gt; Despite this, the rights situation of [[intersex]] people in [[Nepal]] (locally termed ''antarlingi'')&lt;ref name="undp2014"&gt;{{Cite web| publisher = United Nations Development Programme| last = United Nations Development Programme| title = Being LGBT in Asia: Nepal Country Report| location = Bangkok| date = 2014| url = http://asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/operations/projects/overview/being-lgbt-in-asia/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170824044452/http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/operations/projects/overview/being-lgbt-in-asia/| archivedate = 2017-08-24| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is unclear. Local activists have identified [[human rights violations]], including significant gaps in protection of rights to [[Bodily integrity|physical integrity and bodily autonomy]], and protection from discrimination.&lt;ref name="regmi2016" /&gt; A first national meeting of intersex people look place in early 2016, with support from the [[UNDP]].&lt;ref name="undp2016med" /&gt;

==History==
{{main|Intersex in history}}
The [[Blue Diamond Society]], established in 2001, seeks to represent LGBTI people in Nepal politically and has pursued political and social rights. On December 21, 2007 the Supreme Court ruled that a new democratic government must create laws to protect LGBTI rights and change existing laws that were tantamount to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/12/122107nepal.htm 365gay.com, "Nepal High Court Issues Landmark Gay Ruling]," 21 December 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222154420/http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/12/122107nepal.htm |date=22 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7156577.stm Nepal court rules on gay rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805090027/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7156577.stm |date=2011-08-05 }} BBC News, 21 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, several articles mentioning the rights of gender and sexual minorities in the country's new constitution were approved by Parliament after lengthy deliberation. Amongst these:
* Article 12 states that people have the right to have citizenship identification that reflects their preferred gender.
* Article 18 covers rights to equality and states that the State will not "discriminate [against] any citizens based on origin, religion, race, caste, tribe, gender, language or ideological conviction or any other status."
* Article 18 also lists "minorities, marginalized, youth, children, senior citizens, gender and sexual minorities, handicapped persons" asdisadvantaged groups that are recognized by the constitution.

The constitution went into effect on 20 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34275854|title=Nepal approves new constitution|date=17 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2016|via=www.bbc.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804044221/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34275854|archivedate=4 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes mean that [[Nepal]] is likely the most progressive country in [[South Asia]], for [[LGBT]] rights.&lt;ref name="lavers2015"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/09/19/new-nepal-constitution-includes-lgbt-specific-protections/ | title = New Nepal constitution includes LGBT-specific protections | date = September 19, 2015 | first = Michael K. | last = Lavers | work = [[Washington Blade]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151121213009/http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/09/19/new-nepal-constitution-includes-lgbt-specific-protections/ | archivedate = November 21, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, numerous difficulties are reported by intersex people in Nepal, including the right to change gender assignment, the right to bodily autonomy, and the right to health.&lt;ref name="regmi2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iad2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Regmi| first = Esan| title = Growing up in Nepal| work = [[Intersex Day]]| accessdate = 2017-05-21| date = October 2016| url = http://intersexday.org/en/growing-up-nepal/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170103184024/http://intersexday.org/en/growing-up-nepal/| archivedate = 2017-01-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Asian intersex activists published the Statement of Intersex Asia and the Asian Intersex Forum, setting out local demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Intersex Asia| title = Statement of Intersex Asia and Asian intersex forum | accessdate = 2018-09-05| date = February 2018| url = https://www.astraeafoundation.org/stories/first-asian-intersex-forum/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex people are locally termed ''antarlingi''.&lt;ref name="undp2014" /&gt; 

Intersex issues in Nepal may often be thought to be [[Third gender|third sex]] issues,&lt;ref name="stopigm2016" /&gt; and the most well-known third-gender group in South Asia is perhaps the ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]''. Serena Nanda writes that: "There is a widespread belief in India that ''hijras'' are born [[hermaphrodite]]s [intersex] and are taken away by the ''hijra'' community at birth or in childhood, but I found no evidence to support this belief among the ''hijras'' I met, all of whom joined the community voluntarily, often in their teens."&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena. Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India, p. xx. Canada: Wadworth Publishing Company, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This belief has an impact when infants are born. Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear about the possible future life of their child.&lt;ref name="warne2008"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s11154-008-9084-2| issn = 1389-9155| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 227–236| last1 = Warne| first1 = Garry L.| last2 = Raza| first2 = Jamal| title = Disorders of sex development (DSDs), their presentation and management in different cultures| journal = Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders| date = September 2008| url = https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11154-008-9084-2| pmid=18633712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex persons are not protected from violations to physical integrity and bodily autonomy. A 2016 book of personal stories by intersex people from Nepal identifies a range of bodily autonomy and health issues, including "Intersex genital mutilation as a growing practice and lack of information and access to reproductive health information or care" and "Lack of access to necessary health care for those experiencing health difficulties as a result of their intersex variation".&lt;ref name="regmi2016"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Regmi| first = Esan| title = Stories of Intersex People from Nepal| location = Kathmandu| date = 2016| url = https://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Intersex-Stories-in-Nepal.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170422204413/https://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Intersex-Stories-in-Nepal.pdf| archivedate = 2017-04-22| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child questioned the Nepalese government,&lt;ref name="stopigm2016"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Geneva-Nepal-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | title = TRANSCRIPTION &gt; Nepal Questioned over Intersex Genital Mutilations by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - Gov Denies + Deflects | work = [[Zwischengeschlecht]] | date = May 20, 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170624135500/http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Geneva-Nepal-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | archivedate = June 24, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and identified concerns about:
{{quotation|(a) The lack of awareness of issues related to intersex children in Nepal and the high levels of stigma and discrimination faced by intersex children; (b) The challenges faced by intersex children to access identity documents that correspond with the sex/gender identity of their choosing; and, (c) Cases of medically unnecessary surgeries and other procedures on intersex children before they are able to provide their informed consent, which often entail irreversible consequences and can cause severe physical and psychological suffering, and the lack of redress and compensation in such cases.&lt;ref name="crc2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = United Nations| last2 = Committee on the Rights of Child| title = Concluding observations on the third to fifth periodic reports of Nepal| location = Geneva| date = June 3, 2016| url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC/C/NPL/CO/3-5&amp;Lang=en| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170729120520/http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC%2FC%2FNPL%2FCO%2F3-5&amp;Lang=En| archivedate = July 29, 2017| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Committee called for investigations of human rights violations, education of medical professionals, and access to redress.&lt;ref name="crc2016" /&gt;

==Protection from discrimination==

{{main|Discrimination against intersex people}}
While the 2015 constitution provides protection for sexual and gender minorities, disabled people, and minorities more generally, Esan Regmi has identified a number of issues facing intersex people in Nepal, including discrimination, and a lack of intersex-specific research and actions within Nepal's [[LGBTI]] movement. Access to marriage and inheritance rights are also concerns.&lt;ref name="regmi2016" /&gt;

==Identification documents==
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people}}
According to local intersex activists, intersex people are not able to change name or gender marker on Nepalese birth certificates, and also have difficulties in updating academic transcripts and citizenship certificates.&lt;ref name="regmi2016" /&gt;

==Rights advocacy==
On February 8-9, 2016, and with the support of the [[UNDP]] and other organizations, the [[Blue Diamond Society]] hosted a first national meeting on intersex issues.&lt;ref name="undp2016med"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Being LGBTI in Asia| title = The dawn of a national intersex movement: The first national intersex workshop in Nepal| work = Medium| accessdate = 2016-07-30| date = February 29, 2016| url = https://medium.com/being-lgbti-in-asia/the-dawn-of-a-national-intersex-movement-the-first-national-intersex-workshop-in-nepal-621e8d7a826e| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160822213712/https://medium.com/being-lgbti-in-asia/the-dawn-of-a-national-intersex-movement-the-first-national-intersex-workshop-in-nepal-621e8d7a826e| archivedate = August 22, 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = UNDP in Asia and the Pacific| title = Being LGBTI in Asia| accessdate = 2016-07-30| date = July 30, 2016| url = http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/operations/projects/overview/being-lgbt-in-asia.html| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160815114122/http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/operations/projects/overview/being-lgbt-in-asia.html| archivedate = August 15, 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was led by Esan Regmi, with 13 participants from around Nepal.

Since 2014 Jobbik has started to re-define itself as a [[Conservatism|conservative]] people's party and changed the controversial elements of its communication. According to the party's Manifesto on the guidelines of a future government, Jobbik represents all Hungarian citizens and people and aims to build a modern national identity, while rejecting the [[chauvinism]] of the [[20th century]]. After the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2018|Hungarian parliamentary elections on 8 April 2018]], the party polled 1,092,806 votes, securing 19.06% of the total, making them Hungary's second largest party in the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]].

==Name==
The Movement for a Better Hungary more commonly goes under its abbreviated name '''Jobbik''', which is in fact a play on words. The word ''jobb'' in Hungarian has two meanings, the adjective for "better" and the direction "right"; the [[comparative]] ''Jobbik'' therefore means both "the more preferable choice" and "more to the right". This is similar to the English phrase "right choice", which could mean both "a choice on the right side of the political spectrum" and "a correct choice".

==Platform and ideology==
Currently, the party describes itself as a modern conservative people's party.&lt;ref name="jobbik.com"/&gt;

Earlier, the party often defined itself as "a principled, conservative and radically patriotic Christian party", whose "fundamental purpose" was the protection of "Hungarian values and interests".&lt;ref name="politics.hu" /&gt; Since then, Jobbik has implemented major changes in its program and policies, due to its growing popularity and broadening supporter groups. Earlier Jobbik's ideology has been described by political scholars as [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]], whose strategy "relies on a combination of [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalism]] with [[Populism|anti-elitist populist]] rhetoric and a radical critique of existing political institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Betz |first=Hans-Georg |title=Radical Right-Wing Populism in Western Europe (The New Politics of Resentment) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwTTwbtNyxUC&amp;dq=Explaining+the+Emergence+of+Radical+Right-Wing+Populist+Parties:&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |publisher=[[Palgrave MacMillan]] |year=1994 |isbn=0-312-08390-4 |page=4 |quote=the majority of radical right-wing populist parties are radical in their rejection of the established socio-cultural and socio-political system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Albertazzi |first=Daniele |title=Radical Twenty-First Century Populism: The Spectre of Western European Democracy |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |year=2007 |isbn=0-230-01349-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For its part, Jobbik rejects the common classification of the political spectrum in [[Left–right politics|left and right]]. The party sees itself as patriotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leigh Phillips |url=http://euobserver.com/843/29866 |title=EUobserver / A far-right for the Facebook generation: The rise and rise of Jobbik |publisher=Euobserver.com |date=2010-04-19 |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has always rejected the term 'far-right', and instead labeled itself as '[[Radical right (Europe)|radical right-wing]]'. It has also criticised media companies for labelling them as 'far-right' and has threatened to take action towards those who do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alfahir.hu/nem_nevezhetik_szelsojobboldalinak_a_jobbikot_a_hirmusorok |title=Nem nevezhetik szélsőjobboldalinak a Jobbikot a hírműsorok |publisher=alfahir.hu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504224749/http://alfahir.hu/nem_nevezhetik_szelsojobboldalinak_a_jobbikot_a_hirmusorok |archivedate=2013-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Supreme Court of Hungary]] ruled that Jobbik cannot be labeled "far-right" in any domestic radio or television transmissions, as this would constitute an opinion because Jobbik has refuted the 'far-right' label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zalan|first1=Estzer|title=Court rules Jobbik cannot be called 'far-right'|url=http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/124509|publisher=EUobserver|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014 the party has not used the "radical right-wing" term to define itself, stating that Jobbik aims to represent all Hungarian people, not exclusively the right-wing of the political spectrum.

At its beginnings, Jobbik described itself as rejecting "global [[capitalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A Jobbik szembefordul a globális kapitalizmussal |url=http://mandiner.hu/cikk/20131026_a_jobbik_szembefordul_a_globalis_kapitalizmussal |publisher=mandiner.hu |date=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Vona megmondta: befellegzett a globális kapitalizmusnak |url=http://nol.hu/belfold/vona_megmondta__befellegzett_a_globalis_kapitalizmusnak |publisher=nol.hu |date=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and European Union, because they felt disappointed with the conditions of the Hungarian EU accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://visegradinsight.eu/euroscepticism-and-the-emergence-of-east-central-europes-far-right27052014/ |title=Euroscepticism and the emergence of East-Central Europe’s far-right |first=Filip |last=Mazurczak |work=Visegrad Insight |date=27 May 2014 |accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the party previously also opposed [[Zionism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Jobbik "anti-Zionist" demo goes ahead in Budapest |url=http://www.politics.hu/20130505/jobbik-anti-zionist-demo-goes-ahead-in-budapest/ |publisher=politics.hu |date=2013-05-05 |access-date=2014-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730233159/http://www.politics.hu/20130505/jobbik-anti-zionist-demo-goes-ahead-in-budapest/ |archive-date=2017-07-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Hungary's Jobbik party hold anti-semitic rally in Budapest after ban attempts fail |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/hungary/10037377/Hungarys-Jobbik-party-hold-anti-semitic-rally-in-Budapest-after-ban-attempts-fail.html |work=Telegraph |date=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the party's leader, Gabor Vona, stated in February 2017 that he has "never questioned [[Israel]]’s existence"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/world/362663/exclusive-in-first-talk-with-jewish-media-hungarys-far-right-leader-strikes/|title=Exclusive: In First Talk With Jewish Media, Hungary’s Far Right Leader Strikes A New Pose|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the party supports a [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israel-Palestine conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/world/362663/exclusive-in-first-talk-with-jewish-media-hungarys-far-right-leader-strikes/|work=[[The Forward]]|title=Exclusive: In First Talk With Jewish Media, Hungary’s Far Right Leader Strikes A New Pose|date=8 February 2017|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, the party also voted in the European Parliament in favour of greater security coordination with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=VoteWatch|date=4 July 2018|url=https://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-opening-of-negotiations-for-an-eu-israel-agreement-on-the-exchange-of-personal-data-for-fighting-ser.html#/##vote-tabs-list-2|title=Opening of negotiations for an EU-Israel Agreement on the exchange of personal data for fighting serious crime and terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some level the party adheres to [[Hungarian Turanism|Pan-Turanism]], an ideology that asserts that [[Hungarians]] originate from the [[Turanism|Ural–Altaic race]].&lt;ref name=IBNTM&gt;Ghosh, Palash (December 06 2013) "[http://www.ibtimes.com/strange-bedfellows-hungarian-far-right-jobbik-party-embraces-muslim-nations-seeks-eurasian-ideal Strange Bedfellows: Hungarian Far-Right Jobbik Party Embraces Muslim Nations, Seeks 'Eurasian' Ideal Of Statehood]" ''International Business Times''.

Retrieved August 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the party strongly supports closer ties with [[Turkey]], with Vona criticizing the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]] and praising Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] as a "very strong leader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Anadolu Agency]]|title='West uneasy with strong Turkey, Erdogan': Hungary MP|date=5 August 2016|first=Mehmet|last=Yilmaz|url=https://aa.com.tr/en/europe/west-uneasy-with-strong-turkey-erdogan-hungary-mp/622101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gábor Vona, the president of Jobbik, after 2014 the party has grown out of its "[[adolescence]]" and reached its [[adulthood]]. Since then Jobbik defines itself as a national people's party and has significantly changed its views on the [[European Union]], while in the internal politics the party has started to emphasize the opening towards the different groups of the [[Society|Hungarian society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diplomatamagazin.hu/ftp/s9eranm_3-5_(2).pdf|title=Diplomata Magazin|last=Fodros|first=István|date=|website=Diplomatamagazin.hu|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hungary Today"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hungarytoday.hu/news/hungarian-far-right-jobbik-party-holds-year-opening-conference-28046|title=Hungarian Far-Right Jobbik Party Holds Year-Opening Conference - Hungary Today|work=Hungary Today|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Gábor Vona distanced the party from "wrong statements" that it had made in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.budapost.eu/2017/08/jobbik-leader-ready-to-apologize-to-jews-and-roma/|title=Budapost  » Jobbik leader ready to apologize to Jews and Roma|website=Budapost.eu|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobbik, according to the recent remarks from the party, does not regard ideological issues as a primary goal anymore but puts focus on the elimination of social tensions and controversies as well as on the fight against the growing corruption in the public sphere and administration.&lt;ref name="Hungary Today"/&gt;

=== Modern conservativism ===
In summer of 2016 Gábor Vona, the president of Jobbik, declared a new style of politics, called "modern conservativism" with the aim to exceed the pointless debates between the right- and the left-wing and to induct [[cooperation]] among Hungarians with different political backgrounds. According to Vona, the goal of "modern conservativism" is, beyond politics, to build a society that can, by its [[proactivity]], be a basis for a more [[Democracy|democratic]] political functioning. As a historical precedent, he referred to the ideals of [[István Széchenyi]], who is considered as one of the greatest [[Politician|statesmen]] of the Hungarian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alfahir.hu/elarulta_hosszu_tavu_celjait_vona_gabor_a_titkos_ertelmisegi_talalkozon|title=Elárulta hosszú távú céljait Vona Gábor a titkos értelmiségi találkozón|date=2016-08-29|work=Alfahír|access-date=2017-10-20|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-jobbik/hungarys-jobbik-ditches-far-right-past-to-challenge-orban-in-2018-idUSKBN14V1PW |title= Hungary's Jobbik ditches far-right past to challenge Orban in 2018 |date= Jan 11, 2017 |work= Reuters |access-date= 2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation to the European Union ===
Since its formation, Jobbik had a strongly critical stance towards the European Union. The party regarded the accession of Hungary a failure, and looked on the EU as an organization that did not serve the interests of the Hungarians. However, even in this period, the party did not refuse the idea of a radically reformed European [[confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jobbik.com/sites/default/files/Jobbik-RADICALCHANGE2010.pdf|title=Radical change - Jobbik's electoral manifesto 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Brexit]] and the continuous debates on the future of the European Union, the party has reassessed its views on the EU and started to emphasize that by adequate policies a reform of the EU, that could make the organization advantageous for the European nations, is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/hungarys-far-right-jobbik-leader-gabor-vonasays-leaving-eu-no-longer-on-the-agenda/|title=Hungary’s far-right Jobbik says leaving EU no longer on the agenda|date=2016-06-03|work=POLITICO|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jobbik, Hungary should join the [[Eurozone]] as soon as possible since it is a not a political but an economic question. On his press conference on 27 October 2017 the president of the party, Gábor Vona told, if some conditions were fulfilled Jobbik could even support further deepening of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-jobbik-eu/hungarys-jobbik-supports-eu-deepening-with-voters-blessing-idUSKBN1CW1TR|title=Hungary's Jobbik supports EU deepening with voters' blessing|date=27 October 2017|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wage Union ===
{{Main|Wage union|l1=Wage Union}}

Jobbik considers the issue of decreasing the differences between the regions of the EU especially important. Thus, the party sees a strong convergence of the countries as an important goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailynewshungary.com/jobbik-mp-marton-gyongyosi-launching-wage-union-initiative-leave-disastrous-policy-past-27-years-behind/|title=Jobbik MP Márton Gyöngyösi: By launching the wage union initiative, we leave the disastrous policy of the past 27 years behind - Daily News Hungary|date=2017-08-22|work=Daily News Hungary|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the economic differences between the Western and the Eastern part of the European Union and the development of the Eastern regions are key elements of the new EU-policy of Jobbik. According to the party, for the lack of development [[Central and Eastern Europe|Eastern Central Europe]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;an governments and the European Union, that has turned a blind eye on corruption, are equally responsible. Therefore, Jobbik played a leading role in the formation of the Wage Union [[European Citizens' Initiative]], that started its work on 14 March 2017 with the participation of representatives from 8 Central European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wageunion.eu/en/who-we-are|title=Who we are|last=www.wageunion.eu|website=Wageunion.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politics.hu/20170523/jobbik-calls-on-govt-to-back-european-wage-union-initiative/|title=Jobbik calls on gov’t to back European wage union initiative|work=Politics.hu|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
At its beginnings Jobbik rejected globalised capitalism, and the influence of [[foreign investors]] in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Jobbik stages demonstration against banks, "foreign speculative capital" |url=http://www.politics.hu/20090804/jobbik-stages-demonstration-against-banks-foreign-speculative-capital- |publisher=politics.hu |date=2009-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722214040/http://www.politics.hu/20090804/jobbik-stages-demonstration-against-banks-foreign-speculative-capital-/ |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Jobbik has specifically opposed aggressive [[Israel]]i investment in Hungary and selling out of the country. On 4 May 2013, protesting the [[World Jewish Congress]]'s choice to locate their 2013 congress in [[Budapest]], party chairman Gabor Vona said, "The Israeli conquerors, these investors, should look for another country in the world for themselves because Hungary is not for sale",&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Jobbik rally against World Jewish Congress in Budapest|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22413301|accessdate=4 May 2013|publisher=BBC News|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; responding to a highly controversial 10 October 2007 speech of Israeli Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]]. Peres' statement that "from such a small country as ours it is almost amazing, that we are buying up Manhattan, Hungary, Romania and Poland"&lt;ref name=YouTube&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli President: We are buying up Manhattan, Hungary, Romania and Poland|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL4Cu-K17vE|accessdate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; inflicted a heated debate in the Hungarian public discourse and the Israeli diplomacy had to explain the controversial words several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hvg.hu/english/20071115_shimon_peresz_buying_up_hungary|title=Shimon Peres and the true Hungarians|last=Zrt.|first=HVG Kiadó|date=2007-11-15|work=hvg.hu|access-date=2017-10-20|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2017 Manifesto on the party's guidelines, an innovative economic policy should be followed, that's goal is to find the opportunities in the global economy. An increasingly important point of Jobbik's economic policy is the creation of a more competitive [[national economy]] that is able to provide higher wages. The party aims to support [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SME]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jobbik.com/manifesto_on_the_guidelines_for_a_future_jobbik_led_government|title=Manifesto on the guidelines for a future Jobbik-led government|date=4 October 2017|website=Jobbik.com|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a balanced development with [[multinational companies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hungary-farright/hungarys-jobbik-drops-some-hardline-policies-in-push-for-power-idUKKBN0N520V20150414|title=Hungary's Jobbik drops some hardline policies in push for power|first=Marton|last=Dunai|website=Reuters.com|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public order===
The party argues that the [[Law enforcement in Hungary|national police]] should be greatly strengthened and, along with the [[Fidesz]], supports introducing a "[[three strikes law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naplo-online.hu/fooldal-foldalrovat_legfrissebb_hirek/20090524_erositeni_kell_nemzettudatot |title=Erősíteni kell a nemzettudatot |publisher=Naplo-online.hu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722072058/http://www.naplo-online.hu/fooldal-foldalrovat_legfrissebb_hirek/20090524_erositeni_kell_nemzettudatot |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, political rivals of Jobbik claim that its [[#Magyar Gárda and conflicts in the party|connections with the ''Magyar Gárda'']]  militia (which is now banned) cast doubt on the party's commitment to peace and order in Hungarian society, and even within party ranks.

Jobbik have promised to restore the death penalty if they come to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32523384|title=Hungary wants EU death penalty debate|date=30 April 2015|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailynewshungary.com/jobbik-initiates-parliamentary-day-of-debate-on-capital-punishment/|title=Jobbik initiates parliamentary day of debate on capital punishment - Daily News Hungary|date=2 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxi0VxB6OEk|title=Vona Gábor halálbüntetésről és cigánykérdésről (2014-01-18)|first=|last=Vona Gábor médiavideói X|date=28 April 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minority rights and demands for territorial autonomy for Hungarians outside of Hungary===
[[File:Magyarorszag 1920.png|thumb|right|225px|Hungarian losses of territory in the [[Treaty of Trianon]]]]
Jobbik strongly promotes the welfare of the large [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] populations living outside Hungary as [[ethnic minorities]]. The party demands minority rights for these groups in accordance with [[Western Europe]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;an standards. Along with almost all current Hungarian political parties, Jobbik demands the reestablishment of [[List of autonomous areas by country|"territorial autonomy"]] in the [[Székely Land]] of [[Romania]], and desires to make [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] an independent Hungarian district&lt;ref name="Pretrianon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jobbik MEPs to fight for pre-Trianon borders |url=http://politics.hu/20090615/jobbik-meps-to-fight-for-pretrianon-borders |date=2009-06-15 |publisher=Politics.hu ([[Magyar Távirati Iroda|MTI]]) |quote=Jobbik will demand territorial autonomy for Szekler land in Romania and will also press for Transcarpathia in Ukraine to become an independent Hungarian district, Szegedi said. |access-date=2009-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721112553/http://www.politics.hu/20090615/jobbik-meps-to-fight-for-pretrianon-borders/ |archive-date=2011-07-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the model of [[South Tyrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jobbik.com/as_shown_by_the_example_of_south_tyrol_wage_union_and_autonomy_are_vital_for_integrating_central|title=As shown by the example of South Tyrol, wage union and autonomy are vital for integrating Central Europe|date=2017-10-01|work=jobbik.com|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news-h24.com/south-tyrol-is-the-perfect-example-wage-union-and-autonomy-are-vital-for-integrating-central-europe-jobbik/|title=South Tyrol is the perfect example, Wage Union and autonomy are vital for integrating Central Europe – Jobbik - News|date=2017-10-02|work=News|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobbik is frequently accused of agitating for a return to pre-Treaty-of-Trianon borders.&lt;ref name="Zimberg 28–32"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alexis |last=Zimberg |title=Nostalgia and Notions of False Empire: The (Un)historical Rise of the Right in Hungary |journal=The Hidden Transcript |issue=Spring 2013 |pages=28–32 |url=http://issuu.com/the_hidden_transcript/docs/ht4_print_070513_03 |accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jobbik has never suggested changing borders by force, and believes that the ultimate solution is territorial and cultural autonomy within a European Union framework of [[minority rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://delhir.info/2017/09/30/jobbik-autonomia-kuzdelmet-akar-vivni-kulhonban-elo-tombmagyarsag-teruleti-es-szorvanymagyarsag-kulturalis-autonomiajaert/|title="A Jobbik küzdeni fog a külhonban élő tömbmagyarság területi- és a szórványmagyarság kultúrális autonómiájáért" {{!}} Délhír Portál|date=2017-09-30|work=Délhír Portál|access-date=2017-10-19|language=hu-HU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dailynewshungary.com/catalonias-story-tell-us-hungarians/|title=What does Catalonia’s story tell us, Hungarians?|date=24 October 2017|website=Dailynewshungary.com|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Hungary)|2009 election]] slogan "Hungary belongs to the Hungarians" (''Magyarország a Magyaroké!'') attracted much scrutiny. While some critics dismissed the slogan as a tautology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Heltai-Hopp |first=András |title=Big players fight domestic battle in EP election |date=2009-06-05 |url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/content/view/12139/219/ |work=[[The Budapest Times]] }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; others considered it a call to bigotry and complained to the National Electoral Commission, which ruled it "unconstitutional" on the eve of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=EP elections – Hungary elections committee finds radical Jobbik's slogan unconstitutional |date=2009-06-04 |url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/content/view/12155/159/ |work=[[The Budapest Times]] }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 2014, in response to a demonstration in [[Târgu Mureș]], the [[Romania]]n president [[Traian Băsescu]] publicly called for a ban on Jobbik members from entering Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://xml.agerpres.ro/english/2014/03/11/basescu-asking-for-a-document-to-be-issued-to-ban-presence-in-romania-of-jobbik-party-members-20-47-34 |title=Basescu asking for a document to be issued to ban presence in Romania of Jobbik party members |work=[[AGERPRES]] |date=11 March 2014 |accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides defending the rights of ethnic Hungarians living abroad, Jobbik actively supports the cultural autonomy and language rights of the autochthonous [[Minorities in Hungary|ethnic minorities living in Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.szavayistvan.jobbik.hu/mikor_kaphatnak_v_gre_a_hazai_nemzetis_gek_probl_ma_n_lk_l_nemzetis_gi_nyelv_ingyenes_anyak_nyvi_kiv |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019163852/http://www.szavayistvan.jobbik.hu/mikor_kaphatnak_v_gre_a_hazai_nemzetis_gek_probl_ma_n_lk_l_nemzetis_gi_nyelv_ingyenes_anyak_nyvi_kiv |archive-date=2017-10-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oslovma.hu/index.php/hu/magyarul/172-magyarul3-magyarul3/1096-a-nemzetisegek-helyzeterol-targyalt-az-orszaggyules|title=A nemzetiségek helyzetéről tárgyalt az Országgyűlés|website=Oslovma.hu|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
[[File:Pongrátz Gergely 2004 Corvin.jpg|thumb|left|169px|[[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] veteran [[Gergely Pongrátz]], a Jobbik founder]]

===Foundation===
The group was established in 2002 as the Right-Wing Youth Community (''Jobboldali Ifjúsági Közösség – JOBBIK'') by a group of Catholic and Protestant university students, and became a political party in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Miért alakult meg a Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom-párt (Why was the Movement for a Better Hungary founded?) |url=http://zuglo.jobbik.hu/miert_alakult_meg_a_jobbik_magyarorszagert_mozgalom_part |publisher=zuglo.jobbik.hu (Hungarian) |date=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=November 2011}}. The new party elected [[Dávid Kovács]] as president, serving until 2006. A key figure was [[Gergely Pongrátz]], who in a speech to the founding conference invoked the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Pongrácz |first=Gergely |title=Pongrátz Gergely megható beszéde a Jobbik alakuló gyűlésén (Gergely Pongrácz’s moving speech to the Jobbik founding conference) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q7vVCfo-hY |publisher=youtube.com (Hungarian @ 6:25) |date=2003-10-24 |quote=The torch is now falling from our hands, it is you who must take it up, that spirit, those values, for which so many brothers-in-arms died in '56. It is you who must take it onward. ''(A fáklya kiesik a kezünkből, nektek kel átvenni, azt a szellemiséget, azokat az eszméket, amiért 56-ba olyan sok bajtársunk halt meg. Nektek kell tovább vinni.)''}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=December 2011}}

Around Christmas 2003, Jobbik conducted a nationwide programme of erecting crosses, to remind Hungarians of the "true meaning" of the holiday. The move was criticized by several Christian intellectual groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Szilágyi |first=Tamás |title=Sacred Characteristics of the Nation: "Hungarianism" as Political Religion? |url=http://www.revacern.eu/exchange-programme/EP-paper%20szilagyi.pdf |year=2008 |format=PDF |publisher=revacern.eu |quote=The other case, which drew the attention of the public, is the country‐wide cross erecting “actions” of JOBBIK Party during Christmas, which started in 2003... Several Christian intellectual groups have disapproved these actions; however, no clear objection appeared from the churches against the political appropriation of the religious symbol. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171509/http://www.revacern.eu/exchange-programme/EP-paper%20szilagyi.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alliances===
Even though the far-right [[Hungarian Justice and Life Party]] (MIÉP) and Jobbik had publicly quarreled, the parties formed an electoral alliance for the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 national elections]], the [[MIÉP–Jobbik Third Way Alliance of Parties]]. The alliance sought to win votes from the major conservative [[Fidesz]] party.&lt;ref name="hvg05"&gt;{{cite web |title=The nationalist Right Gets Together: "Third way" platform |url=http://hvg.hu/english/20051017nationalistright.aspx |publisher=[[Heti Világgazdaság|hvg]] |date=2005-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the alliance won only 2.2% of the votes, and Jobbik largely withdrew from it. In 2009 the State Audit Office (ÁSZ) reported the alliance for grave breaches of accounting rules. Jobbik blamed MIÉP alone for the irregularities.&lt;ref name="allbr"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.politics.hu/20090819/prosecutors-target-jobbikmiep-2006-election-vehicle | title=Prosecutors target Jobbik-MIÉP 2006 election vehicle | date=2009-08-19 | publisher=Politics.hu | access-date=2009-08-23 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810093500/http://www.politics.hu/20090819/prosecutors-target-jobbikmiep-2006-election-vehicle/ | archive-date=2011-08-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobbik fought the 2010 and 2014 general elections without political allies. Recently, some left-wing [[intellectual]]s suggested a [[coalition]] between the left-liberal parties and Jobbik&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/velemeny/20160308_Jobbik_MSZP_LMP_koalicio_TGM|title=A Jobbik–MSZP–LMP-koalíció ötlete|first=HVG Kiadó|last=Zrt.|date=8 March 2016|website=Hvg.hu|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to challenge the Fidesz government; however Jobbik rejected the idea to cooperate with parties which they call "20th century powers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailynewshungary.com/vona-coalition-with-left-wing-partners-fiction/|title=Vona: coalition with left-wing partners "fiction"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Gábor Vona said in an interview that “We will need several bridges ... to voters on the left, not to parties on the left. Jobbik offers a message, a program both to former leftist and former rightist voters.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-jobbik/hungarys-jobbik-ditches-far-right-past-to-challenge-orban-in-2018-idUSKBN14V1PW |title= Hungary's Jobbik ditches far-right past to challenge Orban in 2018 |date= Jan 11, 2017 |work=Reuters |access-date= 2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Magyar Gárda'' and conflicts in the party===
{{Main|Magyar Gárda}}
[[File:Magyar Gárda Kórus.jpg|thumb|left|225px|A [[Magyar Gárda]] choir sings in [[Békéscsaba]].]]
During the 2000s public order was one of the key topics of the Hungarian political life, especially after in 2006 [[Romani people|Roma]] people lynched a Hungarian teacher in the Eastern Hungarian village of [[Olaszliszka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hungarianspectrum.org/2009/11/13/olaszliszka-hungary-murder-final-verdict/|title=Olaszliszka (Hungary) murder: Final verdict|date=2009-11-13|work=Hungarian Spectrum|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case turned public attention to the failure of Roma integration and the inability of the [[Rendőrség|Hungarian police]] to maintain law and order in the Hungarian countryide. The idea of setting up a "national guard", similar to the [[National Guard of the United States]], became widespread among the conservative political parties of Hungary.

In June 2007, Gábor Vona, supported by the party, founded and registered the organisation called [[Magyar Gárda]] "Hungarian Guard", which says in its deed of foundation that it intends to become "part or core" of a national guard to be set up in accordance with the [[Gabriel Bethlen]] programme, and it also wishes to participate actively "in strengthening national self-defence" and "maintaining public order" as well as supporting and organising social and charity missions, in disaster prevention and civil defence. The foundation of the Guard was accompanied by sharp political debate.

On 10 March 2008 three leading figures resigned from the party: founding president [[Dávid Kovács]], committee chairman Ervin Nagy, and former ethics committee chairman Márton Fári. They named the Hungarian Guard as the cause of their resignation, stating that "Jobbik has been merged inseparably with the Guard, taking responsibility for something that it cannot really control in the long run".

On 2 July 2009 the Metropolitan Court of Appeal (''Fővárosi Ítélőtábla'') disbanded the Hungarian Guard Movement because the court held that its activities attacked the [[minority rights|human rights of minorities]] guaranteed by the [[Constitution of Hungary]]. The Guard has attempted to reorganize itself as a civil service association, the ''Magyar Gárda Foundation'', engaged in cultural and nation building activities rather than politics. Its renewed activities are opposed by the Hungarian authorities&lt;ref name=banning&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20090714/police-investigate-new-magyar-garda-former-minister-mulls-banning-jobbik|title=Police investigate "new" Magyar Gárda; former minister mulls banning Jobbik|work=Politics.hu|accessdate=14 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204135254/http://www.politics.hu/20090714/police-investigate-new-magyar-garda-former-minister-mulls-banning-jobbik|archivedate=4 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prosecutors claim that the founding of the new organization is in contempt of previous court rulings.

After several schisms, the organization has largely ceased activity. On January 28, 2017, some radical members of Magyar Gárda held a demonstration against Gábor Vona outside Jobbik's year-opening event. Participants denounced the new politics of Jobbik as a betrayal of the right wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hungarytoday.hu/news/hungarian-far-right-jobbik-party-holds-year-opening-conference-28046|title=Hungarian Far-Right Jobbik Party Holds Year-Opening Conference - Hungary Today|work=Hungary Today|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moderating the party ===
[[File:Jobbik Kongress.jpg|thumb|440x440px|Gábor Vona speaks on the party congress of Jobbik in 2017]]
Before the 2014 [[General election|parliamentary elections]] a new political trend, the so-called ''néppártosodás'' (transition to a people's party) appeared in Jobbik. The party adopted a new style of [[communication]] while reversing many radical elements of its earlier program.&lt;ref name="FreedomH"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/blog/far-right-hungarian-party-jobbik-moderating-good-thing|title=The Far-Right Hungarian Party Jobbik Is Moderating.

President Gábor Vona, in an interview, promised to "cut the wildlings", the one-time radicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jobbik.com/gabor_vona_on_the_wildling|title=Gábor Vona on the wildling|date=2015-04-24|work=jobbik.com|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the party pursued its strategy of de-demonization by abandoning parts of its original ideological corpus and excluding certain extremist elements, in order to make its image more respectable and incarnate a credible opposition to the conservative government of [[Viktor Orbán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37976687|title=Is Hungary's Jobbik leader really ditching far-right past?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FreedomH"/&gt; Despite Jobbik's pledges, particularly to the Jewish community in Hungary, many left-wing intellectuals and political figures say they want to keep their distance from an organization deemed as undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=French|first1=Ludovic|last1=Lepeltier-Kutasi|title=Hanoucca : le rabbin Köves rejette le bras tendu du Jobbik|work=Le Courrier d'Europe centrale|date=2016-12-30|url=https://courrierdeuropecentrale.fr/hanoucca-rabbin-koves-rejette-jobbik/|accessdate=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=French|author1=[[Ildikó Lendvai]]|title=« Pourquoi nous ne devons pas nous allier au Jobbik »|work=Le Courrier d'Europe centrale|date=2017-06-08|url=https://courrierdeuropecentrale.fr/pourquoi-nous-ne-devons-pas-nous-allier-jobbik/|accessdate=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary philosopher [[Ágnes Heller]], Holocaust survivor, considers that it's necessary to ally with all opposition parties, including Jobbik, to defeat the [[Viktor Orbán|Orbán]]'s [[Fidesz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Hungarian|url=https://magyaridok.hu/belfold/heller-agnes-es-jobbik-kozeledese-2532994/|title=Heller Ágnes és a Jobbik közeledése {{!}} Magyar Idők|website=Magyar Idők|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the local level, however, implicit alliances were formed between left-wing parties and Jobbik in partial municipal elections to defeat the ruling-government's party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=French|author=Florence La Bruyère|url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2018/03/25/en-hongrie-la-petite-ville-qui-defie-orban_1638691|title=En Hongrie, la petite ville qui défie Orbán|website=Libération|date=25 March 2018|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although the party is commonly described as [[Far-right politics|far-right]] by observers and in the international press, some media now consider that it's more difficult to classify Jobbik as it currently stands on the [[Far-right politics|far-right]], because of its de-demonization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/hungarian-political-foes-unite-against-government-attack-on-nationalists-1.3329144|title=Hungarian political foes unite against government ‘attack on nationalists’|website=The Irish Times|date=15 December 2017|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=German|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/wahlkampf-in-ungarn-zwischen-budapest-und-mekka-15424767.html|title=Wahlkampf in Ungarn : Zwischen Budapest und Mekka|website=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|date=31 January 2018|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=French|author=Aude Massiot|url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2018/04/09/en-hongrie-une-large-victoire-pour-viktor-orban_1642024|title=En Hongrie, une large victoire pour Viktor Orbán|quote=contre 19,8% pour l’ancien parti d’extrême droite Jobbik, passé au centre pour ces élections|website=Libération|date=9 April 2018|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=French|url=http://fr.euronews.com/2018/03/15/hongrie-manifestations-pro-et-anti-orban|title=Hongrie : manifestations pro et anti-Orban|quote=le Jobbik - un ancien parti d'extrême-droite qui cherche à se positionner au centre - est, lui, crédité de 18% des intentions de vote.|website=Euronews|date=15 March 2018|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fidesz]]'s ever-increasing right-wingisation rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=French|url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2018/03/27/jobbik-l-ancien-parti-paria-qui-veut-detroner-viktor-orban_1639149|title=Jobbik, l’ancien parti paria qui veut détrôner Viktor Orban|website=Libération|date=27 March 2018|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or even that Jobbik is currently a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] party&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-election-explainer/what-to-watch-at-hungarys-elections-idUSKCN1HC1BU|title=What to watch at Hungary's elections}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamodia.com/2018/03/20/hungarian-opposition-negotiations-falter-boost-orban/|title=Hungarian Opposition Negotiations Falter in Boost to Orban|website=Hamodia|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Jobbik's strategy, moving away from its far-right roots and staking out a more centrist position, has also resulted in the emergence of more radical dissident formations, like the new party [[Force and Determination (Hungary)|Force and Determination]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/08/hungarian-far-right-launches-new-political-party|title=Hungarian far right launches new political party|website=The Guardian|date=8 July 2017|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Due to the disillusioning of young people because no-perspectives, decreasing living conditions and frustrating level of state corruption, popularity of Jobbik skyrocketed among younger generations. Since 2014 Jobbik consciously tried to address young people that are disappointed with other parties. As a result of its youth policy Jobbik's popularity has risen to a never seen level. According to an international survey, conducted in 2016, 53 percent of the young Hungarians aged between 18 and 35 years would vote for Jobbik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://visegradpost.com/en/2016/04/06/the-jobbik-at-53-among-15-34/|title=The Jobbik at 53% among 15-34 {{!}} Visegrád Post|website=visegradpost.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crisis after 2018 ===
Following the 2018 parliamentary election, [[Gábor Vona]] resigned, due to his earlier promises that he would resign if he could not lead the party to victory on the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=French|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2018/04/10/97001-20180410FILWWW00091-hongrie-le-chef-du-parti-jobbik-demissionne.php|title=Hongrie: le chef du parti Jobbik démissionne|website=Le Figaro|date=10 April 2018|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rumors that Jobbik would change its policies, the National Board of the party unanimously decided in favor of the moderate right-wing conservative wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://168ora.hu/itthon/vona-gabor-a-hatterbe-vonul-csak-a-tanacsaival-segiti-a-jobbikot-de-meg-visszaterhet-148264|title=Vona Gábor a háttérbe vonul, csak a tanácsaival segíti a Jobbikot, de még visszatérhet|work=168ora.hu|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 May 2018 the party elected [[Tamás Sneider]] as the president and [[Márton Gyöngyösi]] as the executive vice-president of the party. The Hungarian press evaluated the new presidency as a victory of the moderate politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://index.hu/belfold/2018/05/12/jobbik_tisztujitas_sneider_toroczkai/|title=Sneider Tamás lett a Jobbik elnöke|last=Péter|first=Rovó Attila, Bohus|access-date=2018-05-14|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamás Sneider told he wanted to build a socially conscious party based on the teachings of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alfahir.hu/2018/05/14/sneider_tamas_jobbik_tisztujitas_neppartosodas_keresztenyseg_migracio_kormany|title=„Míg a Fidesz jelképe a narancs, addig a mi jelképünk a kettős kereszt” – Interjú Sneider Tamással|date=2018-05-14|work=Alfahír|access-date=2018-05-14|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[László Toroczkai]] who ran for the leadership election against Támas and who got 46.2% in the election, he would later tell reporters he had formed a new hardline platform and gave party leaders until June 23 to integrate it in party policy or risk a break-up of Jobbik.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-jobbik/hardliners-in-hungarys-jobbik-demand-return-to-far-right-roots-idUSKCN1IN1MW|title=Hardliners in Hungary's Jobbik demand return to far-right roots|first=Marton|last=Dunai|website=Reuters.com|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the platform entailed a return to goals pursued by the original Jobbik, including an end to immigration, stemming emigration of Hungarian youth to the wealthier west of the EU, a tough line on Hungary's Roma minority and support for ethnic Hungarian minorities in neighboring states.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In June 2018, Toroczkai and [[Dóra Dúró]] would form their own party [[Our Home Movement (Hungary)|Our Home Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hungarytoday.hu/brand-new-far-right-party-emerges-from-the-ashes-of-jobbik/|title=Brand New Far-Right Party Emerges from the Ashes of Jobbik|date=25 June 2018|website=Hungarytoday.hu|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 7, 2018, László Toroczkai announced to the media news, the Our Home Movement party got 3 former Jobbik politicians, [[István Apáti]], [[Erik Fülöp]] and [[János Volner]] joins to Toroczkai's political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20181107-volner-apati-fulop-beleptek-a-mi-hazank-mozgalomba.html|title=Az exjobbikos Volner János: Nekünk nem lesz oligarchánk|work=origo.hu|access-date=2018-11-07|language=hu-HU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 elections to the European parliament]], a comment was posted on an unofficial and unverified Hungarian political internet forum, allegedly in the name of [[Krisztina Morvai]], who then headed the party's electoral list.

In a newsletter published by a group calling itself "The trade union of Hungarian police officers prepared for action", the following was allegedly printed: "Given our current situation, anti-Semitism is not just our right, but it is the duty of every Hungarian homeland lover, and we must prepare for armed battle against the Jews." The editor of the union, Judit Szima, was a Jobbik candidate in the upcoming election for the European Union parliament.

During spring 2012, Jobbik representative in Hungarian parliament Zsolt Baráth caused an outrage by commemorating 1882 [[blood libel]] against the Jews in Parliament. The [[Tiszaeszlár Affair|Tiszaeszlár blood libel]], found later to be unrelated to Jews, was known as first major anti-Jewish event in modern Hungary, predating [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=FreeHungary |url=http://freehungary.hu/archives-new/1259-discovering-jewish-roots--former-anti-semitic-party-leader-meets-with-rabbi-koeves.html |title=Discovering Jewish roots – former anti-Semitic party leader meets with rabbi Köves |publisher=Freehungary.hu |date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2013-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217205554/http://freehungary.hu/archives-new/1259-discovering-jewish-roots--former-anti-semitic-party-leader-meets-with-rabbi-koeves.html |archivedate=2013-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech of Baráth caused controversy among Jobbik MPs: some - however finding it inappropriate and uncalled for - stated that in a matured democracy there should not be taboo topics, while leaders of the Jobbik Parliamentary Group told the media that they had evaluated the speech and learnt the lesson that they should care more about what their MPs say. After the incident Baráth was not re-elected and is no longer an MP of Jobbik.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atv.hu/belfold/20120412_a_jobbik_reagalt_barath_zsolt_botranyos_felszolalasara?source=hirkereso|title=A Jobbik reagált Baráth Zsolt botrányos parlamenti felszólalására|last=ATV|website=ATV.hu|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, while evaluating the latest news on the controversial [[Operation Pillar of Defense|Israeli military action in the Gaza strip]], the party's deputy parliamentary leader, [[:hu:Gyöngyösi Márton|Márton Gyöngyösi]], stated in his speech in the Parliament: "I think such a conflict makes it timely to tally up people of Jewish ancestry who live here, especially in the Hungarian Parliament and the Hungarian government, who, indeed, pose a national security risk to Hungary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4312434,00.html |title=Hungary: Far-right leader demands lists of Jews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=27 November 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Márton Gyöngyösi admitted immediately after his speech that he had composed his sentence wrongly, as he thought of MPs with Israeli-Hungarian [[double citizenship]] and not of Jewish people. At the same time Gyöngyösi offered an apology.&lt;ref name="mno.hu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mno.hu/belfold/a-futsalcsapattol-egesz-biztosan-megvalnanak-2403772|title=A futsalcsapattól egész biztosan megválnának|date=17 June 2017|website=Mno.hu|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Al Jazeera]] reported, the incident led to "international condemnation of Nazi-style policies and a protest outside the legislature in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/11/2012112722413396434.html |title=Hungarian MP denounced for 'Jewish list' call |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around ten thousand Hungarians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Than |first=Krisztina |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/02/us-hungary-protest-nazi-idUSBRE8B10CW20121202 |title=Thousands rally against far right in Hungary |publisher=Reuters |date=2 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Budapest protested against Gyöngyösi's anti-Semitic remarks. All major Hungarian political parties took part in the protest. At the protest, [[Attila Mesterházy]] the leader of the successor of the state party of the communist era, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]], described Jobbik as a "fascist possessions virus", while 5th district of Budapest mayor [[Antal Rogán]], representing the governing [[Fidesz]] party, described Jobbik as "evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kanadaihirlap.com/2012/12/02/a-szelsojobboldal-egy-virus-amit-karantenba-kell-zarni-harcias-hangulat-a-budapesti-antifasiszta-tuntetesen/ |title=A szélsőjobboldal egy vírus amit karanténba kell zárni – Harcias hangulat a budapesti antifasiszta tüntetésen |publisher=Kanadaihirlap.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish organizations responded to Gyöngyösi speech by describing it as a reintroduction of Nazism in Hungarian parliament and by describing Jobbik as a [[Nazism|Nazi]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zsido.com/cikkek/Nyilt_nacizmus_a_Parlament_falai_kozott/10/3210 |title=Hírek – Nyílt nácizmus a Parlament falai között |publisher=zsido.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Tibor Ágoston, the deputy chairman of Jobbik's [[Debrecen]] and [[Hajdú-Bihar County]] organization, referred to the Holocaust as the "holoscam". Tamás Horovitz, the chairman of the Debrecen Jewish Congregation and the mayor of Debrecen, [[Lajos Kósa]], condemned Ágoston's remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atv.hu/belfold/20140212-holokamurol-beszelt-a-jobbik-kepviseloje |title="Holokamuról" beszélt a Jobbik képviselője |publisher=atv.hu |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mazsihisz.hu/2014/02/14/kosa-lajos-elhatarolodik-a-jobbikos-kepviselo-holokausztra-tett-kijelenteseitol-6831.html |title=Kósa Lajos elhatárolódik a Jobbikos képviselő holokausztra tett kijelentéseitől |publisher=mazsihisz.hu |date=14 February 2014 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20140213/jewish-leader-condemns-jobbik-politicians-holocaust-remarks/ |title=Jewish leader condemns Jobbik politician’s Holocaust remarks |publisher=politics.hu |date=13 February 2014 |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Ágoston harshly criticized Gábor Vona for not supporting Előd Novák and cutting ties with the so-called "radicals" in the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vs.hu/kozelet/osszes/egy-debreceni-jobbikos-mar-fellazadt-vona-ellen-0421|title=Egy debreceni jobbikos már fellázadt Vona ellen|website=Vs.hu|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[deputy leader]] [[Előd Novák]] posted to his social media account on Facebook a picture of himself and his family next to a separate image of Rikardo Racz, the first newborn in Hungary of the year who was born to a [[Romani people|Romani]] family. In a comment on the pictures, he stated that the population of Hungarians would become a minority and suggested that the Romani population is the biggest problem facing Hungary.  Novák's remarks were both condemned and supported.  Novák would later respond to the issue by refusing to apologize and suggested that the family should apologize to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31168246|title=The baby that divided a nation|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=8 February 2015|accessdate=2015-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Előd Novák was forced by the party's parliamentary group to resign from his position as an MP in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hungarytoday.hu/news/hardliner-mp-elod-novak-kicked-jobbiks-parliamentary-group-11164|title=Hardliner MP Előd Novák Kicked Out Of Jobbik's Parliamentary Group - Hungary Today|work=Hungary Today|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, he is a vocal critic of Jobbik's new policies.

===World Jewish Congress Protest===
[[File:Jobbik-NewHungarianGuard-May2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Members of the New Hungarian Guard stand at a Jobbik rally against a gathering of the [[World Jewish Congress]] in Budapest, 4 May 2013]]
On 4 May 2013, Jobbik members protested against the [[World Jewish Congress]] in [[Budapest]], claiming the protest was against "a Jewish attempt to buy up [[Hungary]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22413301|title=Jobbik rally against World Jewish Congress in Budapest|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobbik MP Enikő Hegedűs vociferously condemned both Israel and Jews at the rally as her husband, Lóránt Hegedűs Jr., stood nearby.&lt;ref name="churches back jews" /&gt; An ordained minister in the [[Reformed Church in Hungary]], Lóránt Hegedűs himself had served in the National Assembly as an MP of the far-right nationalist [[Hungarian Justice and Life Party]] from 1998 to 2002.&lt;ref name="extremists religion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odehnal |first=Bernhard |year=2011 |title=Right wing extremist groups and religion in Central Europe |journal=Working papers 2011 |publisher=Institute for Comparative Political Research |location=Brno |url=http://ispo.fss.muni.cz/uploads/2download/prezentace2/Referat_Rechts.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; He invited Holocaust denier [[David Irving]] to his Budapest church in 2007 as a "special guest",&lt;ref name="extremists religion" /&gt; and has also been accused of anti-Semitism on several occasions for statements he has made about Jews at Jobbik events.

President of Jobbik Gábor Vona later stated that he had criticized Zionism as a political idea and pointed out that he understood the Hungarian Jewish community had to survive such traumas during the 20th century that make dialogue very hard. At the same time he emphasized that he wanted to have harmonic relations with the Hungarian Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/world/362663/exclusive-in-first-talk-with-jewish-media-hungarys-far-right-leader-strikes/|title=Exclusive: In First Talk With Jewish Media, Hungary’s Far Right Leader Strikes A New Pose|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "Hanukkah case" ===
In December 2016 Gábor Vona, besides his Christmas greetings to the nation's churches, as a gesture sent his greetings to his Jewish compatriots on the occasion of the [[Jewish holidays]]. The message of Vona raised controversy among Hungarian Jewish communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-jobbik/hungarys-jobbik-ditches-far-right-past-to-challenge-orban-in-2018-idUSKBN14V1PW|title=Hungary's Jobbik ditches far-right past to challenge Orban in 2018|date=11 January 2017|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.szombat.org/hirek-lapszemle/vona-gabor-hanukai-udvozlete-meg-sokszor|title=Vona Gábor hanukai üdvözlete – még sokszor {{!}} Szombat Online|work=Szombat Online|accessdate=2017-10-26|language=hu-HU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vona had already stated before that those, even party members, who had wanted to see Jobbik as a racist or anti-Semitic party had been wrong. However, Vona took responsibility for turning a blind eye in such situations earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atv.hu/belfold/20150910-vona-nem-akarok-mindenaron-miniszterelnok-lenni|title=Vona: nem akarok mindenáron miniszterelnök lenni|website=Atv.hu|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warnings against "EU Slavery" and ethnic shift in Hungary===
Gábor Vona earlier said that, Hungarians became slaves because the European Union had only wanted Hungary to enter the EU because of its cheap workforce.&lt;ref name="BPtimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://budapesttimes.hu/2011/03/23/vona-hungarians-are-slaves-and-soon-to-be-outnumbered/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407093902/http://budapesttimes.hu/2011/03/23/vona-hungarians-are-slaves-and-soon-to-be-outnumbered/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 April 2014 |title=Vona: Hungarians are slaves and soon to be outnumbered |publisher=budapesttimes.hu |date=23 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vona also stated that "the number of Hungarians continues to fall while the gypsy population grows ever larger. This was not racism but a real social and economic problem. Anyone who doesn’t understand this is not normal."&lt;ref name="BPtimes" /&gt;

In a 2016 inverview, Vona announced that he believes the EU also has some advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-02/hungary-s-jobbik-abandons-push-to-leave-eu-vona-tells-inforadio|title=Hungary’s Radical Jobbik Party Abandons Push to Leave EU|date=2 June 2016|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2017 interview Márton Gyöngyösi, deputy leader of the party's parliamentary group, pointed out that Jobbik seeks for the constructive reform of the European Union.&lt;ref name="mno.hu"/&gt; In addition, Gyöngyösi also said that in order to have a more harmonized EU, maybe some national competencies, such as labor conditions and wage regulations can be reconsidered.

===Attempts to criminalize promotion of "sexual deviancy"===
Jobbik, as a conservative party, does not prefer policies that promote lifestyles that are different from the Christian-conservative model. The party maintains that the most important social unit is the [[traditional family]]. In April 2012, Jobbik tried to introduce a bill into the Hungarian parliament that would change the national constitution to allegedly "protect public morals and the mental health of the young generations" by banning the popularization of "sexual deviancy". The legislation was drafted by party spokesman Ádám Mirkóczki. This was to target "homosexuality, sex changes, transvestitism, bisexuality and paedophile behaviour". The proposed amendments would criminalise anyone who "popularizes their sexual relations—deviancy—with another person of the same sex, or other disturbances of sexual behaviour, before the wider public". The penalty would be three years in prison, or five years if 'popularizing' is done in front of minors. The draft legislation ultimately failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://budapesttimes.hu/2012/04/19/jobbik-seeks-gay-propaganda-ban/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408214124/http://budapesttimes.hu/2012/04/19/jobbik-seeks-gay-propaganda-ban/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 April 2014 |title=Jobbik seeks ‘gay propaganda’ ban |first=R. |last=Kinga |work=[[The Budapest Times]] |date=19 April 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===Support for Miklós Horthy===
In Hungary it is a very important and complex issue to deal with the [[interwar period]] and the legacy of the one-time [[Regent of Hungary]], [[Miklós Horthy]]. Jobbik, like other right and centre-right parties in Hungary, supports a balanced view, appreciating the positive elements of the consolidation after the [[World War I]] and Trianon trauma. On 3 November 2013, Márton Gyöngyösi and other Jobbik members unveiled a bronze bust of [[Miklós Horthy]], a nationalist admiral who served as Regent from 1920 to 1944, in front of the "Church of Homecoming" in downtown Budapest's [[Liberty Square (Budapest)|Liberty Square]], where Lóránt Hegedűs serves as pastor.&lt;ref name="bishop alarmed" /&gt; The ceremony drew strong public and official condemnations over the legacy of Horthy, who [[Hungary in World War II|led Hungary]] into [[World War II]] in 1941 on the side of the [[Axis powers]] (which the country had officially [[Tripartite Pact#Hungary|joined]] the previous year). Many Hungarians thus see Horthy as a source of deep national shame and Nazi collaborator, complicit in the murder of half a million Hungarian Jews in [[History of the Jews in Hungary#The Holocaust|the Holocaust in Hungary]]{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Others, however, revere him as a national hero, ostensibly for guiding the country to stability in its chaotic [[Hungary between the World Wars|interwar period]]—at the ceremony, Gyöngyösi proclaimed Horthy "the greatest Hungarian statesman of the 20th century".&lt;ref name="reuters horthy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/11/03/uk-hungary-farright-horthy-protest-idUKBRE9A20BF20131103|title=Hungarian far-right sparks protests as it commemorates wartime leader|last=Dunai|first=Márton|publisher=Reuters UK|date=3 November 2013|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several thousand individuals—some of whom had pinned [[Yellow badge|yellow Stars of David]] on their clothing came out to protest against the statue, and were met by a smaller crowd of far right protesters near the church who responded with anti-Semitic and racist slurs{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Mayor Antal Rogán condemned Jobbik's move as a "political provocation" that would allow the "western European left-wing press" to unfairly characterise Hungary as being plagued by anti-Semitic extremists. Hegedűs, who had already hung a portrait of Horthy by his church's entrance well prior to the statue's installation,&lt;ref name="extremists religion" /&gt; defended Horthy's legacy to journalists after the unveiling, calling it "unjust and historically wrong" to implicate the former leader in crimes against humanity because he was suspected not prosecuted at the [[Nuremberg trials]].&lt;ref name="reuters horthy" /&gt; In light of the furore over the statue, church officials announced they would launch another official probe into Hegedűs's political activities.&lt;ref name="bishop alarmed"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/11/05/hungarian-bishop-alarmed-by-nazi-allys-monument/|title=Hungarian Bishop Alarmed by Nazi Ally’s Monument|last=Feher|first=Margit|date=5 November 2013|work=Emerging Europe|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral performance==

===Growth and electoral success===
The party faced its first electoral test with the coming of the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European parliamentary elections]]. The election's results shocked their opponents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hungarianspectrum.wordpress.com/2009/06/07/european-parliamentary-elections-hungary/ | title=European parliamentary elections: Hungary | publisher=[[Hungarian Spectrum]] | date=2009-06-07 | last=Balogh | first=Eva}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the party sending three [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] to [[European Parliament|Strasbourg]]; coming close to equal in number of votes with the governing [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] (MSZP) while eliminating their liberal coalition partner [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SZDSZ), to become the nation's third largest party.&lt;ref name="europarl.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Results of the 2009 European elections: Hungary |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/archive/elections2009/en/hungary_en.html |publisher=[www.europarl.europa.eu]  |date=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London on 16 May 2008, the delegation of Jobbik's Committee of Foreign Affairs met [[Nick Griffin]], chairman of the [[British National Party]]. They discussed cooperation between the two parties, and the elections for the European Parliament. Griffin spoke at the party rally in August 2008, while former vice-president Zoltán Füzessy is presently resident in [[Gravesend]], [[Kent]], England.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1911033.ece|title=Top Euro Nazi's hate site run from terraced house … in Gravesend|work=The Sun |date=2008-11-10 |accessdate=2008-11-10 |location=London |first=Tom |last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alliance of European National Movements]] (AENM) was formed in Budapest on 24 October 2009. The alliance's founding members were ''Jobbik'' (the Alliance was established during their sixth party congress), France's [[National Front (France)|National Front]], UK's [[British National Party]] Italy's [[Tricolour Flame]], Sweden's [[National Democrats (Sweden)|National Democrats]] and Belgium's [[National Front (Belgium)|National Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=European nationalist parties form alliance |url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1090191&amp;lang=eng_news |publisher=[[Taiwan News]] (source: [[Associated Press]]) |date=2009-10-24 |quote=Hungary's Jobbik, France's National Front, Italy's Three-Color Flame, Sweden's National Democrats and Belgium's National Front formed the Alliance of European National Movements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since January 2014 [[Béla Kovács (politician, 1960)|Béla Kovács]] has been its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JOBBIK, nueva presidencia de la AEMN en su Asamblea General|url=http://www.tribunadeeuropa.com/?p=18105|website=Tribuna de Europa: La Voz del Pueblo Español|accessdate=24 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108211726/http://www.tribunadeeuropa.com/?p=18105|archivedate=2014-01-08|language=Spanish|date=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aemn.info/?page_id=46 |title=Presidency |work=Alliance of European National Movements |year=2014 |accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Jobbik officially quit AENM and cut all ties with the members of the alliance.

On 12 April 2015, Jobbik's Lajos Rig defeated the [[Fidesz]] candidate in a parliamentary by-election in [[Veszprém County]]. It was the second by-election lost by Fidesz after the national 2014 elections, leaving the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition two short of the parliamentary supermajority (''kétharmad'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dull|first1=Szabolcs|title=Győzött a Jobbik a tapolcai választáson|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2015/04/12/idokozi_valasztas_ajka_sumeg_tapolca_parlament/|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=Index.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gabor vona sympathizer.jpg|left|thumb|327x327px|Gábor Vona on his nationwide tour with Jobbik voters (2017)]]
On 14 March 2017 Jobbik started close cooperation with Bulgarian [[IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement|VMRO]], [[Conservative People's Party of Estonia|Estonian Conservative People's Party]] and Croatian GO! as well as with trade unions, such as the Polish Solidarność 80, in the framework of the Wage Union European Citizens' Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hungary-jobbik-idUKKBN18Q1CY|title=Hungary's opposition Jobbik to campaign on higher wages in 2018 election|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.K.|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jobbik.com/vona_and_gyongyosis_sofia_visit_reveals_launch_date_of_signature_collection_for_the_wage_union|title=Vona and Gyöngyösi's Sofia visit reveals launch date of signature collection for the Wage Union|date=2017-07-12|work=jobbik.com|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jobbik.com/croatia_launches_collection_of_signatures_for_wage_union|title=Croatia launches collection of signatures for Wage Union|date=2017-09-25|work=jobbik.com|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungarian Parliamentary Elections 2014===
In November 2013, the party leader [[Gábor Vona]], expressed optimism about the election saying that the party planned "no less than election victory in 2014". He argued that Jobbik candidates had been faring well in local elections and that opinion surveys had showed that Jobbik was the most popular party among voters aged under 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.politics.hu/20131119/vona-says-jobbik-plans-2014-election-victory/ |title=Vona says Jobbik plans 2014 election victory |work=All Hungary Media Group |date=19 November 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has prepared its election programme dubbed "We'll say it, we'll solve it," which focuses on guaranteeing people a livelihood, safety and order. Vona said his party would initiate a referendum on protecting Hungarian land and on amending Hungary's European Union accession treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=18 January 2014 |url=http://www.politics.hu/20140118/jobbik-to-overthrow-past-24-years-says-vona/ |title=Jobbik to overthrow past 24 years, says Vona |work=All Hungary Media Group |date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2014, Vona held a rally in London where he sharply criticised the election law for preventing Hungarians living abroad from voting by mail at the parliamentary election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=27 January 2014|url=http://www.politics.hu/20140126/vona-in-london-speech-promises-jobs-at-home-to-expat-hungarians-slams-government-for-curbs-on-voting-abroad/|title=Vona, in London speech, promises jobs at home to expat Hungarians, slams government for curbs on voting abroad |work=All Hungary Media Group |date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed bans of [[lesbian]] or [[gay]]-themed books in the [[United States]].

==2005==
===Alabama===
[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] lawmaker [[Gerald Allen (politician)|Gerald Allen]] proposed [[Alabama]] House Bill 30 (HB30), which would have banned [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] libraries from purchasing books by gay authors or with gay characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/26/eveningnews/main691106.shtml|title=Alabama Bill Targets Gay Authors|last=Holguin|first=Jaime|date=27 April 2005|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill did not become law.

===Arkansas===
A proposed ban in [[Arkansas]] would have barred any representation of gay and lesbian people in schools, libraries, and state-funded universities. It passed the state's lower house, but a tie vote in the state senate's Education Committee failed to bring it to the state senate floor.&lt;!--[http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/02/021705arkBooks.htm] dead reference--&gt;

===Oklahoma===
State Rep. [[Sally Kern]], a Republican from [[Oklahoma City]] supported House Resolution 1039, which would have required Oklahoma libraries to "confine homosexually themed books and other age-inappropriate material to areas exclusively for adult access and distribution." The bill also required that no public funds be used in "the distribution of such materials to children." The bill passed in the house but not the senate.

The '''Liverpool 29''' councillors were 29 left-wing councillors on the [[Liverpool City Council]] who were suspended from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] group on the council in 1990 for voting against rent rises, redundancies and implementation of the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Poll Tax]], in breach of the Labour Party whip. They formed their own "Broad Left" group, standing independently in local elections, and also putting up [[Lesley Mahmood]] as a candidate in the [[Liverpool Walton by-election, 1991]].

'''Louis IV, Count Palatine of the Rhine''' (1 January 1424, [[Heidelberg]] &amp;ndash; 13 August 1449, [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]) was an [[Elector Palatine]] of the [[Rhine]] from the [[House of Wittelsbach]] in 1436 - 1449.

==Biography==
Louis IV was the son of [[Louis III, Elector Palatine]] and his second wife [[Matilda of Savoy]]. His mother was a fourth-generation descendant of [[Thomas III of Piedmont]] (1248 - 1282), the eldest son of [[Thomas II of Savoy]].

From the death of Louis III in 1436 until 1442, Louis IV ruled under guardianship of his uncle, Count Palatine [[Otto I, Count Palatine of Mosbach|Otto I of Mosbach]]. In 1444 he repelled the attacks of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]] as an Imperial captain.

In 1445 he married [[Margaret of Savoy, Countess Palatine of the Rhine|Margarete of Savoy]],{{sfn|Kekewich|2008|p=214}} widow of king [[Louis III of Naples]] and daughter of Duke [[Amadeus VIII of Savoy]]. With her, he had his only son, [[Philipp of the Rhine|Philipp]] (14 July 1448 &amp;ndash; 28 February 1508). When he died in 1449, aged 25 years, in Worms, his brother [[Frederick I, Elector Palatine|Frederick]] inherited the Palatinate. Louis was buried in the [[Holy Spirit]] church of Heidelberg.

[[File:Xin Dynasty Uprisings.png|300px|thumb|Map of peasant uprisings in Xin Dynasty, including Lulin and Red Eyebrows rebellions]]
'''Lulin''' ({{zh|t=綠林|p=Lùlín}}, "green forest") refers, as an umbrella term, to one of the two major agrarian rebellion movements against [[Wang Mang]]'s short-lived [[Xin dynasty]] in the modern southern [[Henan]] and northern [[Hubei]] region who banded together to pool their strengths, and whose collective strength eventually led to the downfall of the Xin and a temporary reinstatement of the [[Han Dynasty]] with Liu Xuan ([[Gengshi Emperor]]) as the emperor.  Many Lulin leaders became important members of Gengshi Emperor's government, but infighting and incompetence (both of the emperor and his officials) in governing the empire led to the fall of the regime after only two years, paving the way for the eventual rise of Liu Xiu ([[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]]) of the Eastern Han.  The name Lulin came from the Lulin Mountains (in modern [[Yichang]], Hubei), where the rebels had their stronghold for a while.

== Start of the rebellion ==
In 17 AD, the Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei, [[Hunan]], and southern Henan) was suffering a famine that was greatly exacerbated by the corruption and incompetence of Xin officials.  The victims of the famine were reduced to consuming wild plants, and even those were in short supply, causing the suffering people to attack each other.  Two men named Wang Kuang (王匡) and Wang Feng (王鳳), both from Xinshi (新市, in modern [[Jingmen]], Hubei) became arbiters in some of these disputes, and they became the leaders of the enfamined people.  They were later joined by many others, including Ma Wu (馬武), Wang Chang (王常), and Cheng Dan (成丹).  Within a few months, 7,000 to 8,000 men gathered together under their commands.  They had their base at Lulin Mountain, and their modus operandi was to attack and pillage villages far from the cities for food.  This carried on for several years, during which they grew to tens of thousands in size.

Wang sent messengers issuing pardons in hopes of causing these rebels to disband. Once the messengers returned to the Xin capital [[Chang'an]], some honestly reported that the rebels gathered because the harsh laws made it impossible for them to make a living and therefore they were forced to rebel. Some, in order to flatter Wang Mang, told him that these were simply evil resistors who needed to be killed, or that this was a temporary phenomenon. Wang listened to those who flattered him and generally relieved those who told the truth from their posts. Further, Wang made no further attempts to pacify the rebels, but instead decided to suppress them by force.  In reality, the rebels were forced into rebellion to survive, and they were hoping that eventually, when the famine was over, they could return home to farm.  As a result, they never dared to attack cities.

In 21, the governor of Jing Province mobilized 20,000 soldiers to attack the Lulin rebels, and a battle was pitched at Yundu (雲杜), a major victory for the rebels, who killed thousands of government soldiers and captured their food supply and arms.  When the governor tried to retreat, his retreat route was temporarily cut off by Ma Wu, but Ma Wu allowed him to escape, not wanting to offend the government more than the rebels have done already.  Instead, the Lulin rebels roved near the area, capturing many women, and then returning to the Lulin Mountain.  By this point, they had 50,000 men.

== Temporary breakup after plague ==
In 22, the Lulin rebels suddenly suffered a serious plague of an unspecified nature, and at least 25,000 men died.  This led to the breakup of the group into 3 "force".
* Wang Chang and Cheng Dan moved to the west, toward Nan Commandery (roughly modern [[Jingzhou]], Hubei); this branch was known as the ''Xiajiang Force'' (下江兵).
* Wang Feng, Wang Kuang, Ma Wu, and two other leaders Zhu Wei (朱鮪) and Zhang Ang (張卬) moved to the north, toward Nanyang Commandery (roughly modern [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]], [[Henan]]); this branch was known as the ''Xinshi Force'' (新市兵) (because the Wangs were both from Xinshi).
* Around this time, there was another nearby group of rebels led by Chen Mu (陳牧) and Liao Zhan (廖湛) known as the ''Pinglin Force'' (平林兵) because both Chen and Liao were from Pinglin (in modern [[Suizhou]], Hubei).
These rebels at this time still generally lacked political ambition.

== Reunion and the start of political ambition ==
They were, however, soon spurred on by someone who was.  [[Liu Yan (Bosheng)|Liu Yan]], a descendant of a distant branch of the Han imperial clan, who lived in his ancestral territory of Chongling (舂陵, in modern [[Xiangyang]], Hubei), had long been disgusted by Wang Mang's usurpation of the Han throne, and had long aspired to start a rebellion. He had a brother, [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Liu Xiu]] who, by contrast, was a careful and deliberate man, who was content to be a farmer. Around this time, there were prophecies being spread about that the Lius would return to power, and many men gathered about Liu Yan, requesting that he lead them.  He agreed to do so.  He then joined his forces with the Lulin's Xinshi and Pinglin Forces, and they captured a number of villages and pillaged them.  In winter 22, the ambitious Liu Yan then decided to make an initial assault against Wancheng, the capital of Nanyang Commandery, and he initially failed, suffering such a major loss at the hand of Zhen Fu (甄阜), the governor of Nanyang. His sister Liu Yuan (劉元) and brother Liu Zhong (劉仲) both died in the battle.  Encouraged, Zhen then led his forces in pursuit, intending to crush the all Liu-Lulin rebels once and for all.

Alarmed, the Xinshi and Pinglin Forces began to consider withdrawing from the coalition and fleeing.  At that time, however, the Xiajiang Force arrived nearby, and Liu was able to convince Wang Chang, who was respected by the other Xiajiang leaders, that Liu was a capable military leader.  The Xiajiang Force therefore joined the coalition, and this led the Xinshi and Pinglin Forces to stay in the coalition.

Under Liu's command, the forces then made a surprise attack on Zhen's rear, seizing all of reserve food and arms of the government force.  On the [[Chinese New Year]] 23, Liu crushed Zhen's forces and killed him and his assistant in battle.  Encouraged by the victory, the Lulin leaders began to claim for themselves the title of generals, seize cities, create governmental organizations, and send out propaganda attacking Wang Mang.

== Restoration of Han under Gengshi Emperor ==
At this time, there were more and more calls within the army to support a descendant of the Han imperial house to be emperor.  The soldiers under Liu Yan's direct command and the Xiajiang leaders all supported Liu.  However, the leaders of the Xinshi and Pinglin Forces were deeply jealous and suspicious of Liu's strict discipline, and wanted to instead support someone weak.  They found a minor leader within the Pinglin Force—a descendant of the Han imperial house who was a third cousin of Liu Yan, named [[Gengshi Emperor|Liu Xuan]], who was claiming the title of General Gengshi (更始將軍) at the time.  They decided to support Liu Xuan to be emperor, and Liu Yan, after initial opposition, decided to agree as well, not wanting to start a fight.  In spring 23, Liu Xuan was proclaimed emperor.  Wang Kuang, Wang Feng, Zhu, Liu Yan, and Chen were the top officials in this new regime.

== Battle of Kunyang ==
{{main|Battle of Kunyang}}
Wang Mang decided that he had to crush this rebellion once and for all.  He sent his cousin Wang Yi (王邑) and his prime minister Wang Xun (王尋) with what he considered to be overwhelming force, some 430,000 men, intending to crush the newly constituted Han regime. The Han forces were at this point in two groups—one led by Wang Feng, Wang Chang, and Liu Xiu, which, in response to the arrival of the Xin forces, withdrew to the small town of Kunyang (昆陽, in modern [[Ye County]], Henan) and one led by Liu Yan, which was sieging Wancheng. The rebels in Kunyang initially wanted to scatter, but Liu Xiu opposed it; rather, he advocated that they guard Kunyang securely, while he would gather all other available troops in surrounding areas and attack the Xin forces from the outside. After initially rejecting Liu Xiu's idea, the Kunyang rebels eventually agreed.

Liu Xiu carried out his action, and when he returned to Kunyang, he began harassing the sieging Xin forces from the outside. Wang Yi and Wang Xun, annoyed, led 10,000 men to attack Liu Xiu and ordered the rest of their troops not to move from their siege locations. Once they engaged in battle, however, after minor losses, the other units were hesitant to assist them, and Liu Xiu killed Wang Xun in battle. Once that happened, the Han forces inside Kunyang burst out of the city and attacked the other Xin units, and the much larger Xin forces suffered a total collapse. The soldiers largely deserted and went home, unable to be gathered again. Wang Yi had to withdraw with only several thousand men back to [[Luoyang]].  Once the news about the Battle of Kunyang spread throughout the empire, the people rose everywhere else simultaneously, often killing the local government officials and claiming to be officials under the new Han regime.  Within a month, nearly the entire empire slipped out of Xin control.

== Initial infighting and Liu Yan's death ==
Around the same time, Liu Yan was able to finally capture Wancheng.  Gengshi Emperor entered the city and made it his temporary capital.

However, at this time, infighting would begin.  The very first major incident of infighting in Gengshi Emperor's regime would happen in this time, though. Gengshi Emperor, along with the officials who were formerly leaders of the Xinshi and Pinglin Forces, was fearful of Liu Yan's capabilities and keenly aware that many of Liu Yan's followers were angry that he was not made emperor. One, Liu Ji (劉稷), was particularly critical of Gengshi Emperor. Gengshi Emperor arrested Liu Ji and wanted to execute him, but Liu Yan tried to intercede. Gengshi Emperor took this opportunity to execute Liu Yan as well. However, ashamed of what he had done, he spared Liu Yan's brother Liu Xiu, and in fact made Liu Xiu the Marquess of Wuxin.

== Destruction of Wang Mang and subsequent movement to Chang'an ==
Gengshi Emperor then commissioned two armies, one led by Wang Kuang, targeting Luoyang, and the other led by Shentu Jian (申屠建) and Li Song (李松), targeting Chang'an directly. All the populace on the way gathered, welcomed, and joined the Han forces. Shentu and Li quickly reached the outskirts of Chang'an. In response, the young men within Chang'an also rose up and stormed Weiyang Palace, the main imperial palace. Wang died in the battle at the palace.

After Wang Mang's death, Gengshi Emperor moved his capital from Wancheng to Luoyang. He then issued edicts to the entire empire, promising to allow Xin local officials who submitted to him to keep their posts. For a brief period, nearly the entire empire showed at least nominal submission—even including the powerful [[Chimei]] general Fan Chong (樊崇), who, indeed, went to stay in Luoyang under promises of titles and honors. However, this policy was applied inconsistently, and local governors soon became apprehensive about giving up their power. Fan, in particular, left the capital and returned to his troops.

In 24, Gengshi Emperor moved his capital again, back to the Western Han capital of Chang'an. The people of Chang'an had previously been offended by Gengshi Emperor's officials (the former Lulin leaders), who did not appreciate their rising up against Wang Mang but in fact considered them traitors. Once Gengshi Emperor was back in the capital, he issued a general pardon, which calmed the situation for a while. At this time, Chang'an was still largely intact, except for Weiyang Palace, destroyed by fire. However, Gengshi Emperor's timidity quickly caused problems. When the imperial officials were gathered for an official meeting, Gengshi Emperor, who had never seen such solemn occasions, panicked. Later, when generals submitted reports to him, he asked questions such as, "How much did you pillage today?" This type of behavior further reduced the confidence of the people in his administration.

Eventually, Gengshi Emperor's incompetence (along with the incompetence of the officials he installed—mostly Lulin leaders) in governing even the territories around Chang'an but also elsewhere, caused the loyalty of the people in the outlying regions to peel away.  By the end of 24, Liu Xiu, who had been sent by Gengshi Emperor to pacify the region north of the [[Yellow River]], was de facto independent, while the Chimei were approaching and readying for an attack on Chang'an.

== Destruction of Gengshi Emperor's regime ==
In summer 25, Liu Xiu finally made a formal break with Gengshi Emperor, after his generals and Gengshi Emperor's generals fought over control of the [[Henei (ancient China)|Henei]] and Luoyang regions. He declared himself emperor (establishing the regime known later as the Eastern Han Dynasty), and soon his general [[Deng Yu]] (鄧禹) also captured the modern [[Shanxi]], further reducing Gengshi Emperor's strength.

Feeling trapped, a number of Gengshi Emperor's generals conspired to kidnap him and flee back to their home region of Nanyang.  These conspirators included Zhang Ang, Liao Zhan, Hu Yin (胡殷), Shentu Jian (申屠建), and the warlord Wei Xiao (隗囂).  They were discovered, and most were executed, but Zhang occupied most of Chang'an, forcing Gengshi Emperor to flee, just as Chimei forces were approaching.  Gengshi Emperor then made the further mistake of suspecting, without evidence, Wang Kuang, Chen Mu, and Cheng Dan of conspiring with Zhang; he executed Chen and Cheng by trickery, and Wang, in response, joined Zhang.

Generals still loyal to Gengshi Emperor was eventually able to evict Zhang from the capital, but by that time the situation was desperate. Zhang and his allies surrendered to Chimei and, working with them, attacked again Chang'an, which fell quickly. Gengshi Emperor fled only followed by several loyal followers.  In winter 25, he surrendered to the Chimei, and was eventually killed.  Most Lulin leaders eventually became lost in obscurity, but some who were initially friendly with Liu Xiu joined him and became officials in his government.  They were largely not given important posts, however, in his new dynasty.

'''''McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission''''', 572 U.S. 185 (2014), is a landmark [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance]] decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The decision held that Section 441 of the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] (FECA), which imposed a limit on contributions an individual can make over a two-year period to [[Political parties in the United States|national party]] and federal candidate committees, is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/McCutcheon.shtml#ac |title=McCutcheon, et al. v.

The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 8, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_calendars/MonthlyArgumentCalOct2013.pdf |title=SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OCTOBER TERM 2013 |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States]] |date=July 23, 2013 |access-date=June 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215080731/https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_calendars/MonthlyArgumentCalOct2013.pdf |archive-date=February 15, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; being brought on appeal after the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] dismissed the challenge. It was decided on April 2, 2014, by a 5–4 vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=McCutcheon v. FEC|volume=572|year=2014|docket=12-536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; reversing the decision below and remanding. Justices [[John Roberts|Roberts]], [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]], [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]], and [[Samuel Alito|Alito]] invalidated "aggregate contribution limits" (amounts one can contribute over the two-year period) as violating the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution#Campaign finance|First Amendment]]. Justice [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]] provided the necessary fifth vote, but concurred separately in the judgment while arguing that all contribution limits are unconstitutional.

== Background ==
The [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] (FECA) was first passed in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.gov/info/appfour.htm |title=The Federal Election Campaign Laws:A Short History |publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050730082922/http://www.fec.gov/info/appfour.htm |archivedate=July 30, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments to FECA in 1974, after the [[Watergate Scandal]], limited the total amount of direct contributions an individual could make to national political parties and federal candidates in a given year.&lt;ref name=mutch&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-027468-9| last = Mutch| first = Robert E.| title = Campaign Finance: What Everyone Needs to Know| date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DDC Opinion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/mccutcheon_dc_memo_opinion.pdf |title=SHAUN MCCUTCHEON, et al., Plaintiffs, FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION |author=[[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] |publisher=Federal Election Commission |date=September 28, 2012 |access-date=November 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101220642/http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/mccutcheon_dc_memo_opinion.pdf |archive-date=November 1, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These "aggregate contribution limits" were subsequently upheld in ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name=mutch /&gt; The Court's decision in ''Valeo'' recognized that independent contributions were protected speech, but also held that the aggregate contribution limits were constitutional because the government had a [[Government interest|compelling interest]] in preventing "corruption" and the "appearance of corruption".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-1-4008-2471-7| last = Smith| first = Bradley A.| title = Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform| date = 2009-02-09|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Liptak| first = Adam| title = Supreme Court Again Weighs Spending Limits in Campaigns| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-08-05| date = 2013-10-08| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/us/politics/supreme-court-weighs-campaign-contribution-limits.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (BCRA) was passed. The BCRA revised the aggregate limits, adjusted them  to future (but not past) inflation, and changed the individual limitations from annual to biennial;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/41338.pdf |title=Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002: Summary and Comparison with Previous Law |author=Joseph E.

=== U.S. District Court ===
On June 22, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a Verified Complaint before the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]], asking the court to revisit the precedent set in the Buckley case and calling the limits on contributions to federally elected candidates a "burden on [[Freedom of speech|speech]] and [[Freedom of association|association]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/mccutcheon_mccutcheon_complaint.pdf |title=Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief |author=[[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] |publisher=Federal Election Commission |date=June 22, 2012 |access-date=November 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014154004/http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/mccutcheon_mccutcheon_complaint.pdf |archive-date=October 14, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard by a three-judge court, with judges [[James E.

=== Concurrence and dissent ===
{{primary sources|section|date=April 2014}}
Justice Thomas concurred in the judgment but wished to go further and abolish all campaign contribution limits: "limiting the amount of money a person may give to a candidate ''does'' impose a direct restraint on his political communication." He rejected the rationale of ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'' that "[a] contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support" since "this Court has never required a speaker to explain the reasons for his position in order to obtain full First Amendment protection."

Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan dissented, arguing that the decision "creates a loophole that will allow a single individual to contribute millions of dollars to a political party or to a candidate’s campaign. Taken together with ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n]]'', 558 U.

In response to the decision, a coalition of environmental, voting rights, labor, and government reform groups rallied outside of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Public Interest Research Group"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Public Interest Research Group]] |url=http://www.uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/people-strike-back |title=The People Strike Back |author=Blair Bowie |accessdate=November 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030162449/http://www.uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/people-strike-back |archive-date=October 30, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentalists from [[Greenpeace]] and the [[Sierra Club]] protested what [[Phil Radford]] of [[Greenpeace]] called a "legalized system of corruption through money in politics" that had resulted in few major environmental laws passing in the U.S. since 1980.&lt;ref name="Grist.org"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]] |url=http://grist.org/politics/greens-and-voting-rights-activists-get-big-money-out-of-politics/ |title=Greens and voting rights activists: Get big money out of politics |author=Brentin Mock |accessdate=November 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023194703/http://grist.org/politics/greens-and-voting-rights-activists-get-big-money-out-of-politics/ |archive-date=October 23, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Nation]]'', Ari Berman wrote, "The Court’s conservative majority believes that the First Amendment gives wealthy donors and powerful corporations the carte blanche right to buy an election but that the Fifteenth Amendment does not give Americans the right to vote free of racial discrimination."&lt;ref name="AriBerman"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Nation]]|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/179131/supreme-courts-ideology-more-money-less-voting|title =The Supreme Court’s Ideology: More Money, Less Voting |author=Ari Berman|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countering Berman's quote, [[Robert J. Samuelson]] pointed out that "the rich" is not one single block but that it has many different factions. He added that money does not "guarantee victory. After a certain point, more money hits the law of diminishing returns. It can be and is misspent."&lt;ref name="Samuelson20140406"&gt;{{cite web|last=Samuelson|first=Robert|title=In politics, money is speech|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-j-samuelson-in-politics-money-is-speech/2014/04/04/075df4ec-bc18-11e3-9a05-c739f29ccb08_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=8 April 2014|date=6 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408043804/http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-j-samuelson-in-politics-money-is-speech/2014/04/04/075df4ec-bc18-11e3-9a05-c739f29ccb08_story.html|archive-date=April 8, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuelson also said that there are poor politicians who cannot communicate and so need money "to hire campaign staff, build a website, buy political spots and the like" to "affect how people behave."&lt;ref name="Samuelson20140406" /&gt;

The Center for Competitive Politics, a leading group advocating for deregulation of campaign finance, heralded the decision in a statement: "the Court’s conclusion was common sense: the law limited an individual to contributing the legal maximum to just 18 candidates. If the first 18 aren't 'corrupted' by the contribution, why is candidate 19? What's remarkable is that four justices of the Supreme Court continue to believe that such overt limitations on political speech are constitutional. Moreover, to reach that conclusion the dissenters relied on a series of preposterous hypotheticals bearing no resemblance to reality."&lt;ref name="Center for Competitive Politics"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Center for Competitive Politics]] |url=http://www.campaignfreedom.org/2014/04/02/center-heralds-win-in-mccutcheon-v-federal-election-commission/ |title=Center Heralds Win in McCutcheon v.

In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Jeffrey Toobin]] wrote that "the language of Chief Justice John Roberts's opinion suggests that the Court remains committed to the project announced most prominently in the Citizens United case, four years ago: the deregulation of American political campaigns."&lt;ref name="Toobin"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2014/04/the-john-roberts-project-beyond-mccutcheon.html?currentPage=all|title=The John Roberts Project|author=Jeffrey Toobin|accessdate=April 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407074707/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2014/04/the-john-roberts-project-beyond-mccutcheon.html?currentPage=all|archive-date=April 7, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 30 hours after the ''McCutcheon'' case came down, Professors [[Ronald K. L. Collins]] and [[David Skover]] published an 80,000-word narrative account of the history of the case, which included an analysis of the Court's opinion. The e-book is titled ''When Money Speaks: The McCutcheon Decision, Campaign Finance Laws &amp; the First Amendment'' (Top Five Books, 2014).

Following the decision, [[SCOTUSblog]] published a [http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/04/foreword-its-all-forward-now/ symposium] on the case with a foreword by Collins and Skover as well as commentaries by Floyd Abrams, Jan Baran, Rick Hasen, Burt Neuborne, Ilya Shapiro, Paul M. Smith, and Fred Wertheimer (April 3–4, 2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17307">'''Multimethodology''' or '''multimethod research''' includes the use of more than one method of data collection or research in a research study or set of related studies. '''Mixed methods research''' is more specific in that it includes the mixing of qualitative and quantitative data, methods, methodologies, and/or paradigms in a research study or set of related studies. One could argue that mixed methods research is a special case of multimethod research. Another applicable, but less often used label, for multi or mixed research is '''methodological pluralism'''. All of these approaches to professional and academic [[research]] emphasize that monomethod research can be improved through the use of multiple data, methods, Research,methodologies, perspectives, standpoints, and [[paradigm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.

The term 'multimethodology' was used starting in the 1980s and in the 1989 book Multimethod Research: A Synthesis of Styles by John Brewer and Albert Hunter (Sage Publications). During the 1990s and currently, the term 'mixed methods research' has become more popular for this research movement in the behavioral, social, business, and health sciences. This pluralistic research approach has been gaining in popularity since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="oal"&gt;Onwuegbuzie, Anthony and Leech, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multi and mixed methods research==
There are three broad classes of [[research]] studies that are currently being labeled “mixed methods research” (Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Turner, 2007)
# ''Quantitatively driven approaches/designs'' in which the research study is, at its core, a quantitative study with qualitative data/method added to supplement and improve the quantitative study by providing an added value and deeper, wider, and fuller or more complex answers to research questions; quantitative quality criteria are emphasized but high quality qualitative data also must be collected and analyzed;
# ''Qualitatively driven approaches/designs'' in which the research study is, at its core, a qualitative study with quantitative data/method added to supplement and improve the qualitative study by providing an added value and deeper, wider, and fuller or more complex answers to research questions; qualitative quality criteria are emphasized but high quality quantitative data also must be collected and analyzed (Hesse-Biber, 2010);
# ''Interactive or equal status designs'' in which the research study equally emphasizes (interactively and through integration) quantitative and qualitative data, methods, methodologies, and paradigms. This third design is often done through the use of a team composed of an expert in quantitative research, an expert in qualitative research, and an expert in mixed methods research to help with dialogue and continual integration. In this type of mixed study, quantitative and qualitative and mixed methods quality criteria are emphasized. This use of multiple quality criteria is seen in the concept of ''multiple validities legitimation'' (Johnson &amp; Christensen, 2014; Onwuegbuzie &amp; Johnson, 2006). Here is a definition of this important type of validity or legitimation: Multiple validities legitimation "refers to the extent to which the mixed methods researcher successfully addresses and resolves all relevant validity types, including the quantitative and qualitative validity types discussed earlier in this chapter as well as the mixed validity dimensions. In other words, the researcher must identify and address all of the relevant validity issues facing a particular research study. Successfully addressing the pertinent validity issues will help researchers produce the kinds of inferences and meta-inferences that should be made in mixed research"(Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2014; page 311).
# ''Mixed priority designs'' in which the principal study results derive from the integration of qualitative and quantitative data during analysis (Creamer, 2017). 

One major similarity between mixed methodologies and qualitative and quantitative taken separately is that researchers need to maintain focus on the original purpose behind their methodological choices. A major difference between the two however, is the way some authors differentiate the two, proposing that there is logic inherent in one that is different from the other. Creswell (2009) points out that in a quantitative study the researcher starts with a problem statement, moving on to the hypothesis and null hypothesis, through the instrumentation into a discussion of data collection, population, and data analysis. Creswell proposes that for a qualitative study the flow of logic begins with the purpose for the study, moves through the research questions discussed as data collected from a smaller group and then voices how they will be analysed.

A research ''strategy'' is a procedure for achieving a particular intermediary research objective — such as sampling, data collection, or data analysis. We may therefore speak of sampling strategies or data analysis strategies. The use of multiple strategies to enhance construct validity (a form of methodological [[Triangulation (social science)|triangulation]]) is now routinely advocated by  methodologists. In short, mixing or integrating research strategies (qualitative and/or quantitative) in any and all research undertaking is now considered a common feature of good research.

A research ''approach'' refers to an integrated set of research principles and general procedural guidelines. Approaches are broad, holistic (but general) methodological guides or roadmaps that are associated with particular research motives or analytic interests. Two examples of analytic interests are population frequency distributions and prediction. Examples of research approaches include experiments, surveys, correlational studies, ethnographic research, and phenomenological inquiry. Each approach is ideally suited to addressing a particular analytic interest. For instance, experiments are ideally suited to addressing [[nomothetic]] explanations or probable cause; surveys — population frequency descriptions, correlations studies — predictions; ethnography — descriptions and interpretations of cultural processes; and phenomenology — descriptions of the essence of phenomena or lived experiences.

In a ''single approach design'' (''SAD'')(also called a "monomethod design") only one analytic interest is pursued. In a ''mixed or multiple approach design (MAD)'' two or more analytic interests are pursued. NOTE: a multiple approach design may include entirely “quantitative” approaches such as combining a survey and an experiment; or entirely “qualitative” approaches such as combining an ethnographic and a phenomenological inquiry, and a mixed approach design includes a mixture of the above (e.g., a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data, methods, methodologies, and/or paradigms).

A word of caution about the term “multimethodology”. It has become quite common place to use the terms "method" and "methodology" as synonyms (as is the case with the above entry). However, there are convincing philosophical reasons for distinguishing the two. "Method" connotes a way of doing something — a procedure (such as a method of data collection). "Methodology" connotes a discourse about methods — i.e., a discourse about the adequacy and appropriateness of particular combination of research principles and procedures. The terms methodology and biology share a common suffix "''logy''." Just as bio-''logy'' is a discourse about life — all kinds of life; so too, methodo-''logy'' is a discourse about methods — all kinds of methods. It seems unproductive, therefore, to speak of multi-biologies or of multi-methodologies. It is very productive, however, to speak of multiple biological perspectives or of multiple methodological perspectives.

==Desirability==
The case for multimethodology or mixed methods research as a strategy for intervention and/or research is based on four observations:
# Narrow views of the world are often misleading, so approaching a subject from different perspectives or [[paradigm]]s may help to gain a holistic or more truthful worldview.
# There are different levels of social research (i.e.: biological, cognitive, social, etc.), and different methodologies may have particular strengths with respect to one of these levels. Using more than one should help to get a clearer picture of the social world and make for more adequate explanations.
# Many existing practices already combine methodologies to solve particular problems, yet they have not been theorised sufficiently.
# Multimethodology fits well with [[pragmatism]].

==Feasibility==
There are also some hazards to multimethodological or mixed methods research approaches. Some of these problems include:
# Many paradigms are at odds with each other. However, once the understanding of the difference is present, it can be an advantage to see many sides, and possible solutions may present themselves.
# Multimethod and mixed method research can be undertaken from many paradigmatic perspectives, including pragmatism, dialectial pluralism, critical realism, and constructivism. 
# Cultural issues affect world views and analyzability. Knowledge of a new paradigm is not enough to overcome potential biases; it must be learned through practice and experience.
# People have cognitive abilities that predispose them to particular paradigms. The logical thinker can more easily understand and use quantitative methodologies. It is easier to move from quantitative to qualitative, and not the reverse.

==Software==
A few [[Computer assisted qualitative data analysis software|qualitative research analysis software applications]] support some degree of quantitative integration, and the following software or web applications focus on mixed methods research:

==Conclusion==
Multimethodology and mixed methods research are desirable and feasible because they provide a more complete view, and because the requirement during the different phases of an intervention (or research project) make very specific demands on a general methodology. While it is demanding, it is more effective to choose the right tool for the job at hand.

It can be used when you want to build from one phase of research to another. You may first want to explore the data qualitatively to identify help in the development an instrument or to identify concepts/variables to test in a later quantitative study or phase of a single study. You engage in a mixed methods study when you want to construct a quantitatively-driven design, a qualitatively-driven design, or an interactive/equal-status design. Each of these come with advantages and disadvantages. For more information on designing multiple and mixed methods research studies see the following design typologies and other (anti-typology): Brewer &amp; Hunter (2006); Creamer (2017); Creswell &amp; Plano Clark (2011); Greene (2007); Guest (2013); Johnson &amp; Christensen (2014); Morgan (2014); Morse &amp; Niehaus (2009); Muskat et al. (2012); and Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori (2009).

==Criticisms==
Multimethodology is criticized by the adherents of [[incompatibility thesis]] - particularly [[post-structuralist]] and [[post-modernists]]. Its critics argue that mixed methods research is inherently wrong because quantitative and qualitative approach represent different and inherently incompatible research paradigms.

The '''National Farmers Union of (NFU)''' is an organization set up by Canadian farmers. It is headquartered in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada. It is descended from the [[United Farmers of Canada]] which was a loose federation of militant farmers' organizations. It was created as the Interprovincial Farm Union Council (IFUC) in 1945 to co-ordinate activities between provincial bodies, particularly the [[Alberta Farmers Union]] and the United Farmers of Canada (Saskatchewan Section) who were planning a farmers' strike if grievances on farm prices and marketing problems were not solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/farm_movement_1901-49.html |title=Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan |accessdate=9 December 2014 |chapter=Farm Movemement 1901-49 |author=Stuart A.

'''Operation Legacy''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Colonial Office]] (later [[Foreign Office]]) program to destroy or hide files, to prevent them being inherited by its ex-colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/11/british-empire-kenya-oman-ireland-state-secrecy/|title=Erasing Empire - Jacobin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=yauZDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131&amp;lpg=PT131&amp;dq=operation%20legacy%20%20empire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0U62BcKtrP&amp;sig=ayvQMyZE9ZSz3rbnVyupUZ-xp0I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs4YuB76PQAhVLK8AKHXxpAXAQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=operation%20legacy%20%20empire&amp;f=false|title=The History Thieves: Secrets, Lies and the Shaping of a Modern Nation|first=Ian|last=Cobain|date=1 September 2016|publisher=Granta Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran from the 1950s until the 1970s, when the [[decolonisation]] of the [[British Empire]] was at its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/operation-legacy-britain-destroyed-thousands-colonial-files.html|title=Operation Legacy: How Britain Destroyed Thousands Of Colonial Files|date=9 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As decolonisation progressed, British officials were keen to avoid a repeat of the embarrassment that had been caused by the overt burning of documents that took place in Delhi in 1947, which had been covered by local Indian news sources.  On May 3, 1961, Iain Macleod from the UK Colonial Office, wrote a telegram to all British embassies to advise them on the best way to retrieve and dispose of sensitive documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/operation-legacy-britain-destroyed-thousands-colonial-files.html|title=Operation Legacy: How Britain Destroyed Thousands Of Colonial Files|last=Winston|first=George|date=2014-01-09|work=WAR HISTORY ONLINE|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All secret documents in the colonial administrations were vetted by [[MI5]] or [[Special Branch]] agents to ensure those that might embarrass the British government or show racial or religious bias, were destroyed or sent to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/revealed-how-british-empire-s-dirty-secrets-went-up-in-smoke-in-the-colonies-8971217.html|title=Revealed: How British Empire’s dirty secrets went up in smoke in the|date=29 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precise instructions were given for methods to be used for destruction, including burning and dumping at sea.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk" /&gt; Some of the files detailed torture methods used against opponents of the colonial administrations, ''e.g.'', during the [[Mau Mau Uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-records-colonial-crimes|title=Britain destroyed records of colonial crimes|first1=Ian|last1=Cobain|first2=Owen|last2=Bowcott|first3=Richard|last3=Norton-Taylor|date=17 April 2012|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic study of the end of the British Empire has been assisted in recent years by the declassification of the ''migrated archives'' in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) 141 series. After the UK government admitted in 2011 that it had secret documents related to the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau]] case, it began to declassify documents and by November 2013 some 20,000 files had been declassified. These documents can now be accessed at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] in Kew, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sato|first=Shohei|date=2017-04-11|title=‘Operation Legacy’: Britain’s Destruction and Concealment of Colonial Records Worldwide|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03086534.2017.1294256|journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/03086534.2017.1294256|issn=0308-6534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Monarchism|Concepts}}

'''Primogeniture''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|p|r|aɪ|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ᵻ|tʃ|ər}}) is the right, by law or custom, of the paternally acknowledged, [[wikt:firstborn|firstborn]] son to [[inheritance|inherit]] his parent's entire or main [[estate (law)|estate]], in preference to daughters, elder illegitimate sons, [[cadet branch|younger sons]] and collateral relatives; in some cases the estate may instead be the inheritance of [[#Absolute primogeniture|the firstborn child]] or occasionally [[#Matrilineal primogeniture|the firstborn daughter]]. The descendant (often the son) of a deceased elder sibling (typically elder brother) inherits before a living younger sibling by right of substitution for the deceased heir. In the absence of any children, brothers succeed, individually, to the inheritance by seniority of age (subject to substitution). Among siblings, sons usually inherit before daughters. In the absence of male descendants in the male-line, there are variations of primogeniture which allocate the inheritance to a daughter or a brother or, in the absence of either, to another collateral relative, in a specified order (e.g. male-preference primogeniture, Salic primogeniture, semi-Salic primogeniture).

The principle has applied in history to inheritance of real property (land) as well as inherited titles and offices, most notably monarchies, continuing until modified or abolished.

Variations on primogeniture modify the right of the first-born son to the entirety of a family's inheritance (see [[appanage]]) or, in the West since World War II, eliminate the preference for males over females (absolute primogeniture). Most [[monarchies in Europe|monarchies in Western Europe]] have eliminated male preference in succession: [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Monarchy of Norway|Norway]], [[Monarchy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].

Some monarchies have succession rules contrasting greatly with primogeniture. Currently, [[succession to the Saudi Arabian throne]] uses a form of lateral [[agnatic seniority]], as did the [[Kievan Rus']] (see [[Rota system]]), the early [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (see [[Tanistry]]), the [[Mongol Empire]] (see [[Order of succession#Lateral succession|lateral succession]]) or the later [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Line of succession to the former Ottoman throne#Succession practices|succession practices]]).

===Absolute primogeniture===
&lt;!-- This section is forward referenced and linked from [[Westeros]] and [[Hundred Years' War]]--&gt;
''Absolute'', ''equal'', or ''lineal primogeniture'' is a form of primogeniture in which sex is irrelevant for inheritance. No modern monarchy before 1980 practiced this form of primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Poumarede (1972), the [[Basque people|Basques]] of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] transmitted title and property to the firstborn regardless of sex.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W4H-4H5DYN9-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1113676711&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=4ae9185f30a93cc3f5c45dbfcec3b167 |title=Succession strategies in the Pyrenees in the 19th century: The Basque case |doi=10.1016/j.hisfam.2005.03.002 |volume=10 |journal=The History of the Family |pages=271–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher [[nobility]] and free families of the [[early middle ages|early]] and [[high middle ages]] followed this custom.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt; The Navarrese monarchy, however, was inherited by dynasties from outside of [[Navarre]], which followed different successional laws, usually male preference primogeniture. Eventually only the Basque lower nobility and free families of the Basque country and other regions continued to follow this custom, which persisted as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt;

An ancient and alternative way in which women succeeded to power, especially without displacing the direct male line descendants of the first monarchs, is the historical consortium or [[coregency]] between husband, and wife or other relatives. The most notable of these are the Egyptian cases of [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Thutmose III]], and the monarchs of the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]].

In 1980, [[Sweden]] amended its [[constitution]] to adopt royal succession by absolute primogeniture, displacing King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]]'s infant son, [[Prince Carl Philip]], in favor of his elder daughter, [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria]], in the process. Several monarchies have since followed suit: the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, [[Luxembourg]] in 2011, and the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realms]] in 2015.

[[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] also deviated from traditional primogeniture in the late 20th or early 21st century by restricting succession to the crown to relatives within a specified degree of [[kinship]] to the most recent monarch.

Recently, other monarchies have changed or considered changing to absolute primogeniture:

* With the birth of [[Infanta Leonor of Spain]] on 31 October 2005 to the then heir apparent [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe, Prince of Asturias]] and [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Princess Letizia]], the Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] reaffirmed the intention of the government to institute, by amendment of the Spanish constitution, absolute primogeniture. Zapatero's proposal was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative ''[[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]]'', making its passage probable. However, Zapatero's administration ended before an amendment was drafted, and the succeeding government has not pursued it. The Prince counseled reformers that there was plenty of time before any constitutional amendment would need to be enacted because the expectation was to leave him next in line to succeed his father despite his elder sisters' continued status as [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]]; equal primogeniture was expected to apply first to his children. Felipe succeeded to the throne as Felipe VI upon his father's abdication in 2014, by which time he had two daughters. Felipe VI has no son that would, absent the constitutional amendment, displace Leonor as heir apparent.
* In July 2006, the [[Nepal]]ese government proposed adopting absolute primogeniture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newkerala.com/news3.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=31256 |title=New Kerala}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the monarchy was abolished in 2008 before the change could be effected.
* In 2011, the governments of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s which have a common monarch announced the [[Perth Agreement]], a plan to legislate changes to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |title=Royal equality act will end succession of firstborn male –  rather than older sister |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/28/commonwealth-royalty-succession-change}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was implemented when the necessary legislation came into effect on 26 March 2015.
* In [[Japan]], it has been debated whether or not to adopt absolute primogeniture, as [[Princess Aiko]] is the only child of [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]]. However, the birth in 2006 of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]], a son of [[Prince Akishino]] (the younger brother of Crown Prince Naruhito, and next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne following Naruhito) has suspended the debate.

===Agnatic primogeniture===
Under agnatic primogeniture, or patrilineal primogeniture, the degree of kinship (of males and females) is determined by tracing shared descent from the nearest common ancestor through male ancestors.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Murphy |first=Michael Dean |title=A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm |accessdate=5 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who share agnatic kinship are termed "agnates"; those who share descent from a common ancestor through males and females or through females only are "cognates".

There were different types of succession based on agnatic primogeniture, all sharing the principle that inheritance is according to seniority of birth among siblings (compare to [[ultimogeniture]]) and seniority of lineage among the agnatic kin, firstly, among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male-line issue inheriting before brothers and their issue. Females and female-line descendants are excluded from succession.

===Male-preference primogeniture===
Male-preference primogeniture accords succession to the throne to a female member of a [[dynasty]] if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. A [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]]'s sons and their lines of descent all come before that dynast's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.

It was practiced in the succession to the once-separate thrones of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] (until their union under [[James VI and I]]) and then the [[United Kingdom]] until 2015, when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] changed it to absolute primogeniture. The rule change also applies to all [[Commonwealth realm]]s that have the British monarch as their head of state.

Male-preference primogeniture is currently practiced in succession to the thrones of [[Monaco]]{{since when?|date=November 2018}} and [[Spain]] (before 1700 and since [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|1830]]).

With respect to [[hereditary title]]s, it is usually the rule for Scotland and [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|baronies by writ]] in the United Kingdom, but baronies by writ go into [[abeyance]] when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder.

==Salic law==
An [[agnatic seniority]] primogeniture system that excludes any female from inheritance of a monarch's principal possessions is generally known in western Europe as an application of the "[[Salic law]]" (see ''[[Terra salica]]''). This rule of succession developed in the course of a series of successions in France in the later Middle Ages. In 1316, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]], the only surviving child of [[Louis X of France]] was debarred from the throne in favor of her uncle, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]]. After this it was declared that women could not inherit the French throne. Then in 1328, after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]] (Charles IV's paternal cousin) became king, notwithstanding the claims of [[Edward III of England]]. By [[proximity of blood]], Edward was the closest relative to the dead king, as he was the son of the king's sister [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris resolved that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded.  This ruling became a key point of contention in the subsequent [[Hundred Years War]]. Over the following century, French jurists adopted a clause from the 6th century ''[[Salic law|Pactus Legis Salicae]]'', which asserted that no female or her descendants could inherit the French throne, as a governing rule for the French succession.

By the start of the 19th century, the royal houses of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] ([[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Bourbon Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Sicily]] and [[Bourbon-Parma|Parma]]) and [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] ([[Kingdom of Sardinia]]), had adopted this system of exclusively male hereditary succession. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s conquests subsequently nudged the adoption of the law in [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]] ([[House of Bernadotte|beginning in 1810]]) and in princely states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. Other states adopted strict agnatic primogeniture as well, including [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] ([[Frederick VII of Denmark#Succession crisis|beginning in 1853]]) and the new kingdoms of [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)|Albania]], [[Kingdom of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. During this era, Spain (in the [[Carlist Wars|Carlist conflicts]]) fought a [[civil war]] which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of the ruling dynasty against one another for possession of the crown.

A variation of Salic primogeniture allowed the sons of women to inherit, but not women themselves, an example being the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] succession to the throne of Spain that was applied in 1947&amp;ndash;1978.

Most British and French titles of nobility descend to the senior male by primogeniture, to the exclusion of females, and agnatic [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] may bear [[courtesy titles|courtesy]] or [[subsidiary title|subsidiary]] titles.  Notable exceptions in England include the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], which is merged with the [[British Crown]] (which has included women in inheritance since the 16th century), and the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukedom of Marlborough]], which has included women in inheritance since its establishment in 1702.

==Semi-Salic law==
{{for|a clearer explanation of the differences between Salic, Semi-Salic laws and male-preference primogeniture|Salic law}}

Another variation on agnatic primogeniture is the so-called semi-Salic law, or "agnatic-cognatic primogeniture", which allows women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line.&lt;ref&gt;Nordisk familjebok, ''Tronföljd'', 1920; SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd''.&lt;/ref&gt; Such were the cases of [[Bourbon Spain]] until 1833 and the dominions of [[Austria-Hungary]], as well as most realms within the former [[Holy Roman Empire]], i.e. most German monarchies. This was also the law of [[Russia]] under the [[Pauline Laws]] of 1797 and of [[Luxembourg]] until equal primogeniture was introduced on 20 June 2011.

There are various versions of semi-Salic law also, although in all forms women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female agnate of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture. Among sisters (and the lines of descendants issuing from them), the elder are preferred to the younger. In reckoning [[consanguinity]] or [[proximity of blood]] the dynasty's [[house law]] defines who among female relatives is "nearest" to the last male.

===Uterine primogeniture===
Under ''uterine primogeniture'', succession to the throne or other property is passed to the male most closely related to the previous titleholder through female kinship.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; A male may also inherit a right of succession through a female ancestor or spouse, to the exclusion of any female relative who might be older or of nearer proximity of blood (see above for Spain's mid-twentieth century dynastic succession law). In such cases, inheritance depends on uterine kinship,&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; so a king would typically be succeeded by his sister's son. This particular system of inheritance applied to the thrones of the [[Picts]] of Northern Britain and the [[Etruscans]] of Italy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Some kingdoms and ethnic groups in [[Africa]] follow the same practice. This usage may stem in part from the certainty of the relationship to the previous king and kings: sons and daughters of a sister are his relations ([[mater semper certa est]]), even if they do not have the same father.

====Matrilineal primogeniture====
''Matrilineal primogeniture'', or ''female-preference uterine primogeniture'', is a form of succession practised in some societies in which the eldest female child inherits the throne, to the total exclusion of males. The order of succession to the position of the [[Rain Queen]] is an example in an [[Africa]]n culture of [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] primogeniture: not only is [[dynasty|dynastic]] descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.

==History==
In Christian Europe, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] originally had a monopoly on the authority to sanction marriage. It forbade polygamy and taught that divorce was an impossibility ''per se'', as it still does. Consequently, in Europe, it was very difficult to ensure succession solely by direct male descendants or even direct male or female progeny. In [[Islam]]ic and Asian cultures, religious officials and customs either sanctioned [[polygyny]], use of consorts, or both, or they had no authority of marriage; monarchs could consequently ensure sufficient numbers of male offspring to assure succession. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare.

[[File:Figures Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving|''Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils'', a 1728 engraving by [[Gerard Hoet]].]]
The earliest account of primogeniture to be known widely in modern times is that of [[Isaac]]'s sons [[Esau]], who was born first,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacob]], who was born second.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esau was entitled to the "birthright" (''bekhorah'' בְּכוֹרָה), but he sold the right to Jacob for a [[mess of pottage]], i. e. a small amount of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the veracity of this account is not corroborated by other sources, its widespread acceptance {{by whom|date=July 2017}} demonstrates that primogeniture was sufficiently common in the [[Middle East]] for the account to seem plausible to the people living there prior to the [[Roman Empire]].

===Roman law===
During the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman law]] governed much of Europe, and the laws pertaining to inheritance made no distinction between the oldest or youngest, male or female, if the decedent died [[Intestacy|intestate]].&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam, (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2006, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Although admission to the two highest ''[[Roman Empire#ordines|ordines]]'' (orders), i. e. the [[Roman Senate|senators]] and [[equestrian order|equestrians]], potentially brought lifelong privileges that the next generation could inherit, the principle of inherited rank in general was little used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Millar |first1=Fergus |authorlink=Fergus Millar |year=1983 |title=Empire and City, Augustus to Julian: Obligations, Excuses and Status |url= |journal=[[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=73 |issue= |pages=87–88 |doi=10.2307/300073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and a Roman family could not maintain its position in the ''ordines'' merely by hereditary succession or title to land.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Keith (2000). "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," in ''The Dynamics of Ancient Empires: State Power from Assyria to Byzantium'' ([[Oxford University Press]]), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the eldest son typically carried [[Roman naming conventions|his father's name]] in some form, he was expected to construct his own [[cursus honorum|career]] based on competence as an [[legatus|administrator or general]] and on remaining in favor with the emperor and his council at court.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,'' p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than meeting requirements for personal wealth, the qualifications for belonging to the senatorial or equestrian orders varied from generation to generation, and in the later Empire, the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' ("esteem") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with additional titles, such as ''[[vir illustris]],'' that were not inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Millar. "Empire and City". p. 90, calls them "status-appellations".&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Roman emperor]]s indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] heir, and the presumption that the eldest or even a natural son would inherit was not enshrined. The death of an emperor led to a critical period of uncertainty and crisis. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or the [[Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Winterling, Aloys. ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome''. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, originally published 1988 in German). p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, neither an emperor nor his heir had an inherent "right" to rule, and did so through military power and the Senate's symbolic consent.

===Reemergence in medieval and modern times===
The law of primogeniture in Europe has its origins in [[Medieval Europe]]; which due to the [[feudal system]] necessitated that the [[Fiefdom|estates]] of land-owning feudal lords be kept as large and united as possible to maintain social stability as well as the wealth, power and social standing of their families.&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu" /&gt;

[[Adam Smith]], in his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', explains the origin of primogeniture in Europe in the following way:

{{quote|[W]hen land was considered as the means, not of subsistence merely, but of power and protection, it was thought better that it should descend undivided to one. In those disorderly times, every great landlord was a sort of petty prince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge, and in some respects their legislator in peace and their leader in war. He made war according to his own discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed estate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it, depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not immediately indeed, but in process of time, in the succession of landed estates, for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that of monarchies, though not always at their first institution.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Historical examples===
A case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the [[France|French]] royal ''milieu'', where the [[Salic Law]] (attributed to the [[Salian Franks]]) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line. This rule was adopted to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1316|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of [[John I of France]], the short-lived son of deceased [[Louis X of France]] in favour of [[Philip V of France]] (brother of Louis and uncle of John) over [[Joan II of Navarre]] (daughter of Louis and sister of John), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Estates-General of 1317|fr|3=États généraux de 1317}} ruling that "''Women do not succeed the kingdom of France''". In 1328, it was further elaborated, with the statement that "''Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess''", to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1328|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of Philip V's brother [[Charles IV of France]] ([[Edward III of England]] or [[Philip VI of France]]), though the former would have a stronger claim should [[proximity of blood]] be considered, which had never been the case in France since 987, instead as well of both agnatic-cognatic primogeniture or male-preference cognatic primogeniture and the resulting heirs. This dispute was among the factors behind the [[Hundred Years' War]], which broke out in 1337.

Conflict between the Salic law and the male-preferred system was also the genesis of [[Carlism]] in [[Spain]].

The crowns of [[Hanover]] and [[Great Britain]], which had been in [[personal union]] since 1714, were separated in 1837 upon the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]: his niece [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] inherited the British crown under male-preference primogeniture but, because of semi-Salic law, was not the heir to that of Hanover, which passed to William's eldest surviving brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]].

The divergence in the late 19th century of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both ruled by semi-Salic law, resulted from the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than did the Dutch line. The Luxembourg succession was set by the [[Nassau Family Pact|Nassau House Treaty of 1783]], which declared each prince of the [[House of Nassau]] to be a potential heir to the territories of every branch of the dynasty. Insofar as the succession is concerned, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-)[[Nassau-Dietz]], which was given in exchange to [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange]] in 1813. Succession to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was recognised by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as belonging exclusively to the descendants of Prince William VI, who became [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I of the Netherlands]]. In 1890, William I's agnatic line of male descendants died out, leaving the Netherlands to his female descendant [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], whereas Luxembourg still had an agnatic heir from a distant branch of the dynasty left to succeed; ex-[[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Duke Adolf of Nassau]], who became reigning Grand Duke, thus ending the [[personal union]] of the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Since the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived.

Common in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on a form of primogeniture: A [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, assuming his wife's title (''[[jure uxoris]]'').

In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood]] and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture.
* The [[Philip I of Burgundy|Burgundian succession]] in 1361 was resolved in favor of [[John II of France|King John II]], son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of the elder daughter and son of [[Joan II of Navarre|Jeanne]]. John was only one generation of consanguinity removed from the late duke instead of two for Charles.
* In dispute over the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Scottish succession]], 1290–92, the [[Bruce]] family pleaded [[tanistry]] and [[proximity of blood]], whereas [[John of Scotland|Balliol]] argued his claim based on primogeniture. The arbiter, [[Edward I of England]], decided in favor of primogeniture. But later, the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Independence Wars]] reverted the situation in favor of the Bruce, due to political exigency.
* The [[Earl of Gloucester|Earldom of Gloucester]] (in the beginning of 14th century) went to full sisters of the dead earl, not to his half-sisters, though they were elder, having been born of the father's first marriage, while the earl himself was from second marriage. Full siblings were considered higher in proximity than half-siblings.

However, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries.

Later, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, ''agnatic primogeniture'' (practically the same as [[Salic Law]]) became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.

Some countries, however, accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter. For example, in 1632 [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]] succeeded to the throne after the death of her father, King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]].

In England, primogeniture was mandatory for inheritance of land. Until the [[Statute of Wills]] was passed in 1540, a will could control only the inheritance of personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant  [[by operation of law]]. The statute added a provision that a landowner could "devise" land by the use of a new device called a "testament". The rule of primogeniture in England was not changed until the [[Administration of Estates Act]] in 1925.
In law, primogeniture is the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son. Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see [[knight]]). The effect of this rule was to keep the father's land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England, consequently, there was enacted the Statute of Wills (1540), which permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, still customary in England.

====United States and Canada====
In the United States, the colonies followed English primogeniture laws. Carole Shammas argues that issues of primogeniture, dower, curtesy, strict family settlements in equity, collateral kin, and unilateral division of real and personal property were fully developed in the colonial courts. The Americans differed little from English policies regarding the status of widow, widower, and lineal descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shammas |first1=Carole |year=1987 |title=English inheritance law and its transfer to the colonies |url= |journal=American Journal of Legal History |volume=31 |issue= |page=145 |doi=10.2307/845880}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primogeniture laws were repealed at the time of the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson took the lead in repealing the law in Virginia, where  nearly three-fourths of Tidewater land and perhaps a majority of western lands were entailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=Holly |year=1997 |title=Entailing Aristocracy in Colonial Virginia:" Ancient Feudal Restraints" and Revolutionary Reform |journal=William and Mary Quarterly |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=307–346 |jstor=2953276}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Canada had the same law but repealed it in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Hallowell, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Canadian History'' (2004), p 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] met at Placentia Bay in August 1941, FDR said he couldn’t understand the British aristocracy’s concept of primogeniture, and he intended to divide his estate equally between his five children; Churchill explained that an equal distribution was nicknamed the “Spanish Curse” by the British upper classes: ''“We give everything to the eldest and the others strive to duplicate it and found empires. While the oldest, having it all, marries for beauty. Which accounts, Mr President, for my good looks”''. But as Churchill’s father was a younger son, there may have been more modesty than mock-vanity than FDR realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roberts | first = Andrew  | authorlink = Andrew Roberts (historian) | title = Masters and Commanders: The Military Geniuses who Led the West to Victory in World War II | publisher = Penguin | date = 2009 | location = London | page = 53 | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-141-02926-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noble titles==
===Spain===
In 2006, King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] decreed a reform of the succession to noble titles from male-preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref name="Spanish Nobility and Grandee Titles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |title=Nobility and Grandee Titles |work=Spanish Ministry of Justice |accessdate=May 31, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803062402/http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |archivedate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the Spanish Ministry of Justice, the default custom of succession is absolute primogeniture, but the titleholder may designate his or her successor or distribute titles among children, provided that the eldest inherits the highest title unless he waives that right.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote
 | The order of succession for all noble dignities is determined in accordance with the title of concession and, if there is none, with that traditionally applied in these cases. When the order of succession to the title is not specified in the nobility title creation charter, the following rules apply:
* Absolute preference is given to the direct descending line over the collateral and ascending line, and, within the same line, the closest degree takes precedence over the more remote and, within the same degree, the elder over the younger, combined with the principles of firstborn and representation.
* Men and women have an equal right of succession to [[grandee]]ship and to titles of nobility in [[Spain]], and no person may be given preference in the normal order of succession for reasons of gender.
}}

===United Kingdom===
Since 2013, there has been a revived movement to reform hereditary peerage inheritance law for equal primogeniture. The [[Equality (Titles) Bill]] and its successive legislation have been referred to as the "Downton law" in reference to the British television drama ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' where the Earl's eldest daughter is unable to inherit the family seat because it is [[Fee tail|entailed]] and can be passed only to a male heir.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Georgia|title=Ladies who could soon be a leaping|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10540898/Ladies-who-could-soon-be-a-leaping.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prison Reform Trust''' (PRT) was founded in 1981 in [[London]], [[England]] by a small group of [[prison reform]] campaigners who were unhappy with the direction in which the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]] was heading, concentrating more on community punishments than on traditional [[prison reform]] issues. Founding members included Sir [[Monty Finniston]] and [[Veronica Linklater]].

PRT offers advice and information to thousands of people every year: [[prison]]ers, their families, [[prison]] and [[probation]] staff, the [[legal profession]], students, academics and interested members of the public. PRT organise an annual lecture (delivered by [[Charles Clarke]] MP, Home Secretary, in 2005), and a range of conferences and seminars which attract high-profile speakers and large audiences.

The Prison Reform Trust carries out research on all aspects of prison. Recent studies include: prisoners' views on prison education, the mental health needs of women prisoners, older prisoners, prisoner councils, foreign national prisoners, prisoner votes, and a report into how sentencers make the decision to imprison offenders.

[[Stephen Shaw (ombudsman)|Stephen Shaw]] was Director of PRT from 1981 to 1999, when he became the [[Prisons and Probation Ombudsman]] for [[England]] and [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian 9 July 2003"&gt;{{cite news |last= Travis |first= Alan |title= A look inside  |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/09/guardiansocietysupplement.prisons | date= 9 July 2003|newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate= 6 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as Director by [[Juliet Lyon]].

Sir [[Monty Finniston]] was succeeded as Chair by the former Cabinet Minister, [[Edmund Dell]], broadcaster and journalist, [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]]. Lord [[Douglas Hurd]], the former [[Home Secretary]] and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], succeeded Jon Snow as PRT's fourth chair in November 1997. [[Robert Fellowes, Baron Fellowes|Robert Fellowes]], a [[crossbench]] [[peerage of the United Kingdom|peer]], who has served as Private Secretary to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], and holds a senior position at [[Barclays plc]] succeeded Douglas Hurd in September 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3290">''Scintilla'' was a communist circle created in Rome in 1940, as one of a number of attempts to refound the [[Communist Party of Italy]] (PCd'I) banned since 1926. Most of its leaders would later contribute to creating the dissident-communist [[Movimento Comunista d'Italia]], largest formation of the [[Italian Resistance]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bandiera rossa nella resistenza romana|last = Corvisieri|first = Silverio|publisher = Samona e Savelli|year = 1968|isbn = |location = Rome|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It issued two issues of a newsletter, and brought together a number of former communist and anarchist militants working in post, rail and other sectors. The organisation was smashed by Roman police in December 1942, only to resurface in the liberalisation period following [[Pietro Badoglio]]'s 25 July 1943 coup against [[Benito Mussolini]].

The Southern Political Science Association was founded in 1929 in [[Atlanta]], Georgia.&lt;ref name="aboutspsa"&gt;{{cite web|title=About SPSA|url=http://spsa.net/about-spsa/ |website=Southern Political Science Association|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is independent of the [[American Political Science Association]].&lt;ref name="afiftyyearlegacy"/&gt; Its first president was [[Cullen B. Gosnell]], a Professor of Political Science at [[Emory University]].&lt;ref name="afiftyyearlegacy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Havard |first1=William C. | last2 = Dauer | first2= Manning J. |title=The Southern Political Science Association: A Fifty Year Legacy |journal=The Journal of Politics |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=664–686 |jstor=2130545 | date = August 1980 |registration=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association organizes a conference every January.&lt;ref name="aboutspsa"/&gt; From 1929 to 1936, it took place in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref name="afiftyyearlegacy"/&gt; However, since 1937, its location has changed to a different location in the South every year.&lt;ref name="afiftyyearlegacy"/&gt; From 1956 to 1963, the annual meeting took place in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]], where both whites and blacks could find places to stay.&lt;ref name="aboutspsa"/&gt;

Its president was [[Alfred Benjamin Butts]] in 1938.&lt;ref name="spsapresidents"&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Presidents|url=http://spsa.net/about-spsa/past-presidents/ |website=Southern Political Science Association |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roscoe C. Martin]] served as its president in 1942.&lt;ref name="afiftyyearlegacy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spsapresidents"/&gt; He was followed by [[Herman Clarence Nixon]], who served as its president in 1944 and 1945.&lt;ref name="spsapresidents"/&gt; By 1955, its president was [[Manning J. Dauer]].&lt;ref name="spsapresidents"/&gt;
 
In 1964, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] gave an address at the SPSA meeting in [[Durham, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="afiftyyearlegacy"/&gt; During the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]] of the 1950s, the association remained apolitical.&lt;ref name="afiftyyearlegacy"/&gt; By 1973, its president was [[Samuel DuBois Cook]], an African-American political scientist.&lt;ref name="spsapresidents"/&gt;

The SPSA publishes ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'', a peer-reviewed academic journal.&lt;ref name="aboutspsa"/&gt;

'''Soyombo Revival Society''' (in [[Russian language|Russian]] Общество Возрождения Соёмбо, abbreviated ОВС, ''OVS'') was a [[secret society]] that was founded by [[white émigré]] in [[Mongolia]] (according to documents&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://golos.ruspole.info/node/7490|title=Документы и материалы РОВС 1924-1928 гг.|last=|first=|date=|website=Русское поле|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pereklichka.livejournal.com/929188.html|title=Документы и материалы РОВС 1930-1932 гг.|last=|first=|date=|website=Перекличка - электронный журнал русского обще-воинского союза|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it denoted both [[Mongolia|state of Mongolia]] and Chinese ethnic Mongol provinces) in 1930, being subsidiary organization of Mongolian department of [[Russian All-Military Union|ROVS]]. Its main purpose was to gain the support of local [[Asian people|Asiatic]] population in various anti-communist activities.

== History ==

=== Precursors and foundation ===
[[File:Mongolian ROVS card.jpg|thumb|Sample membership card of Mongolian Department of [[ROVS]]]]
Following establishment of ROVS in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1924 the Far-Eastern Department was founded in 1927&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; from which Mongolian Department was separated in 1929.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdf-archive.com/2017/02/18/untitled-pdf-document-1/|title=Приказ об учреждении Монгольского отдела РОВС|last=Ханжин|first=Михаил|date=1927|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounded by pro-Soviet forces, senior officials of the Mongolian department (mostly former [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Semyonov]] and [[Roman von Ungern-Sternberg|Ungern]] staffers&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=General V. A. Kislitsin: From Russian Monarchism to the Spirit of Bushido|last=Breuillard|first=Sabine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) decided to form separate conspiratory organization to attract more supporters from local population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Миссия русской эмиграции|last=Назаров|first=Михаил|publisher=Родник|year=1994|isbn=|location=Москва|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its structure and customs were largely inspired by traditional Mongolian [[duguilang]] societies and Ungern's idea of "Order of militant buddhists"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=БАРОН УНГЕРН Даурский крестоносец или буддист с мечом|last=Жуков|first=Андрей|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with paramilitary organization of regular ROVS departments. Despite initial success, the Society had proven to be unable to survive after beginning of [[Stalinist repressions in Mongolia|mass purges]] and was forced to retreat to China.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Participation in conflitcs ===
In Xingjiang, OVS had managed to gain support from exciled [[Semirechye Cossacks|Semirechye cossacks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kommolrb.ru/patriot-vospitanie/235--lr-128-1939-1945|title=Русская Диаспора в Монголии|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later participated in Kumul Rebellion and coup against Jin Shuren.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foreign affairs, Volume 32|last=|first=|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|year=1954|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911‒1949|last=Forves|first=Andrew|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly, OVS was behind some volunteer forces fought in [[Suiyuan Campaign|Suiyuan]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Dissolution ===
The Society was eventually dissolved after arrests of most of its members following the success of [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] and [[Chinese Civil War|Chinese people's revolution]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Image:ISF070501.jpg|frame|'right'|The 2011 Standard of Good Practice]]
The '''Standard of Good Practice for Information Security''', published by the [[Information Security Forum]] (ISF), is a business-focused, practical and comprehensive guide to identifying and managing [[information security]] risks in organizations and their supply chains.

The most recent edition is 2018, an update of the 2016 edition.

The 2011 Standard is the most significant update of the standard for four years. It includes information security 'hot topics' such as consumer devices, critical infrastructure, cybercrime attacks, office equipment, spreadsheets and databases and cloud computing.

The 2011 Standard is aligned with the requirements for an [[Information Security Management System]] (ISMS) set out in [[ISO/IEC 27000-series]] standards, and provides wider and deeper coverage of [[ISO/IEC 27002]] control topics, as well as cloud computing, information leakage, consumer devices and security governance.

In addition to providing a tool to enable ISO 27001 certification, the 2011 Standard provides full coverage of [[COBIT]] v4 topics, and offers substantial alignment with other relevant standards and legislation such as [[PCI DSS]] and the [[Sarbanes Oxley Act]], to enable compliance with these standards too.

The Standard is used by Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), information security managers, business managers, IT managers, internal and external auditors, IT service providers in organizations of all sizes.

The 2018 Standard is available free of charge to members of the ISF. Non-members are able to purchase a copy of the standard directly from the ISF.

== Organization ==
The Standard has historically been organized into six categories, or ''aspects''. '''Computer Installations''' and '''Networks''' address the underlying [[IT infrastructure]] on which '''Critical Business Applications''' run. The '''End-User Environment''' covers the arrangements associated with protecting corporate and workstation applications at the endpoint in use by individuals. '''Systems Development''' deals with how new applications and systems are created, and '''Security Management''' addresses high-level direction and control.

The Standard is now primarily published in a simple "modular" format that eliminates redundancy. For example, the various sections devoted to security audit and review have been consolidated.

|}

The six aspects within the Standard are composed of a number of ''areas'', each covering a specific topic. An area is broken down further into ''sections'', each of which contains detailed specifications of [[information security]] best practice. Each statement has a unique reference. For example, SM41.2 indicates that a specification is in the Security Management aspect, area 4, section 1, and is listed as specification #2 within that section.

The Principles and Objectives part of the Standard provides a high-level version of the Standard, by bringing together just the ''principles'' (which provide an overview of what needs to be performed to meet the Standard) and ''objectives'' (which outline the reason why these actions are necessary) for each section.

The published Standard also includes an extensive topics matrix, index, introductory material, background information, suggestions for implementation, and other information.

'''''The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914–1991''''' is a book by [[Eric Hobsbawm]], published in 1994. In it, Hobsbawm comments on what he sees as the disastrous failures of [[state socialism]], [[capitalism]], and [[nationalism]]; he offers an equally skeptical take on the progress of the arts and changes in society in the latter half of the twentieth century.

Hobsbawm calls the period from the start of [[World War I]] to the fall of the so-called [[Soviet bloc]] "[[the short twentieth century]]", to follow on "[[the long 19th century]]", the period from the start of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 to the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, which he covered in an earlier trilogy of histories (''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848|The Age of Revolution: Europe, 1789-1848]]'', ''[[The Age of Capital: 1848–1875]]'', ''[[The Age of Empire: 1875–1914]]''). In the United States, the book was published with the subtitle ''A History of the World, 1914–1991'' ({{ISBN|978-0-679-73005-7}}).

==Failure of prediction==
Hobsbawm points out the abysmal record of recent attempts to predict the world's future. "The record of forecasters in the past thirty or forty years, whatever their professional qualification as prophets, has been so spectacularly bad that only governments and economic research institutes still have, or pretend to have, much confidence in it."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', pp. 5-6 [all page numbers are from Time Warner Books, 2002 Abacus edition reprint.]&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes President [[Calvin Coolidge]], in a message to Congress on December 4, 1928, on the eve of the [[Great Depression]], as saying "The country can regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future with optimism." &lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of the future himself, Hobsbawm largely confines himself to predicting continued turmoil: "The world of the third millennium will therefore almost certainly continue to be one of violent politics and violent political changes. The only thing uncertain about them is where they will lead,"&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'',  p.460&lt;/ref&gt; and expressing the view that "If humanity is to have a recognizable future, it cannot be by prolonging the past or the present." &lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his few more concrete predictions, he writes that "Social distribution and not growth would dominate the politics of the new millennium."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure of communism==
The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was not the revolution of the most advanced capitalist societies predicted by [[Karl Marx]]. As Hobsbawm puts it, "Capitalism had proved far easier to overthrow where it was weak or barely existed than in its heartlands."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.82&lt;/ref&gt; Even within Russia, Hobsbawm doubts the ostensibly "progressive" effects of the revolution: "What remained [after revolution and civil war] was a Russia even more firmly anchored in the past... [W]hat actually governed the country was an undergrowth of smaller and larger bureaucracy, on average even less educated and qualified than before."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.379&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a central thesis of Hobsbawm's book that, from the start, State Socialism betrayed the [[socialism|socialist]] and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] vision it claimed to uphold. In particular, State Socialism always dispensed with the [[democracy|democratic]] element of the socialist vision: "Lenin... concluded from the start that the liberal horse was not a runner in the Russian revolutionary race."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.58&lt;/ref&gt; This anti-liberalism ran deep. In 1933, with [[Benito Mussolini]] firmly in control of Italy, "Moscow insisted that the Italian communist leader P. Togliatti withdraw the suggestion that, perhaps, social-democracy was not the primary danger, at least in Italy."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

As for support for international revolution, "The communist revolutions actually made (Yugoslavia, Albania, later China) were made against Stalin's advice. The Soviet view was that, both internationally and within each country, post-war politics should continue within the framework of the all-embracing anti-fascist alliance.... There is no doubt that Stalin meant all this seriously, and tried to prove it by dissolving the Comintern in 1943, and the Communist Party of the United States in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.168&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he Chinese Communist regime, though it criticized the USSR for betraying revolutionary movements after the break between the two countries, has no comparable record of practical support for Third World liberation movements."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, he is no friend of the [[Maoist]] doctrine of perpetual revolution: "Mao was fundamentally convinced of the importance of struggle, conflict and high tension as something that was not only essential to life but prevented the relapse into the weaknesses of the old Chinese society, whose very insistence on unchanging permanence and harmony had been its weakness."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.469&lt;/ref&gt; Hobsbawm draws a straight line from this belief to the disastrous [[Great Leap Forward]] and the subsequent Chinese famine of 1959–1961.&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', pp.468-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialism, Hobsbawm argues, ultimately fell because, eventually, "...hardly anyone believed in the system or felt any loyalty to it, not even those who governed it."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.488&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Danny Yee]], [http://dannyreviews.com/h/Age_Extremes.html ''The Age of Extremes''], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of imperialism==
Hobsbawm has very mixed feelings about the end of the nineteenth-century imperial order, largely because he is no happier with the nation-states that replaced the empires. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[World War I]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;... had made the habitual and sensible process of international negotiation suspect as 'secret diplomacy'. This was largely a reaction against the secret treaties arranged among the Allies during the war... The [[Bolshevik]]s, discovering these sensitive documents in the Tsarist archives, had promptly published them for the world to read." &lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

"The botched peace settlements after 1918 multiplied what we, at the end of the twentieth century, know to be the fatal virus of democracy, namely the division of the body of citizens exclusively along ethnic-national or religious lines." &lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.139&lt;/ref&gt; "The ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of... anti-colonialist logic was the attempt by an extremist Jewish fringe group in Palestine to negotiate with the Germans (via Damascus, then under the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]]) for help in liberating Palestine from the British, which they regarded as the top priority for [[Zionism]]. (A militant of the group involved in this mission eventually became prime minister of Israel: [[Yitzhak Shamir]].)" &lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure of free-market capitalism==
None of this throws Hobsbawm into the embrace of free-market capitalism: "Those of us who lived through the years of the Great Slump still find it almost impossible to understand how the orthodoxies of the pure free market, then so obviously discredited, once again came to preside over a global period of depression in the late 1980s and 1990s, which once again, they were equally unable to understand or to deal with."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

"As it happened, the regimes most deeply committed to laissez-faire economics were also sometimes, and notably in the case of Reagan's United States and Thatcher's Britain, profoundly and viscerally nationalist and distrustful of the outside world. The historian cannot but note that the two attitudes are contradictory."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.412&lt;/ref&gt; He points up the irony that "[T]he most dynamic and rapidly growing economy of the globe after the fall of Soviet socialism was that of Communist China, leading Western business-school lectures and the authors of management manuals, a flourishing genre of literature, to scan the teachings of Confucius for the secrets of entrepreneurial success."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', pp.412-413&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, in world terms, he sees capitalism being just as much of a failure as state socialism: "The belief, following neoclassical economics, that unrestricted international trade would allow the poorer countries to come closer to the rich, runs counter to historical experience as well as common sense. [The examples of successful export-led Third World industrialization usually quoted -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea — represent less than two percent of the Third World population]." (brackets in the original)&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.571&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fascism==
Denying fascism's claim to philosophical respectability, Hobsbawm writes: "Theory was not the strong point of movements devoted to the inadequancies of reason and rationalism and the superiority of instinct and will", and further on the same page: "[[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] could have readily dispensed with his house philosopher, [[Giovanni Gentile]], and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] probably neither knew nor cared about the support of the philosopher [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he claims, the popular appeal of fascism lay with its claims to technocratic achievement: "Was not the proverbial argument in favour of fascist Italy that 'Mussolini made the trains run on time'?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

He also writes: "Would the horror of the holocaust be any less if historians concluded that it exterminated not six millions but five or even four?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hobsbawm's use of statistics==
Hobsbawm often uses statistics to paint a broad picture of a society at a particular time. With reference to the contemporary United States (at the time of writing) he points out, "In 1991, 58 per cent of all black families in the United States were headed by a single woman and 70 per cent of all children were born to single mothers,"&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.322&lt;/ref&gt; and "In 1991 15 per cent of what was proportionally the largest prison population in the world — 426 prisoners per 100,000 population -- were said to be mentally ill."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.337&lt;/ref&gt;

He finds damning statistics to back up his claim of the total failure of state socialism to promote the general welfare: "In 1969, Austrians, Finns and Poles could expect to die at the same average age (70.1 years) but in 1989, Poles had a life expectancy about four years shorter than Austrians and Finns,"&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.472&lt;/ref&gt; "...The great [Chinese] famine of 1959-61, probably the greatest famine of the twentieth century: According to official Chinese statistics, the country's population in 1959 was 672.07 millions. At the natural growth rate of the preceding seven years, which was at least 20 per thousand per year, one would have expected the Chinese population in 1961 to have been 699 millions. In fact it was 658.59 millions or forty millions less than might have been expected.&lt;!--presumably, the quote ends here(?)--&gt;" &lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', pp.466-467, note&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, "Brazil, a monument to social neglect, had a GNP per capita almost two-and-a-half as large as Sri Lanka in 1939, and over six times as large at the end of the 80s. In Sri Lanka, which had subsidized basic foodstuffs and given free education and health care until the later 1970s, the average newborn could expect to live several years longer than the average Brazilian, and to die as an infant at about half the Brazilian rate in 1969, at a third of the Brazilian rate in 1989. The percentage of illiteracy in 1989 was about twice as great in Brazil as on the Asian island."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.577&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hobsbawm on the arts==
Hobsbawm writes on Post-war modernist art practice:

:"...consisted largely in a series of increasingly desperate gimmicks by which artists sought to give their work an immediately recognizable individual trademark, a succession of manifestos of despair... or of gestures reducing the sort of art which was primarily bought for investment and its collectors ad absurdum, as by adding an individual's name to piles of brick or soil ('[[minimalism|minimal]] art') or by preventing it from becoming such a commodity through making it too short-lived to be permanent ('[[performance art]]').

:"The smell of impending death rose from these [[avant-garde]]s. The future was no longer theirs, though nobody knew whose it was. More than ever, they knew themselves to be on the margin."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', pp.516-517&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hobsbawm on popular culture==
Hobsbawm also comments on popular culture, a subject he has left alone in other books. He writes, "[[Buddy Holly]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Brian Jones]] of [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and a number of other popular divinities fell victim of a life-style designed for early death. What made such deaths symbolic was that youth, which they represented, was impermanent by definition."&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.324&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Joplin's and Hendrix's deaths were drug-related; Jones's may have been (the coroner's verdict was "death by misadventure"; there has been much controversy surrounding the events leading to his death); Holly died in a plane crash and Marley of cancer.

However, he does use youth culture as a lens to view the changes in the late-twentieth-century social order:

:"The novelty of the new youth culture was threefold.

:"First, 'youth' was not seen as a preparatory stage of adulthood but, in some sense, as the final stage of full human development. As in sport, the human activity in which youth is supreme, and which now defined the ambitions of more human beings than any other, life clearly went downhill after the age of thirty...

:"The second novelty of the youth culture...: it was or became dominant in the 'developed market economies'... What children could learn from their parents became less obvious than what parents did not know and children did. The role of generations was reversed. Blue jeans..., pioneered... by students who did not wish to look like their elders, came to appear... below many a grey head.

:"The third peculiarity of the new youth culture in urban societies was its astonishing internationalism... The English language of rock lyrics was often not even translated... The heartlands of Western youth culture themselves were the opposite of culturally chauvinist... They welcomed styles imported from the Caribbean, Latin America and, from the 1980s, increasingly Africa." &lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', pp.325-327&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobsbawm goes on to write that "The cultural revolution of the latest twentieth century can thus best be understood as the triumph of the individual over society, or rather, the breaking of the threads which in the past had woven human beings into social textures"&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.334&lt;/ref&gt; and evokes this as paralleling [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s claim that 'There is no society, only individuals'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Extremes'', p.337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikiquote:Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]] (''[[Wikiquote]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels''''' is a 2014 book by [[United States|American]] energy theorist [[Alex Epstein (American writer)|Alex Epstein]],&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broughton|first1=Philip Delves|title=Making ‘The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels’|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-moral-case-for-fossil-fuels-by-alex-epstein-1417477909|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author argues that, although sometimes labeled as "immoral," the use of [[fossil fuel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s dramatically improves the overall progress of humanity, and improves life expectancy and income.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; The book was a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' bestseller.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Selling Science Books|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/science/best-selling-science-books.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicmagazine.com/industry-segments/drilling-exploration-subsection/author-epstein-makes-the-moral-case-for-fossil-fuels/ |title=Author Epstein makes the moral case for fossil fuels |author=White, Andrew |website=BICMagazine.com |accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels'' outlines the benefits that the development of coal, oil, and natural gas have had on mankind, including improved health, increased lifespan, and expansion of material welfare.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|title=Making the Case for the Benefits of Fossil Fuels|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-11-17/making-the-case-for-the-benefits-of-fossil-fuels|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stossel|first1=John|title=Fossil fuels are no catastrophe.

The book also covers the topics of climate livability, the effects of [[carbon emissions]], the nature of the environmental movement, and the role fossil fuels play in everyday life.&lt;ref name=cspan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edward Hilboldt|first1=John|title=Book Discussion on The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?322718-1/book-discussion-moral-case-fossil-fuels|publisher=CSPAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=financialpost&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=Peter|title=Peter Foster: Don’t trust the global warming doomsters and their moral outrage|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2015/01/29/peter-foster-why-you-cant-trust-the-global-warming-doomsters/|work=Financial Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein writes that alternative energy sources like wind, solar, and [[biofuel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are inferior to fossil fuels because they are more expensive and less reliable.&lt;ref name=blaze&gt;Veer, PeerGuy [http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/the-moral-case-for-fossil-fuels-a-bold-humanist-statement/ The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels: A Bold Humanist Statement] ''The Blaze''.

'''''The Real Global Warming Disaster''''' (''Is the Obsession with 'Climate Change' Turning Out to Be the Most Costly Scientific Blunder in History?'') is a 2009 book by English journalist and author [[Christopher Booker]] in which he asserts that [[global warming]] can not be [[Attribution of climate change|attributed to humans]], and then alleges how the [[scientific opinion on climate change]] was formulated.

From a standpoint of [[environmental scepticism]], Booker seeks to combine an analysis of the science of global warming with the consequences of political decisions to reduce [[carbon dioxide|{{chem|CO|2}}]] emissions and claims that, as governments prepare to make radical changes in [[Energy policy|energy policies]], the [[scientific evidence]] for global warming is becoming increasingly challenged. He asserts that global warming is not [[scientific opinion on climate change|supported by a significant number of climate scientists]], and criticises how the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) presents evidence and [[data]], in particular citing its reliance on potentially inaccurate [[global climate models]] to make temperature projections. Booker concludes, "it begins to look very possible that the nightmare vision of our planet being doomed"&lt;ref name="Booker-342"&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be imaginary, and that, if so, "it will turn out to be one of the most expensive, destructive, and foolish mistakes the human race has ever made".&lt;ref name="Booker-342"/&gt;

The book's claims were strongly criticised by [[science journalist|science writer]] [[Philip Ball]],&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The book consists of three parts and an epilogue.

Booker sums up the book's contents in a long [[epilogue]], which quotes [[Theseus]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush supposed a bear&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Booker contends that in this quote [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] is identifying that "when we are not presented with enough information for our minds to resolve something into certainty, they may be teased into exaggerating it into something quite different from what it really is".&lt;ref name="Booker-341"&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The book received a mixed reception in the media.

In his review in ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Philip Ball]] wrote that the book was "the definitive climate sceptics' manual" in that it makes an uncritical presentation of "just about every criticism ever made of the majority scientific view" on global warming. Though expressing "a queer kind of admiration for the skill and energy with which Booker has assembled his polemic", Ball called the claims made by the author "bunk". Ball also criticised Booker's tactic of introducing [[global warming sceptic]]s "with a little eulogy to their credentials, while their opponents receive only a perfunctory, if not disparaging, preamble".&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = But much, including the central claim, is bunk. [...] Booker's position would require that you accept something like the following: 1) Most of the world's climate scientists, for reasons unspecified, decided to create a myth about human-induced global warming and have managed to twist endless measurements and computer models to fit their case, without the rest of the scientific community noticing. George W Bush and certain oil companies have, however, seen through the deception. 2) Most of the world's climate scientists are incompetent and have grossly misinterpreted their data and models, yet their faulty conclusions are not, as you might imagine, a random chaos of assertions, but all point in the same direction.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Spectator]]'', [[Rodney Leach]] wrote that "the shelf of sceptical books keeps filling and Booker's belongs there with the best", remarking that Booker "narrates this story with the journalist's pace and eye for telling detail and the historian's forensic thoroughness which have made him a formidable opponent of [[humbug]]".&lt;ref name="Leach The Spectator"&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', [[Brian Morton (Scottish writer)|Brian Morton]] was largely sympathetic to the position taken by Booker in the book: "The question isn't whether climate is changing, but what is to blame. A crippling tithe of international political effort and social action is directed to the assumption that we are", and "the climate change debate—or enforced consensus—concerns the way science is done and perceived. As Booker says, 'consensus' is not a term in science but in politics".&lt;ref name="Morton The_Herald"&gt;

A positive review by Henry Kelly in ''[[The Irish Times]]'', referring to the book as "meticulously researched, provocative and challenging",&lt;ref name="Kelly_Irish Times"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was criticised by Irish environmental campaigner and ''climatechange.ie'' website founder [[John Gibbons (environmental campaigner)|John Gibbons]], who said that the decision by ''The Irish Times'' to allow Kelly to review ''The Real Global Warming Disaster'' was part of a recent trend of "the media giving too much coverage to 'anti-science' climate change deniers and failing to convey the gravity of the threat, making readers and viewers apathetic".&lt;ref name="Monaghan_Times"&gt;

In ''[[The Scotsman]]'', writer and environmentalist [[John Lister-Kaye|Sir John Lister-Kaye]] chose ''The Real Global Warming Disaster'' as one of his books of the year, writing that "though barely credible in places" this was an "important, brave book making and explaining many valid points".&lt;ref name="Lister-Kaye The Scotsman"&gt;

==Houghton misquotation==

The book opens with an incorrect quotation which wrongly attributes to [[John T. Houghton]] the words "Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news
| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/fabricated-quote-used-to-discredit-climate-scientist-1894552.html
| date = 10 February 2010
| title = Fabricated quote used to discredit climate scientist
| author = Connor, Steve
| work = [[The Independent]]
| accessdate = 10 February 2010
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The publishers apologised for this misquotation, confirmed that it would not be repeated, and agreed to place a corrigendum in any further copies of the book. In an article which appeared in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' on 20 February 2010, Booker wrote "we shall all in due course take steps to correct the record, as I shall do in the next edition of my book".&lt;ref name="Booker retraction"/&gt;
Houghton felt that Booker continued to misstate his position regarding the role of disasters in policy making, and he referred the matter to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] (PCC Reference 101959), following whose involvement ''The Sunday Telegraph'' published on 15 August a letter of correction by Houghton stating his actual position, that adverse events shock people and thereby bring about change.&lt;ref name="Houghton letter"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8977">'''Women's National Council''' ({{lang-cs|Ženská národní rada (ŽNR)}} (1923-1942) was the only women's [[umbrella organization]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] and only official women's collective which existed in the country until after 1990. As such, it was the most significant feminist organization in the [[interwar period]]. Founded by [[Františka Plamínková]], its members strove for reform of marriage laws and employment restrictions of women, which they believed had been promised by the equality mandate in the new constitution.

==History==
After the founding of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] in 1918 and passage of its [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|constitution]] in 1920,{{sfn|Masaryk University|2014|p=3}} Františka Plamínková, a politician who recognized the need for an effective lobbying group for women's issues, established the Women's National Council (ŽNR) in 1923.{{sfn|Feinberg|2006|p=53}} Throughout the life of the organization, Plamínková served as the president.{{sfn|Masaryk University|2014|p=3}} The governing documents of the ŽNR were approved by the Ministry of the Interior on 24 February 1923,{{sfn|Gatialová|2016}} and soon after its formation joined the [[International Council of Women]] and the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]]. The organization was established as an umbrella organization to unite other women's organizations in gaining political and civic equality for women.{{sfn|Feinberg|2006|p=53}} Established in [[Prague]], with a branch office in [[Brno]],{{sfn|Masaryk University|2014|p=3}} by 1935, they had fifty affiliated organizations and some 2,200 members{{sfn|Gatialová|2016}} without regard to creed, nationality or political affiliation.{{sfn|Feinberg|2006|p=53}} Most of the affiliated organizations were professional organizations of civil servants, social workers and teachers, with membership among the educated middle class. Because the organization focused on Czech women and meetings and correspondence was in the [[Czech language]] women identifying as German or Slovak rarely joined, though the Slovak network, Živena and several German and Jewish organizations were members.{{sfn|Feinberg|2006|pp=53-54}} The organization's leadership was staunchly [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]], which often precluded Catholic women's organizations from participating. Politically, the membership included members of the [[Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants|Agrarian Party]], [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]], [[Czech National Social Party|National Socialist Party]] and [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]], but most of the executive were aligned with the conservative [[Czechoslovak National Democracy|National Democrats]].{{sfn|Feinberg|2006|p=54}}

The ŽNR worked to educate women about their rights, as well as to mold public opinion. To that end, they worked to establish a library of materials about women both from within Czechoslovakia and abroad. The organization collected women's literature, and specifically tried to obtain information on reforms, draft laws, and pending legislation which might impact women's equality. Members were encouraged to contact legislative members, [[trade unions]] and [[libraries]] in other jurisdictions to expand the information ŽNR could offer for study to members, public officials and journalists. They also established a journal, ''Ženská rada'' (Women's advice) which was published from 1925 to 1938 and edited by Plamínková.{{sfn|Gatialová|2016}} Developing a number of departments, the organization focused on women's civil status as wives and employees, educational opportunities, family matters and parenting, legal status, morality, [[pacifism]], [[Civil liberties|personal freedom]], and societal improvement.{{sfn|Masaryk University|2014|p=3}} Members like [[Milada Horáková]], Marie Svozilová and Hana Vichová devoted speeches and articles to criticize the government's failure to implement laws for equality which was constitutionally guaranteed. They demanded an end to employment discrimination on the basis of sex and insisted that equal pay for employment based on education and skill be upheld.{{sfn|Gatialová|2016}}{{sfn|Feinberg|2006|p=56}} Because the civil code designated the man as head of the household, women by law were legal dependents having the same position as children, with decision-making authority over their economic life or guardianship concerns for their children.{{sfn|Uhrová|2015}} ŽNR drafted a new civil code which called for equality of spouses as well as for their mutual care of dependents and each other. Each spouse should have the right to work and the responsibility for care of the family with equal decision-making authority, and for [[Homemaking|domestic maintenance]]. There should be equality in division of assets, the right of spouses to choose their legal name, the right of divorce and equal alimony regardless to the sex of the lower earning partner.{{sfn|Feinberg|2006|p=55}} Their suggestions were rejected and though the law was revised in 1931, men still maintained authority over children, property and their wives;{{sfn|Feinberg|2006|p=60}} the only substantive change being that marriage would henceforward be a civil partnership, rather than a religious rite.{{sfn|Feinberg|2006|p=61}} 

With the advent of the [[Great Depression]] and austerity measures put in place at that time, ŽNR pressed for relief programs that provided assistance to the unemployed, rather than the mass dismissal of women workers.{{sfn|Gatialová|2016}} The women also worked for assistance programs for the disabled, illegitimate children and orphans, a juvenile court system, protections for women prisoners, and a comprehensive reform of unemployment schemes, specifically for the establishment of a women's unemployment fund.{{sfn|Uhrová|2015}} When the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Nazi occupation]] began in 1938, women lost ground. Implementation of programs outlawing all political parties except the state-sponsored party, which women could not join, effectively silenced the ŽNR's ability to engage politically. State-sponsored paternalism ensured that the women's choices were curtailed and President [[Emil Hácha]] took over the appointment of the women who were to serve on the ŽNR board, some of whom were not members of the organization. The intent was to subvert the concerns of women from women's issues and point them toward state-approved activities which would benefit the state. in 1942, the organization was outlawed.{{sfn|Gatialová|2016}}{{sfn|Masaryk University|2014|p=3}}

A '''worker cooperative''', is a [[cooperative]] that is [[Workers' self-management|owned and self-managed by its workers]]. This control may be exercised in a number of ways. A cooperative enterprise may mean a firm where every worker-owner participates in [[decision-making]] in a democratic fashion, or it may refer to one in which management is elected by every worker-owner, and it can refer to a situation in which managers are considered, and treated as, workers of the firm. In traditional forms of worker cooperative, all shares are held by the workforce with no outside or consumer owners, and each member has one voting share. In practice, control by worker-owners may be exercised through individual, collective, or majority ownership by the workforce; or the retention of individual, collective, or majority voting rights (exercised on a one-member one-vote basis).&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk/ciod_papers/57/ Ridley-Duff, R.

CICOPA has two regional organisations: CECOP- CICOPA Europe and CICOPA Americas.

==History==
[[File:New harmony vision.jpg|thumb|250px|Model of [[Robert Owen]]'s visionary project for a cooperative settlement. [[Owenism|Owenites]] fired bricks to build it, but construction never took place.]]
Worker cooperatives rose to prominence during the [[Industrial Revolution]] as part of the [[labour movement]]. As employment moved to industrial areas and job sectors declined, workers began organizing and controlling businesses for themselves. Workers cooperative were originally sparked by "critical reaction to industrial capitalism and the excesses of the industrial revolution." The formation of some workers cooperatives were designed to "cope with the evils of unbridled capitalism and the insecurities of wage labor".&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt;

The philosophy that underpinned the cooperative movement stemmed from the [[socialism|socialist]] writings of thinkers including [[Robert Owen]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. Robert Owen, considered by many as the father of the cooperative movement, made his fortune in the cotton trade, but believed in putting his workers in a good environment with access to education for themselves and their children. These ideas were put into effect successfully in the [[cotton mill]]s of [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]]. It was here that the first co-operative store was opened. Spurred on by the success of this, he had the idea of forming "villages of co-operation" where workers would drag themselves out of poverty by growing their own food, making their own clothes and ultimately becoming self-governing.  He tried to form such communities in [[Orbiston, Scotland|Orbiston]] in Scotland and in [[New Harmony, Indiana]] in the [[United States|United States of America]], but both communities failed.

Similar early experiments were made in the early 19th century and by 1830 there were several hundred co-operatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/co-op02.html|work=Cotton Times, understanding the industrial revolution|title=Social strife: The birth of the co-op|page=2|author=Doug Peacock|accessdate=2008-06-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725065418/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/co-op02.html|archivedate=25 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William King (doctor)|Dr William King]] made Owen's ideas more workable and practical. He believed in starting small, and realized that the [[working class]]es would need to set up co-operatives for themselves, so he saw his role as one of instruction.  He founded a monthly periodical called ''The Co-operator'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mATAAAAQAAJ|title=The Co-operator|author=|date=14 May 2018|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first edition of which appeared on 1 May 1828.  This gave a mixture of co-operative philosophy and practical advice about running a shop using cooperative principles.

===Modern movement===
[[File:Rochdale pioneers group photograph.jpg|350x350px|thumb|right|The [[Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers]] was established in 1844 and defined the modern cooperative movement.]]
The first successful organization was the [[Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers]], established in England in 1844. The Rochdale Pioneers established the ‘[[Rochdale Principles]]’ on which they ran their cooperative. This became the basis for the development and growth of the modern cooperative movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=158|title=Cooperative Principles Then and Now|author=David Thompson|date=July&lt;!-- –Aug --&gt; 1994|accessdate=2008-06-26|work=Co-operative Grocer|publisher=[[National Cooperative Grocers Association]], Minneapolis|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010012855/http://cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=158|archivedate=10 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the mechanization of the Industrial Revolution was forcing more and more skilled workers into poverty, these tradesmen decided to band together to open their own store selling food items they could not otherwise afford.

With lessons from prior failed attempts at co-operation in mind, they designed the now famous [[Rochdale Principles]], and over a period of four months they struggled to pool one [[pound sterling]] per person for a total of 28 pounds of capital. On 21 December 1844, they opened their store with a very meagre selection of butter, sugar, flour, oatmeal and a few candles.  Within three months, they expanded their selection to include tea and tobacco, and they were soon known for providing high quality, unadulterated goods.

The [[Co-operative Group]] formed gradually over 140 years from the merger of many independent retail societies, and their wholesale societies and federations. In 1863, twenty years after the [[Rochdale Pioneers]] opened their co-operative, the North of England Co-operative Society was launched by 300 individual co-ops across [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. By 1872, it had become known as the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS). Through the 20th century, smaller societies merged with CWS, such as the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society (1973) and the [[South Suburban Co-operative Society]] (1984).

===Today===
[[File:Newcastlebridge.jpg|thumb|300px|The old Co-operative building behind the [[Gateshead Millennium Bridge]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].]]
When the current cooperative movement resurfaced in the 1960s it developed mostly on a new system of "collective ownership" where par value shares were issued as symbols of egalitarian voting rights. Typically, a member may only own one share to maintain the egalitarian ethos. Once brought in as a member, after a period of time on probation usually so the new candidate can be evaluated, he or she was given power to manage the coop, without "ownership" in the traditional sense. In the UK this system is known as [[common ownership]].

Some of these early cooperatives still exist and most new worker cooperatives follow their lead and develop a relationship to capital that is more radical than the previous system of equity share ownership.

In the United States there is no coherent legislation regarding worker cooperatives nationally, much less Federal laws, so most worker cooperatives make use of traditional consumer cooperative law and try to fine-tune it for their purposes. In some cases the members (workers) of the cooperative in fact "own" the enterprise by buying a share that represents a fraction of the market value of the cooperative.

In Britain this type of cooperative was traditionally known as a ''producer cooperative'', and, while it was overshadowed by the consumer and agricultural types, made up a small section of its own within the national apex body, the Cooperative Union. The 'new wave' of worker cooperatives that took off in Britain in the mid-1970s joined the [[Industrial Common Ownership Movement]] (ICOM) as a separate federation. Buoyed up by the alternative and ecological movements and by the political drive to create jobs, the sector peaked at around 2,000 enterprises. However the growth rate slowed, the sector contracted, and in 2001 ICOM merged with the Co-operative Union (which was the federal body for consumer cooperatives) to create [[Co-operatives UK]], thus reunifying the cooperative sector.

In 2008 Co-operatives UK launched The Worker Co-operative Code of Governance, an attempt to implement the ICA approved World Declaration.

In 2018 Google announced a $1 million grant to a [[platform cooperative]] development kit in collaboration with 5 pilot cooperatives, which are all worker-owned&lt;ref&gt;https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/google.org-awards-1-million-for-jobs-cooperative-consortium&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Definition of worker cooperative==
Many definitions exist as to what qualifies as a workers' cooperative. [[CICOPA]], the International Organisation of Industrial, Artisanal and Service Producers’ Cooperatives, gives an 8-page definition in their World Declaration on Workers' Cooperatives, which was approved by the [[International Co-operative Alliance]] General Assembly in September 2005. Below is the section on the basic characteristics of workers' cooperatives:

# They have the objective of creating and maintaining sustainable jobs and generating wealth, to improve the quality of life of the worker-members, dignify human work, allow workers’ democratic self-management and promote community and local development.
# The free and voluntary membership of their members, in order to contribute with their personal work and economic resources, is conditioned by the existence of workplaces.
# As a general rule, work shall be carried out by the members. This implies that the majority of the workers in a given worker cooperative enterprise are members and vice versa.
# The worker-members’ relation with their cooperative shall be considered as different from that of conventional wage-based labour and to that of autonomous individual work.
# Their internal regulation is formally defined by regimes that are democratically agreed upon and accepted by the worker-members.
# They shall be autonomous and independent, before the State and third parties, in their labour relations and management, and in the usage and management of the means of production.&lt;ref name="ICA" /&gt;

Workers' cooperatives also follow the [[Rochdale Principles]] and values, which are a set of core principles for the operation of cooperatives. They were first set out by the [[Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers]] in Rochdale, England, in 1844 and have formed the basis for the principles on which co-operatives around the world operate to this day.

Even though there is no universally accepted definition of a workers' cooperative, they can be considered to be businesses that make a product, or offer a service, to sell for profit where the workers are members or worker-owners. Worker-owners work in the business, govern it and manage it. Unlike with conventional firms, ownership and decision-making power of a worker cooperative should be vested solely with the worker-owners and ultimate authority rests with the worker-owners as a whole. Worker-owners control the resources of the cooperative and the work process, such as wages or hours of work.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams, Frank and Gary Hansen (1993) Putting Democracy To Work: A Practical Guide for Starting and Managing Worker-Owned Businesses, Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, the majority—if not all—of the workers in a given worker cooperative enterprise are worker-owners, although some casual or wage workers may be employed with whom profits and decision making are not necessarily shared equally. Workers also often undergo a trial or screening period (such as three or six months) before being allowed to have full voting rights.&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt;

Participation is based on one vote per worker-owner, regardless of the number of shares or equity owned by each worker-owner. Voting rights are not tied to investment or patronage in the workers' co-operative, and only worker-owners can vote on decisions that affect them. In practice, worker co-operatives have to accommodate a range of interests to survive and have experimented with different voice and voting arrangements to accommodate the interests of trade unions,&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, W. F., Whyte, K. K. (1991) ''Making Mondragon'', New York: ILR Press/Itchaca.&lt;/ref&gt; local authorities,&lt;ref name="Paton, R. 1989"&gt;Paton, R. (1989) ''Reluctant Entrepreneurs'', Milton Keynes: Open University Press&lt;/ref&gt; those who have invested proportionately more labour, or through attempts to mix individual and collective forms of worker ownership and control.&lt;ref&gt;Holmstrom, M. (1993), ''The Growth of the New Social Economy in Catalonia'', Berg Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by theorists and practitioners alike, the importance of capital should be subordinated to labour in workers' cooperatives. Indeed, Adams et al. see workers' cooperatives as "labor-ist" rather than "capital-ist":

"Labor is the hiring factor, therefore the voting and property rights are assigned to the people who do the work and not to capital, even though the worker-members supply capital through membership fees and retained earnings...Any profit or loss after normal operating expenses is assigned to members on the basis of their labor contribution."&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt;

Nevertheless, recent developments in the co-operative movement have started to shift thinking more clearly towards multi-stakeholder perspectives. This has resulted in repeated attempts to develop model rules that differentiate control rights from investment and profit-sharing rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commoncausefoundation.org/?q=node/4|title=Common Cause Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103122414/http://www.commoncausefoundation.org/?q=node%2F4|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers' co-operatives have often been seen as an alternative or "third way" to the domination of labour by either capital or the state (see below for a comparison). Co-operatives traditionally combine social benefit interests with capitalistic property-right interests. Co-operatives achieve a mix of social and capital purposes by democratically governing distribution questions by and between equal controlling members. Democratic oversight of decisions to equitably distribute assets and other benefits means capital ownership is arranged in a way for social benefit inside the organization. External societal benefit is also encouraged by incorporating the operating-principle of cooperation between co-operatives.

In short, workers' co-operatives are organised to serve the needs of worker-owners by generating benefits (which may or may not be profits) for the worker owners rather than external investors. This worker-driven orientation makes them fundamentally different from other corporations. Additional cooperative structural characteristics and guiding principles further distinguish them from other business models. For example, worker-owners may not believe that profit maximisation is the best, or only, goal for their co-operative or they may follow the Rochdale Principles. As another example, worker cooperatives’ flattened management structure and more egalitarian ideology often give workers more options and greater freedom in resolving work-place problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gowerpublishing.com/isbn/9781409429241 Hoffmann, Elizabeth A. (2012) ''Co-operative Workplace Dispute Resolution:  Organizational Structure, Ownership, and Ideology,'' United Kingdom: Routledge Publishing.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102230452/http://www.gowerpublishing.com/isbn/9781409429241 |date=2 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Profits (or losses) earned by the worker's cooperative are shared by worker owners. Salaries generally have a low ratio difference which ideally should be "guided by principles of proportionality, external solidarity and internal solidarity"&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt; (such as a two to one ratio between lowest and highest earner), and often are equal for all workers. Salaries can be calculated according to skill, seniority or time worked and can be raised or lowered in good times or bad to ensure job security.

===Internal structure===
Worker cooperatives have a wide variety of internal structures. Worker control can be exercised directly or indirectly by worker-owners. If exercised indirectly, members of representative decision-making bodies (e.g. a Board of Directors) must be elected by the worker-owners (who in turn hire the management) and be subject to removal by the worker-owners. This is a hierarchical structure similar to that of a conventional business, with a board of directors and various grades of manager, with the difference being that the board of directors is elected.

If exercised directly, all members meet regularly to make—and vote on—decisions on how the co-operative is run. Direct workers' cooperatives sometimes use [[consensus decision-making]] to make decisions.&lt;ref name="Routes"&gt;[http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/publicdownloads/setupaworkerscoop-lowres.pdf How to set up a Workers' Co-op] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215041523/http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/publicdownloads/setupaworkerscoop-lowres.pdf |date=15 December 2013 }} by Radical Routes&lt;/ref&gt; Direct worker control ensures a formally flat management structure instead of a [[hierarchical]] one. This structure is influenced by activist collectives and civic organizations, with all members allowed and expected to play a managerial role. Such structures may be associated with political aims such as [[anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]] and [[participatory economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southendpress.org/about|title=About Us - SouthEnd Press|author=|date=|website=www.southendpress.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208101437/http://www.southendpress.org/about|archivedate=8 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haymarketcafe.org/|title=Haymarket Cafe|author=|date=|website=haymarketcafe.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224145941/http://www.haymarketcafe.org/|archivedate=24 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some workers' cooperatives also practice [[job rotation]] or [[balanced job complex]]es to overcome inequalities of [[Political power|power]] as well as to give workers a wider range of experiences and exposure to the different jobs in a work place so that they are better able to make decisions about the whole workplace. The [[Mondragon Bookstore &amp; Coffeehouse]] is a good example of a workplace that does this.

====Worker Collectives====
The term 'worker collective' is sometimes used to describe worker cooperatives which are also collectives: that is, managed without hierarchies such as permanent manager roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultivate.coop/wiki/Differences_Between_Worker_Cooperatives_and_Collectives|title=Differences Between Worker Cooperatives and Collectives - Cultivate.Coop|author=|date=|website=cultivate.coop|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803214412/http://cultivate.coop/wiki/Differences_Between_Worker_Cooperatives_and_Collectives|archivedate=3 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common ownership is practised by large numbers of voluntary associations and non-profit organizations as well as implicitly by all public bodies. Most co-operatives have some element of common ownership, but some part of their capital may be individually owned.

====Common ownership worker co-operatives====
===== Definition =====
The principle of common ownership was codified in UK law in the [https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1976/78/contents Industrial Common Ownership Act 1976] which defines a "common ownership enterprise" as:

a body as to which the registrar has given, and has not revoked, a certificate stating that he is satisfied—

:(a) that the body is—

::(i) a company which has no share capital, is limited by guarantee and is a bona fide co-operative society; or

::(ii) a registered society within the meaning of the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014; and

:(b) that the articles of association or rules of the body include provisions which secure—

::(i) that only persons who are employed by, or by a subsidiary of, the body may be members of it, that (subject to any provision about qualifications for membership which is from time to time made by the members of the body by reference to age, length of service or other factors of any description which do not discriminate between persons by reference to politics or religion) all such persons may be members of the body and that members have equal voting rights at meetings of the body,

::(ii) that the assets of the body are applied only for the purposes of objects of the body which do not include the making over of assets to any member of the body except for value and except in pursuance of arrangements for sharing the profits of the body among its members, and

::(iii) that, if on the winding up or dissolution of the body any of its assets remain to be disposed of after its liabilities are satisfied, the assets are not distributed among its members but are transferred to such a common ownership enterprise or such a central fund maintained for the benefit of common ownership enterprises as may be determined by the members at or before the time of the winding up or dissolution or, in so far as the assets are not so transferred, are held for charitable purposes; and

:(c) that the body is controlled by a majority of the people working for the body and of the people working for the subsidiaries, if any, of the body.

The principle is typically implemented through inserting two clauses in a company's [[Memorandum of Association]], or an [[industrial and provident society]]'s rules:

* The first provides that the company’s assets shall be applied solely in furtherance of its objectives and may not be divided among the members or trustees.
* The second provides for "[[altruism|altruistic]] dissolution", an "asset lock", whereby if the enterprise is wound up, remaining assets exceeding liabilities shall not be divided among the members but shall be transferred to another enterprise with similar aims or to charity.

British law has been reluctant to entrench common ownership, insisting that a three-quarters majority of a company’s members, by passing a "special resolution", have the right to amend a company’s memorandum of association. This three-quarters majority above applies to most limited companies, except that it is possible since 2006 to entrench altruistic dissolution in an industrial and provident society registered as a "community benefit society" ("bencom"). This statutory asset lock is not available to societies registered as 'bona fide' co-operatives. However, such entrenchment has also been written into the [[community interest company]] (CIC), a new legal status that was introduced in 2005.

===== Promotion and finance =====
Section 1.2 of the Industrial Common Ownership Act authorised the Secretary of State for Industry to make grants and loans to bodies "constituted for the purpose of encouraging the development of common ownership enterprises or co-operative enterprises" up to a total of £250,000 over a period of five years, with the proviso that grants should not exceed £30,000 in any year. Grants to promote common ownership enterprises were made to the Industrial Common Ownership Movement and the Scottish Co-operatives Development Committee, while loans were administered through Common Ownership Finance Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1978/dec/07/common-ownership-grants-and-loans#S5CV0959P0_19781207_CWA_153|title=Common Ownership (Grants and Loans) (Hansard, 7 December 1978)|website=api.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section was repealed in 2004.

In 1978 the UK government set up the national Cooperative Development Agency and in subsequent years common ownership was promoted as a model to create employment, and approximately 100 local authorities in the UK established co-operative development agencies for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt; Having failed to become self-supporting, the national agency was wound up in 1989.

===== Examples =====
A very significant early influence on the movement has been the [[Scott Bader Commonwealth]], a composites and specialty polymer plastics manufacturing company in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, which its owner Ernest Bader gave to the workforce in installments through the late 1950s to early 1960s. Contrary to the popular concept of common ownership organisations as being small organisations, this is a high-technology chemical manufacturer whose turnover has exceeded £100 million per annum since the early 1990s with a workforce of hundreds. In London, Calverts is an example of an established worker co-operative with a policy of pay parity. From the collective movement, one of the most successful ventures is probably [[Suma (co-operative)|Suma Wholefoods]] in Elland, West Yorkshire.

==Political philosophy of workers' cooperatives==

The advocacy of [[workplace democracy]], especially with the fullest expression of [[worker self-management]], such as within workers' cooperatives, is rooted within several intellectual or political traditions:

* The alleviation of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation in the workplace]], especially in regard to [[Marxist]] thought
* The encouragement of [[Participatory democracy|Participatory]] or [[direct democracy]]
* Radical but popular-democratic strategies for the overthrow of [[capitalism]], for example, several strains of [[socialist]] and [[anarchist]] thought.
* Autonomy and self-control, especially within anarchist thought.
* Cooperating with other Worker Cooperatives

Workers' cooperatives are also central to ideas of [[Autonomism]], [[Distributism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]], [[Syndicalism]], Participatory economics, [[Guild socialism]], [[Libertarian socialism]] as well as others.

==An economic model: The labor-managed firm==

Economists have modeled the worker cooperative as a firm in which labor hires capital, rather than capital hiring labor as in a conventional firm. The classic theoretical contributions of such a "labor managed firm" (LMF) model are due to Benjamin Ward and [[Jaroslav Vanek]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaroslav Vanek]], The General Theory of Labor-Managed Market Economies, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1970; Ward, Benjamin, 1958. "The Firm in Illyria: Market Syndicalism," American Economic Review, 48, 4, 1958, 566-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the neoclassical version, the objective of the LMF is to maximize not total profit, but rather income per worker. But such a scenario implies "perverse" behavior, such as laying off workers when output price rises so as to divide increased profits among fewer members.&lt;ref&gt;This is known as the Ward effect; see Ward, Benjamin, 1958. "The Firm in Illyria: Market Syndicalism," American Economic Review, 48, 4, 1958, 566-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence supporting such behavior is lacking however; a review of the empirical economics literature is found in Bonin, Jones, and Putterman.&lt;ref&gt;Bonin, John, [[Derek C. Jones]] and Louis Putterman, ‘Theoretical and Empirical Research on the Labor Managed Firm: Will the Twain Ever Meet?’ Journal of Economic Literature, Fall 1993. See also W. Bartlett, J. Cable, S. Estrin, D.C. Jones, and S.C. Smith, "Labor Managed Cooperatives and Private Firms in North Central Italy: An Empirical Comparison," Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 46, 103-118, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; But alternative behavioral models have been proposed. Peter Law examined LMFs that value employment as well as income.&lt;ref&gt;Law showed that if enough weight were placed on employment LMFs would not behave "perversely"; Peter J. Law, "The Illyrian firm and Fellner's union-management model, "Journal of Economic Studies 4 29-37 (1977). Evidence is consistent with this scenario e.g. for Italian Lega labor-managed firms; see Bonin, Jones and Putterman op cit pp. 1299-1300.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Laureate [[Amartya Sen]] examined pay according to work and according to need.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amartya Sen]], "Labour Allocation in a Cooperative Enterprise," The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 33, No. 4 (October 1966), pp. 361-371&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Laureate [[James Meade]] examined behavior of an "inegalitarian" LMF.&lt;ref&gt;Such firms would not exhibit the "Ward effect" even in theory: [[James Meade]], "The Theory of Labour Managed Firms and of Profit Sharing," Economic Journal 82, 325 (Supplement, March 1972): 402-428.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the evidence indicates that worker cooperatives have higher productivity than conventional companies although this difference may be modest in size.&lt;ref&gt;See Chris Doucouliagos, Worker participation and productivity in labor-managed and participatory capitalist firms: A Meta-Analysis," Industrial and Labor Relations Review, Vol. 49, No. 1, October 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Economists have explained clustering of worker coops through leagues or "supporting structures"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaroslav Vanek]] termed such leagues "supporting structures."&lt;/ref&gt; Regions where large clusters of worker cooperatives are found supported by leagues include [[Mondragón]], in the Basque Region of Spain, home of [[Mondragón Cooperative Corporation]] and in Italy, particularly [[Emilia-Romagna]]. Leagues provide various kinds of scale economies to make coops viable. But as leagues need coops to start them the result is a [[chicken or egg]] problem that helps explain why few coops get started.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Joshi and [[Stephen C. Smith (economist)|Stephen C. Smith]], "Endogenous Formation of Coops and Cooperative Leagues," Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 68, 1, October 2008, 217-233. Examples of leagues include [http://www.legacoop.it/ Legacoop in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130030151/http://www.legacoop.it/ |date=30 November 2009 }} and [[Mondragón Cooperative Corporation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worker cooperatives by country==

===Europe===
Worker co-operation is well established in most countries in Europe, with the largest movements being in Italy, Spain and France.

The [[European Cooperative Statute]], which has been in force since 2006, permits worker cooperatives to be created by individuals or corporate bodies in different EU countries. It is a loose framework which devolves much detail to the national legislation of the country in which the European Cooperative Society (ECS) is registered. It permits a minority of shares to be held by 'investor members' which are not employees.

====France====

Workers' associations were legalised in 1848 and again in 1864. In 1871, during the [[Paris Commune]], workshops abandoned by their owners and were taken over by their workers. In 1884 a chamber of workers' cooperatives was founded. By 1900 France had nearly 250 workers' cooperatives and 500 by 1910. The movement was to rise and fall throughout the twentieth century, with growth in 1936, after the Second World War, between 1978 and 1982 and since 1995.

In 2004 France had 1700 workers' co-operatives, with 36,000 people working in them. The average size of a co-operative was 21 employees. More than 60% of co-operative employees were also members.&lt;ref&gt;CGSCOP&lt;/ref&gt; French workers' co-operatives today include some large organisations such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Chèque Déjeuner|fr|3=Groupe Up}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Acome|fr}}. Other cooperatives whose names are generally known include the magazines ''[[Alternatives économiques]]'' and ''[[Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace]]'', the driving school ECF CERCA and the toy manufacturer "Moulin Roty".

====Italy====

The cooperative movement in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, successfully melds two divergent philosophical currents: Socialism and Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/8311289/emiliaromagna|title=emiliaromagna|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009212433/https://www.scribd.com/doc/8311289/emiliaromagna|archivedate=9 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more than a century of cooperative history, the region includes more than 8,000 cooperatives.

====Norway====

The employee-owned IT company [[Kantega]] has several times been recognized as one of the [[100 Best Workplaces in Europe]].

====Spain====

One of the world's best known examples of worker cooperation is the [[Mondragón Cooperative Corporation]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.uvic.ca/bcics/research/worker/mondragon.htm|title=Smith, Julia. BC Institute for Co-operative Studies "The Most Famous Worker Co-operative of All…Mondragon"|author=|date=|website=uvic.ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501034834/http://web.uvic.ca/bcics/research/worker/mondragon.htm|archivedate=1 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UK====

In the United Kingdom, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s enthusiasm for worker cooperatives was at its highest in the 1970s and 1980s, with [[Tony Benn]] being a prominent advocate. A small number of such co-operatives were formed during the 1974 Labour Government as worker takeovers&lt;ref name="www3.interscience.wiley.com"&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117967289/abstract Ridley-Duff, R. J. (2007) "Communitarian Perspectives on Social Enterprise", ''Corporate Governance: An International Review'', 15(2):382-392].&lt;/ref&gt; following the bankruptcy of a private firm in a desperate attempt to save the jobs at risk. However the change in ownership structure was usually unable to resist the underlying commercial failure.&lt;ref name="Paton, R. 1989" /&gt; This was true in particular of the best known, the [[Meriden, West Midlands|Meriden]] motor-cycle cooperative in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] which took over the assets of the ailing [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd#The Meriden Motorcycle Co-operative|Triumph]] company, although there were instances of successful employee buy-outs of nationalised industries in the period, notably [[National Express]].&lt;ref&gt;Spear, R. (1999) "Employee-Owned UK Bus Companies", ''Economic and Industrial Democracy'', 20: 253-268.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, many more worker co-operatives were founded as start-up businesses, and by the late 1980s there were some 2,000 in existence. Since then the number has declined considerably.

Co-operatives are typically registered under either the [[Companies Act 2006]] or the [[Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014]] (IPS), though other legal forms are available. A number of model rules have been devised to enable cooperatives to register under both acts; for workers' cooperatives, these rules restrict membership to those who are employed by the workplace. Most workers' co-operatives are incorporated bodies, which limits the liability if the co-operative fails and goes into liquidation.&lt;ref name="Routes" /&gt;

The largest examples of a British worker cooperatives include, [[Suma (co-operative)|Suma Wholefoods]], Bristol-based Essential Trading Co-operative, [[Brighton]]-based Infinity Foods Cooperative Ltd and the retail giant [[John Lewis Partnership]] (although it only uses the term occasionally).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.employeeownership.co.uk|title=Home - Employee Ownership Association|work=Employee Ownership Association|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508040536/http://employeeownership.co.uk/|archivedate=8 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===

====Israel====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}

In Israel, worker cooperatives emerged in the early 20th century alongside the [[Kibbutz]], the collective farming movement. The Kibbutz is a cooperative movement which was founded on Zionist ideas, with the intention to cultivate land and increase the number of Jewish settlements. By the 1970s, the [[Histadrut]] (Israel Labour Federation) controlled a significant number of corporations, including Israel’s largest bank—[[Bank Hapoalim]] (literally the Worker’s Bank). By the 1990s, the Histadrut had lost its power and influence and many worker cooperative corporations were sold or became [[Public company|public companies]]. Israel’s biggest [[public transportation]] company, [[Egged (company)|Egged]], is still a workers cooperative. However, Egged employs workers who are not cooperative members and are paid at a lower wage than worker-members.

===In North America===

====U.S.====
'''National Organization'''

The [[United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives]] is the only organization in the U.S. representing worker cooperative interests nationally. Offering a voice on national level, promoting the worker co-operative model, uniting co-ops at conferences and providing a base of support and technical assistance to the worker co-operative community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usworker.coop/member-directory United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224005430/http://usworker.coop/member-directory |date=24 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Regional Organizations'''

The Eastern Conference for Workplace Democracy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://east.usworker.coop/|title=Home|author=|date=4 March 2017|website=usworker.coop|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404015311/http://east.usworker.coop/|archivedate=4 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Western Worker Co-operative Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://west.usworker.coop/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117061147/http://west.usworker.coop/ |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; hold conferences every other year for their respective regions. In addition, there are national and regional nonprofit organizations that focus on providing technical support and assistance to both create new worker cooperatives (start-ups) and conversions of existing businesses into worker cooperatives, usually when the business owner is retiring and wants to sell the company. These organizations include Democracy at Work Institute (created by the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives), Cooperative Development Institute, Ohio Employee Ownership Center, Vermont Employee Ownership Center, Project Equity, and others.

'''Local Organizations'''

Local networks and secondary co-operatives—co-ops of co-operatives—are spread throughout the country.

====Canada====
Worker co-ops in Canada are represented by the [[Canadian Worker Co-op Federation]] (CWCF). Members of the CWCF are found throughout English Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianworker.coop/english/4/index_e412.html|title=Canadian Worker Co-op Federation "Members"|author=|date=|website=canadianworker.coop|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815163038/http://www.canadianworker.coop/english/4/index_e412.html|archivedate=15 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
After the revolt on 1 January 1994 from [[EZLN]], the indigenous people in [[Chiapas]] started the reconstruction of their [[Zapatista coffee cooperatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tangoitalia.com/zapatistas/cafe_coops_en.htm|title=Zapatista coffee|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106114328/http://tangoitalia.com/zapatistas/cafe_coops_en.htm|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===

====Argentina====
In response to the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|economic crisis in Argentina]], many Argentinian workers occupied the premises of bankrupt businesses and began to run them as worker-owned cooperatives. As of 2005, there were roughly 200 worker-owned businesses in Argentina, most of which were started in response to this crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upsidedownworld.org/coops_arg.htm Benjamin Dangl, 'Occupy, Resist, Produce: Worker Cooperatives in Argentina'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029220734/http://upsidedownworld.org/coops_arg.htm |date=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary film ''[[The Take (2004 film)|The Take]]'' described this phenomenon.

According to a recent statement by the International Co-operative Alliance, cooperative businesses in Argentina employ nearly 20 million people across a number of business sectors from health care to housing to factory work and beyond. These businesses are increasing in number at a drastic rate, with over 6000 having been created in 2012 alone.&lt;ref name="2013 ICA report"&gt;{{cite web|author=International Co-operative Alliance|url=http://ica.coop/en/media/news/argentinas-co-operative-sector-continues-grow|title=Argentinas Co-Operative Sector Continues Grow|accessdate=28 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201928/http://ica.coop/en/media/news/argentinas-co-operative-sector-continues-grow|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venezuela====
{{see also|List of Venezuelan cooperatives}}

[[Venezuela]] began to see an upsurge of worker cooperatives after [[Hugo Chávez]]'s election in 1999. Upon his election, the [[Venezuelan constitution]] was rewritten as an extension of his "[[Bolivarian Revolution]]" movement. The government saw cooperatives as a way to democratize capital and decentralize the state.&lt;ref name="Ness"&gt;Immanuel Ness and Dario Azzellini. Ours to Master and Own: Workers' Control from the Commune to the Present. Haymarket Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution added terms and conditions which aided the starting of new cooperatives. The government also created tax exemption programs in 2004, which incentivized cooperative building and allowed for cooperatives of various sizes to emerge.
&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Patrick Clark. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2326322  Sowing the Oil? The Chavez Government's Policy Framework for an Alternative Food System in Venezuela.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514184739/https://www.jstor.org/stable/2326322 |date=14 May 2018 }} Humboldt Journal of Social Relations 33:1/2. pg 135-165&lt;/ref&gt;  These tax exemptions led to many on-paper cooperatives, which were in reality, businesses claiming to be cooperatives but instead just taking advantage of tax breaks. The cooperative creation process was also simplified in 2001, when new cooperatives were made exempt from registration charges and, if qualified, gained access to state contracts and loans.&lt;ref name="Ness" /&gt;

According to some, Venezuela is home to the most vibrant cooperative movement in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://affinitiesjournal.org/index.php/affinities/article/view/28|title=Cooperatives and the ‘Bolivarian Revolution’ in Venezuela - Malleson - Affinities: A Journal of Radical Theory, Culture, and Action|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617061716/http://affinitiesjournal.org/index.php/affinities/article/view/28|archivedate=17 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and has approximately 946,000 members in 83,769 cooperatives in all sectors of the economy.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Jeffry Harris. 2007.

===Asia===

====India====
Indians own the largest worker cooperative in the world: [[Indian Coffee House]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
The [[Indian Coffee House]]s in India were started by the Coffee Board in the early 1940s, during British rule. In the mid-1950s the Board closed down the Coffee Houses, due to a policy change. The thrown-out workers then took over the branches, under the leadership of [[A. K. Gopalan]] and renamed the network as Indian Coffee House. This history is recorded in [[Coffee Housinte Katha]], a book in [[Malayalam]], the mother tongue of A. K. Gopalan. The author of the book is [[Nadakkal Parameswaran Pillai]] one of the leaders of the ICH movement. Another very large network of worker coops is [[Kerala]] Dinesh Beedi, originally started by exploited beedi rollers.&lt;ref&gt;See T.M. Thomas Isaac, Richard W. Franke, and Pyaralal Raghavan, "Democracy at Work in an Indian Industrial Cooperative. The Story of Kerala Dinesh Beedi," Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other work organizations==
{{Disputed section|date=January 2014}}
There are significant differences between ends and means between firms where capital controls labour, or firms where the state controls both labour and capital. These distinctions are easily seen when measured by essential elements of commerce: purpose, organization, ownership, control, sources of capital, distribution of profits, [[dividend]]s, operational practices, and tax treatment. The following chart compares the commercial elements of capitalism, socialism, and cooperative worker-ownership. It is based on US rules and regulations.&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt;
