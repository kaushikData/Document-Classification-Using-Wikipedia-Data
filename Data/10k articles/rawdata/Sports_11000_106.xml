'''Broad''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for [[Addington Cricket Club|Addington]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] during the 1740s.

==Career==
Broad is mentioned in reports from 1745 to 1750.  The first was his appearance for [[Robert Colchin|Long Robin's XI]] v [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|R Newland's XI]] at the [[Artillery Ground]] on Wednesday, 26 June 1745, his team winning by over 70 runs.&lt;ref name=ASW&gt;[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], ''At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742-1751'', ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known to have played in two matches in 1747.  On Thursday, 9 July, he was a member of [[William Hodsoll|W Hodsoll's XI]] versus Long Robin's XI and on Monday, 31 August, he was in the [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] team that played [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]].&lt;ref name=ASW/&gt;  The last known mention of Broad is in the Kent v Surrey match at [[Dartford Brent]] on Friday, 6 July 1750.&lt;ref name=ASW/&gt;

As Broad had established his reputation by 1745, he must have been active for some years previously.  His career possibly began in the 1730s and continued into the 1750s. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports.

The '''Cork Senior Hurling Championship''' (known for sponsorship reasons as the '''''Evening Echo'' Cork County Senior Hurling Championship''') is an annual [[hurling]] competition organised by the [[Cork GAA|Cork County Board]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] since 1887 for the top hurling teams in the [[County Cork|county of Cork]] in [[Ireland]].

The series of games are played during the summer and autumn months with the county final currently being played at [[Páirc Uí Chaoimh]] in October. The prize for the winning team is the [[Seán Óg Murphy Cup]]. Initially played as a knock-out competition, the championship currently uses a [[Double-elimination tournament|double elimination format]] whereby each team is guaranteed at least two games.

The Cork County Championship is an integral part of the wider [[Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship]]. The winners of the Cork county final join the champions of the other four hurling counties to contest the provincial championship.

Twenty-six teams currently participate in the Cork County Championship. The title has been won at least once by nineteen different teams. The all-time record-holders are [[Blackrock GAA|Blackrock]], who have led the roll of honour since the championship began and have won a total of 32 titles.

[[Imokilly GAA|Imokilly]] are the [[2018 Cork Senior Hurling Championship|title-holders]] after defeating [[Midleton GAA|Midleton]] by 4-19 to 1-18 in the 2018 championship final.

==History==
===Beginnings===
[[File:The Burning of Cork (9713428703).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Civil unrest following the burning of Cork during the War of Independence lead to the 1921 championship being cancelled.]]
Following the foundation of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] in 1884, new rules for [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] were drawn up and published in the ''[[United Irishman (1848 newspaper)|United Irishman]]'' newspaper. In 1886, county committees were established, with the [[Cork GAA|Cork County Board]] affiliating on 19 December 1886. The [[1887 Cork Senior Hurling Championship|inaugural championship]] was played during the summer of 1887, however, the final stages ended in disarray with no final being played. In spite of this, [[Blackrock GAA|Cork Nationals]] were subsequently declared the champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/histrionics-a-founding-aspect-to-a-rivalry-that-has-real-history-but-least-we-can-expect-a-game-now-1.634844|title=Histrionics a founding aspect to a rivalry that has real history, but least we can expect a game now|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 August 2010|accessdate=10 November 2017|first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the championship title has been awarded every year except on two occasions. A delay in the [[1904 Cork Senior Hurling Championship|1904 championship]] meant that the [[1905 Cork Senior Hurling Championship|1905 championship]] never took place. Civil unrest following the [[burning of Cork]] at the height of the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]] resulted in the 1921 championship being cancelled.

===Team dominance===

Since the beginning the championship has been dominated by [[Blackrock GAA|Blackrock]], [[St. Finbarr's GAA|St. Finbarr's]] and [[Glen Rovers GAA|Glen Rovers]] who are collectively known as the "big three".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/tradition-still-counts-for-a-lot-in-corks-hurling-heart-36249223.html|title=Tradition still counts for a lot in Cork's hurling heart|publisher=Irish Independent|date=22 October 2017|accessdate=5 December 2017|first=Dermot|last=Crowe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/cork-hurlers-the-rebels-in-need-of-a-new-uprising-1.2569746|title=Cork hurlers – the Rebels in need of a new uprising|publisher=Irish Times|date=12 March 2016|accessdate=5 December 2017|first=Keith|last=Duggan}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have won a combined total of 84 championship titles. Blackrock dominated the first thirty years of the championship, winning 15 titles between 1887 and 1920. It was during this time that the county championship earned the nickname of the "little [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]]" due to its competitive nature. St. Finbarr's, after making a breakthrough in the early years of the 20th century, were the team of the decade for the 1920s before regularly claiming championship titles in each of the decades that followed. [[Glen Rovers GAA|Glen Rovers]] made their own breakthrough with a first championship in 1934 and were the dominant club from then until the 1960s. Between 1971 and 1982, the "big three" shared every available championship title. Their rivalry reached its peak in 1977 when a record attendance of 34,151 saw St. Finbarr's defeat Glen Rovers in the championship decider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/gaa/crowded-house-the-ingredients-for-a-packed-pairc-ui-chaoimh-opening-461043.html|title=Crowded house: The ingredients for a packed Páirc Uí Chaoimh opening|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=17 October 2017|accessdate=5 December 2017|first=Michael|last=Moynihan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that zenith the "big three" have only claimed two titles in each of the decades from 1990 to 2017 as the power base of Cork hurling has moved from the city to the county with several clubs making significant breakthroughs and impacts on the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/columnists/michael-moynihan/a-different-demographic-the-changing-face-of-cork-hurling-242478.html|title=A different demographic: the changing face of Cork hurling|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=10 September 2013|accessdate=5 December 2017|first=Michael|last=Moynihan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 [[Midleton GAA|Midleton]] broke the decade-long hegemony and went on to claim five championships over a thirty-year period to 2013. In 1990 [[Na Piarsaigh GAA|Na Piarsaigh]] became the first city club outside of the "big three" since [[Redmonds GAA|Redmonds]] in 1917 to claim the championship. They added two more titles in 1995 and 2004. [[Erin's Own GAA (Cork)|Erin's Own]] also added their name to the roll of honour in 1992 before winning further titles in 2006 and 2007. The mid nineties saw the rise of the divisional sides, with [[Carbery GAA|Carbery]], [[Avondhu GAA|Avondhu]] and [[Imokilly GAA|Imokilly]] claiming four championship titles between 1994 and 1998. The success of [[Newtownshandrum GAA|Newtownshandrum]] between 2000 and 2009 also highlighted the changing demographics of Cork hurling as the tiny parish of 800 people won four championships during that decade. [[Sarsfields GAA (Cork)|Sarsfields]], although close in proximity to the city but based in the [[East Cork]] division, ended a 51-year famine in 2008 by claiming their third championship title ever. Between 2008 and 2015 they appeared in seven finals and won four titles. The East Cork village of [[Carrigtwohill GAA|Carrigtwohill]] ended a 93-wait for their second championship title in 2011.

In recent decades many rural and city-based clubs have also contested championship deciders without making a successful breakthrough. These include [[Ballyhea GAA|Ballyhea]], [[Cloyne GAA|Cloyne]], [[Bride Rovers GAA|Bride Rovers]] and [[Bishopstown GAA|Bishopstown]]. Educational institutions like [[UCC GAA|University College Cork]] and [[CIT GAA|Cork Institute of Technology]] have also appeared in finals.

===Formats used===

22 teams entered the inaugural championship in 1887 and a [[Single elimination tournament|single elimination format]] was used. Each team was afforded only one defeat before being eliminated from the championship. The creation of the divisions in the 1920s added a new dimension to the championship. These divisional teams, which were composed of [[Cork Junior Hurling Championship|junior]] and [[Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship|intermediate]] players, competed in a preliminary section with the two winning teams advancing to the championship proper which retained its single elimination format. The introduction of a "back door" system at inter-county level in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland Championship]] in 1997 lead to the idea of introducing a second chance for defeated teams at county level. In the twenty-year period from the late 1990s to 2017, the championship underwent a number of format changes. The provision of a second chance for defeated teams was later expanded to allow teams the opportunity of being defeated twice and still remain in the championship. The splitting of the intermediate grade in two resulted in the introduction of relegation in 2006, with [[Delaney Rovers GAA|Delaney Rovers]] becoming the first team to be relegated that year. Prior to this teams were allowed to decide for themselves if they wanted to regrade or retain their senior status. In 2015 the championship once again reverted to a [[Double elimination tournament|double elimination format]].

==The championship==

===Overview===

The Cork County Championship is a [[double elimination tournament]]. Each team is afforded two defeats before being eliminated from the championship. Pairings for matches are drawn at random and there is no [[Seed (sports)|seeding]].

Each match is played as a single leg. If a match is drawn there is a period of [[extra time]], however, if both sides are still level at the end of extra time a replay takes place and so on until a winner is found.

==Sponsorship==

Since 2005 the Cork County Championship has been sponsored by the ''[[Evening Echo]]''. The competition was previously sponsored by [[Permanent TSB|TSB Bank]].

==Qualification for subsequent competitions==

The Cork Senior Hurling Championship winners qualify for the subsequent [[Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship]]. This place is reserved for club teams only as divisional and amalgamated teams are not allowed in the provincial championship. If a divisional side wins the Cork Championship then the runners-up qualify for the Munster Championship. This has occurred on five occasions. If two divisional sides qualify for the final then the provincial championship place is given to one of the defeated semi-finalists. This occurred in 1996 when [[Na Piarsaigh GAA|Na Piarsaigh]] represented Cork due to [[Avondhu GAA|Avondhu]] and [[Imokilly GAA|Imokilly]] contesting the final.

==Venues==
===Early rounds===
[[File:Páirc Uí Chaoimh.jpg|thumb|Since 2017 the county final has been held at [[Páirc Uí Chaoimh]], on the site of the previous stadium which hosted it from 1976 to 2014.]]
Fixtures in the opening rounds of the championship are usually played at a neutral venue that is deemed halfway between the participating teams. Some of the more common venues include [[Mallow GAA|Mallow GAA Complex]], [[Valley Rovers GAA|Brinny Sportsfield]], [[Aghabullogue GAA|Coachford Pitch]] and  [[Midleton GAA|Clonmult Memorial Park]]. All games from Round 4 onward are played at either [[Páirc Uí Rinn]] or [[Páirc Uí Chaoimh]].

=== Final ===
The final has been played at the rebuilt [[Páirc Uí Chaoimh]] since it opened in 2017. The rebuilding process meant that the finals of 2015 and 2016  were hosted at [[Páirc Uí Rinn]]. Prior to rebuilding, the final was hosted by the original Páirc Uí Chaoimh since it opened in 1976. The final was played at [[Mardyke (UCC)|the Mardyke]] in 1974 and 1975, while in the 70 years prior to the development of Páirc Uí Chaoimh the final was usually played at the [[Cork Athletic Grounds]]. From the inaugural championship in 1887 up to the turn of the 20th century, the final was held at Cork Park.

==Managers==

[[Manager (Gaelic Games)|Managers]] in the Cork Championship are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and sourcing of players. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the individual club committees. The manager is assisted by a team of two or three selectors and a backroom team consisting of various coaches.

==Trophy==

The winning team is presented with the Seán Óg Murphy Cup. A native of Cork city, [[Seán Óg Murphy]] (1897–1956) played hurling for [[Blackrock GAA|Blackrock]] and Gaelic football for [[Nil Desperandum GAA|Nils]]. He won three [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] medals with [[Cork GAA|Cork]] and served as secretary of the Cork County Board from 1929 until his death in 1956. The cup is similar in design to the [[Liam MacCarthy Cup]].

==Winners and finalists==
===The Double===

[[Glen Rovers GAA|Glen Rovers]] and their sister club, [[St. Nicholas' GAA|St. Nicholas']], became the first teams to win the double in 1938 before claiming two further doubles in 1941 and 1954. [[UCC GAA|University College Cork]] won their only double in 1963. [[St. Finbarr's GAA|St. Finbarr's]] hold the distinction of being the only single entity club team to have won the double. They achieved this in 1980 and 1982.

Divisional sides [[Avondhu GAA|Avondhu]], [[Carbery GAA|Carbery]] and [[Imokilly GAA|Imokilly]] and club team [[Midleton GAA|Midleton]] also hold the distinction of being dual county senior championship-winning teams, however, these were not achieved in a single calendar season.

In [[gridiron football]], a '''dual-threat quarterback''', also known as a '''running quarterback''',&lt;ref name=Benoit14&gt;{{cite web|last=Benoit|first=Andy|url=http://mmqb.si.com/2014/06/05/andrew-luck-russell-wilson-colin-kaepernick-robert-griffin-cam-newtown-running-quarterbacks-analysis/|title=NFL’s Best Running Quarterback? The Answer May Surprise You|publisher=''Sports Illustrated''|work=The MMQB|date=June 5, 2014|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[quarterback]] who possesses the skills and physique to run with the ball if necessary. With the rise of several blitz heavy defensive schemes and increasingly faster defensive players, the importance of a mobile quarterback has been redefined. While arm power, accuracy, and [[Passing pocket|pocket]] presence&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the ability to successfully operate from within the "pocket" formed by his blockers&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; are still the most important quarterback virtues, the ability to elude or run past defenders creates an additional threat that allows greater flexibility in the team's passing and running game. Overall, the dual-threat quarterback has been referred to as "the most complex position in sports" by [[Bleacher Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2274521-br-cfb-250-top-20-dual-threat-quarterbacks|title=B/R CFB 250: Top 20 Dual-Threat Quarterbacks|publisher=''Bleacher Report''|date=December 15, 2014|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual-threat quarterbacks have historically been more prolific at the college level. Typically, a quarterback with exceptional quickness is used in an option offense, which allows the quarterback to either hand the ball off, run it himself, or pitch it to the running back following him at a distance of three yards outside and one yard behind. This type of offense forces defenders to commit to either the running back up the middle, the quarterback around the end, or the running back trailing the quarterback. It is then that the quarterback has the "option" to identify which match up is most favorable to the offense as the play unfolds and exploit that defensive weakness. In the college game, many schools employ several plays that are designed for the quarterback to run with the ball.

This is much less common in professional football, except for a [[quarterback sneak]], but there is still an emphasis on being mobile enough to escape a heavy [[Rush (American football)|pass rush]].

==History in the National Football League==
===Early history (1950s–70s)===
[[File:Tarkenton Scrambling.PNG|thumb|Fran Tarkenton scrambling]]
In the 1950s, [[Tobin Rote]], was a rare example of a dual-threat quarterback,&lt;ref name=MDSmith14&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Michael David|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/06/21/vick-isnt-the-first-rushing-quarterback-but-he-is-the-best-for-now/|title=Vick isn’t the first rushing quarterback, but he is the best (for now)|publisher=''NBC Sports''|work=Pro Football Talk|date=June 21, 2014|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he led the [[Green Bay Packers]] in rushing in 3 seasons, and retired with 3,128 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nfl.packers.com/news/releases/2000/06/06-28b.html|title=Packer Hall of Famer Tobin Rote Dead at 72|publisher=''Green Bay Packers''|date=June 28, 2000|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Litsky|first=Frank|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/30/sports/tobin-rote-72-a-championship-quarterback-for-the-lions.html|title=Tobin Rote, 72, a Championship Quarterback for the Lions|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=June 30, 2000|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of [[2017 NFL season]], Rote still ranks 10th all time in rushing yards for a quarterback.&lt;ref name=Rotestats/&gt;

The next decade, however, saw [[Fran Tarkenton]] impact the game in both passing and running aspects. Tarkenton writes, "When I began my NFL career in 1961, I was a freak. The reason was simple: I played quarterback and I ran. There were no designed runs in our playbook, but I would scramble out of the pocket when a play broke down."&lt;ref name=Tarkenton13&gt;{{cite web|last=Tarkenton|first=Fran|url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_22379070/fran-tarkenton-1961-i-was-freak-today-running|title=Fran Tarkenton: 'In 1961, I was a freak.' Today, running quarterbacks embraced|publisher=''Twin Cities''|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkenton adds by describing the reaction to his scrambling at the time, "It was not a skill set that was embraced. Plenty of people mocked it, and the rest wrote it off."&lt;ref name=Tarkenton13/&gt; At the time of his retirement, Tarkenton was the all-time leader in rushing yards by a quarterback, with 3,674.&lt;ref name=Jones13&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Riley|url=http://sneakerreport.com/news/perf-sneaker-history-randall-cunningham-qb-rushing-record-nike/|title=Today in Performance Sneaker History: Randall Cunningham Sets QB Rushing Record in Nike Cleats|publisher=''Sneaker Report''|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Chicago Bears]] quarterback [[Bobby Douglass]] set the single-season rushing yards record for a quarterback, as he logged 968 yards.&lt;ref name=Yellon10&gt;{{cite web|last=Yellon|first=Al|url=http://chicago.sbnation.com/2010/8/31/1657421/bears-quarterback-controversy-jay-cutler-bobby-douglass|title=Bobby Douglass: A Bears Quarterback Who Was One Of A Kind|publisher=''SB Nation''|work=Chicago|date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass, however, was not considered a good passer, as his receivers complained his arm strength was, "too strong," as he often overthrew the ball.&lt;ref name=Yellon10/&gt; The Bears attempted to create wild schemes, before discovering his rushing ability, leading to his record-breaking 1972 season.&lt;ref name=Yellon10/&gt;

Another rare dual-threat quarterback that emerged in the 1970s was [[Steve Grogan]].  While playing college football for [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]], Grogan had rushed for a 100-yard game, and had over 500 yards in two seasons as a starter.  Drafted by the [[New England Patriots]] in 1975, Grogan scored 12 rushing touchdowns in the [[1976 New England Patriots season|1976 season]], a record for quarterbacks which stood for 35 years.  During the [[1978 New England Patriots season|1978 season]], Grogan ran for 539 yards, on a team which set the NFL record for total rushing yards (3,165), which still stands as of 2018.  Limited by injuries during the middle part of his career, Grogan would transition to a more traditional pocket-passer by the middle 1980s.

During the 1980s and 90s, dual-threat quarterbacks were more frequently seen than in previous decades. [[Randall Cunningham]] and [[Steve Young]] were the faces of rushing quarterbacks during this era. Cunningham was able to exceed Young in statistical regards. On October 18, 1992, Cunningham surpassed Tarkenton's record for career rushing yards by a quarterback.&lt;ref name=Jones13/&gt; Following the 2001 NFL season, Cunningham retired with a then-record 4,928 rushing yards. Despite Cunningham having more rushing yards, Young held the record for most career rushing touchdowns by a quarterback (43) until being surpassed by [[Cam Newton]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=LeBeau11&gt;{{cite web|last=LeBeau|first=James|url=http://www.craveonline.com/sports/articles/176896-top-5-rushing-quarterbacks-of-all-time|title=Top 5 Rushing Quarterbacks Of All Time|publisher=''CraveOnline''|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2662596-cam-newton-passes-steve-young-for-most-rushing-tds-by-a-qb-in-nfl-history|title=Cam Newton Passes Steve Young for Most Rushing TDs by a QB in NFL History|publisher=''Bleacher Report''|date=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to whether Young or Cunningham was the better rushing quarterback. ''[[CraveOnline]]'' writes that, although, "there may be two others [Vick and Cunningham] that hold an edge to Steve Young in amount of yards rushed, career wise, by a QB but make no mistake about it, if you are a QB that can run, then Young is who you want to emulate," adding that, Young, "had the rare gift of explosive speed combined with deadly accuracy."&lt;ref name=LeBeau11/&gt; As for Cunningham, [[Jeff Darlington]], an NFL Media reporter, writes, "True, Steve Young had legs that merited the respect of defenders. But Cunningham ... Cunningham was different. And today's quarterbacks know it."&lt;ref name=Darlington13&gt;{{cite web|last=Darlington|first=Jeff|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000154103/printable/randall-cunningham-at-50-reflections-on-career-new-qbs-more|title=Randall Cunningham at 50: Reflections on career, new QBs, more|publisher=''NFL.com''|date=March 26, 2013|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darlington adds to his point by referring to an anecdote from [[Robert Griffin III]], a 2010s rushing quarterback, in which Griffin III would watch Cunningham's highlights with his father.&lt;ref name=Darlington13/&gt; Griffin III elaborates, "We'd watch how well he moved in the pocket to avoid defenders and make plays -- not just with his legs, but with his arm. He was one of the first true game-changers the league saw."&lt;ref name=Darlington13/&gt;

Aside from Cunningham and Young, [[Steve McNair]] and [[Kordell Stewart]] were also considered dynamic running quarterbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/former-pittsburgh-steelers-quarterback-kordell-stewart-retires-at-39-053012|title=Ex-Steelers QB Kordell Stewart retires|publisher=''Fox Sports''|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LookbackMcNair&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titansonline.com/news/article-1/A-Look-Back-at-the-Career-of-Steve-McNair/7bafa73a-0a67-4b0b-847d-c74e278737fb|title=A Look Back at the Career of Steve McNair|publisher=''Tennessee Titans''|date=July 4, 2009|accessdate=December 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214075337/http://www.titansonline.com/news/article-1/a-look-back-at-the-career-of-steve-mcnair/7bafa73a-0a67-4b0b-847d-c74e278737fb|archive-date=2015-02-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michael Vick running, November 2006.jpg|thumb|Michael Vick running during his record 2006 season]]
As Young, Cunningham, and [[John Elway]], another dual-threat QB from the 1980s and 90s, all retired from 1998 to 2001, a new generation of mobile quarterbacks was ushered in. [[Donovan McNabb]] was drafted by the Eagles in 1999, beginning a successful quarterbacking career, in which his running ability was frequently identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolp|first=Curt|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/137504-donovan-mcnabb-the-greatest-philadelphia-eagle-quarterback-of-all-time|title=Donovan McNabb: The Greatest Philadelphia Eagle Quarterback of All Time?|publisher=''Bleacher Report''|date=March 11, 2009|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Michael|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2003/01/20/336208/back-in-stride-buoyed-by-donovan-mcnabbs-speedy-recovery-the-eagles-advanced-to-their-second-straight-nfc-championship-game|title=Back in Stride Buoyed by Donovan McNabb's speedy recovery, the Eagles advanced to their second straight NFC Championship Game|publisher=''Sports Illustrated''|work=The Vault|date=January 20, 2003|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his mobility, McNabb once joked, "I think you run a lot better when you don't want to be hit."&lt;ref name=Longman03&gt;{{cite web|last=Longman|first=Jere|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/08/sports/pro-football-mcnabb-starts-anew.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; McNabb Starts Anew|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=January 8, 2003|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After sustaining an injury in the 2003 season, there was speculation as to if McNabb would be able to retain his mobility, as [[Ray Buchanan]] stated, "We'd probably rather see McNabb, because he's not as mobile right now," which McNabb responded with, "According to everyone else I'm not mobile. I'll just let people continue to think that, and when the time comes, I'll make sure I showcase that a little bit."&lt;ref name=Longman03/&gt;

McNabb was also connected to [[Michael Vick]], one of the most prolific running quarterbacks in the history of the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spiegelman|first=Sam|url=http://highschoolsports.nola.com/news/article/8063056283384459619/new-york-jets-qb-michael-vick-to-visit-independence-stadium-in-shreveport-friday-site-says/|title=New York Jets QB Michael Vick to visit Independence Stadium in Shreveport Friday, site says|publisher=''The Times-Picayune|work=High School Sports|date=July 10, 2014|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending [[Syracuse University]], McNabb attempted to assist in the recruitment of [[Michael Vick]], and in addition to that, McNabb also mentored Vick about the speed of the professional level.&lt;ref name=Longman03/&gt; Vick also served as McNabb's backup in [[Philadelphia]] in 2009, later succeeding McNabb as the starter for the franchise.&lt;ref name=Rhoden10&gt;{{cite web|last=Rhoden|first=William C.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/sports/football/22rhoden.html?_r=0|title=An Unsung Role in Vick’s Success|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=November 22, 2010|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Vick was drafted first overall by [[Atlanta Falcons]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=Vrentas14&gt;{{cite web|last=Vrentas|first=Jenny|url=http://mmqb.si.com/2014/08/22/michael-vick-new-york-jets/|title=The Franchise Backup|publisher=''Sports Illustrated''|work=The MMQB|date=August 22, 2014|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick would go on to be a successful runner for the Falcons from 2001 to 2006.&lt;ref name=SIWire14&gt;{{cite web|author=SI Wire|url=https://www.si.com/sports/nfl/2014/06/23/jets-michael-vick-revolutionized-game|title=Jets quarterback Michael Vick: 'I revolutionized the game'|publisher=''Sports Illustrated''|date=June 23, 2014|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 14 games into his 2006 season, Vick broke Douglass' single-season rushing yards record by a quarterback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newberry|first=Paul|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/16/AR2006121601262.html|title=Vick Breaks 34-Year-Old Rushing Record|publisher=''Washington Post''|date=December 17, 2006|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Vick surpassed the 1,000 rushing yards milestone, becoming the first quarterback to reach the mark in a single season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2707909|title=Vick first NFL QB to rush for 1,000 yards in season|publisher=''ESPN''|date=December 24, 2006|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with a record 1,039 yards.&lt;ref name=Vickstats&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/V/VickMi00.htm|title=Michael Vick|publisher=''Sports-Reference''|work=Pro Football Reference|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick's mobility influenced future mobile quarterbacks; Jenny Vrentas of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writes, "Young players go out of their way to tell Vick that they were always him when they played ''[[Madden NFL|Madden]]'' growing up, and wore his [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] cleats."&lt;ref name=Vrentas14/&gt;

Carr is not considered a dual-threat quarterback, though his, "mindset, athleticism, pocket presence, quick release and strong arm" have all been praised by executives, coaches and analysts.&lt;ref name=Wesseling12814/&gt; [[Steve Young]], who ranks third all-time in rushing yards for a quarterback, was cited as believing scrambling away from pressure limits and stunts the development of a quarterback's [[passing pocket|pocket presence]].&lt;ref name=Wesseling12814/&gt;&lt;ref name=BranchNov14&gt;{{cite web|last=Branch|first=Eric|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/49ers/2014/11/21/steve-young-and-the-art-of-molding-a-mobile-quarterback/|title=Steve Young and the art of molding a mobile quarterback|publisher=''San Francisco Gate''|date=November 21, 2014|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the season, [[Bill Polian]], a former [[Indianapolis Colts]] president, stated, "What we're seeing this year is the incredible erosion of the running quarterback."&lt;ref name=PKing14/&gt; Obstacles such as high expectations and an increased potential for injury hindered the perception that mobile quarterbacks would become the dominant breed of the position.&lt;ref name=Boyer14&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyer|first=Zac|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/20/rg3-colin-kaepernick-cam-newton-russell-wilson-adj/?page=all|title=Pocket Change: NFL’s young, mobile QBs caught in adjustment process|publisher=''Washington Times''|date=November 20, 2014|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Kaepernick, Newton, and Griffin III struggled during the season, mobility in other quarterbacks was praised. Success in the passing game, while having mobility to extend the play, was regarded more highly than pure running athleticism in 2014. Aaron Rodgers' mobility, for example, was considered by one NFL.com writer to be critical to the Packers' offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patra|first=Kevin|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000422716/article/aaron-rodgers-hamstring-looked-good-in-workout|title=Aaron Rodgers (hamstring) 'looked good' in workout|publisher=''NFL.com''|work=Around the NFL|date=November 4, 2014|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New England Patriots]] head coach [[Bill Belichick]] praised Rodgers' mobility, stating, "he has a great ability to extend plays, either sliding in the pocket or at times scrambling outside the pocket."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Shalise Manza|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/11/26/bill-belichick-heaps-praise-packers-aaron-rodgers/j71RcHskxyyjXXMqVkETaO/story.html|title=Bill Belichick heaps praise on Packers QB Aaron Rodgers|publisher=''Boston Globe''|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luck's mobility was also acclaimed by another NFL head coach, [[Chip Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosher|first=Geoff|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nbc-yahoo-sports/chip-kelly-on-andrew-luck---he-s-in-that-manning--brady-category-181513044-nfl.html|title=Chip Kelly on Andrew Luck: 'He's in that Manning, Brady category'|publisher=''Yahoo!

==History in the Canadian Football League==
The width of the CFL's field at 65 yards and the length at 110 yards has allowed quarterbacks to find openings to run the ball, implementing improvisation by a quarterback as a beneficial trait in [[Canadian football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.13thman.com/cflvsnfl.html |title=CFL vs NFL |publisher=13thman.com |accessdate=January 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105203148/http://www.13thman.com/cflvsnfl.html |archivedate=January 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2190906-bo-levi-mitchell-shows-that-cfl-quarterbacks-are-not-wimps |title=Bo Levi Mitchell Shows That CFL Quarterbacks Are Not Wimps |publisher=bleacherreport.com |date=September 8, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015 |author=Flannery,Jim |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105204604/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2190906-bo-levi-mitchell-shows-that-cfl-quarterbacks-are-not-wimps |archivedate=January 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quarterback sneak]]s or other runs in short yardage situations tend to be successful as a result of the distance between the [[offensive line|offensive]] and [[defensive line]]s being one yard. [[Drew Tate]], a quarterback for the [[Calgary Stampeders]]', led the CFL in rushing touchdowns during the [[2014 CFL season|2014 season]] with ten scores as the backup to [[Bo Levi Mitchell]].&lt;ref name="cfl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/cfl-55-yard-line/backup-quarterback-drew-tate-plays-major-role-in-limited-time-in-stampeders--grey-cup-win-045955279.html |title=Backup quarterback Drew Tate plays major role in limited time in Stampeders' Grey Cup win |publisher=ca.sports.yahoo.com |date=November 30, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015 |author=Denomme, Ian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105210801/https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/cfl-55-yard-line/backup-quarterback-drew-tate-plays-major-role-in-limited-time-in-stampeders--grey-cup-win-045955279.html |archivedate=January 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfl.ca/statistics/league/stat/Rushing/year/2014/type/reg |title=Rushing - 2014 |publisher=cfl.ca |accessdate=January 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105210152/http://cfl.ca/statistics/league/stat/Rushing/year/2014/type/reg |archivedate=January 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was primarily used in short yardage situations due to his speed and running ability. Tate scored two one-yard rushing touchdowns in the Stampeders' 20-16 victory over the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] in the [[102nd Grey Cup]].&lt;ref name="cfl"/&gt;

A '''fly ball pitcher''' is a type of [[baseball pitcher]] who produces an above-average number of [[Batted ball|fly balls]], typically by keeping his [[fastball]] high up in the strike zone and relying on late movement to cause the batter to be unable to make solid contact. This designation is constructed around the [[ground ball fly ball ratio]], which measures how frequently a pitcher gets batters out on fly balls versus ground balls.

The downside of a fly ball pitcher is that, in a ballpark where the design tends to favor hitters over pitchers (an example being [[Yankee Stadium]]), a fly ball pitcher will tend to give up more home runs, resulting in a higher [[earned run average]].

Examples include pitchers [[Sid Fernandez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-08-11/sports/1995223063_1_sid-fernandez-orioles-camden-yards|title='Sid Sez': He likes the NL better|accessdate=2014-09-14|date=1995-08-11|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|author=Rosenthal, Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Lilly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/baseball/flb/story?id=5426501|title=Ted Lilly, Ryan Theriot to Dodgers|accessdate=2014-09-14|date=2010-07-31|publisher=[[ESPN]]|author=Cockcroft, Tristan H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Chris Young (pitcher)|Chris Young]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/fantasy-baseball-today/24610428/chris-young-breakout-or-fakeout|title=Chris Young: Breakout or fakeout?|accessdate=2014-09-14|date=2014-07-07|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|author=White, R.

'''Hong Kong Coliseum''' ({{zh|t=香港體育館}}), commonly known as the '''Hung Hom Coliseum''' (紅磡體育館, 紅館) is a multi-purpose [[indoor arena]], in [[Hung Hom Bay]], [[Kowloon]], [[Hong Kong]].

It was built by the [[Urban Council]] and inaugurated on 27 April 1983.

The coliseum has 12,500 seats, which is the second largest among indoor facilities in Hong Kong, only behind the 2005-opened [[AsiaWorld–Arena]].

It is now managed by the [[Leisure and Cultural Service Department]] of the [[Hong Kong Government]].

==Facilities==
The Hong Kong Coliseum consists of a big arena and a number of conference rooms.

===Arena===
[[Image:KCR Hung Hom station exterior (1).jpg|thumb|Hong Kong Coliseum, the inverted [[pyramid]]-like construction, right behind the [[Hung Hom (MTR)|MTR Hung Hom station]].]] 
The arena is rectangular with sides 41m each, with a [[concrete]] cement flooring. 

During performances, the floor may be covered with different 
overmounted floorings, such as demountable wooden flooring or various rubberized roll-outs, to facilitate the set-up of sporting equipment and the playing of different sporting activities such as [[futsal]], [[badminton]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]] and [[ice-skating]].

Moreover, the floor can hold strong pressures up to 1,800&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which cannot even be done by industrial buildings. This facilitates the set up of stages, platforms and sound equipments during [[concerts]] and other concert-like performances that requires an elevated stage and good PA systems.

Different technical equipments and a 4-side colour television projection system are also present to project the performer's image onto a screen, so that audience sitting around the rear side of the stadium can also see clearly.

===Conference Rooms===
The Hong Kong Coliseum offers both open and sheltered areas for holding conventions and conferences. The demountable open stage provides the arena with an excellent forum for public assemblies as well as staging live television broadcasts of opening ceremonies.

===Reception Room===
The reception room acts as an assistant facility for hirers of the arena and the conference rooms to accommodate visiting VIPs. The room can hold 60 persons.

==Purposes==
Even though its formal name in Chinese roughly translates to "Sports Arena", the [[Sports venue|venue]] often serves as a concert venue for popular singers. In addition, some [[university|universities]] rent it every year for [[congregation (university)|congregation]].  Some performances like [[ice-skating]] also choose Hong Kong Coliseum as their stages. It is also used every year from 1991 to hold the Miss Hong Kong Pageant, except for 2008.  It also hosts a part of the FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League (Before:[[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|FIVB World Grand Prix]]) for volleyball every year. On 3 June 2001, Irish vocal pop band [[Westlife]] held a concert for their [[Where Dreams Come True Tour]] supporting their album [[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]].

==Venue for 2009 East Asian Games==
The Hong Kong Coliseum was one of the venues for the 5th [[East Asian Games]] that was hosted in [[Hong Kong]] in 2009.

The '''Hungarian motorcycle Grand Prix''' was a motorcycling event that had been part of the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] World Championship.

Only two editions were held, and despite efforts to engineer a return in [[2010 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2010]] at the [[Balatonring]] circuit, the race did not take place and was replaced on the calendar by the [[Aragon motorcycle Grand Prix]].

'''Kazan Arena''' ({{lang-rus|«Казань Арена»|}}; {{lang-tt|Казан Арена}}) is a [[stadium]] in [[Kazan]], Russia.  It was completed in July 2013, and hosts [[association football|football]] matches, especially [[Rubin Kazan]]'s home games in the [[Russian Premier League]]. The stadium has the largest outside screen in the world. Its capacity is around 45,379.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kazanarena.com/stadium/about/|title=Футбольный стадион «Казань Арена»  - Казань Арена|website=kazanarena.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2813">A '''kickoff specialist''' ('''KOS''') is a seldom-used position in [[gridiron football]]. Kickoff specialists are members of the [[special teams]].  They are responsible for kicking the ball in the [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]].  These players tend to have a strong leg, often capable of making [[touchback]]s, and capable of keeping a ball in the bounds of the field of play but do not have the accuracy or technique required to be a full-time [[placekicker]] or [[Punter (American football)|punter]]. Some kickoff specialists later become full-time placekickers, while some are marginal placekickers who are soon out of football.

Due to modern roster restrictions (and a 2016 rule change discouraging the kicking of touchbacks by awarding the receiving team possession at the 25-yard line instead of the 20), most NFL teams do not elect to have a kickoff specialist, and instead use their placekickers (or, less often, punters) on kickoffs. The most recent NFL kickoff specialist was [[Jordan Gay]], who played the position for the [[Buffalo Bills]] under special teams coach [[Danny Crossman]] from 2014 to 2016. Prior to Gay's being claimed off waivers, Buffalo's kickoff duties were handled by [[Billy Cundiff]] and [[John Potter (American football)|John Potter]], who likewise were kickoff specialists during their time in Buffalo; for 2017, the team brought in former high school kicking phenom [[Austin Rehkow]] as a contender for the position but opted not to use a kickoff specialist that year. Other players who have spent at least some time as kickoff specialist for an NFL team since 2006 include [[Steven Hauschka]], [[Rhys Lloyd (American football)|Rhys Lloyd]], [[David Buehler]], and [[Todd Carter]]. As of the end of the 2014 NFL season, punters [[Thomas Morstead]], [[Matt Bosher]], [[Sam Martin (American football)|Sam Martin]], [[Pat McAfee]], and [[Michael Koenen]] handle kickoffs.There is at least one example of a backup quarterback serving as a kickoff specialist; in 1965, [[Bob Timberlake (American football)|Bob Timberlake]] did so for the [[New York Giants]]. In [[high school football]] and most other professional leagues, such as the [[Arena Football League]] and, until recent roster expansions, the [[Canadian Football League]], one kicker handles all three kicking positions. Even [[college football]] teams usually do not use kickoff specialists, despite the much larger rosters at that level; however, if an underclassman has a stronger leg than the upperclassman kicker, but is not yet ready to assume placekicker or punter duties, they will handle kickoff a while being the primary backup to the other positions.

The '''Kingdome''' (officially '''King County Multipurpose Domed Stadium'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=2527|title=Kingdome opens to a crowd of 54,000 on March 27, 1976|last=Macintosh|first=Heather|publisher=HistoryLink.org|accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Seattle]]'s [[SoDo, Seattle|SoDo]] neighborhood. Owned and operated by [[King County, Washington|King County]], the Kingdome opened in 1976 and was best known as the home stadium of the [[Seattle Seahawks]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the [[Seattle Mariners]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The stadium also served as both the home [[Association football|outdoor]] and [[indoor soccer|indoor]]&lt;ref&gt;http://davfal.powweb.com/SoundersIndoors.html{{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; venue for the [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|Seattle Sounders]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL) and hosted numerous amateur sporting events, concerts, and other events. The Kingdome measured 660 feet wide from its inside walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=24 years of Kingdome facts &amp; figures|url=http://your.kingcounty.gov/stadium/|website=kingcounty.gov|deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182351/http://your.kingcounty.gov/stadium/|archivedate=March 3, 2016|date=March 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of constructing a covered stadium for a [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] [[American football|football]] and/or [[baseball]] team was first proposed to Seattle officials in 1959. Voters rejected separate measures to approve [[government spending|public funding]] for such a stadium in 1960 and 1966, but the outcome was different in 1968; King County voters approved the issue of US$40 million in [[municipal bond]]s to construct the stadium. Construction began in 1972 and the stadium opened in 1976 as the home stadium of the Sounders and Seahawks. The Mariners moved in the following year, and the SuperSonics moved in the next year, only to move back to the [[Seattle Center Coliseum]] in 1985. The stadium hosted several major sports events, including the [[Soccer Bowl]] in August [[Soccer Bowl '76|1976]], the [[Pro Bowl]] in January 1977, the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] in July 1979, the [[NBA All-Star Game]] in [[1987 NBA All-Star Game|1987]], and the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] in [[1984 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1984]], [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]], and [[1995 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1995]].

During the 1990s, the Seahawks' and Mariners' respective ownership groups began to question the suitability of the Kingdome as a venue for each team, threatening to relocate unless new, publicly funded stadiums were built. At issue was the fact that neither team saw their shared tenancy as profitable, as well as the integrity of the stadium's roof as highlighted by the collapse of ceiling tiles onto the seating area before a scheduled Mariners game. As a result, public funding packages for new, purpose-built stadiums for the Mariners and Seahawks were approved in 1995 and 1997, respectively. The Mariners moved to [[Safeco Field]] midway through the 1999 season, and the Seahawks temporarily moved to [[Husky Stadium]] after the [[1999 NFL season|1999 season]]. The Kingdome was demolished by [[building implosion|implosion]] on March 26, 2000; the Seahawks' new stadium, Seahawks Stadium (now known as [[CenturyLink Field]]) was built on the site and opened in [[2002 Seattle Seahawks season|2002]].

King County paid off the bonds used to build and repair the Kingdome in 2015, 15 years after its demolition.&lt;ref name=debtretired&gt;{{cite news

==Concept and construction==
In 1959, Seattle [[restaurateur]] David L. Cohn wrote a letter to the [[Seattle City Council]] suggesting the city needed a covered stadium for a [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports]] franchise.&lt;ref name=HLCrowley&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowley|first=Walt|title=National Football League awards Seattle a franchise for future Seahawks on December 5, 1974|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=7633|publisher=HistoryLink.org|accessdate=March 15, 2011|date=February 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A domed stadium was thought to be a must due to Seattle's frequent rain. At the time, the city had [[Husky Stadium]] and [[Sick's Stadium]] for [[college football|collegiate]] [[American football|football]] and [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] [[baseball]], respectively, but both were deemed inadequate for a major league team.&lt;ref name=HLCrowley /&gt;

In 1960, the city council placed a $15 million [[municipal bond|bond]] issue measure on the ballot to fund construction of a stadium, but voters rejected it due to doubt the stadium could be built within that budget, and lack of a guarantee the city would have a team to play in the stadium.&lt;ref name=HLCrowley /&gt; By 1966, the [[National Football League]] and the [[American League]] were both considering granting the city an [[expansion team|expansion franchise]], and as a result the [[King County Council]] placed another bond issue measure on the ballot, which was also rejected by voters.&lt;ref name=HLCrowley /&gt;

In 1967, the American League granted Seattle an expansion franchise that would be known as the Seattle Pilots. The league clearly stated Sick's Stadium was not adequate as a major-league stadium, and stipulated that as a condition of being awarded the franchise, bonds had to be issued to fund construction of a domed stadium that had to be completed by 1970; additionally, the capacity at Sick's Stadium had to be expanded from 11,000 to 30,000 by [[Opening Day]] 1969, when the team was scheduled to begin playing. The Pilots were supposed to begin play in 1971 along with the [[Kansas City Royals]].  However, when [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Stuart Symington]] of [[Missouri]] got wind of those plans, he demanded both teams begin play in 1969. The American League had birthed the Royals and Pilots as a result of the [[Kansas City Athletics]] moving to [[Oakland]], and Symington would not accept the prospect of Kansas City waiting three years for baseball's return.

In February 1968, as part of the [[Forward Thrust]] group of [[municipal bond|bond]] propositions, King County voters approved the issue of $40 million in bonds to fund construction of the "King County Multipurpose Domed Stadium."&lt;ref name=HLCrowley/&gt; That year a committee considered over 100 sites throughout Seattle and King County for the stadium, and unanimously decided the best site would be on the grounds of [[Seattle Center]], site of the [[Century 21 Exposition|1962 World's Fair]]. Community members decried the idea, claiming the committee was influenced by special interest groups.&lt;ref name=HLMacIntosh&gt;{{cite web|last=MacIntosh|first=Heather|title=Kingdome: The Controversial Birth of a Seattle Icon (1959–1976)|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=2164|publisher=HistoryLink.org|accessdate=March 15, 2011|date=March 1, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pilots began play as planned in [[1969 Seattle Pilots season|1969]], but Sick's Stadium proved to be a problematic venue for fans, media, and visiting players alike, and it soon became apparent that it was inadequate even for temporary use. The Pilots only drew 677,000 fans that season, not nearly enough to break even, and a petition by stadium opponents brought the Sick's Stadium project to a halt. The Pilots' ownership group ran out of money by the end of the season, and with the stadium plans in limbo, the team was forced to declare [[bankruptcy]].  Despite efforts by Seattle-area businessmen to buy the team as well as an attempt to keep the team in Seattle through the court system, the Pilots were sold to [[Milwaukee]] businessman [[Bud Selig]], who relocated the team to Wisconsin and renamed it the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] a week before the start of the [[1970 Milwaukee Brewers season|1970 season]].

The push to build the domed stadium continued despite the lack of a major league sports team to occupy it. In May 1970 voters rejected the proposal to build the stadium at Seattle Center.&lt;ref name=HLMacIntosh/&gt;&lt;ref name=vinsettrp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ipApAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=busDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4838%2C1677344 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |agency=Associated Press |title=Voters in Seattle reject proposals |date=May 20, 1970 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 to 1972, the commission studied the feasibility and economic impact of building the stadium on King Street adjacent to [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]] and the [[International District, Seattle|International District]]—a site that ranked at the bottom when the commission originally narrowed the field of possible sites in 1968.&lt;ref name=HLMacIntosh/&gt; This drew sharp opposition primarily from the International District community, which feared the impact of the stadium on neighborhood businesses located east of the site. The King Street site was approved 8–1 by the county council in late 1971,&lt;ref name=sokinse&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=msleAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eDIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4337%2C134361 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho)|agency=Associated Press |title=Stadium okehed inside Seattle |date=December 1, 1971 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the groundbreaking ceremony in 1972 was held on November 2.&lt;ref name=phgbcer&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZoJfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lTAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6088%2C850157 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho)|agency=Associated Press |title=Protesters halt groundbreaking at Seattle domed stadium site |date=November 3, 1972 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several protesters attended the ceremony, disrupted the speakers, and at one point threw mud balls at them.&lt;ref name=HLMacIntosh/&gt;&lt;ref name=phgbcer/&gt;

On December 5, 1974, the NFL awarded Seattle an expansion franchise to occupy the new stadium;&lt;ref name=nfselgrp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e5JYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fPgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4795%2C1781066 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=NFL selects Seattle group |date=December 5, 1974 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team was later named the [[Seattle Seahawks]].&lt;ref name=HLCrowley/&gt; Construction lasted another two years, and the stadium held an opening ceremony on March 27, 1976.&lt;ref name=HLMacIntosh/&gt; It hosted its first professional sporting event two weeks later on April 9, an exhibition [[Association football|soccer]] game between the [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|Seattle Sounders]] and [[New York Cosmos (1971–85)|New York Cosmos]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|NASL]].

==Football==
===Seattle Seahawks===
The expansion [[Seattle Seahawks]] of the NFL played their first game ever on August 1, [[1976 Seattle Seahawks season|1976]], a preseason game against the [[1976 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] at the Kingdome.&lt;ref name=shlog&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tLsSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2PgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2818%2C74470 |newspaper=Seattle Daily Chronicle |agency=Associated Press |last=Baker |first=Tony |title=Seahawks lose opening game |date=August 2, 1976 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seahawks' first regular season game was against the [[1976 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]] at the Kingdome on September 12. At the end of that season, the venue hosted the [[1977 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]], the NFL's all-star game, on January 17, 1977.&lt;ref name=pbopsidt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DvpLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6vgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5989%2C218977 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |agency= |title=Pro battle of pride set in Dome tonight |date=January 17, 1977 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seahawks hosted [[Monday Night Football]] games at the Kingdome twelve times in its history and were 9-3 in those games. The Seahawks and the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders played five Monday Night games in the Dome in the 1980s with Seattle holding a 3-2 edge including a 37-0 blowout victory in 1986.&lt;ref name="pro-football-reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/|title=Seattle Seahawks Team Encyclopedia - Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, in [[1987 NFL season|1987]], [[Bo Jackson]] of the [[1987 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] rushed for 221 yards, the most ever on MNF, and scored 2 touchdowns. One of his scores was a 91-yard touchdown and the other was a historic plowing into [[1987 Seattle Seahawks season|Seahawks]] high-profile rookie linebacker [[Brian Bosworth|Brian "The Boz" Bosworth]].

The Kingdome's final NFL game was played on January 9, [[1999 Seattle Seahawks season|2000]], a first-round playoff loss to the [[1999 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jt-sw.com/football/pro/results.nsf/Teams/1999-sea|title=1999 Seattle Seahawks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dolphins scored a fourth-quarter touchdown to win 20-17; it was the last NFL victory for [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[quarterback]] [[Dan Marino]] and head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]. It was also the last event the Kingdome ever hosted before its implosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisgreatgame.com/ballparks-kingdome.html |title=The Ballparks: Seattle Kingdome |publisher=This Great Game |access-date=October 1, 2018 |quote=Shortly after the Kingdome’s final event—a Seahawks playoff game on January 9, 2000—the same blueprints used to erect the stadium were dusted off to give demolition crews a good idea of how to bring it down.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seahawks had an overall record of 104-84 ({{winning percentage|104|84}}) in the Kingdome, and were 2-1 in the postseason.&lt;ref name="pro-football-reference.com"/&gt;

===Amateur===
====College====
The first [[college football]] game played in the Kingdome was also in 1976, between the [[1976 Washington State Cougars football team|Washington State Cougars]] and [[1976 USC Trojans football team|USC Trojans]] on October 9.&lt;ref name=tkidb&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FvQjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nu0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2977%2C3490770 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington)|last=Missildine |first=Harry |title=Thompson's key in 'Dome Bowl' |date=October 9, 1976 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With 37,268 in attendance, USC running back [[Ricky Bell (running back)|Ricky Bell]] rushed for 346 yards and set the [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-8]] single-game rushing record, &lt;!--later broken by [[Reuben Mayes]] of Washington State;--&gt; and the Trojans won by nine points, {{nowrap|23–14.&lt;ref name=brftfsy&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MOVVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4OADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5045%2C2225785 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon)|agency=Associated Press |title=Bell runs for 346 yards as USC slips Cougars |date=October 10, 1976 |page=6C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ctw&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F_QjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nu0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5856%2C4249851 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review|location=(Spokane, Washington)|last=Missildine |first=Harry |title=Cougs tough, short; UI wins |date=October 10, 1976 |page=1, sports }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perry |first=Jim |url=http://usctrojans.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/091201aab.html |title = &lt;nowiki&gt;Ricky Bell: 'The Bulldog'&lt;/nowiki&gt; |accessdate = November 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Puget Sound Loggers|University of Puget Sound Loggers]]' and [[Pacific Lutheran University]] Lutes' success in bringing large crowds to the newly-opened [[Tacoma Dome]] in 1983, 1984, and 1985, enticed the Kingdome to move the rivalry game for the Totem Pole Trophy to Seattle.  It was played in the Kingdome for two years – 1986 and 1987.  While it was relatively successful for small college football, organizers realized that they would never get the 50,000 needed to fill the Kingdome and the game returned to Tacoma.

====High school====
The stadium also hosted the [[Washington Interscholastic Activities Association|WIAA]] [[high school football]] state championships in an event called the '''King Bowl''' from 1976 through 1994; the title games were moved to the [[Tacoma Dome]] in nearby Tacoma in 1995.&lt;ref name=wmgttac&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4ERWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7OoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2754%2C6073305 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |agency=Associated Press |title=Washington moves games to Tacoma |date=May 25, 1995 |page=2D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tdplbruq&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=82FWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XfEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6649%2C4266266 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |last=Trimmer |first=Dave |title=Tacoma Dome plan brings up questions about sites of semis |date=June 15, 1995 |page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaa.com/ardisplay.aspx?ID=472|title=WIAA - Washington Interscholastic Activities Association|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
 
The Seattle and Tacoma Police Departments played a yearly game named the ''[[Bacon Bowl]]'' to raise money for charity from 1979 to 1999; it continued to be played at Husky Stadium, then CenturyLink Field until it was discontinued in 2005.

==Baseball==
Shortly after the Pilots' departure for Milwaukee, the city of Seattle, King County, and the state of Washington sued the [[American League]], claiming a [[breach of contract]]. The league agreed to grant Seattle another franchise in exchange for dropping the lawsuit, and the team that would later be known as the [[Seattle Mariners]] was born. The Mariners held their first game at the Kingdome in [[1977 Seattle Mariners season|1977]] against the [[1977 California Angels season|California Angels]] on April 6.

The Kingdome was somewhat problematic as a baseball venue: foul territory was quite large, outfield dimensions were quite small, and seating areas were set back far from the playing field, with seats in the upper deck as far as {{convert|617|ft}} from home plate.&lt;ref name="Storied"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Curt|authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|year=2001|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York City|isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the problem was that the Kingdome was not a multipurpose stadium in the truest sense. Instead, it was built as a football stadium that could convert into a baseball stadium. For instance, most fans in the outfield seats on the 300 level were unable to see parts of right and center field; these areas were not part of the football playing field.

[[File:10 inside kindome.jpg|thumb|left|The inside of the Kingdome during a Mariners game, ca 1996]]
For most of the Mariners' first 18 years, their poor play (they did not have a winning season until [[1991 Seattle Mariners season|1991]]) combined with the Kingdome's design, led to poor attendance. Some writers and fans called it "the Tomb" (because of its gray concrete and lack of noise) and "[[Puget Sound|Puget]] Puke."&lt;ref name="Storied"/&gt; After their inaugural home opener, the Mariners didn't have another sellout until [[1990 Seattle Mariners season|1990]]. At one point the Mariners covered seats in the upper decks in right and right-center with a tarp in order to make the stadium feel "less empty". Additionally, the Kingdome's acoustics created problems for stadium announcers, who had to deal with significant echo issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1995mariners.com/2009/03/13/a-conversation-with-mariners-announcer-tom-hutyler/ |title=A Conversation With Mariners Announcer Tom Hutyler |website=1995mariners.com |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618075830/http://1995mariners.com/2009/03/13/a-conversation-with-mariners-announcer-tom-hutyler/ |archivedate=June 18, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the team's fortunes began to change in the mid&amp;ndash;1990s and they began drawing larger crowds, especially in the post-season, the noise created an electric atmosphere and gave the home team a distinct advantage similar to the effect on football games.

Despite its cavernous interior, the Kingdome's field dimensions were relatively small. It had a reputation as a hitter's park, especially in the 1990s when [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]], [[Edgar Martínez]], [[Jay Buhner]], [[Alex Rodriguez]] and other sluggers played there.

The large number of in-play objects—speakers, roof support wires and streamers—contributed to an "arena baseball" feel. The Kingdome was somewhat improved in [[1982 Seattle Mariners season|1982]] with the addition of a {{convert|23|ft|m|sing=on}} wall in right field nicknamed the "Walla Walla" (after [[Walla Walla, Washington]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectballpark.org/history/al/kingdome.html |title=Kingdome |publisher=Projectballpark.org |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; " featuring a new out-of-town scoreboard, which was in play. In [[1990 Seattle Mariners season|1990]] and [[1991 Seattle Mariners season|1991]], the moving of home plate closer to the backstop, the addition of box seats down the third base line and the removal of a few rows of seats in left field reduced foul territory and increased outfield dimensions.

The most noteworthy baseball game in the Kingdome's history took place on October 8, 1995, when the [[1995 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] defeated the [[1995 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] 6&amp;ndash;5 in 11 innings in the [[List of baseball jargon (R)#rubber game|rubber game]] of the [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] in front of 57,411 raucous fans. In the bottom of the 11th, Martinez [[The Double (Seattle Mariners)|doubled to left]], sending [[Joey Cora]] and Griffey home with the winning runs and vaulting the Mariners into the [[1995 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] for the first time in franchise history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B10080SEA1995.htm|title=Retrosheet Boxscore: Seattle Mariners 6, New York Yankees 5|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1996 Seattle Mariners season|1996]], a game between the Mariners and the [[1996 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] on May 2 in the Kingdome was suspended in the home half of the seventh inning because of a minor [[earthquake]]. The earthquake occurred during a pitching change as Indians' [[pitcher]] [[Orel Hershiser]] was walking off the mound following a home run by [[Edgar Martínez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Saperstein |first = Aliya |title = Not even a quake could crack the Dome |accessdate = November 9, 2007 |publisher = Seattle Post-Intelligencer |url = http://www.seattlepi.com/kingdome/quak.shtml }} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After an inspection by engineers, the game was continued the next evening, resulting in a win for the Indians.

In 1989, Griffey Jr., in his first-ever plate appearance at the Kingdome on April 10, hit a home run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SEA/SEA198904100.shtml|title=Chicago White Sox at Seattle Mariners Box Score, April 10, 1989 - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, 1999, Griffey Jr. hit the last home run ever at the Kingdome against the Texas Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SEA/SEA199906270.shtml|title=Texas Rangers at Seattle Mariners Box Score, June 27, 1999 - Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basketball==
===Seattle SuperSonics===
Besides the Mariners and Seahawks, the stadium also hosted the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Seattle SuperSonics]] for a number of years. The 1978&amp;ndash;79 season was the first year the  Sonics played in the Kingdome on a full-time basis (they had played a few games there over the previous two seasons) with the addition of portable stadium seating added onto the floor of the arena as well as additional scoreboards and a new basketball court. [[Fred Brown (basketball)|Fred Brown]] and [[Gus Williams (basketball)|Gus Williams]] led the team that year to their first and only championship. At the time it was known in the NBA for being the noisiest arena for basketball as well as the largest crowds with stadium vendor Bill the Beerman taking the duties as cheerleader. In the 1979&amp;ndash;80 season, the SuperSonics set an NBA record average attendance of 21,725 fans per game (since broken).&lt;ref name=richardson&gt;{{Cite news | last = Richardson | first = Kenneth | title = Sonics Going Dome Tonight: Hawks in Rare Kingdome Visit | newspaper = [[The Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date = January 27, 1989 | url = http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1989/8901030278.asp | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978, the SuperSonics set the NBA single-game playoff attendance record at 39,457, and then again in 1980 at 40,172 (also, since broken). The Kingdome regular season, single-game attendance record of 38,067 was set in 1991.&lt;ref name=apnytimes&gt;{{Cite news | title = Jordan Finds a Groove In Time to Edge Sonics  | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date = November 24, 1991 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D61431F937A15752C1A967958260 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SuperSonics hosted the [[1987 NBA All-Star Game]] there.

Logistics would be a problem during the playoffs, as the Mariners (the Kingdome's primary tenants) objected to letting the Sonics play there in the spring. Therefore, the Sonics would only play home playoff games at the Kingdome while the Mariners were on the road, with most of the games played at [[Seattle Center Coliseum]], and a few games had to be played at [[Hec Edmundson Pavilion]] at the [[University of Washington]].

Sonics owner Barry Ackerley made the decision to leave the Kingdome and to build a new basketball arena. Plans were underway to build a new arena south of the Kingdome (where [[Safeco Field]] stands today) to be called Ackerley Arena, but after financing fell through, the team went back to the Coliseum for the 1985-86 season, playing occasionally at the Kingdome over the next few years. The Coliseum was eventually rebuilt as [[KeyArena]], reopening for the 1995–96 season. The Sonics played there until the team was purchased and relocated by [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Oklahoma City]] businessman Clayton "Clay" Bennett before the 2008–09 season.

===College===
The [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] of [[college basketball]] was held three times at the Kingdome – in [[1984 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1984]], when [[Georgetown Hoyas basketball|Georgetown]] defeated [[Houston Cougars basketball|Houston]], in [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]] when [[Michigan Wolverines basketball|Michigan]] beat [[Seton Hall University|Seton Hall]] in overtime, and in [[1995 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1995]] when [[UCLA Bruins basketball|UCLA]] won their first championship since the retirement of coach [[John Wooden]] 20 years earlier in 1975, defeating [[Arkansas Razorbacks basketball|Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/la-sp-ucla-1995-champs-20150316-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sports and entertainment==

===Soccer===
The Kingdome's first sporting event was a 1976 game between the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|NASL]]'s [[New York Cosmos (1971–85)|New York Cosmos]] and [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|Seattle Sounders]] on April 25, with 58,128 fans in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Keefe |first=Vincent |date=April 10, 1976 |title=The King (Pele) stars in Kingdome |page=D1 |newspaper=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdome hosted [[Soccer Bowl '76]] between the [[Minnesota Kicks]] and the [[Toronto Metros-Croatia]] on August 28, 1976.

The Kingdome hosted the [[1984 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship]] Final between Clemson University, coached by Dr. [[I. M. Ibrahim]], and defending national champions Indiana University headed by Coach [[Jerry Yeagley]].  Clemson University won in regulation bringing home its first national championship in soccer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=657787&amp;SPID=103704&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=28500&amp;ATCLID=205527849|title=1984 National Championship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-star festivities===
The Kingdome hosted the [[Pro Bowl|NFL Pro Bowl]] in [[1977 NFL season|1977]], the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] in 1979, and the [[1987 NBA All-Star Game]], making it the only venue that has hosted all star games for three major sports leagues.

===Concerts===
Numerous rock concerts were held in the venue, despite significant echo and sound delay problems attributable to the structure's cavernous size.

==Final years==
===Relocation threats===
By the 1990s, the stadium's suitability as an NFL and MLB venue came into doubt. Neither the Seahawks' nor the Mariners' respective ownership groups saw the shared stadium arrangement as economically feasible.&lt;ref name=HLCrowley/&gt; After several years of threats to relocate the Mariners due to poor attendance and revenue, owner [[Jeff Smulyan]] sold the team to an ownership group led by [[Nintendo]] president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] in 1992. Almost immediately, the new ownership group began campaigning with local and state governments to secure public funding for a new baseball-only stadium. In March 1994, King County Executive [[Gary Locke]] appointed a task force to study the need for a baseball-only stadium.

===1994 ceiling collapse===
The Kingdome's roof had been problematic from the beginning. Leaks were discovered in the roof two months before the stadium opened, and several attempts at repairs made the situation worse and/or had to be undone.&lt;ref name="SeaTimes19940828"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940828&amp;slug=1927603|title=Years Of Fixes Turned Leaky Kingdome Roof Into Sodden Disaster|last=Nalder|first=Eric|author2=Guillen, Tomas |date=August 28, 1994|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the county decided to strip off the outer roof coating and replace it with a special coating. [[Abrasive blasting|Sandblasting]] failed to strip the old roof material off, and the contractor changed its method to [[pressure washer|pressure washing]]. This pressure-washing resulted in water seepage through the roof, and on July 19, 1994, four {{convert|26|lb|kg|adj=on}}, waterlogged acoustic ceiling tiles fell into the seating area. The tiles fell while the Mariners were on the field preparing for a scheduled game against the [[Baltimore Orioles]], a half-hour before the gates were to open for fans to enter the stadium.&lt;ref name="SeaTimes19940828" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SeaTimes20010719"&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2001982925_tile19x.html "Ten Years After The Kingdome Tiles Fell."], ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', July 19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Kingdome was closed for repairs.

The Mariners were forced to play the last 20 games of the 1994 season on the road after the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]] vetoed playing the "home" games at [[Cheney Stadium]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[BC Place Stadium]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], or some neutral site, as the union believed its members should only play in major-league venues.&lt;ref name="SeaTimes20010719" /&gt; The extended road trip could have lasted over two months, but was shortened due to the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike]], which began on August 12 and ended up cancelling the remainder of the 1994 MLB season and delaying the start of the 1995 season.&lt;ref name="SeaTimes20010719" /&gt; The Seahawks had to play both preseason games and the first three regular-season home games of the [[1994 NFL season|1994]] regular season at nearby [[Husky Stadium]].

The Kingdome held a reopening ceremony the weekend of November 4–6, 1994, which culminated with the Seahawks returning to the stadium for a regular-season game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].&lt;ref name="SeaTimes19941103"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19941103&amp;slug=1939516|title=Dome To Reopen With Repair Budget In Red|last=Schaefer|first=David|date=November 3, 1994|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repairing the roof ultimately cost US$51 million and two construction workers lost their lives in a crane accident during the repair. The incident also motivated plans to replace the stadium.&lt;ref name="SeaTimes20010719" /&gt;

===Replacement===
On September 19, 1995, King County voters defeated a ballot measure that would have funded the construction of a new baseball-only stadium for the Mariners. However, the following month, the Mariners made it to the MLB postseason for the first time, and defeated the [[New York Yankees]] in the decisive 5th game of the [[1995 American League Division Series|1995 ALDS]] on the heels of a walk-off [[The Double (Seattle Mariners)|game-winning double]] hit by [[Edgar Martínez]]. The Mariners' postseason run demonstrated that there was a fan base in Seattle that wanted the team to stay in town, and as a result, the [[Washington State Legislature]] approved a separate funding package for a new stadium.

In January 1996, Seahawks owner [[Ken Behring]] announced he was moving the team to Los Angeles and the team would play at [[Anaheim Stadium]], which had recently been vacated as a football venue when the [[Los Angeles Rams]] moved to [[St. Louis]]. His rationale for the decision included unfounded safety concerns surrounding the seismic stability of the Kingdome. Behring went so far as to relocate team headquarters to [[Anaheim, California]], but his plans were defeated when lawyers found out that the Seahawks could not break their lease on the Kingdome until 2005. As a result, Behring tried to sell the team. He found a potential buyer in [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]], who stipulated that a new publicly funded stadium had to be built as a condition of his purchase of the team. Allen funded a special election held on June 17, 1997, that featured a measure that would allocate public funding for a new stadium for the Seahawks to be built on the Kingdome site. The measure passed, Allen officially purchased the team, and the Kingdome's fate was sealed.

The Mariners played their final game in the Kingdome to a sold-out crowd on June 27, 1999, and played their first game at their new home, [[Safeco Field]], on July 15, nearly 3 weeks later. The Seahawks, meanwhile, temporarily relocated to [[Husky Stadium]] following the 1999 season. While the Kingdome was demolished, their new stadium, [[CenturyLink Field|Seahawks Stadium]], was being built on the Kingdome's footprint, and opened on time for the 2002 NFL season.

===Demolition===

==Successors==

Two separate facilities replaced the Kingdome. [[Safeco Field]], a purpose-built baseball park for the Seattle Mariners, broke ground in 1997 on a site located adjacent to the Kingdome, across Royal Brougham Way, and opened in 1999. [[CenturyLink Field]], a multipurpose stadium built primarily for the Seattle Seahawks was built on the Kingdome's former site beginning after the demolition of the Kingdome in 2000. CenturyLink Field (previously known as Seahawks Stadium and Qwest Field) has been the home field of the Seattle Seahawks since it opened in 2002, and has been home field for the [[Seattle Sounders FC]] of [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] since 2009.

==In popular culture==
The Kingdome made an appearance in the 2007 RTS game ''[[World in Conflict|World In Conflict]]'', in which the Kingdome was destroyed by Soviet artillery during the Soviet invasion of Seattle.

In 1978 the Kingdome served the backdrop for a rescue in the Emergency! TV movie "Most Deadly Passage", featuring work of Seattle Medic One paramedics.

Also mentioned in Full House episode "Crushed" Season 5 Episode 6 by "Tommy Page."

The Kingdome is mentioned in a 1998 episode of the Seattle-set sitcom ''[[Frasier]]''.  In Season 6 Episode 6, "[[Frasier (season 6)#Episodes|Secret Admirer]]," Martin describes Daphne's frustrating driving that repeatedly takes them right into various traffic delays: "So then Daphne takes a left on Madison.  Bumper to bumper all the way to Pike.  Then a right on Pike.  And what do you know?  King Dome [sic] traffic!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kacl780.net/frasier/transcripts/season_6/episode_6/secret_admirer.html Transcript of Frasier Season 6 Episode 6].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdome is mentioned in the Foo Fighters song ‘New Way Home’ featured on the 1997 album ‘The Colour and the Shape'

Playstation's Gran Turismo Racing series featured the Kingdome in the Seattle Circuit race track, a street circuit based on the roads of Seattle. Seattle Circuit is featured in Gran Turismo 2, Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec, Gran Turismo 4,Tourist Trophy and Gran Turismo PSP. 
(In GT3, GT4, TT, and GT PSP you race between the Kingdome and Safeco field towards the end of a lap, in GT2 you race between the Kingdome and a series of grandstands because the real Safeco field was not yet completed while GT2 was being developed.)

The '''LG Cup 1999–2000''' was a four team cricket [[One Day International|ODI]] tournament held in Kenya. After the [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] stage, the final took place between [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] and [[Indian cricket team|India]]. Despite only making his international debut in India's opening game of the tournament, [[Vijay Bhardwaj]] won the man of the series award. The tournament was dominated by the bowlers, with the best bowling figures being [[Sunil Joshi|Sunil Joshi's]] 5 wickets for 6 runs off his full 10 overs, one of the most economical figures of all time.[http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/ODIS/BOWLING/ODI_BOWL_BEST_INNS_ECON.html]
With the bat, no player passed 50 twice in the series and only Ganguly and [[Lance Klusener]] made hundreds.

==Final==

The final took place between South Africa and India at the [[Nairobi Gymkhana Club|Gymkhana Club Ground]] in Nairobi. India won the toss and sent the South African into bat. They made 235 from their 50 overs with an innings of 84 from [[Herschelle Gibbs]] being the highest. Vijay Bharadwaj took 3 wickets but perhaps the best spell came from [[Venkatesh Prasad]] who bowled 5 maidens in his 10 overs. His namesake, [[Mannava Prasad]] contributed 63 runs in their chase but it wasn't enough as [[Jacques Kallis]] took the final wicket to give the South Africans a 26 run victory.

In [[association football]] (soccer), a '''long ball''' is an attempt to move the ball a long distance down the field via one long aerial kick from either a goalkeeper or a defender directly to an attacking player, with the ball generally bypassing the midfield. Rather than arrive at the feet of the receiving attacking player, the attacker is expected to challenge the opposing defence in the air, with other attacking players and midfielders arriving to try and take possession of the ball if it breaks loose. In Continental Europe the style is called '''kick and rush'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fifield|first=Dominic|title=World Cup 2010: Franz Beckenbauer attacks England's 'kick and rush'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/15/world-cup-franz-beckenbauer-england|work=The Guardian|accessdate=27 June 2012|location=London|date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all lengthy passes are considered long ball play, and long but precise passes towards a particular teammate may not fit the description. Long-ball play is generally characterised by the relatively aimless nature of the kick upfield, with the ball simply being 'hoofed' high in the air towards the general location of the forwards, who, given the length of time the ball is in the air, will have time to arrive at the position where the ball will drop.

==Statistical basis==
The 'long ball theory' was first discussed by a retired RAF Wing Commander—[[Charles Reep]]—in the 1950s in [[England]]. Reep was an amateur statistician and analyzed not only the number of passes that led to a goal, but also the field positions where those passes originated. Reep documented his findings in various publications including match day programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Grim Reep|work= [[When Saturday Comes]] |date=|url= http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/2502/29/ |accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reep developed a number of concepts describing effective long ball play. 'Gulleys' refer to the optimum position between the corner flag and six yard box from which to make the final pass into the penalty box; the '3-pass optimization rule' emerges from the fact that a higher percentage of goals are scored in moves involving only three passes prior to the shot; the '9 shots per goal' maxim, stating that on average, only one goal is scored for every nine shots; and the 'twelve point three yard' position, which is the mean distance from the goal that all goals are scored. The long-ball game is also advocated in such books '' The Winning Formula: The Football Association Soccer Skills and Tactics'', by [[Charles Hughes (football coach)|Charles Hughes]], which demonstrates with statistics that a majority of goals are scored within 5 passes of the ball.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hughes, The Winning Formula: The Football Association Soccer Skills and Tactics, HarperCollins: 1990. 0001979620&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Wilson (journalist/author)|Jonathan Wilson]] criticises Reep's statistical analysis as heavily flawed. The 'three pass optimum', for example, comes in for particular criticism. Wilson notes that while Reep's statistics showed that a higher percentage of goals were scored in moves involving three passes, they also show that three pass moves account for a higher percentage of all shots.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jonathan. 2008. ''Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics.'' Orion, {{ISBN|0-7528-8995-8}}. p140.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the percentage of shots for which three-pass or fewer account is higher than the percentage of goals for which they account, implying that moves involving more passes have a higher ratio of success. Furthermore, Reep's own statistics show that this trend becomes stronger at higher levels of football, indicating that moves with a greater number of passes become more effective amongst higher quality teams. Reep also fails to distinguish statistically between three-pass moves that emerge from long balls and those that emerge from other sources such as attacking [[Direct free kick|free kick]]s or successful [[tackle (association football)|tackles]] in the opponent's half.

==Effectiveness==
The long ball strategy has often been criticized as a method that has held back the [[England national football team]]. Hughes became the head of coaching at the [[The Football Association|FA]] in the 1990s, and used this position to promote his theory of long ball, which followed on from the work of Reep. Hughes and those who defend the tactic claim that time and time again, teams playing direct play have more success.&lt;ref name="Hadfield"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-learning-to-live-with-footballs-bogeyman-dave-hadfield-lived-next-door-to-charles-hughes--and-survived-1376088.html Football: Learning to live with football's bogeyman: Dave Hadfield lived next door to Charles Hughes - and survived] Hadfield, David. ''[[The Independent]]''. 13-08-94, Accessed 08-06-10&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], for example, the winning [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] team scored the most goals from three or fewer passes, while the team to score from a move involving the most passes - the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] - were eliminated in the second round.&lt;ref name="Hadfield" /&gt; While multi-pass moves such as those by Brazil against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup Final]] or [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] versus [[Serbia and Montenegro]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] are widely lauded as brilliant examples of football,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2006/06/design_architec.html Design. Architecture. Football] City of Sound Blog. 20-06-06. Accessed 08-10-06&lt;/ref&gt; it is partially the rareness of success for such long moves that results in their appreciation and makes them ineffective tactics to attempt to replicate.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

It is however used by teams desperate to score a goal before the end of a match, though this is probably as much due to the lack of time for a gradual build-up as it is for its perceived effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.express.co.uk/ourcomments/view/22706 | first = Jim | last = Holden | title = Why England Need Coaching Genius|website=Express.co.uk|accessdate=2016-07-28 | date = 21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long ball technique is also effective in lower level football matches since players lack skill to work as a team and pass the ball accurately up the field. A long ball is a quick counterattacking move and with a fast striker may produce multiple goals.

==Examples==
[[Image:Bergkampscore3.jpg|right|thumb|220|Bergkamp's goal against Argentina]]
The long ball is sometimes criticized as being used by weaker teams with less tactical skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Swann |url=http://theconversation.com/what-tiki-taka-football-can-teach-us-about-boosting-innovation-45853 |title=What tiki-taka football can teach us about boosting innovation |publisher=Theconversation.com |date=10 August 2015 |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the hands of mediocre teams, or at the lower youth leagues this might be so. Analysis of its implementation at world-class levels however, shows that effective use of long-ball techniques can be found in numerous competitive World Cup or championship club teams. It can be used as a counterattacking style, or as a daring through pass when opportunities open up during a game. The long ball requires top level skill to implement correctly. Mere passing is not the only variable—intelligent running into space, good dribbling and crisp finishing are also required.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Jones and Pat Welton, Soccer Skills and Tactics, Crown Publishers, 1979, p. 157–159&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best uses of the long-ball was [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] striker [[Dennis Bergkamp]]'s goal against Argentina in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. Dutch defender [[Frank de Boer]] initiated the move from near the middle of the field, with a long pass that curled over 7 opposing players. Bergkamp controlled the difficult ball, spun past a defender and smashed it home. The example illustrates the power of the long-ball style but also that it is more than simply pumping the ball upfield. Only Bergkamp's excellent skills were able to take advantage of the de Boer's outstanding, and daring pass. As such, it emphasizes that football is a game requiring not only a comprehensive package of individual skills, but imagination and creativity as well. Both are present in the long-ball style.

Contemporary teams like [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] have also demonstrated the viability of the long-ball approach when executed with skill, precision and creativity by top players. Norway played a characteristic 4-5-1 formation in the 1990s and early 21st century. The left back would often hit long crosses to [[Jostein Flo]], who in turn would head the ball to either one of the central midfielders or to the striker. This was known as the Flo Pass, and the Norwegian national team garnered much criticism for its perceived long-ball approach. Egil Olsen did, however, take the national team to two World Cups, and the long ball style of play is considered to have played an important role in accomplishing this.&lt;ref&gt;National Soccer Coaches Association of America, ''The Soccer Coaching Bible,'' Human Kinetics Publishers; 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-7360-4227-7}} {{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the greatest of the Norwegian goals scored with this style was by the striker [[Tore André Flo]] during the 1998 World Cup. Similar to the Bergkamp goal, but played to an advanced man on the wing, it began with an extremely long pass from [[Stig Inge Bjørnebye]]. Flo was alone when he received. He ran on and cut inside to beat his defending opponent, then slotted the ball past the goalkeeper [[Taffarel]]. The Norwegians went on to upset the mighty [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian]] team in this match. However, Brazil had already won the group before this game took place while Norway needed to win.

It should be noted that accurate passes aimed at a specific player are examples of individual long balls, but do not represent the spirit of a team playing a long-ball game. In that situation, the team would be pumping long-balls up repeatedly into an area, rather than a specific player, hoping the striker would get some of them and the percentages would pay off in the long-run.

The long ball can be very effective as a switch in game plan in pressure situations. In [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s quarter-final victory over [[Paris Saint Germain|PSG]] in the 2013/2014 Champions' League, PSG needed to defend their 3-2 lead on aggregate for 10 more minutes when [[Fernando Torres]] entered the game as a substitute for Oscar. Chelsea's rehearsed gameplan for this scenario was to go direct from anywhere in the field, and PSG's defensive line fell very deep and very compressed.  All secondary balls from either Chelsea or PSG players fell into spaces occupied solely by Chelsea players, leading to multiple goal scoring opportunities, one of which eventually taken by [[Demba Ba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2014/matches/round=2000481/match=2011875/postmatch/report/index.html |title=UEFA Champions League 2013/14 - History - Chelsea-Paris – |publisher=Uefa.com |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''luge''' {{IPAc-en|l|uː|ʒ}} is a small one- or two-person [[sled]] on which one sleds [[Supine position|supine]] (face up) and feet-first. A luger steers by using their [[Calf (leg)|calf]] muscles to flex the sled's runners or by exerting opposite shoulder pressure to the seat. Racing sleds weigh {{convert|21|–|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for singles and {{convert|25|–|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for doubles.&lt;ref name="usaluge2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamusa.org/~/media/USA_Luge/Documents/IRO_2014_AT_English.pdf|title=Rules of Artificial Track Luge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luge is also the name of an Olympic sport.

Lugers can reach speeds of 140&amp;nbsp;km/h (87&amp;nbsp;mph). [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Manuel Pfister]] reached a top speed of 154&amp;nbsp;km/h (96&amp;nbsp;mph) on a [[The Whistler Sliding Centre|track in Whistler]], [[Canada]], prior to the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/sports/2010-02/13/c_13174368.htm |title=Whistler's fast luge track poised risky |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2010-02-13 |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216130157/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/sports/2010-02/13/c_13174368.htm |archivedate=2010-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lugers compete against a timer in one of the most precisely timed sports in the world—to one one-thousandth of a second on artificial tracks.

The first recorded use of the term "luge" dates to 1905 and derives from the [[Savoy]]/[[Switzerland|Swiss]] dialect of the [[French language|French]] word ''luge'', meaning "small coasting sled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=luge |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motionvideo.co.nz/kjhkj/extreme-sport-articles/extreme-sports-disicplines/293-lugel.html|title=Luge, extreme sport disciplines|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611010017/http://www.motionvideo.co.nz/kjhkj/extreme-sport-articles/extreme-sports-disicplines/293-lugel.html|archivedate=2016-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Luge sled.jpg|thumb|left|Luge sled, with steel runners removed.]]
[[File:Young luger.jpg|thumb|left|A young luger on the start ramp at the Utah Olympic track.]]
The  very practical use of sleds is ancient and widespread. The first recorded sled races took place in Norway sometime during the 15th century.&lt;ref name="usaluge1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usaluge.org/aboutluge/history.php/ |title=United States Luge Association |publisher=Usaluge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sport of luge, like the [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] and the [[bobsleigh]], originated in the health-spa town of [[St Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], in the mid-to-late 19th century, through the endeavours of hotel entrepreneur [[Caspar Badrutt]]. Badrutt successfully sold the idea of winter resorting, as well as rooms with food, drink, and activities. His more adventurous English guests began adapting delivery boys' sleds for recreation, which led to collisions with pedestrians as they sped down the lanes and alleys of the village.

The first organized meeting of the sport took place in 1883 in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fil-luge.org/ |title=International Luge Federation |publisher=Fil-luge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the Internationale Schlittensportverband or International Sled Sports Federation was founded in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]]. This body governed the sport until 1935, when it was incorporated in the [[Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing]] (FIBT, International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation). After it had been decided that luge would replace the sport of [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] at the [[Olympic Games]], the first [[FIL World Luge Championships|World Championships]] in the sport were held in [[FIL World Luge Championships 1955|1955]] in [[Oslo]] ([[Norway]]). In 1957, the [[Fédération Internationale de Luge de Course]] (FIL, International Luge Federation) was founded. Luge events were first included in the [[Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Luge at the 1964 Winter Olympics|1964]].

Americans were slow to adopt the sport of luge. The first luge run in North America was built at [[Lolo Hot Springs, Montana]], in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Delta Sky Mag|date=January 2011|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the United States competed in every Olympic luge event from 1964 through 1976, it was not until 1979 that the United States Luge Association was founded. The first artificial American track was completed in that year for use in the 1980 XIII Winter Olympic Games at Lake Placid, New York.&lt;ref name="usaluge1"/&gt;
Since that time the United States luge program has greatly improved. A second artificial track was constructed near [[Park City, Utah]], for the 2002 XIX Olympic Winter Games at Salt Lake City.

==Artificial tracks==

{{Details|List of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks}}

Artificial luge tracks have specially designed and constructed banked curves plus walled-in straights. Most tracks are artificially refrigerated, but artificial tracks without artificial cooling also exist (for example, in [[St. Moritz]]). Tracks tend to be very smooth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The athletes ride in a flat, aerodynamic position on the sled, keeping their heads low to minimize air resistance. They steer the sled mainly with their calves by applying pressure on the runners—right calf to turn left, left calf to turn right. It takes a precise mix of shifting body weight, applying pressure with calves and rolling the shoulders. There are also handles for minor adjustments. A successful luger maintains complete concentration and relaxation on the sled while traveling at high speeds. Most lugers "visualize" the course in their minds before sliding.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Fastest times result from following the perfect "line" down the track. Any slight error, such as brush against the wall, costs time. Track conditions are also important. Softer ice tends to slow speeds, while harder ice tends to lead to faster times. Lugers race at speeds averaging {{convert|120|–|145|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} around high banked curves while experiencing a centripetal acceleration of up to 5g. Men's Singles have their start locations near where the [[bobsled]] and [[skeleton(sport)|skeleton]] competitors start at most tracks, while both the Doubles and Women's Singles competition have their starthouse located farther down the track. Artificial track luge is the fastest and most agile sledding sport.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Natural track luge==
{{Details|List of natural luge tracks}}
Natural tracks are adapted from existing mountain roads and paths. Artificially banked curves are not permitted.&lt;ref name="NTRules2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of Natural Track Luge|url=http://www.fil-luge.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/IRO/IRO_2014_NB_English_komplett_web.pdf|website=FIL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track's surface should be horizontal. They are naturally iced. Tracks can get rough from the braking and steering action. Athletes use a steering rein and drag their hands and use their legs in order to drive around the tight flat corners. Braking is often required in front of curves and is accomplished by the use of spikes built on the bottom of the shoes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Most of the tracks are situated in Austria and Italy, with others in Germany, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Canada, Switzerland, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Turkey, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Bulgaria, Romania, New Zealand and the United States. The Upper Peninsula Luge Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upluge.org/ |title= The Upper Peninsula Luge Club |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Negaunee, Michigan]], is home to one of only five lighted natural track luge runs in the world, and the only natural track in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first =  Sarah |last = O'Neill |title=Negaunee Luge Hill Open for Public Use|url=http://www.thenorthwindonline.com/negaunee-luge-hill-open-for-public-use/|accessdate=2015-03-03|work=The North Wind |location= Northern Michigan University |date=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The over 800 meter (half-mile) track features 29 curves along its {{convert|88|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} vertical drop. The club hosts international luge events and offers luge instruction to the public during the winter months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[FIL World Luge Natural Track Championships|World championships]] have been held since [[FIL World Luge Natural Track Championships 1979|1979]] while [[FIL European Luge Natural Track Championships|European championships]] have been held since [[FIL European Luge Natural Track Championships 1970|1970]].

==Events==
There are four luge disciplines.
*Men's singles
*Doubles (open to both genders)
*Women's singles
*Team relay (Olympic discipline starting in 2014)
These are further broken into several age classes - multiple youth and junior classes that cover the range of age 7–20, and general class (ages 21 and older).&lt;ref name="usaluge2"/&gt;  Older competitors may enjoy the sport in masters (age 30–50), and senior masters (age 51+) classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Luge |title= United States Luge Association |publisher=usaluge.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a team relay competition, one man, one woman, and a doubles pair form a team. A touchpad at the bottom of the run is touched by a competitor signaling a teammate at the top of the run to start.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Rules and procedures for races are very precise:
* A drawing is held to determine start order for the race. Athletes are assigned a number which is displayed on a bib. During major national and international events, men's singles consists of four runs. Women's singles and doubles competitions consist of two runs. The cumulative time of all runs is used to determine finish order. In all three events, the start order after the first run is determined by the outcome of the previous run, with the last-place slider sliding first, the next-to-last place slider sliding second, and so forth, with the leader of the previous run sliding last.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Physical measurements of the sled are taken, and the temperature of the sled's steel blades is checked and may not be more than {{convert|5|°C}} above that of a previously established control temperature. Additionally, for artificial track races, the athlete must first be weighed. This is to determine whether the athlete is entitled to carry extra weight on their body while sliding. Men may use additional weight amounting to 75% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of {{convert|90|kg}}. Women may use additional weight amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of {{convert|70|kg}}. Doubles athletes may use additional weight amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of {{convert|90|kg}}. Additional weight is not allowed if the body weight of the front person and back person together exceeds {{convert|180|kg}}.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If one of the partners weighs more than {{convert|90|kg}}, the weight exceeding the {{convert|90|kg}} mark is added to the lighter partner. If there should still be a difference between the partner’s weight and the {{convert|90|kg}} mark, the difference can be compensated according to an official weight table.&lt;ref name="usaluge2"/&gt; Between runs, athletes are randomly selected for additional weight checks. Before each run, the sled (with the athlete, for artificial track races) is weighed at the start ramp.
* Once an athlete is on their sled, they are audibly notified that the track is clear. At this point, a tone sounds and the athlete has thirty seconds to begin their run. A run becomes official when an athlete and their sled, in contact with one another, crosses the finish line. If an athlete and sled are not within contact of one another, the athlete is disqualified from further competition. Disqualifications may also take place for any violation of rules and regulations. Certain disqualifications may be appealed.&lt;ref name="usaluge2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Training==
The sport of luge requires an athlete to balance mental and physical fitness. Physically, a luger must have strong neck, upper body, abdominal, and thigh muscles. Athletes also use Wind Tunnels to train&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freshwater-and-saltwater.webnode.com/title=Rules to play Luge|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|title=Freshwater-and-saltwater}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Strength training]] is essential to withstand the extreme G-forces of tight turns at high speeds. Since lugers have very little protection other than a visor and helmet, they must be able to endure the physical pounding administered by the track when mistakes are made.

==Risks==
As with many [[extreme sports]], luging has risks. Though most injuries involve bumps, bruises, broken bones and concussions, fatalities do occasionally occur. [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] luger [[Nodar Kumaritashvili]] suffered a fatal crash during his final practice run for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] on the [[Whistler Sliding Centre]] in [[Whistler, British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/02/12/olympic.luge.crash/index.html|title=Olympic Luger Dies on Track Where Speed Caused Concern|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hours later, the [[International Luge Federation]] concluded that the accident was caused by a steering error and not a track error; nevertheless, changes to the track were made before the re-opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/fil-statement-on-mens-luge-competition_274462nE.html |title=Joint VANOC/FIL statement |publisher=Vancouver2010.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumaritashvili was the fourth athlete to die while in preparation for a Winter Olympics competition, following speed skier [[Nicolas Bochatay]], 27, who died while preparing for the [[Albertville 1992]] games, [[United Kingdom|British]] luger [[Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypecki]] and skier [[Ross Milne]], 19, who both died in the run-up to the [[Innsbruck 1964]] games.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Governing body==
The sport of luge is governed by the FIL, Fédération International de Luge de Course. The FIL is located in [[Berchtesgaden]], Germany, and includes 53 member nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fil-luge.org/index.php?id=402 |title=Member Countries – International Luge Federation |publisher=Fil-luge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is traditionally dominated by German representatives, however.

The following persons have been president of the FIL:
* [[Bert Isatitsch]], [[Austria]] (1957–1994)
* [[Josef Fendt]], [[Germany]] (1994–current)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2509">Mexico is an Associate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). Mexico joined the ICC as an Affiliate in 2004 and became an Associate in 2017. Mexico is included in the [[ICC Americas]] region.

The Mexico Cricket Association is the official governing organ for [[cricket]] in [[Mexico]] and it is based at the Reforma Athletic Club, Reforma San Pablo, San Juan Totoltepec, Naucalpan de Juarez, State of Mexico (part of the [[Greater Mexico City|Mexico City Metropolitan Area]]). The Mexican cricket season runs from late September to late May.

There is a 20-over league in which four teams - Mexico Union Cricket Club, Aztecs, Aguilas, and Reforma - compete for the Lincoln Clarke Trophy. 20-over social games are held, including an Ambassador's Cup, Cricketers vs Footballers, India vs Pakistan, ANZAC Day, and Asia vs Rest of the World. All league and social games are played at the Reforma Athletic Club. The Reforma Athletic Club has the second highest turf wicket in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03nngx8|title=Mexican pitch leaves players 'gasping for air', Stumped - BBC World Service|website=BBC|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A weekend sixes tournament takes place in [[Tequisquiapan]], a small town to the north of Mexico City. 

The Mexico Cricket Association has a junior development programme – Las Iguanas – where boys and girls between the ages of 8 and 13 are taught cricket at the Reforma Athletic Club, including hand eye coordination skills, batting, bowling, and fielding technique, and the spirit of cricket, Cricket is also taught to school children in Tequisquiapan.

Mexico sends an [[Mexico national cricket team|international]] team to take part in the biennial 20-over Central American Championships and the annual 20-over South American Championships. The Mexico Cricket Association was instrumental in setting up the first Central American Championships in Belize in 2006, and went on to both host and win the tournament the following year. Mexico won the tournament again in 2013. Mexico made its debut in the 2014 edition South American Championships in Peru and won the tournament.

Mexico also hosts international touring teams. The Mexico Cricket Association welcomed the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] to Mexico for the first time in March 2017 for a series of 20-over games.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13554">'''Movable seating''' is a feature of some facilities like [[stadium]]s, often known as '''convertible stadiums''', or '''moduable stadiums'''. It allows for the movement of parts of the [[grandstand]] to allow for a change of the playing surface shape. This allows games that use various shaped playing surfaces such as an oval field, for [[cricket]] and/or [[Australian rules football]]; or a rectangular field, for [[football (soccer)]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], [[American football]], and/or [[Canadian football]]; or a diamond field, for [[baseball]]; to be played in the same stadium. This is particularly useful in Australia and the United States, where various professional sports with varying field configurations are popular spectator pastimes. The process of conversion from one form to another is time consuming – depending on the stadium it can take from 8&lt;ref name="telstrastadium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telstrastadium.com.au/index.aspx?link_id=1.117|title=Telstra Stadium – Reconfiguration}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 80&lt;ref name="stadedefrance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumdb.com/stadiums/fra/stade_de_france|title=State de France}}&lt;/ref&gt; hours. Many stadiums were built in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s to host both baseball and American football.

==Stadiums with movable seating==
[[File:Panorama-TelstraStadium-Oct2005.jpg|right|thumb|[[Stadium Australia]] showing a configuration of seating in progress.]]

* [[Barnet Copthall|Allianz Park]], the stadium that is the most notable structure within the Barnet Copthall leisure complex in London, UK, has movable seating that was installed for the benefit of its primary tenant, the [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]] rugby union club, in a renovation that was completed in early 2013. The movable stands allow the stadium to continue to serve in its original role as an athletics (track and field) venue.
* [[Aloha Stadium]] in [[Honolulu|Honolulu, Hawaii]], USA, opened in 1975, and has four movable sections allowing it to be reconfigured for baseball, [[American football]], soccer, or concerts. However, the stadium managers permanently locked the stands in the football configuration effective in 2007, citing maintenance costs for the equipment used to move the sections.
* [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] (Stadium Australia) was the Olympic Stadium at the [[Sydney]] [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Australia. Post-Olympics during 2001–2003, it was re-configured and movable seating was implemented allowing the stadium to transition between a rectangular or an oval playing surface. Once the redevelopment is complete in 2021, the stadium's rectangular configuration will be permanently locked as a Football-only stadium.&lt;ref name="telstrastadium"/&gt;
* [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] (Docklands Stadium) in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia, was completed in 1999. Features such as movable seating and a retractable roof allow for the venue to host many sports and entertainment events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etihadstadium.com.au/stadium/seating-configuration|title=Etihad Stadium – Seating Configuration}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first stadium in Australia to have this feature.
* [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]], USA, home of the [[Miami Dolphins]] ([[National Football League]]) and [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] ([[college football|NCAA football]]), originally had a movable stand used to accommodate the then-Florida Marlins ([[National League]]). The now-[[Miami Marlins]] opened a new stadium of their own, [[Marlins Park]], following which the movable stand was permanently locked into a football-only configuration. This stand was later demolished in a 2015 reconstruction of the stadium's lower bowl.
* [[London Stadium]], formerly known as Olympic Stadium in London, England, UK, was originally built for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] with fixed seating, but movable sections were added to provide optimal configurations for its original purpose of athletics, association football and concerts. [[West Ham United F.C.]] moved into the reconfigured venue starting in the 2016–17 season.
* [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] in [[Atlanta]], USA, home to the NFL's [[Atlanta Falcons]] and Major League Soccer's [[Atlanta United FC|Atlanta United]] since August 2017, has retractable lower-bowl seats along the sidelines. This allows an appropriate playing area for soccer, whose regulation field is nearly 20 meters wider than that of American football.
* [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]] (known in the past by several sponsored names) in [[Oakland, California]], USA, is the home venue for the [[Oakland Raiders]] ([[National Football League]]) and [[Oakland Athletics]] ([[American League]]).
* [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, has two movable sections allowing it to be reconfigured for baseball, [[Canadian football]], soccer and concerts.
* [[Perth Stadium|Optus Stadium]] in [[Perth]], Australia, a venue built with an oval pitch for cricket and Australian rules football, has several "drop-in" movable seating areas positioned to "fill in" much of the sides of the pitch when the venue is used for rectangular-field sports.
* [[Paris La Défense Arena]], located near the [[La Défense]] business district in the Paris suburb of [[Nanterre]], opened in October 2017 after many delays, with its main tenant, the [[Racing 92]] rugby union club, moving in that December. The stadium features a movable seating block that allows it to accommodate field or court sports.
* [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] in Washington, D.C., USA, used movable seating to accommodate two different pairs of teams:
** Starting in 1962, the year after the stadium opened, the NFL's [[Washington Redskins]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|the second incarnation of the Washington Senators]] (American League) shared the stadium until the Senators moved to the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex]] in 1971. During this time, several different soccer teams also used RFK in its (American) football configuration.
** The [[Washington Nationals]] ([[National League]]) and [[D.C. United]] ([[Major League Soccer]]) shared the stadium from 2005 until 2008, when the Nationals moved to a [[Nationals Park|new ballpark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/nationals/2005-01-25-nats-getting-ready_x.MemorMMi |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061146/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/nationals/2005-01-25-nats-getting-ready_x.MemorMMi |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-03-04 |date=2005-01-25 |title=Nationals rounding third, heading home |last=Johnson |first=Chuck |accessdate=2006-08-11 |work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rogers Centre]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, has separate layouts for the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] ([[American League]]) and the [[Toronto Argonauts]] ([[Canadian Football League]]). For several years in the 21st century, the [[Buffalo Bills]] (NFL) [[Bills Toronto Series|played one regular-season home game there each year]], using the CFL seating configuration and an NFL-regulation field. The Argonauts moved to an expanded and renovated [[BMO Field]] in 2016, after which the movable seating was permanently locked into its baseball configuration.
* [[Saitama Super Arena]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama City]], [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], Japan, has separate layouts for arena-type seating for basketball and hockey and stadium-like seating for soccer, American football, and concerts. This is possible because of a large movable block.
* [[SDCCU Stadium]] (formerly San Diego Stadium, Jack Murphy Stadium, and Qualcomm Stadium) in [[San Diego]], USA, was formerly shared by the [[San Diego Padres]] of [[Major League Baseball]], the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] of the [[National Football League]], and a local college football team, the [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State Aztecs]], and thus had movable seating. The Padres moved to [[Petco Park]] in 2004, leaving football as the only major sport played in SDCCU Stadium, and the Chargers returned to their original home of [[Los Angeles Chargers|Los Angeles]] in 2017, leaving the Aztecs as the stadium's only occupant.
* [[Stade de France]] in the Paris suburb of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], France was built for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. It has a movable stand which covers an athletics track.&lt;ref name="stadedefrance"/&gt;
* [[U.S. Bank Stadium]] in [[Minneapolis]], USA, which opened in 2016 as the new home of the [[Minnesota Vikings]] ([[National Football League]]), is purposed for football but is able to convert to baseball for the [[University of Minnesota]] [[Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball|men's baseball team]]. The stadium is also scheduled to host basketball and professional wrestling events.

==Future stadiums with movable seating==
--&gt;

==Proposed stadiums with movable seating==
* The [[Australian Capital Territory]]'s minister for sport has proposed a 'super stadium' with removable seating as a replacement for the ageing [[Canberra Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=May 9, 2010 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former stadiums with movable seating==
* The [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in [[Minneapolis]], USA, featured movable seating, with layouts for baseball and football. Before its 2014 demolition, it was home to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] (NFL), served as a part-time home for the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball|Minnesota Golden Gophers]] [[college baseball]] team (representing the [[University of Minnesota]]), and was also used for other college baseball games. It had also been home to the [[Minnesota Twins]] ([[American League]]) and the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|university's football program]], but the Twins moved into their new [[Target Field]] in April 2010 and the Gophers football team opened their new [[TCF Bank Stadium]] in September 2009. The Metrodome also hosted [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[college basketball|college]] [[basketball]] games as well as [[association football|soccer]] events. The Metrodome was replaced on-site by [[U.S. Bank Stadium]], a stadium which also features movable seating.
* [[Mile High Stadium]] in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]], USA, added a large movable stand in a 1977 expansion project. A [[hydraulic]] process allowed the stadium to change from a football to a baseball configuration in about two hours. The longtime home of the NFL's [[Denver Broncos]] and [[minor league baseball]]'s [[New Orleans Zephyrs|Denver Bears/Zephyrs]], it became the original home of baseball's [[Colorado Rockies]] in 1993. The Rockies drew all-time [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] record crowds in their first two seasons before leaving Mile High for their new [[Coors Field]] in 1995. Mile High was torn down after its football-only replacement, currently known as [[Broncos Stadium at Mile High]], was opened in 2001.
* [[Shea Stadium]] in New York City was built to function as both a football and baseball stadium. The [[New York Mets]] called Shea Stadium home from 1964 until 2008. The [[New York Jets]] played there from 1964 until 1983. Field level seats were arranged in two crescent shaped sections that could be moved on below-ground rails. In the football configuration these sections faced each other from opposite sides of the playing field. For baseball, the sections were rotated so that they would come close to meeting in the territory behind home plate. One section would be along the first base side foul line while the other was on the third base side. One consequence of the movable sections was that in the baseball configuration the seats were a larger distance from the foul lines than in most baseball-only parks. The seats also directly faced the foul line regardless of where they were located. Fans seated beyond first or third base would have to turn to face the infield. Another problem was that moving the seats damaged the grass playing surface. Late season Mets games often had sections of dead grass in the corners of the outfield from when the seats were moved for Jets games.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/080926&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Jets moved to [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey following the 1983 NFL season, the seats were left in the baseball configuration. Seats were later added along the baselines, reducing the size of foul territory.
* [[Candlestick Park]] (aka 3Com Park from 1995 until 2003) in San Francisco was opened in 1960 as a baseball-only stadium for the [[San Francisco Giants]]. In 1971 the [[San Francisco 49ers]] football team moved in, which required the stadium to be significantly expanded and altered which resulted in a shape like few other stadiums in the world. The Giants moved to [[AT&amp;T Park]] after the 2000 season, and the stadium remained in its football configuration for the rest of its life. The 49ers moved to [[Levi's Stadium]] after the 2013 season, and demolition of Candlestick Park began in February 2015.

The '''Petersen Sports Complex''' (PSC) is a {{convert|12.32|acre|ha|adj=on}} multi-sport athletic facility on the campus of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It houses Charles L. Cost Field, Vartabedian Field, and Ambrose Urbanic Field, the respective home practice and competition venues of the university's [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] varsity athletic [[Pittsburgh Panthers baseball|baseball]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers softball|softball]], and men's and women's soccer teams. Known as the [[Pittsburgh Panthers|Pittsburgh (Pitt) Panthers]], these teams compete in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. The complex is located adjacent to the school's [[Trees Hall]] and [[Cost Sports Center]] near the remainder of the university's other [[University of Pittsburgh#Location and campus|upper campus]] athletic facilities.

==History==
[[File:PeteSportsComplexEntrance1.jpg|thumb|right|Main entrance and ticket plaza]]
[[File:PeteSportsComplexEntrancePlaza.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance plaza]]
The sports complex was a project that had been in development since the 1999 closure of [[Pitt Stadium]] on the university's campus. With the demolition of the stadium, the soccer teams, track &amp; field teams, marching band and many intramural programs of the university lost their homes. The university's [[Pittsburgh Panthers baseball|baseball]] and [[Pittsburgh Panthers softball|softball]] teams had long been playing in what had been deemed as inadequate facilities on [[Trees Field]] tucked behind the school's indoor [[Cost Sports Center]].&lt;ref name="deal"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07082/771856-53.stm | title=City, Pitt, Hill finally agree on Oak Hill project | first=Rich | last=Lord | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2007-03-27 | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, the soccer teams had moved their home games to off-campus Founders Field in [[Cheswick, Pennsylvania|Cheswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://pittnews.com/article/2010/03/24/petersen-sports-complex-will-bring-new-homes-softball-baseball-soccer | title=Petersen Sports Complex will bring new homes for softball, baseball, soccer | first=Donnie | last=Tasser | newspaper=The Pitt News | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2010-03-24 | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex was built on the former Robinson Court housing project. The land was obtained after five years of sometimes contentious negotiations between the university, a housing developer, and the City of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name="deal"/&gt; The final cost of the {{convert|12.3|acre|m2|adj=on}} site for the university was a total contribution of $7 million in payments and community contributions which doubled the 2005 bid of several developers.&lt;ref name="deal"/&gt; The land sale was formally approved and Pitt acquired the parcel in the second half of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08206/899289-100.stm | title=Pitt, developer to get former public housing land | first=Rich | last=Lord | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2008-07-24 | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground was broken on the complex in the fall of that year.&lt;ref name="landsdonation"/&gt; The estimated cost of the complex's construction is $29 million. It is named after alumnus John Petersen and his wife Gertrude who donated an undisclosed amount for its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09293/1006971-100.stm | title=Pitt's new Olympic Sports complex to bear a familiar name | date=2009-10-20 | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | first=Paul | last=Zeise | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baseball field has been named Charles L. Cost Field, after an alumnus who is also the namesake of the neighboring Cost Sports Center, while the softball field has been named Vartabedian Field and the soccer field has been named Ambrose Urbanic Field. The Petersen Sports Complex hosted its first official athletic contest with a March 16, 2011 baseball game between Pitt and [[Kent State Golden Flashes baseball|Kent State]].&lt;ref name="first game"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-basebl/recaps/031611aad.html | title=The Panthers Drop Inaugural Game at Charles L. Cost Field | publisher=PittsburghPanthers.com | date=2011-03-16 | accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grand opening ceremonies, termed the "First Pitch Event", occurred on April 9, 2011, and featured contests involving all four sports teams that will use the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/s_731025.html | title=Pitt antes up on facilities for other university sports | first=Jerry | last=DiPaola | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=April 7, 2011 | accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following completion of the sports complex, the former baseball and softball facilities on Trees Field are planned to be turned into a new track and field complex.&lt;ref name="OSCbrochure"&gt;{{citation | url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/pitt/genrel/auto_pdf/OSCBrochure092409.pdf | title=The Olympic Sports Complex: Only Big Dreams | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | year=2009 | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complex==
The Petersen Sports Complex includes three competition and practice venues, including for baseball, softball and men's and women's soccer. In addition, the complex includes a two-story, {{convert|23000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} support building that houses locker rooms for each sport as well as dedicated equipment and athletic training facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=17502 | first=Peter | last=Hart | first2=Kimberly K. | last2=Barlow | title=What’s New: Places | newspaper=University Times | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2011-09-01 | accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An indoor batting practice facility, serving both the baseball and softball teams, is also contained within the facility and is located adjacent to baseball's Charles L. Cost Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11097/1137574-142.stm | title=Pitt to hold grand opening for new complex Saturday | first=Paul | last=Zeise | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2011-04-07 | accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A concessions area is located within the portion of the support building that runs along the southeast goal line of the Ambrose Urbanic soccer field. Outside of the facility, a ticket book is adjacent to an entrance plaza that contains a depiction of the University of Pittsburgh's seal in its granite surface. Within the entrance plaza is a statue of the silhouette of an athlete representing each of the fours teams that call the complex home. Behind each of these figures are plaques honoring those that contributed to the construction of the facility.

===Ambrose Urbanic Field===
The men's and women's soccer facility includes the 735-seat Ambrose Urbanic Field. Used for both practice and competition, the facility includes lighting and a press box.&lt;ref name="OSCbrochure"/&gt; The soccer pitch will use the [[FIFA]]-certified "Duraspine" version of [[FieldTurf]] as found in [[Gillette Stadium]] and  [[Qwest Field]].&lt;ref name="plan"/&gt; The first game held at the soccer facility was an exhibition played by the men's team against the [[Pittsburgh Riverhounds]] on March 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/032111aaa.html | title=Men's Soccer Sees First Action At Petersen Sports Complex | publisher=PittsburghPanthers.com | date=2011-03-21 | accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles L. Cost Field===
The baseball facility includes the 900-seat Charles L. Cost Field, a press box, in-ground team dugouts, bullpens, and hitting and pitching practice areas. [[Field Turf]] synthetic grass is installed in both the infield and outfield to allow for play and practice throughout the year and lighting is installed for evening games. The field has {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} base lines and {{convert|375|ft|m|adj=on}} power alleys, and is {{convert|405|ft|m}} to center field.&lt;ref name="OSCbrochure"/&gt; The field was named after three-sport [[Letterman (sports)|letterman]] and former [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pitt football]] running back Charles L. "Corky" Cost. The scoreboard was donated by Armand C. Dellovade.

The first game held at Cost Field was a 10–7 Pitt loss to Kent State on March 16, 2011.&lt;ref name="first game"/&gt; Pitt's first win at the facility was a 9–6 victory over [[Niagara University#Athletics|Niagara]] on March 18, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-basebl/recaps/031811aaa.html|title=Pitt Baseball Downs Niagara, 9-6, To Capture First Win at Petersen Sports Complex|publisher=PittsburghPanthers.com | date=2011-03-18 | accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pole vaulting''' is a [[track and field]] event in which a person uses a long flexible pole (which today is usually made either of [[fiberglass]] or [[carbon fiber]]) as an aid to jump over a [[#bar|bar]].  Pole jumping competitions were known to the [[Mycenaean Greece|ancient Greeks]], [[Minoan civilization|Cretans]] and [[Celt]]s. It has been a full medal event at the [[Olympic Games]] since [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] for men and [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] for women.

It is typically classified as one of the four major jumping events in [[Sport of athletics|athletics]], alongside the [[high jump]], [[long jump]] and [[triple jump]]. It is unusual among track and field sports in that it requires a significant amount of specialised equipment in order to participate, even at a basic level. A number of elite pole vaulters have had backgrounds in [[gymnastics]], including world record breakers [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] and [[Brian Sternberg]], reflecting the similar physical attributes required for the sports.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Mike.

==History==
[[File:Pole vaulting LOC det.4a15081.jpg|thumb|Pole vault in the 1890s at [[US Naval Academy]]]]
[[File:Fierljeppen de natsprong.jpg|thumb|Traditional [[fierljeppen]] in the Netherlands, using poles to clear distances over rivers]]

Poles were used as a practical means of passing over natural obstacles in marshy places such as provinces of [[Friesland]] in the [[Netherlands]], along the [[North Sea]], and the great level of the [[Fens]] across [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Huntingdonshire]], [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Norfolk]].  Artificial draining of these marshes created a network of [[open drain]]s or [[canal]]s intersecting each other. To cross these without getting wet, while avoiding tedious roundabout journeys over bridges, a stack of jumping poles was kept at every house and used for vaulting over the canals. Venetian [[gondolier]]s have traditionally used punting poles for moving to the shore from their boat.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=April 2018}}

Distance pole vaulting competitions continue to be held annually in the lowlands around the [[North Sea]]. These far-jumping competitions ([[West Frisian language|Frysk]]: ''[[Fierljeppen]]'') are not based on height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbholland.com/info.php?context=alle&amp;lang=en|title=Info|publisher=Polsstokverspringen/ Fierljeppen Holland|date=5 September 2012|accessdate=7 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002031515/http://www.pbholland.com/info.php?context=alle&amp;lang=en|archivedate=2 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Mechanics of the Pole Vault,'' [[Richard Ganslen]] reports that the London Gymnastic Society under Professor Voelker held measured pole vaulting events in 1826, involving 1,300 participants and recording heights up to {{convert|10|ft|10|in|abbr=on|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pureskyvaulting.com/Some%20Cool%20Stuff/First25Pages.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early pole vaulting competitions where height was measured took place at the [[Ulverston|Ulverston Football and Cricket Club]], [[Furness|Lancashire, north of the sands]] (now [[Cumbria]]) in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Simon (13 June 2009).

Retrieved on 2009-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern competition began around 1850 in [[Germany]], when pole vaulting was added to the exercises of the [[Turners|Turner]] gymnastic clubs by [[Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths|Johann C. F. GutsMuths]] and [[Friedrich L. Jahn]]. In [[Great Britain]], it was first practiced at the Caledonian Games.

Initially, vaulting poles were made from stiff materials such as [[bamboo]] or [[aluminum]]. The introduction of flexible vaulting poles in the early 1950s made from composites such as [[fiberglass]] or [[carbon fiber]] allowed vaulters to achieve greater height.&lt;ref name=first&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19620207&amp;id=CWxPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MwUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4887,840268&lt;/ref&gt; Physical attributes such as speed, agility and strength are essential to pole vaulting effectively, but technical skill is an equally if not more important element. The object of pole vaulting is to clear a bar or crossbar supported upon two uprights (standards) without knocking it down.

In 2000, IAAF rule 260.18a (formerly 260.6a) was amended, so that "world records" (as opposed to "indoor world records") can be set in a facility "with or without roof". This rule was not applied retroactively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With many indoor facilities not conforming to outdoor track specifications for size and flatness, the pole vault is the only world record set indoors.

== Modern vaulting ==
Today, athletes compete in the pole vault as one of the four [[jumping]] events in [[track and field]]. Because the [[high jump]] and pole vault are both vertical jumps, the competitions are conducted similarly. Each athlete can choose what height they would like to enter the competition. Once they enter, they have three attempts to clear the height. If a height is cleared, the vaulter advances to the next height, where they will have three more attempts. Once the vaulter has three consecutive misses, they are out of the competition and the highest height they cleared is their result. A "no height", often denoted "NH", refers to the failure of a vaulter to clear any bar during the competition.

Once the vaulter enters the competition, they can choose to pass heights. If a vaulter achieves a miss on their first attempt at a height, they can pass to the next height, but they will only have two attempts at that height, as they will be out once they achieve three consecutive misses. Similarly, after earning two misses at a height, they could pass to the next height, when they would have only one attempt.

[[File:Pole vault Its all for this moment.jpg|thumb|left|An athlete passes the bar with the aid of a pole]]

The competitor who clears the highest height is the winner. If two or more vaulters have finished with the same height, the tie is broken by the number of misses at the final height. If the tied vaulters have the same number of misses at the last height cleared, the tie is broken by the total number of misses in the competition.

If there is still a tie for first place, a jump-off occurs to break the tie. Marks achieved in this type of jump-off are considered valid and count for any purpose that a mark achieved in a normal competition would.

If a tie in the other places still exists, a jump-off is not normally conducted, unless the competition is a qualifying meet, and the tie exists in the final qualifying spot. In this case, an administrative jump-off is conducted to break the tie, but the marks are not considered valid for any other purpose than breaking the tie.

A jump-off is a [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] competition in which the tied vaulters attempt the same height, starting with the last attempted height. If both vaulters miss, the [[#bar|bar]] goes down by a small increment, and if both clear, the bar goes up by a small increment. A jump-off ends when one vaulter clears and the other misses. Each vaulter gets one attempt at each height until one makes and one misses.

The equipment and rules for pole vaulting are similar to the [[high jump]]. Unlike high jump, however, the athlete in the vault has the ability to select the [[#standards|horizontal position]] of the bar before each jump and can place it a distance beyond the back of the [[#box|box]], the metal pit that the pole is placed into immediately before takeoff. The range of distance the vaulter may place the standards varies depending on the level of competition.

[[File:Salto con l Asta.jpg|thumb|Painting by former athlete [[Raffaello Ducceschi]] depicting the pole vault ]]

If the pole used by the athlete dislodges the [[#bar|bar]] from the uprights, a foul attempt is ruled, even if the athlete has cleared the height. An athlete does not benefit from quickly leaving the landing pad before the bar has fallen. The exception to this rule if the vaulter is vaulting outdoors and has made a clear effort to throw the pole back, but the wind has blown the pole into the bar; this counts as a clearance. This call is made at the discretion of the pole vault official.  If the pole breaks during the execution of a vault, it is considered an equipment failure and is ruled a non-jump, neither a make nor a miss. Other types of equipment failure include the standards slipping down or the wind dislodging the bar when no contact was made by the vaulter.

Each athlete has a set amount of time in which to make an attempt. The amount of time varies by level of competition and the number of vaulters remaining. If the vaulter fails to begin an attempt within this time, the vaulter is charged with a time foul and the attempt is a miss.

Poles are manufactured with ratings corresponding to the vaulter's maximum weight. Some organizations forbid vaulters to use poles rated below their weight as a safety precaution. The recommended weight corresponds to a flex rating that is determined by the manufacturer by placing a standardized amount of stress (most commonly a {{Convert|50|lb|abbr=on|adj=on}} weight) on the pole and measuring how much the center of the pole is displaced. Therefore, two poles rated at the same weight are not necessarily the same stiffness.

Because pole stiffness and length are important factors to a vaulter's performance, it is not uncommon for an elite vaulter to carry as many as ten poles to a competition. The effective properties of a pole can be changed by gripping the pole higher or lower in relation to the top of the pole. The left and right [[#grip|handgrips]] are typically a bit more than shoulder width apart. Poles are manufactured for people of all skill levels and body sizes, with sizes as short as {{Convert|3.05|m|ftin|abbr=on}} to as long as {{Convert|5.30|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, with a wide range of weight ratings. Each manufacturer determines the weight rating for the pole and the location of the maximum handhold band.

However speed is the most essential element to higher jumps, because the [[kinetic energy|energy]] produced by the run (&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;=mass of the athlete;&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;=speed) is converted to vertical propulsion ([[gravitational potential energy]]) (mass x height x acceleration due to gravity(&lt;math&gt;9.81ms^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;)).

==Technology==
Competitive pole vaulting began using solid [[Fraxinus|ash]] poles. As the heights attained increased, the bamboo poles gave way to tubular [[aluminum]],&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Matthew. [http://illumin.usc.edu/printer/143/soaring-to-new-heights-the-evolution-of-pole-vaulting-and-pole-materials/ "Soaring to New Heights: The Evolution of Pole Vaulting and Pole Materials"]. Illumin. Retrieved on 25 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which was tapered at each end. Today's pole vaulters benefit from poles produced by wrapping pre-cut sheets of [[fiberglass]] that contains resin around a metal pole mandrel, to produce a slightly curved pole that bends more easily under the compression caused by an athlete's take-off. The shape of the fiberglass sheets and the amount of fiberglass used is carefully planned to provide the desired length and stiffness of pole. Different fiber types, including carbon-fiber, are used to give poles specific characteristics intended to promote higher jumps. In recent years, carbon fiber has been added to the commonly used E-glass and S-glass materials to create a lighter pole.

As in the [[high jump]], the landing area was originally a heap of sawdust or sand where athletes landed on their feet. As technology enabled higher vaults, mats evolved into bags of large chunks of foam. Today's high-tech mats are foam usually {{convert|1|-|1.5|m|sp=us}} thick. Mats are growing larger in area as well to minimize risk of injury. Proper landing technique is on the back or shoulders. Landing on the feet should be avoided, to eliminate the risk of injury to the lower extremities, particularly ankle sprains.

Rule changes over the years have resulted in larger landing areas and additional padding of all hard and unyielding surfaces.

The pole vault crossbar has evolved from a triangular aluminum bar to a round fiberglass bar with rubber ends. This is balanced on standards and can be knocked off when it is hit by a pole vaulter or the pole. Rule changes have led to shorter pegs and crossbar ends that are semi-circular.

Although many techniques are used by vaulters at various skill levels to clear the [[#bar|bar]], the generally accepted technical model can be broken down into several phases:

=== Approach ===
During the approach the pole vaulter sprints down the runway in such a way as to achieve maximum speed and correct position to initiate [[takeoff]] at the end of the approach. Top class vaulters use approaches with 18 to 22 strides, often referred to as a "step" in which every other foot is counted as one step. The run-up to the vaulting pit begins forcefully with the vaulter running powerfully in a relaxed, upright position with knees lifted and torso leaning very slightly forward. The head, shoulders and hips are aligned, the vaulter increasing speed as the body becomes erect. The tip of the vaulting pole is angled higher than eye level until three paces from takeoff, when the pole tip descends efficiently, amplifying run speed as the pole is planted into the vault box. The faster the vaulter can run and the more efficient their take-off is, the greater the [[kinetic energy]] that can be achieved and used during the vault.

=== Plant and take-off ===
The plant and take off is initiated typically three steps out from the final step. Vaulters will usually count their steps backwards from their starting point to the box only counting the steps taken on the left foot (vice versa for left-handers) except for the second step from the box, which is taken by the right foot. For example; a vaulter on a "ten count" (referring to the number of counted steps from the starting point to the box) would count backwards from ten, only counting the steps taken with the left foot, until the last three steps taken and both feet are counted as three, two, one. These last three steps are normally quicker than the previous strides and are referred to as the "turn-over". The goal of this phase is to efficiently translate the [[kinetic energy]] accumulated from the approach into [[potential energy]] stored by the elasticity of the pole, and to gain as much initial vertical height as possible by jumping off the ground. The plant starts with the vaulter raising their arms up from around the hips or mid-torso until they are fully outstretched above the head, with the right arm extended directly above the head and the left arm extended perpendicular to the pole (vice versa for left-handed vaulters). At the same time, the vaulter is dropping the pole tip into the [[#box|box]]. On the final step, the vaulter jumps off the trail leg which should always remain straight and then drives the front knee forward. As the pole slides into the back of the [[#box|box]] the pole begins to bend and the vaulter continues up and forward, leaving the trail leg angled down and behind.

=== Swing up ===
The swing and row simply consists of the vaulter swinging the trail leg forward and rowing the pole, bringing the top arm down to the hips, while trying to keep the trail leg straight to store more potential energy into the pole, the rowing motion also keeps the pole bent for a longer period of time for the vaulter to get into optimum position. Once in a "U" shape the left arm hugs the pole tight to efficiently use the recoil within the pole. The goal is to carry out these motions as thoroughly and as quickly as possible; it is a race against the unbending of the pole. Effectively, this causes a double [[pendulum]] motion, with the top of the pole moving forward and pivoting from the [[#box|box]], while the vaulter acts as a second pendulum pivoting from the right hand. This action gives the vaulter the best position possible to be "ejected" off the pole. The swing continues until the hips are above the head and the arms are pulling the pole close to the chest; from there the vaulter shoots their legs up over the cross bar while keeping the pole close.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usatf.org/groups/coaches/library/2007/Pole%20Vault%20Training/2007NPEP-McGinnis.pdf|title=Mechanics of the pole vault|last=McGinnis|first=Peter|date=December 2015|website=usatf.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/learning-the-pole-vault-3259054|title=How to Do the Pole Vault in Track and Field|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extension ===
The extension refers to the extension of the hips upward with outstretched legs as the shoulders drive down, causing the vaulter to be positioned upside down. This position is often referred to as "inversion". While this phase is executed, the pole begins to recoil, propelling the vaulter quickly upward. The hands of the vaulter remain close to the body as they move from the shins back to the region around the hips and upper torso.

=== Turn ===
The turn is executed immediately after or even during the end of the rockback. As the name implies, the vaulter turns 180° toward the pole while extending the arms down past the head and shoulders. Typically the vaulter will begin to angle their body toward the [[#bar|bar]] as the turn is executed, although ideally the vaulter will remain as vertical as possible. A more accurate description of this phase of the vault may be "the spin" because the vaulter spins around an imaginary axis from head to toe.

=== Fly-away ===
This is often highly emphasized by spectators and novice vaulters, but it is arguably the easiest phase of the vault and is a result of proper execution of previous phases. This phase mainly consists of the vaulter pushing off the pole and releasing it so it falls away from the [[#bar|bar]] and mats. As the torso goes over and around the [[#bar|bar]], the vaulter is facing the bar. Rotation of the body over the bar occurs naturally, and the vaulter's main concern is making sure that their arms, face and any other appendages do not knock the bar off as they go over. The vaulter should land near the middle of the foam landing mats, or [[#pit|pits]], face up.

== Terminology ==
* {{anchor|bar}}'''Bar''': The cross bar that is suspended above the ground by the standards.
* {{anchor|box}}'''Box''': A trapezoidal indentation in the ground with a metal or fiberglass covering at the end of the runway in which vaulters "plant" their pole. The back wall of the box is nearly vertical and is approximately {{convert|8|in|cm}} in depth. The bottom of the box gradually slopes upward approximately {{convert|3|ft|cm|-1}} until it is level with the runway. The covering in the box ensures the pole will slide to the back of the box without catching on anything. The covering's lip overlaps onto the runway and ensures a smooth transition from all-weather surface so a pole being planted does not catch on the box.
* {{anchor|knee}}'''Drive knee''': During the plant phase, the knee is driven forward at the time of "takeoff" to help propel the vaulter upward.
* {{anchor|grip}}'''Grip''': The location of the vaulter's top hand on the pole. As the vaulter improves, their grip may move up the pole incrementally. The other hand is typically placed shoulder-width down from the top hand. Hands are not allowed to grip the very top of the pole (their hand perpendicular to the pole) for safety reasons.
* {{anchor|jump foot}}'''Jump foot''': The foot that the vaulter uses to leave the ground as they begin their vault. It is also referred to as the take-off foot.
* {{anchor|pit}}'''Pit''': The mats used for landing in pole vault.
* {{anchor|plant position}}'''Plant position''': The position a vaulter is in the moment the pole reaches the back of the box and the vaulter begins their vault. Their arms are fully extended and their drive knee begins to come up as they jump.
* {{anchor|pole}}'''Pole''': The fiberglass equipment used to propel the vaulter up and over the bar. One side is stiffer than the other to facilitate the bending of the pole after the plant. A vaulter may rest the pole on their arm to determine which side is the stiff side.
* {{anchor|standards}}'''Standards''': The equipment that holds the bar at a particular height above the ground. Standards may be adjusted to raise and lower the bar and also to adjust the horizontal position of the bar.
* {{anchor|steps}}'''Steps''': Since the box is in a fixed position, vaulters must adjust their approach to ensure they are in the correct position when attempting to vault.
* {{anchor|swing leg|trail leg}}'''Swing leg''' or '''trail leg''': The swing leg is also the jump foot. After a vaulter has left the ground, the leg that was last touching the ground stays extended and swings forward to help propel the vaulter upwards.
* '''[[Volzing]]''': A method of holding or pushing the bar back onto the pegs while jumping over a height. This takes considerable skill, although it is now against the rules and counted as a miss.  The technique is named after U.S. Olympian [[Dave Volz]], who made an art form of the practice and surprised many by making the U.S. Olympic team in 1992.

[[File:StamfordMuseum Bull run memorial jug.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A jug commemorates Ann Blades - a Stamford bull runner in 1792]]

The '''Stamford bull run''', or the '''bull-running in Stamford''', was a [[bull-running]] and [[bull-baiting]] event held on [[Brice of Tours|St Brice]]'s Day (13 November) in the English town of [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], for almost 700 years, until it was ended in 1839.&lt;ref name="Chambers 1864"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chambers Book of Days |first=Robert |last=Chambers |author-link=Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802) |chapter=November 13.

A 1996 ''Journal of Popular Culture'' paper refers to the bull run as a [[festival]], in the academic sense of "the broader context of the medieval if not aboriginal festival calendar",&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/73551/1/j.0022-3840.1996.00233.x.pdf |title=November Bull-running in Stamford, Lincolnshire" |first=Martin W. |last=Walsh |work=Journal of Popular Culture |date=Summer 1996 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1996.00233.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; though works written during and shortly after the activity's later years variously describe it as a "riotous custom", a "hunt", an "old-fashioned, manly, English sport", an "ancient amusement", and – towards its end – an "illegal and disgraceful&amp;nbsp;... proceeding".&lt;ref name="Chambers 1864" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strutt 1801"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England: From the Earliest Period, Including the Rural and Domestic Recreations, May Games, Mummeries, Pageants, Processions and Pompous Spectacles |first1=Joseph |last1=Strutt |author-link=Joseph Strutt (engraver and antiquary) |editor-first=J.

At least one other such regular event survived into fairly modern times, the annual 15 August '''[[Tutbury]] bull-running'''&lt;!--Do not de-boldface this; it redirects here.--&gt; in [[Staffordshire]], which was brought to an end in 1788, the year suppression of the Stamford run also began.&lt;ref name="Strutt 1801" /&gt;  Other such events had also been held in earlier times in [[Axbridge]], [[Canterbury]], [[Wokingham]], and [[Wisbech]] {{crossref|(see [[Bull running]] for an overview)}}.

==Origins==
According to local tradition, the origin of the Stamford custom dated from the time of [[John, King of England|King John]] (1199 - 1216) when [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey]], standing on the battlements of the castle, saw two bulls fighting in the meadow beneath. Some butchers came to part the combatants and one of the bulls ran into the town, causing a great uproar. The earl, mounting his horse, rode after the animal, and enjoyed the sport so much, that he gave the meadow in which the fight began to the butchers of Stamford on condition that they should provide a bull, to be run in the town every 13 November, forever after.&lt;ref name="Walsh" /&gt; The town of Stamford acquired common rights in the grassy floodplain next to the [[River Welland]], which until the last century was known as Bull-meadow, and today just as the Meadows.

Similarly, the [[Tutbury]] run had dubious legendary noble associations, in that case to the 14th-century figure [[John of Gaunt|John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]

==The event==
The ringing of [[St Mary's Church, Stamford|St Mary’s Church]] bells at 10.45 am opened the event, announcing the closing and boarding of shops and the barricading of the street with carts and wagons. By 11&amp;nbsp;am crowds gathered and the bull was released, baited by the cheering of the crowd, and (among other things) a man who would roll towards it in a barrel. It was then chased through the main street and down to Bull-meadow or into the River Welland. It was caught, killed, and butchered. Its meat was provided to the poor and as such the custom by the 1700s was supported as a charity by donations.

Seventeenth-century historians described how the bull was chased and tormented for the day before being driven to Bull-meadow and slaughtered. "Its flesh [was] sold at a low rate to the people, who finished the day's amusement with a supper of bull-beef."&lt;ref name="Chambers 1864" /&gt;

==Suppression and end==
[[File:StamfordMuseum Bull Run Last.jpg|thumb|A painting showing the [[5th Dragoon Guards]] heading down the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] to suppress the bull run in 1839]]
Such an event was a time of drunken disorder. The custom was periodically suppressed and eventually ended in the 19th century. The bull-running in Tutbury, which was more violent and included mutilation of the bull, and involved folk from [[Staffordshire]], [[Derbyshire]], and [[Devonshire]], was ended by the [[Duke of Devonshire]] in 1788.&lt;ref name="Strutt 1801" /&gt; The same year, an unsuccessful attempt (the first recorded) was made to stop the Stamford event.&lt;ref name="Strutt 1801" /&gt;
 
The bull-running in Stamford was the subject of an 1833 campaign by the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]. Some Stamford residents defended their ancient custom as a "traditional, manly, English sport; inspiring courage, agility and presence of mind under danger." Its defenders argued that it was less cruel and dangerous than fox hunting, and one local newspaper asked "Who or what is this London Society that, usurping the place of constituted authorities, presumes to interfere with our ancient amusement?"&lt;ref name="Chambers 1864" /&gt;  A rather noncommittal [[riot]] trial in 1836 tried only five men, and convicted a mere three; this inspired the town to plan an even bigger event for the next year.&lt;ref name="Chambers 1864" /&gt; The mayor of Stamford – at the direction of and with the support of the [[Home Secretary]] – used 200 newly sworn-in [[Special constabulary|special constables]], some military troops, and police brought in from outside, to stop the bull-run of 1837, but it happened anyway. The bull and the people ran through the security line, a riot ensued, and in the end no one was killed (not even the bull, which turned out to have been supplied by or stolen from a local lord, discreetly unnamed in contemporary reports).&lt;ref name="Chambers 1864" /&gt;

The last bull-run of Stamford was in 1839, in the face of an even larger force of soldiers and constables – some of the latter of whom smuggled the bull in themselves. The run was short, with the bull being captured by the peace-keeping forces quickly and without reported serious incident.&lt;ref name="Chambers 1864" /&gt; Because the townsfolk were forced to bear the cost of this militia presence for several years in a row, they agreed to stop the practice on their own henceforth, and kept their word.&lt;ref name="Chambers 1864" /&gt; The last known witness of the bull-running was James Fuller Scholes who spoke of it in a newspaper interview in 1928 before his 94th birthday:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stamford &amp; District News (Closed 1942) |url=http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~dscholes/5034.html |access-date=18 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222034309/http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~dscholes/5034.html |archive-date=22 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }} Interview, 20 August 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I am the only Stamford man living who can remember the bull-running in the streets of the town. I can remember my mother showing me the bull and the horses and men and dogs that chased it. She kept the St Peter's Street – the building that was formerly the Chequers Inn at that time and she showed me the bull-running sport from a bedroom window. I was only four years old then, but I can clearly remember it all. The end of St Peter's Street (where it was joined by Rutland Terrace) was blocked by two farm wagons, and I saw the bull come to the end of the street and return again.}}

'''The Classical''' is a sports website featuring long-form sports articles. Described as the sports equivalent of [[The Awl]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dylan Stableford |url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/cutline/classical-looks-kickstart-awl-inspired-sports-215111183.html |title=The Classical looks to kickstart Awl-inspired sports site |publisher=Yahoo |date=2011-08-16 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the site was launched in December 2011 by several members of the basketball blog ''FreeDarko'', including [[Bethlehem Shoals]] and Eric Freeman, and features other writers such as David Roth, Eric Nusbaum, [[Tom Scharpling]], Tim Marchman and [[Lang Whitaker]].&lt;ref name="kickstarter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/101341727/the-classical |title=The Classical by The Classical |publisher=Kickstarter |date=2011-08-15 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In August 2011, it was announced that Shoals and others would be launching a sports website featuring a prominent collection of writers that had written for Sports Illustrated, ESPN, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Nation, Slate, Deadspin, GQ and other publications.&lt;ref name="kickstarter" /&gt; A [[Kickstarter]] page was established by the site's founders, and $50,000 were raised to help maintain the site for its first year.&lt;ref name="kickstarter" /&gt; The Classical launched in December 2011.&lt;ref name="columbia" /&gt;

The site's approach to long-form sports writing instantly drew comparisons to Grantland,&lt;ref name="columbia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack Dickey |url=http://deadspin.com/5830909/a-gaggle-of-clever-sportswriters-is-starting-a-long+form-web-concern |title=A Gaggle Of Clever Sportswriters Is Starting A Long-Form Web Concern |publisher=Deadspin |date=2011-08-15 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ESPN-funded website that had been launched by [[Bill Simmons]] the year before.

On the site's Kickstarter page,&lt;ref name="kickstarter" /&gt; the founders of The Classical wrote that the intention of the site was to create something completely original, stating: "We will make no attempt to be comprehensive, or even to offer a reliable guide to the world of sport at a given moment. We will not try to be a smarter version of what you can find elsewhere. Instead, The Classical will be a running, wide-ranging conversation between us and our readers about baseball, basketball, soccer, football and fighting, and about things that aren't sports, too. Our model in this regard is The Awl, a site for which many of us have written and which all of us love."

==Name==
The name of the site is in reference to the first track of the 1982 album [[Hex Enduction Hour]], by the English post-punk band [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]].&lt;ref name="punk"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kat Stoeffel |url=http://observer.com/2011/08/the-classical-will-publish-post-punk-sports-journalism-if-we-kickstart-them/ |title=The Classical Will Publish Post-Punk Sports Journalism... If We Kickstart Them |publisher=The New York Observer |date=2011-08-16 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Beatty, one of the site's founders, said the name was appropriate since "it is probably fair to describe The Classical as post-punk sports journalism."&lt;ref name="punk" /&gt;

'''The Maer Ground''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]], [[Devon]]. It is the home ground of [[Exmouth Cricket Club]] and is also used regularly by [[Devon County Cricket Club]].

The first recorded match played on the ground was in 1874 when Devon played Will-o'-the-Wisp. From 1883 to 1889 the ground played host to eight matches between Devon and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]].  In 1951, the Maer hosted Devon's first [[Minor Counties Championship]] match against [[Berkshire County Cricket Club|Berkshire]], and has since played host to 49 Minor Counties Championship matches. The ground played host to a Women's [[One Day International]] between [[England women's cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand women's cricket team|New Zealand]] in the [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|1973 Women's World Cup]].  In 1986, it hosted its first [[List A cricket|List A]] match in the [[1986 NatWest Trophy]] between Devon and [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]], which Devon lost by 59 runs. The Maer has hosted 16 List A matches, the last of which came in the [[2005 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy]] when Devon hosted [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]]. In 2004 the ground played host to one of the biggest upsets in [[county cricket]] history when Devon defeated [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] by losing fewer wickets in tying with Leicestershire's score of 156.  In 2008, the ground played host to the touring [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]], who defeated Devon by ten runs in a one-day match.
