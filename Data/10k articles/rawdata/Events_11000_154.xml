==Cancellation==
Prior to the date of the event, the Latin Grammys were moved from Miami to Los Angeles due to protests by [[Cuban exile]]s for allowing musicians living in Cuba to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1446795/latin-grammys-relocated-to-avoid-miami-protests/|title=Latin Grammys Relocated To Avoid Miami Protests|last=Vanhorn|first=Teri|website=[[MTV]]|date=2001-08-20|accessdate=2014-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were to have been presented at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California|CA]] with a [[CBS]] national telecast on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. It was to be hosted by [[Jimmy Smits]] and [[Christina Aguilera]]. The telecast was cancelled because of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]] that morning in [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2001-09-12/entertainment/17616114_1_theme-parks-latin-grammys-fashion-week|title=Attack forces cancellations / L.A.

Instead, the winners were announced at a press conference on October 30 at the [[Conga Room]]. The cancellation of the event cost the organizers an estimate of two million dollars in losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garza|first1=Augustin|title=Latin Grammys Struggle With Loss of Momentum|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/may/18/entertainment/et-gurza18|accessdate=2014-09-24|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2002-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''9th World Science Fiction Convention''', also known as '''Nolacon I''', was held 1–3 September 1951 at the St. Charles Hotel in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], United States.
&lt;!--
The supporting organization was the [[ORG]].  
--&gt;
The chairman was Harry B. Moore.
The guest of honor was [[Fritz Leiber]].  
Total attendance was approximately 190. The at-the-door membership price was US$1, the same price charged from the [[1st World Science Fiction Convention|1st]] through the [[12th World Science Fiction Convention|12th]] Worldcon

Other pros attending included [[Robert Bloch]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[Judith Merril]], [[E.E. Smith]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], editor [[John W. Campbell]] and fantasy artist [[Hannes Bok]], who did Nolacon's program book cover. Famous fans present included [[Sam Moskowitz]], [[Wilson Tucker]] (aka Bob Tucker), [[Dave Kyle]], [[Roger Sims]], [[Terry Carr]], and [[Lee Hoffman]]. The latter, editor of the very popular fanzine ''Quandry'', whom everyone assumed was male, turned out to be a young woman, a ‘revelation’ which greatly startled even those who had corresponded with her.

Notable events included world premiere screenings of ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day The Earth Stood Still]]'' and ''[[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide]]'', plus a continuous two-day-long party in Room 770 at the St. Charles Hotel that became legendary following the convention not only for its duration but for its high quality. Mike Glyer's long-running newszine ''[[File 770]]'', named in commemoration of this party, has won the [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine]] a number of times.&lt;ref name="fancyc"/&gt;

[[Hugo Award]]s were not presented at this Worldcon as the awards were not proposed until the following year, 1952, with the first Hugos actually presented in 1953 at the [[11th World Science Fiction Convention]]. However, in 2001 at the [[59th World Science Fiction Convention]] held in [[Philadelphia]], a set of [[Retro Hugo Award]]s were presented to honor work that would have been Hugo-eligible had the award existed in 1951. A "Certificate of Merit" was presented to representatives of ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'' by the Nolacon I chairman, and this was reported on [[Movietone News]] at the time.&lt;ref name="cert"/&gt;

==In science fiction culture==
*Nolacon is a plot point in ''The Case of the Little Green Men'', the first novel by [[Mack Reynolds]], which is set in part at "AnnCon", a fictional version of the [[10th World Science Fiction Convention]] held in 1952.&lt;ref name="nyt510923"/&gt; The real 10th Worldcon, held in [[Chicago]], had no actual name like "AnnCon", being simply called, in its own publications, "the 10th Annual World Science Fiction Convention" (and once as "the 10th Annual Science Fiction Convention," likely a dropped-word [[linotype machine|linotype]] operator's typo). Before and during the convention, its attendees often referred to it as "Chicon II," an unofficial [[nickname]] that stuck to this Chicago Worldcon in the decades that followed.

'''''Alessandro''''' ([[Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] 21), is an [[opera]] composed by [[George Frideric Handel]] in 1726 for the [[Royal Academy of Music (company)|Royal Academy of Music]]. [[Paolo Rolli]]'s [[libretto]] is based on the story of [[Ortensio Mauro]]'s ''La superbia d'Alessandro''. This was the first time the famous singers [[Faustina Bordoni]] and [[Francesca Cuzzoni]] appeared together in one of Handel's operas. The original cast also included Francesco Bernardi who was known as [[Senesino]].

Handel had originally planned ''Alessandro'' to be his first contribution to the 1725—1726 season of the Royal Academy. However, Bordoni did not arrive in London in time to stage ''Alessandro'', and Handel substituted his own ''[[Scipione]]'' in March and April 1726 until her arrival. The opera received its first performance on 5 May 1726 at the [[King's Theatre, London]],&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard G., "Classical History and Handel's ''Alessandro''" (February 1996). ''[[Music &amp; Letters]]'', '''77''' (1): pp. 34–63.&lt;/ref&gt; and was received "with great applause".&lt;ref name="Master Musicians"/&gt;

The story recounts [[Alexander the Great]]'s journey to India and depicts him less in a heroic vein than as vainglorious as well as indecisive in matters of the heart. The work's charm and lightness of touch make it at times almost a comic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Robert|title=Elegant, Beautifully Performed Handel|url=http://www.classicstoday.com/review/elegant-beautifully-performed-handel/|website=Classics Today|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:London Kings Theatre Haymarket.jpg|thumb|The King's Theatre, London, where ''Alessandro'' had its first performance]]
The German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had brought Italian opera for the first time with his opera ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]''. A tremendous success, ''Rinaldo'' created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed [[Kapellmeister|music director]] of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music (unconnected with the present day London conservatoire), a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, W. &amp; J.M. Knapp (1995) Handel's operas 1704-1726, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qw8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA273 |title=Essays on Handel and Italian opera by Reinhard Strohm |via=[[Google Books]] |date= |accessdate=2013-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handel had composed numerous Italian operas for the Academy, with varying degrees of success; some were enormously popular. In February 1726 Handel revived his ''[[Ottone]]'', which had been spectacularly successful at its first performances in 1723 and was again a hit at its revival, with a London newspaper reporting
&lt;blockquote&gt;Handel had the satisfaction of seeing an Old Opera of his not only fill the House, which had not been done for some time, but above three hundred turn'd away for want of room.&lt;ref name="Master Musicians"&gt;Burrows 2012, p.154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Portrait of soprano Susannah Maria Cibber.jpg|left|thumb| Francesca Cuzzoni, who created the role of Lisaura]]
As the newspaper notes, full houses were by no means a regular occurrence by that time, and the directors of the Royal Academy of Music decided to increase audiences' interest by bringing another celebrated international opera star, Italian soprano Faustina Bordoni, to join established London favourites Francesca Cuzzoni and the star castrato Senesino in the company's performances. Many opera companies in Italy featured two leading ladies in one opera and Faustina (as she was known) and Cuzzoni had appeared together in opera performances in various European cities with no trouble; there is no indication that there was any bad feeling or ill-will between the two of them prior to their London joint appearances.&lt;ref name="Master Musicians"/&gt;&lt;ref name=House/&gt;

The three stars, Bordoni, Cuzzoni and Senesino commanded astronomical fees, making much more money from the opera seasons than Handel did.&lt;ref name=Snowman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snowman|first1=Daniel|title=The Gilded Stage: A Social History of Opera|date=2010|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1843544661}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opera company would have been aware that the story of the two princesses in love with Alexander the Great chosen for the two prima donnas' first joint appearance was familiar to London audiences through a tragedy by [[Nathaniel Lee]], ''The Rival Queens, or the Death of Alexander the Great'', first performed in 1677 and often revived and it may be that they were encouraging the idea that the two singers were rivals.&lt;ref name=House/&gt; One of the agents who had arranged Faustina's appearances in London, [[Owen Swiny]], explicitly warned against the choice of libretto as likely to cause "disorder" in a letter to the directors of the Royal Academy of Music, imploring them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;never to consent to any thing that can put the Academy into disorder, as it must, certainly, if what I hear … is put in Execution: I mean the opera of Alexander the great; where there is to be a Struggle between the Rival Queen’s, for a Superiority.&lt;ref name=Hyperion&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Anthony|title=Programme Notes for "The Rival Queens"|url=http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/al.asp?al=CDA66950|publisher=Hyperion Records|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The performances of ''Alessandro'' went off with no signs of animosity between Bordoni and Cuzzoni or their respective supporters, but it was not very long after that tension between the two erupted. As 18th century musicologist [[Charles Burney]] observed about the Cuzzoni / Faustina rivalry, which became acute around the time of the performances of a subsequent Handel opera, ''[[Admeto]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;it seems impossible for two singers of equal merit to tread the stage ''a parte eguale'', as for two people to ride on the same horse, without one being behind.&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dean|first1=Winton|title=The New Grove Handel|date=1997|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=978-0393303582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Royal Academy of Music collapsed at the end of the 1728 - 29 season, partly due to the huge fees paid to the star singers, and Cuzzoni and Faustina both left London for engagements in continental Europe. Handel started a new opera company with a new prima donna, [[Anna Strada]]. One of Handel's librettists, [[Paolo Antonio Rolli|Paolo Rolli]], wrote in a letter (the original is in Italian) that Handel said that Strada "sings better than the two who have left us, because one of them (Faustina) never pleased him at all and he would like to forget the other (Cuzzoni)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lotario|url=https://handelhendrix.org/learn/about-handel/opera-synopses/lotario/|website=handelhendrix.org|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
:Place: Oxidraca, India
:Time: Approx. 326 BC

===Act 1===
A battle is in progress with Alessandro (Alexander the Great), besieging the Indian city of Oxidraca. Despite the many victories he has won elsewhere, the city's defenders get the best of his army and he is in personal danger when he is rescued by his general Clito ([[Clitus the Black]]), Prince of Macedonia.

In Alexander's camp, two princesses, both in love with Alessandro, are much concerned for his safety—Lisaura, a princess of Scythia, and Rossane ([[Roxana]]), a princess taken captive by Alessandro in his previous campaign in Persia. The rival princesses are tormented by jealousy for Alessandro seems unable to make up his mind which of them he prefers. The Indian King Tassile, whose life Alessandro saved and whose throne he restored, brings the glad tidings to the princesses that Alessandro is safe and unharmed. Both ladies are overjoyed at the news, which grieves Tassile, as he is hopelessly smitten with Princess Lisaura.

In the temple of Jupiter, Alessandro gives thanks for yet another glorious victory, but his apparent invincibility has gone to his head. He announces that he is a god, the son of the divine Jupiter, and orders that he shall be worshiped as such. General Clito protests at this sacrilege, enraging Alessandro, who orders Clito's execution, but he eventually yields to pleas from the princesses to show mercy.

===Act 2===
[[File:AlexanderTheGreat Bust Transparent.png|thumb|Alexander the Great]]
Alessandro, finding both princesses captivating, still cannot decide between the two of them. He encourages them both equally, which drives the ladies to distraction. Rossane, a captive, makes melting appeals to Alessandro to free her and show his magnanimity. Alessandro hesitates to do so, fearing that she will then leave him, but finally agrees to release her from her bondage.

Meanwhile, General Leonato and others of Alessandro's officers are appalled at his seeming descent into insane megalomania, and they plot to assassinate him.

In Alessandro's quarters, he announces to the assembled generals that he intends to divide the vast territories he has conquered between them and give them all away. His status as a living god to be worshiped will suffice for him. General Clito is once again compelled by his conscience to denounce such arrogance, whereupon Alessandro is about to run him through with his sword, but suddenly, as part of a plot by the conspirators, the roof caves in. Miraculously, no one is injured, which only reinforces Alessandro's conviction that he is beloved of the gods. Alessandro orders his sycophantic follower Cleone to lead Clito to jail.

Rossane has heard of the assassination attempt on Alessandro and believes it to have been successful. She weeps and mourns in despair, and Alessandro, overhearing this, is deeply touched by such devotion and decides she will be the woman of his choice. No sooner has he made this clear to her, however, than King Tassile brings the news that the people of Oxidraca, who seemed to have been finally conquered, are staging a revolt. Alessandro rushes to battle, leaving Rossane once again anxiously praying for his safety.

===Act 3===
[[File:Zanetti senesino.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature of Senesino, who created the role of Alessandro]]
General Leonato frees Clito from prison and throws Cleone in jail instead, but Cleone is also released by his supporters.The conspirators are now resolved to wage open warfare against their former leader, Alessandro, leading large parts of his army in a mutiny. Cleone is aware of this plot and informs Alessandro.

Alessandro, having decided to take Rossane as wife, breaks the news gently to Princess Lisaura, explaining that he is not good enough for her and that King Tassile, his dearest friend, loves her and he must not stand in the way of Tassile making Lisaura his queen. Tassile is overjoyed.

The conspirators and the mutinous army launch into battle against Alessandro, but King Tassile supports him with his troops and the conspirators are defeated. They beg for mercy, which Alessandro generously grants. Alessandro will marry Rossane, Tassile will have Lisaura, all are forgiven and praise the great hero's magnaminity.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beasly|first1=Gregg|title=Alessandro|url=https://handelhendrix.org/learn/about-handel/opera-synopses/alessandro/|website=handelhendrix.org|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synopsis of Alessandro |url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/NewDesign/fintro.files/bintro.files/operas/Alessandro(George_Frideric_Handel).htm |publisher=Naxos records |accessdate=2 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117061636/http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/NewDesign/fintro.files/bintro.files/operas/Alessandro%28George_Frideric_Handel%29.htm |archivedate=17 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical features==
After the overture, the opera begins with rousing battle music featuring trumpet and drums. Handel is very careful to give both leading ladies equal opportunities; they make their entrances simultaneously and they have an equal number of arias and one duet together.&lt;ref name=Aspden&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aspden|first1=Susanne|title=The Rival Sirens: Performance and Identity on Handel's Operatic Stage |date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1107033375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handel differentiates between the two princesses through his music; Lisaura is given melancholy and expressive music with a pensive and brooding quality, whereas the music for Rossane portrays her as scheming and spirited with some vocal writing of enormous virtuoso demands.&lt;ref name=Burrows&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burrows|first1=Donald|title=The Cambridge Companion to Handel|series=[[Cambridge Companions to Music]]|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521456135}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Paul Henry Lang]], Rossane's love music in act two as she waits for Alessandro is "Handel at his idylllic- pastoral best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Paul Henry|title=George Frideric Handel|year=2011|edition=reprint|publisher=Dover Books on Music|isbn=978-0-486-29227-4|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera is scored for two recorders, two oboes, bassoon, two trumpets, two horns, strings and [[Figured bass|continuo]].(cello, lute, harpsichord).

==Reception and performance history==
''Alessandro'' was a resounding success, with a run of thirteen performances, which would have been greater had Senesino not become indisposed necessitating cancellation of more.&lt;ref name="Burrows" /&gt; Lady Sarah Cowper complained in a letter that it was difficult to get tickets.&lt;ref name="DeanHO"&gt;Winton Dean: ''Handel’s Operas, 1726–1741.'' Boydell &amp; Brewer, London 2006, Reprint: The Boydell Press, Woodbridge 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-84383-268-3}}, S. 24 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Handel revived the work in his seasons of 1727 and 1732.&lt;ref name="Worklist"/&gt; [[Horace Walpole]] recalled years later that at the performance he saw, during the opening scene depicting the siege of Oxidraca, Senesino "So far forgot himself in the heat of the conquest, as to stick his sword into one of the pasteboard stones of the wall of the town, and bore it in triumph before him."&lt;ref name="DeanHO" /&gt;

As with all Baroque opera seria, ''Alessandro'' went unperformed for many years, but with the revival of interest in Baroque music and [[Historically informed performance|historically informed musical performance]]  since the 1960s,''Alessandro'', like all Handel operas, receives performances at festivals and opera houses today.&lt;ref name="Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=Handel:A Biographical Introduction|url=http://gfhandel.org/handel/biography.html|website=GF Handel.org|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other performances, ''Alessandro'' was produced at the [[Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe]] in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alessandro|url=http://spielzeit12-13.staatstheater.karlsruhe.de/programm/info/1161/|publisher=Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Palace of Versailles]] as part of the Versailles Festival in May and June 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handel Alessandro|url=http://www.chateauversailles-spectacles.fr/en/spectacles/2013/haendel-alessandro|publisher=Versailles Festival|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Athens Festival]] also in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alessandro |url=http://www.greekfestival.gr/en/mobile/event373-camerata---orchestra-of--the-friends-of-music---lucinda-childs.htm |website=Athens-Epidaurus Festival |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210641/http://www.greekfestival.gr/en/mobile/event373-camerata---orchestra-of--the-friends-of-music---lucinda-childs.htm |archivedate=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''American Friends''''' is a 1991 British film starring [[Michael Palin]]. It was written by Palin and its director, [[Tristram Powell]].

==Plot==
Palin plays Francis Ashby, a senior [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] professor on holiday in the [[Swiss Alps]] in 1861. There he meets the American Caroline Hartley ([[Connie Booth]]) and her 18-year-old [[Ward (law)|ward]] Elinor ([[Trini Alvarado]]). Ashby is drawn to them both, particularly Elinor, but is rather surprised when they arrive in Oxford and rent a house. Women are not allowed in the College, nor are [[Fellow]]s allowed to marry, which puts him in an embarrassing situation.

'''B-Boy Park''' is a [[Japan]]ese [[hip hop]] festival that takes place every year in [[Tokyo]]. It is free admission and open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bboypark.com/i/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914033401/http://www.bboypark.com/i/ |date=2008-09-14 }} B-Boy Park Website (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent player on the [[Japanese hip hop]] scene, Crazy-A, organized the annual hip hop festival in [[Yoyogi Park]] in 1999. It is a celebration of hip hop music, dance, fashion and culture. 

At its inaugural event, American break dancer, [[Crazy Legs (dancer)|Crazy Legs]], judged the dance competition. However, he was not completely satisfied with the overall performance of Japanese break dancers. He commented that they needed to focus more on footwork, and less on "power moves".&lt;ref&gt;Condry, Ian. Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006, pp66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Author Ian Condry notes that the festival is extremely important to a hip hop scene that many doubted could even exist: “Up until the mid-nineties, people who worked in the entertainment world pointed to hip hop’s rootedness in African American communities as a reason to doubt its possible takeoff in Japan, where different understandings of race, language, and social class prevail.” &lt;ref&gt;Condry, Ian. Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, the festival continues to draw rappers, b-boys and girls, and hip hop fans from all corners of Japan, representing a plethora of styles that reflect the richness and diversity of the Japanese hip hop scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bboypark.com/ BBOYPARK.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3712">[[File:Bent's Hall, 1879.jpg|thumb|right|Bent's Opera House]]
'''Bent's Opera House''', also known as '''Bent's Hall''', is a three-story building located at 444 Main Street in [[Medina, New York]], in the United States. The building is made of Medina Sandstone and features an opera house on the top floor. Construction began in 1864 and was completed early the next year. The building is named for Don Carlos Bent, a local farmer who owned the property and had the structure erected. A formal dedication ceremony was held on February&amp;nbsp;28, 1865, featuring remarks by a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] officer and patriotic pageantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waldo |first=Russell |title=Medina's Old Hitching Post Days-May 19, 1954 |url=http://www.eggstreet.org/Bent's%20History.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524095909/http://www.eggstreet.org/Bent%27s%20History.pdf |archivedate=May 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many decades, Bent's Opera House was a prominent venue in Medina for concerts, plays, shows, commencements, elections, and other public functions. [[P. T. Barnum]] and [[Buffalo Bill|William "Buffalo Bill" Cody]] were among the hundreds of touring performers who brought their talents to the Bent's stage.

As motion pictures and other forms of entertainment became popular in the twentieth century, the Opera House fell into disuse. Yet its legacy was not completely forgotten, as Bent's Hall was included as a contributing property to Medina's [[Main Street Historic District (Medina, New York)|Main Street Historic District]], which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1995.

In 2010, [[Bank of America]], the building's last commercial owner, donated the Bent's Hall property to the Orleans Renaissance Group, Inc. (ORG), a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to bringing arts and cultural programs to the greater Medina community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kropf |first=Virginia |title=Historic Medina opera donated to local group |url=http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_b630c1e6-083e-5f7c-9b53-dab2b5aa6850.html?mode=story |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204031509/http://thedailynewsonline.com/news/article_b630c1e6-083e-5f7c-9b53-dab2b5aa6850.html?mode=story |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |newspaper=Batavia Daily News |date=November 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of ORG hope to restore the Opera House to its former glory as a functioning performance venue.

In 2012, Bent's Opera House was included on the Preservation League of New York State's annual "Seven to Save" list. This list highlights "valued historic resources [that] are in danger of disappearing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservenys.org/seven-2012/seven-05.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311201757/http://www.preservenys.org/seven-2012/seven-05.html |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Break the Ice''' ('''BTI''') was a [[hardcore punk]] festival held in [[Melbourne, Australia]] in 2012, 2013, and 2014. It was run by [[Broken Hive Records]] and though short-lived, it was a significant event in the [[Australian hardcore]] calendar, attracting hundreds of punters each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restassuredzine.com/tours/1613-break-the-ice-fest-2013-first-lineup-announced|title=BREAK THE ICE Fest 2013 First Lineup Announced|publisher=Restassuredzine|date=|accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival began in 2012 as the feature date on the national tour for well-known band [[Trapped Under Ice (band)|Trapped Under Ice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombshellzine.com/blog/2012/01/break-the-ice-fest-announced/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005356/http://www.bombshellzine.com/blog/2012/01/break-the-ice-fest-announced/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-12-03|title=Break The Ice Fest Announced|publisher=Bombshellzine|date=|accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspiration for the fest comes from similar styled multi-day hardcore punk festivals in the USA such as This Is Hardcore and Sound and Fury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brokenhiverecords.tumblr.com/post/28819212698/what-would-your-opinion-be-on-having-an-australian|title=Australian Sound and Fury|publisher=Broken Hive Records|date=|accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the festival turned into a 2-day event with a more purposeful focus on other aspects of the hardcore music scene consisting of a trade market place, a bigger presence of local [[Independent record label|DIY labels]], stalls selling [[Veganism|vegan]] baked goods and an increased sense of community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/news/17009/break-the-ice-2013-final-announcement/|title=Break The Ice 2013 final announcement|publisher=Killyourstereo.com|date=|accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subsequent 2014 event would be the last.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="900">'''Broadway On Ice''' is a long-running ice show produced by Willy Bietak Productions.  Dating back to the early 1980s, in recent years the show has been presented in theatrical venues in resort areas such as [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Branson, Missouri]] with a rotating cast of skating and musical guest stars, rather than as a touring ice show.  The format of the show is a [[revue]] using music from popular [[Broadway theatre]] shows.  

Skaters who have been featured in the show include [[Nancy Kerrigan]], [[Dorothy Hamill]], [[Brian Boitano]], [[Oksana Baiul]], and [[Rudy Galindo]].  Musical guest stars have included [[Davis Gaines]], [[Deborah Gibson]], and [[Leslie Uggams]], [[Franc D'Ambrosio]].

'''Buddha's Birthday''' is a [[holiday]] traditionally celebrated in most of [[East Asia]] to commemorate the birth of the [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha Gautama]], later the Gautama Buddha and founder of [[Buddhism]]. It is also celebrated in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] as ''[[Vesak]]'' which also acknowledges the enlightenment and death of the Buddha. According to the Theravada [[Tripitaka]] [[Buddhist texts|scriptures]]{{Which|date=November 2010}} (from Pali, meaning "three baskets"), Gautama was born in [[Lumbini]] in ancient India now in modern-day [[Nepal]], in the year 563 B.C., according to the Nepalese Account, and raised in [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/666 Lumbini in Nepal is the birthplace of the Lord Buddha], Gethin ''Foundations'', p. 19, which states that in the mid-3rd century BCE the Emperor [[Ashoka]] determined that Lumbini was Gautama's birthplace and thus installed a pillar there with the inscription: "... this is where the Buddha, sage of the Śākyas (''Śākyamuni''), was born."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Gethin ''Foundations'', p. 14, states: "The earliest Buddhist sources state that the future Buddha was born Siddhārtha Gautama (Pali Siddhattha Gotama), the son of a local chieftain—a ''rājan''—in Kapilavastu (Pali Kapilavatthu) what is now the Indian–Nepalese border." However, Professor Gombrich (''Theravāda Buddhism'', p. 1) and the old but specialized study by Edward Thomas, ''The Life of the Buddha'', ascribe the name Siattha/fitta to later sources.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of thirty five, he attained enlightenment ([[nirvana]]) underneath a Bodhi tree at [[Bodhgaya]] (modern day [[India]]). He delivered his first sermon at [[Sarnath]], India. At the age of eighty, he died at [[Kushinagar]], India.&lt;ref name="diamondway-buddhism.org"&gt;https://www.diamondway-buddhism.org/buddhism/buddha/&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date of Buddha's Birthday is based on the Asian [[lunisolar calendar]]s. The date for the celebration of Buddha's Birthday varies from year to year in the Western Gregorian calendar, but usually falls in April or May. In leap years it may be celebrated in June.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Buddha discourse under tree.jpg|thumb|225px|left| Enlightened Buddha with disciples - Traditional Image]] --&gt;
The exact date of Buddha's Birthday is based on the Asian lunisolar calendars and is primarily celebrated in [[Baisakh]] month of the [[Buddhist calendar]] and the [[Bikram Sambat]] Hindu calendar, and hence it is also called [[Vesak]]. In modern-day India and Nepal, where the Historical [[Buddha]] lived, it is celebrated on the full moon day of the [[Vaisakha]] month of the Buddhist calendar. In Theravada countries following the Buddhist calendar, it falls on a full moon Uposatha day, typically in the 5th or 6th lunar month.

In most Japanese temples, Buddha's birth is now celebrated on the Gregorian calendar date April 8; only a few (mainly in Okinawa) celebrate it on the orthodox Chinese calendar date of the eighth day of the fourth lunar month.

====India====
India is the land where the Buddha attained enlightenment ([[nirvana]]) at Bodhgaya and established Buddhism. Buddha spent majority of his life in what is now modern day India. Some of the holiest sites associated with Buddha's life include Bodhgaya (place of enlightenment), [[Sarnath]] (site of first sermon), [[Sravasti]] and [[Rajgir]] (site where Buddha spent the greater part of his monastic life and delivered majority of his discourses), and [[Kushinagar]] (site where Buddha attained Parinirvana and passed away)&lt;ref&gt;https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/f/fa-hien/f15l/chapter20.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aboutbuddha.org/english/life-of-buddha-4.htm/&lt;/ref&gt; Under Emperor [[Ashoka]], Buddhism spread from India to other nations.&lt;ref name="diamondway-buddhism.org"/&gt; ''Buddha Purnima'' or ''Buddha Jayanthi'' in South India or ''[[Tathagata]]'' is a public holiday in India.The public holiday for Buddha purnima in India was initiated  by [[Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar]] when he was the minister of social justice &lt;ref&gt;http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/india/&lt;/ref&gt; It is celebrated especially in [[Sikkim]], [[Ladakh]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Bodh Gaya]], various parts of North Bengal such as [[Kalimpong]], [[Darjeeling]], and [[Kurseong]], and [[Maharashtra]] (where 73% of total Indian [[Buddhist]]s live) and other parts of India as per Indian calendar. Buddhists go to common [[Viharas]] to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra, akin to a service. The dress code is pure white. [[semi-vegetarianism|Non-vegetarian]] food is normally avoided. [[Kheer]], a sweet rice porridge is commonly served to recall the story of Sujata, a maiden who, in Gautama Buddha's life, offered the Buddha a bowl of milk [[porridge]]. 
Informally called "Buddha's Birthday", it actually commemorates the birth, enlightenment (nirvāna), and death (Parinirvāna) of Gautama Buddha in the Theravada tradition. Tibetans in exile remember Buddha's birthday on the 7th day of the Saga Dawa month (fourth month of the Tibetan calendar), which culminates with Buddha's parinirvana celebrations on the full moon day.

It is said that the Buddha originally followed the way of [[asceticism]] to attain enlightenment sooner, as was thought by many at that time. He sat for a prolonged time with inadequate food and water, which caused his body to shrivel so as to be indistinguishable from the bark of the tree that he was sitting under. Seeing the weak Siddhartha Gautama, a woman named Sujata placed a bowl of  "Kheer" in front of him as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Us9wbjmvXfgC&amp;pg=PT32&amp;dq=sujata++bakraur#v=onepage&amp;q=sujata%20%20bakraur&amp;f=false | title=Knowing Buddha Life and Teachings| isbn=9788122309638| last1=Prasoon| first1=Shrikant| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that without food one can do nothing, the Buddha refrained from harming his own body. Thereafter, he would go on to attain nirvana.

The Japanese celebration on 8 April has been significant in the [[Bay Area]] for some decades. In 1968 the first [[circumambulation]] of Mt. Tamalpais to celebrate Buddha's Birthday was conducted. Starting in 1969 at Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, ''Hana-Matsuri'' was celebrated each spring. Dressed in formal black robes, the roughly 70 monks and students formed a formal procession to the Horse Pasture with the leader periodically ringing a small, clear bell. A temporary stone altar was built under a huge oak tree in a gorgeous field of green grass and abundant wildflowers; a small statue of a baby Buddha was placed upon it in a metal basin. Then each person would in turn approach the altar, ladle one thin-lipped bamboo dipperful of sweet green tea over the statue, bow, and walk to one side.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japanese-city.com/calendar/events/index.php?eID=32066&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New York City|New York]], the ''International Lotus Lantern Parade'' has been a notable and successful annual event held at [[Union Square Park]]. The event celebrates the Buddha's birthday and ''Yeon Deung Hoe'' (연등회), a Korean lantern celebration that is held during Vesak. The festival features a number of Buddhist themed events and is started off by numerous Buddhist centres of Japanese, Korean and Sri Lankan origins for example.&lt;ref&gt;http://nycviewsandnews.blog.com/2012/05/07/lotus-lantern-parade/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://interfaithcenter.org/archives/5318&lt;/ref&gt;

The current '''conflict in the Niger Delta''' first arose in the early 1990s over tensions between [[multinational corporation|foreign]] [[oil industry|oil corporations]] and a number of the [[Niger Delta]]'s minority ethnic groups who feel they are being exploited, particularly the [[Ogoni people|Ogoni]] and the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]]. Ethnic and political unrest has continued throughout the 1990s despite the conversion to [[democracy]]{{clarify|date=November 2016}} and the election of the [[Obasanjo]] government in 1999. Competition for [[petroleum politics|oil wealth]] has fueled violence between [[ethnic groups]], causing the militarization of nearly the entire region by ethnic militia groups, [[Military of Nigeria|Nigerian military]] and police forces, notably the [[Nigerian Mobile Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koos|first=Carlo|last2=Pierskalla|first2=Jan|date=2015-01-20|title=The Effects of Oil Production and Ethnic Representation on Violent Conflict in Nigeria: A Mixed-Methods Approach |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09546553.2014.962021|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/09546553.2014.962021|issn=0954-6553}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence has contributed to Nigeria's [[Nigerian energy supply crisis|ongoing energy supply crisis]] by discouraging foreign investment in new power generation plants in the region.

From 2004 on, violence also hit the oil industry with piracy and kidnappings. In 2009, a presidential amnesty program accompanied with support and training of ex-militants proved to be a success. Thus until 2011, victims of crimes were fearful of seeking justice for crimes committed against them because of a failure to prosecute those responsible for human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/africa/nigeria0205/1.htm|title=Violence in Nigeria's Oil Rich Rivers State in 2004 : Summary |publisher=Hrw.org|accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{see also|Environmental issues in the Niger Delta|Petroleum industry in Nigeria|Niger Delta|Warri Crisis}}
Nigeria, after nearly four decades of oil production, had by the early 1980s become almost completely  economically dependent on petroleum extraction, which at the time generated 25% of its [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. This portion has since risen to 60%, as of 2008. Despite the vast wealth created by petroleum, the benefits have been slow to trickle down to the majority of the population, who since the 1960s have increasingly been forced to abandon their traditional [[agricultural]] practices. Annual production of both cash and food crops dropped significantly in the later decades of 20th century. [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] production dropped by 43% for example; Nigeria was the world's largest cocoa exporter in 1960. [[Rubber]] production dropped by 29%, [[cotton]] by 65%, and [[peanut|groundnut]]s by 64%.&lt;ref name=vultures&gt;Where Vultures Feast (Okonta and Douglas, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; While many skilled, well-paid Nigerians have been employed by oil corporations, the majority of Nigerians and most especially the people of the Niger Delta states and the far north have become poorer since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialaction.org/shell/report/intro.html |title=Untitled|publisher=Essentialaction.org |accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Delta region has a steadily growing population estimated at more than 30 million people in 2005, and accounts for more than 23% of Nigeria's total population. The population density is also among the highest in the world, with 265 people per square kilometre, according to the [[Niger Delta Development Commission]]. This population is expanding at a rapid 3% per year and the oil capital, [[Port Harcourt]], and other large towns are also growing quickly. [[Poverty]] and [[urbanization]] in Nigeria are growing, and official [[corruption]] is considered a fact of life. The resulting scenario is one in which urbanization does not bring accompanying economic growth to provide jobs.&lt;ref name=vultures/&gt;

===OGONILAND ===
{{See also|Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People|Ken Saro-Wiwa}}
[[Ogoniland]] is a {{convert|404|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} region in the southeast of the [[Niger Delta]] basin. Economically viable [[petroleum]] was discovered in Ogoniland in 1957, just one year after the discovery of Nigeria's first commercial petroleum deposit. [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Chevron Corporation]] set up shop there throughout the next two decades. The [[Ogoni people]], a minority ethnic group of about half a million people who call Ogoniland home, and other ethnic groups in the region attest that during this time, the government began forcing them to abandon their land to oil companies without consultation, offering negligible compensation.

A 1979 constitutional amendment gave the federal government full ownership and rights to all Nigerian territory and also declared that eminent domain compensation for seized land would "be based on the value of the crops on the land at the time of its acquisition, not on the value of the land itself." The [[Nigerian government]] could now distribute the land to oil companies as it deemed fit, said the Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref name=HRW99&gt;
[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/nigeria  The Price of Oil: Corporate Responsibility and Human Rights Violations in Nigeria's Oil Producing Communities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527060959/https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/nigeria |date=May 27, 2016 }} (Human Rights Watch, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s and 1980s saw government promised benefits for the Niger Delta peoples fall through and fail to materialize, with the Ogoni growing increasingly dissatisfied and their environmental, social, and economic apparatus rapidly deteriorating. The [[Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People]] (MOSOP) was formed in 1992, spearheaded by Ogoni playwright and author [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], became the major organization representing the Ogoni people in their struggle for ethnic and environmental rights. Its primary targets, and at times adversaries, have been the Nigerian government and [[Royal Dutch Shell]].
[[File:Flag of the Ogoni people.svg|thumb|Ogoni Flag created by [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]]]]

Beginning in December 1992, the conflict between the Ogoni and the oil companies escalated to a level of greater seriousness and intensity on both sides. Both parties began carrying out acts of violence and MOSOP issued an ultimatum to the oil companies (Shell, [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and the [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]]) demanding some $10 billion in accumulated [[royalties]], damages and compensation, and "immediate stoppage of environmental degradation", as well as negotiations for mutual agreement on all future drilling.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.nigerianmuse.com/nigeriawatch/oputa/OputaVolumeTwo.pdf|title=International Action Report|publisher=Nigerianmuse.com|format=PDF|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ogonis threatened mass action to disrupt oil company operations if they failed to comply with MOSOP demands, and thereby shifted the focus of their actions from the unresponsive federal government to the oil companies producing in the region. The rationale for this assignment of responsibility was the benefits accrued by the oil companies from extracting the natural wealth of the Ogoni homeland, and the central government's neglectful failure to act.

The government responded by banning public gatherings and declaring disturbances to [[oil production]] acts of treason. Oil extraction from the territory slowed to a trickle of {{convert|10000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} (.5% of the national total).

Military repression escalated in May 1994. On May 21, soldiers and mobile policemen appeared in most Ogoni villages. On that day, four Ogoni chiefs (all on the conservative side of a schism within MOSOP over strategy) were brutally murdered. Saro-Wiwa, head of the opposing faction, had been denied entry to Ogoniland on the day of the murders, but he was detained in connection with the killings. The occupying forces, led by Major Paul Okuntimo of [[Rivers State]] Internal Security, claimed to be 'searching for those directly responsible for the killings of the four Ogonis.' However, witnesses say that they engaged in terror operations against the general Ogoni population. [[Amnesty International]] characterized the policy as deliberate [[terrorism]]. By mid-June, the security forces had razed 30 villages, detained 600 people and killed at least 40. This figure eventually rose to 2,000 civilian deaths and the displacement of around 100,000 [[internal refugee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tobias |last=Haller |year=2000 |title=Fossile Ressourcen, Erdölkonzerne und indigene Völker |location=Giessen |publisher=Focus Verlag |page=105 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bogumil Terminski, Oil-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Social Problem and Human Rights Issue|url=http://www.conflictrecovery.org/bin/Bogumil_Terminski-Oil-Induced_Displacement_and_Resettlement_Social_Problem_and_Human_Rights_Issue.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Conflictrecovery.org|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1994, nine activists from the movement who later became known as 'The Ogoni Nine', among them Ken Saro-Wiwa, were arrested and accused of [[incitement]] to murder following the deaths of four Ogoni elders. Saro-Wiwa and his comrades denied the charges, but were imprisoned for over a year before being found guilty and sentenced to death by a specially-convened tribunal, hand-selected by General [[Sani Abacha]], on 10 November 1995. The activists were denied [[due process]] and upon being found guilty, were [[hanged]] by the Nigerian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Mathiason |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/05/shell-saro-wiwa-execution-charges |title=Shell in court over alleged role in Nigeria executions &amp;#124; Business &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 2009-04-05|accessdate=2011-04-23 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executions met with an immediate international response. The trial was widely criticised by [[human rights]] organisations and the governments of other states, who condemned the Nigerian government's long history of detaining its critics, mainly pro-democracy and other political activists. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]], which had pleaded for [[clemency]], suspended Nigeria's membership in response to the executions. The [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[European Union|EU]] all implemented [[International sanctions|sanctions]]—but not on petroleum, Nigeria's primary [[export]].

Shell claimed to have asked the Nigerian government to show clemency towards those found guilty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/05/shell-saro-wiwa-execution-charges|title=Shell in court over alleged role in Nigeria executions|date=April 4, 2009|author=Nick Mathiason|publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but said its request was refused. However, a 2001 [[Greenpeace]] report found that "two witnesses that accused them [Saro-Wiwa and the other activists] later admitted that Shell and the military had bribed them with promises of money and jobs at Shell. Shell admitted having given money to the Nigerian military, who brutally tried to silence the voices which claimed justice".&lt;ref name="Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/toxics/reports/shellreport.pdf|format=PDF|title=Contamination in Paulina by Aldrin, Dieldrin, Endrin and other toxic chemicals produced and disposed of by Shell Chemicals of Brazil|publisher=Greenpeace|date=2001|accessdate=14 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317080635/http://archive.greenpeace.org/toxics/reports/shellreport.pdf  |archivedate=17 March 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, the situation in Ogoniland has eased significantly, assisted by the transition to democratic rule in 1999. However, no attempts have been made by the government or any international body to bring about justice by investigating and prosecuting those involved in the violence and property destruction that have occurred in Ogoniland,&lt;ref name="HRW02"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/nigeria3/nigerdelta.pdf|format=PDF|title= THE NIGER DELTA: NO DEMOCRATIC DIVIDEND|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=2002|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although individual plaintiffs have brought a class action lawsuit against Shell in the US.&lt;ref name="CSRN02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mallenbaker.net/csr/CSRfiles/page.php?Story_ID=616|title=Shell hit by new litigation over Ogoniland |publisher=Mallenbaker.net |accessdate=14 October 2014 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207183450/http://www.mallenbaker.net/csr/CSRfiles/page.php?Story_ID=616 |archivedate=7 February 2009|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ijaw unrest (1998–1999) ===
The December 1998 All Ijaw Youths Conference crystallized the Ijaws' struggle for petroleum resource control with the formation of the [[Ijaw Youth Council]] (IYC) and the issuing of the [[Kaiama Declaration]]. In it, long-held Ijaw concerns about the loss of control over their homeland and their own lives to the oil companies were joined with a commitment to [[direct action]]. In the declaration, and in a letter to the companies, the Ijaws called for oil companies to suspend operations and withdraw from Ijaw territory. The IYC pledged "to struggle peacefully for freedom, self-determination and ecological justice," and prepared a campaign of celebration, prayer, and direct action, ''Operation Climate Change'', beginning December 28.

In December 1998, two warships and 10-15,000 Nigerian troops occupied [[Bayelsa]] and [[Delta state]]s as the Ijaw Youth Congress (IYC) mobilized for Operation Climate Change.  Soldiers entered the Bayelsa, the state capital of [[Yenagoa]], announced they had come because youths trying to stop the oil companies. On the morning of December 30, two thousand young people processed through Yenagoa, dressed in black, singing and dancing. Soldiers opened fire with rifles, machine guns, and tear gas, killing at least three protesters and arresting twenty-five more. After a march demanding the release of those detained was turned back by soldiers, three more protesters were shot dead including Nwashuku Okeri and Ghadafi Ezeifile. The military declared a state of emergency throughout Bayelsa state, imposed a dusk-to-dawn [[curfew]], and banned meetings. At military roadblocks, local residents were severely beaten or detained. At night, soldiers invaded private homes, terrorizing residents with beatings and women and girls with [[rape]].

On January 4, 1999 about one hundred soldiers from the military base at [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]'s Escravos facility attacked [[Opia]] and Ikiyan, two Ijaw communities in Delta State. Bright Pablogba, the traditional leader of Ikiyan, who came to the river to negotiate with the soldiers, was shot along with a seven-year-old girl and possibly dozens of others. Of the approximately 1,000 people living in the two villages, four people were found dead and sixty-two were still missing months after the attack. The same soldiers set the villages ablaze, destroyed canoes and fishing equipment, killed livestock, and destroyed churches and religious shrines.

Nonetheless, Operation Climate Change continued, and disrupted Nigerian oil supplies through much of 1999 by turning off valves through Ijaw territory. In the context of high conflict between the Ijaw and the Nigerian Federal Government (and its police and army), the military carried out the [[Odi massacre]], killing scores if not hundreds of Ijaws.

Subsequent actions by Ijaws against the oil industry included both renewed efforts at [[nonviolent]] action and attacks on oil installations and foreign oil workers.&lt;ref name="Nigeria Online"&gt;{{cite web|first=Eric|last=Aghadiuno |url=http://www.onlinenigeria.com/finance/?blurb=669 |title=Ijaw Tribe |publisher=OnlineNigeria.com |date=1999-01-04 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation of the Niger Delta Development Commission (2000–2003) ===

The [[Niger Delta Development Commission]] (NDDC) was established in 2000 by President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] with the sole mandate of developing the petroleum-rich Niger-Delta region of southern Nigeria. Since its inauguration, the NDDC has focused on the development of social and physical infrastructures, ecological/environmental remediation and human development. The NDDC was created largely as a response to the demands of the population of the Niger Delta, a populous area inhabited by a diversity of minority ethnic groups. During the 1990s these ethnic groups, most notably the Ijaw and the Ogoni established organizations to confront the Nigerian government and multinational oil companies such as Shell. The minorities of the Niger Delta have continued to agitate and articulate demands for greater autonomy and control of the area's petroleum resources.

The ethnic unrest and conflicts of the late 1990s (such as those between the Ijaw, Urhobo and Itsekiri), coupled with a peak in the availability of small arms and other weapons, led increasingly to the militarization of the Delta. Local and state officials offered financial support to the paramilitary groups they believed would attempt to enforce their own political agenda. Conflagrations have been concentrated primarily in [[Delta State (Nigeria)|Delta]] and [[Rivers State]]s.&lt;ref name="Where Vultures Feast"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where Vultures Feast |isbn=1-85984-473-1 |publisher=Verso|year=2003|last=Okonata |first=Ike |author2=Douglas, Oronto }}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

Prior to 2003, the epicenter of regional violence was [[Warri, Nigeria|Warri]].&lt;ref name="Where Vultures Feast"/&gt; However, after the violent convergence&lt;!-- what's a violent  convergence? fighting? --&gt; of the largest military groups in the region, the [[Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force]] (NDPVF) led by [[Mujahid Dokubo-Asari]] and the [[Niger Delta Vigilante]]s (NDV) led by [[Ateke Tom]] (both of which are primarily made up of [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]]s), conflict became focused on [[Port Harcourt]] and outlying towns. The two groups dwarf a plethora of smaller militias, supposedly numbering more than one hundred. The Nigerian government classifies these groups as "cults", but many began as local university [[fraternities]]. The groups have adopted names largely based on [[Western culture]], some of which include Icelanders, Greenlanders, KKK, and Vultures. All of the groups are constituted mostly by disaffected young men from Warri, Port Harcourt, and their suburban areas. Although the smaller groups are autonomous, they have formed alliances with and are largely controlled from above by either Asari and his NDPDF or Tom's NDV, who provide military support and instruction.

The NDPVF was founded by Asari, a former president of the Ijaw Youth Council, in 2003 after he "retreated into the bush" to form the group with the explicit goal of acquiring control of regional petroleum resources. The NDPFV attempted to control such resources primarily through oil "bunkering", a process in which an oil [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] is tapped and the oil extracted onto a barge. Oil corporations and the Nigerian state point out that bunkering is illegal; militants justify bunkering, saying they are being exploited and have not received adequate profits from the profitable but ecologically destructive oil industry. Bunkered oil can be sold for profit, usually to destinations in [[West Africa]], but also abroad. Bunkering is a fairly common practice in the Delta but in this case the militia groups are the primary perpetrators.&lt;ref name=HRW05&gt;[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/africa/nigeria0205/index.htm Rivers and Blood: Guns, Oil and Power in Nigeria's Rivers State] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720075704/http://hrw.org/backgrounder/africa/nigeria0205/index.htm |date=July 20, 2008 }} (Human Rights Watch, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The intense confrontation between the NDPVF and NDV seems to have been brought about by Asari's political falling out with the NDPVF's financial supporter [[Peter Odili]], governor of [[Rivers State]] following the April 2003 local and state elections. After Asari publicly criticized the election process as fraudulent, the Odili government withdrew its financial support from the NDPVF and began to support Tom's NDV, effectively launching a paramilitary campaign against the NDPVF.

Subsequent violence occurred chiefly in riverine villages southeast and southwest of Port Harcourt, with the two groups fighting for control of bunkering routes. The conflagrations spurred violent acts against the local population, resulting in numerous deaths and widespread displacement. Daily civilian life was disrupted, forcing schools and economic activity to shut down, widespread property destruction resulted.

The state campaign against the NDPVF emboldened Asari who began publicly articulating populist, anti-government views and attempted to frame the conflict in terms of pan-Ijaw nationalism and "self-determination." Consequently, the state government escalated the campaign against him by bringing in [[Nigerian Mobile Police|police]], [[Army of Nigeria|army]], and [[Navy of Nigeria|navy]] forces that began occupying Port Harcourt in June 2004.

The government forces collaborated with the NDV during the summer, and were seen protecting NDV militiamen from attacks by the NDPVF. The state forces failed to protect the civilian population from the violence and actually increased the destruction of citizens' livelihood. The Nigerian state forces were widely reported to have used the conflict as an excuse to raid homes, claiming that innocent civilians were cahoots with the NDPVF. Government soldiers and police obtained and destroyed civilian property by force. The NDPVF also accused the military of conducting air bombing campaigns against several villages, effectively reducing them to rubble, because they were believed to be housing NDPVF soldiers. The military denies this, claiming they engaged in aerial warfare only once in a genuine effort to wipe out an NDPVF stronghold.

Innocent civilians were also killed by NDPVF forces firing indiscriminately in order to engage their opponents. At the end of August 2004 there were several particularly brutal battles over the Port Harcourt waterfront; some residential slums were completely destroyed after the NDPVF deliberately burned down buildings. By September 2004, the situation was rapidly approaching a violent climax which caught the attention of the international community.&lt;ref name=HRW05/&gt;

=== Nigerian oil crisis (2004–2006) ===
After launching a mission to wipe out NDPVF, approved by [[President of Nigeria|President]] [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] in early September 2004, [[Mujahid Dokubo-Asari]] declared "all-out war" with the Nigerian state as well as the [[oil industry|oil corporations]] and threatened to disrupt oil production activities through attacks on [[oil well|wells]] and pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3695990.stm|title=Nigerian army warns oil rebels|date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quickly caused a major crisis the following day on September 26, as [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] evacuated 235 non-essential personnel from two oil fields, cutting oil production by {{convert|30000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.
 
Nigeria was the world's tenth [[List of countries by oil exports|largest oil exporter]]. The abundant oil reserves resulted in widespread exploitation. The Niger Delta region encompasses about 8% of Nigeria's landmass and is the largest wetlands region on the African continent. Oil drilling in the region began in the 1950s. In the beginning, the oil drilling in the region really stimulated Nigeria's economy and was extremely beneficial to the country. Numerous multinational corporations established oil operations in the region and made a conscious effort to not violate any environmental or human rights regulations. Shell began drilling in the Niger Delta region in 1956. Over time, Shell's presence in Nigeria has been very detrimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The environmental and social impact of Shell's operations in Nigeria|author=Antoni Pigrau|publisher=International Catalan Institute for Peace|issue=18|work=Per la Pau / Peace in Progress|date=November 2013|issn=2013-5777|url=http://www.icip-perlapau.cat/e-review/issue-18-november-2013/environmental-and-social-impact-shell-s-operations-nigeria.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These negative consequences are the result of thousands of oil spills, human rights violations, environmental destruction, and corruption. Over the past half century, Nigeria has become a plutocracy; political power is concentrated solely in the hands of the socioeconomic elite. Shell's strong presence has played a major role in the absence of democracy in Nigeria. According to the documentary ''Poison Fire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq2TBOHWFRc|title=Poison Fire|author=Maweni Farm Documentaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; one and a half million tons of oil have been discharged into the Delta's farms, forests, and rivers since oil drilling began in 1956. This is equivalent to 50 [[Exxon Valdez]] disasters. Hundreds of kilometers of [[rain forest]] have been destroyed by the oil spills. When petroleum is discharged into the soil, the soil becomes acidic, which disrupts [[photosynthesis]] and kills trees because their roots are not able to get oxygen. Moreover, the fish population has also been negatively affected by oil drilling. The region is home to over 250 different fish species, and 20 of these species are found nowhere else in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/news_facts/multimedia/video/index.cfm?uNewsID=61121&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;|title=World Wildlife Fund. 2006. Fishing on the Niger River. Retrieved May 10, 2007|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If oil spills continue at this rate entire species will become extinct and the entire Nigerian fishing industry will be decimated.

==== Royal Dutch Shell controversy ====
[[Platform (art group)|Platform London]], Friends of the Earth Netherlands ([[Milieudefensie]]) and [[Amnesty International]] have launched international campaigns aimed at having Shell clean the oil spills in the Delta. The organisations are concerned about the economic and health consequences for the people in the region. Shell's inability to respond effectively has led Friends of the Earth Netherlands and Amnesty International to believe it actively contributes to the human rights violations in the region. Because of the large area affected, the environmental consequences are vast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worsethanbad.org |title=Worse Than Bad |publisher=Milieudefensie.nl |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Piracy and kidnappings (2006–2014) ===
{{main article|Piracy in the Gulf of Guinea|Foreign hostages in Nigeria}}
Starting in October 2012 Nigeria experienced a large spike in piracy off its coast. By early 2013 Nigeria became the second most-pirated nation in [[Africa]], after [[Somalia]]. The [[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta]] is thought to be behind most of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4732210.stm|title=Nigeria's shadowy oil rebels|date=20 April 2006|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2016|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2012 MEND has hijacked 12 ships, kidnapped 33 sailors, and killed 4 oil workers. Since this started the [[United States]] has sent soldiers to train Nigerian soldiers in maritime tactics against pirates. Since this 33 pirates have been captured. Although the [[Nigerian Navy]] now has learned new tactics to use against pirates, attacks still occur on an almost regular basis.

Since 2006, militant groups in [[Nigeria]]'s [[Niger Delta]], especially the [[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta]] (MEND), have resorted to taking foreign employees of [[oil companies]] [[hostage]]. More than 200 foreigners have been kidnapped since 2006, though most were released unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5542459.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=British hostages moved by Niger rebels after botched rescue | first=Catherine | last=Philp | date=January 19, 2009 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military crackdown (2008–2009) ===
In August 2008, the Nigerian government launched a massive military crackdown on militants. They patrolled waters and hunted for militants, searched all civilian boats for weapons, and raided numerous militant hideouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|wENIO4bzemI|Military operations in the Niger Delta - 16 Aug 08}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2009, a military operation undertaken by a Joint Task Force (JTF) began against MEND militants operating in the Niger Delta region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fatade |first=Wale |url=http://www.234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/News/National/5418588-146/Governors,_lawmakers_meet_to_end_Niger.csp?CSPCHD=0020000100004310gmn9000000TvRs_tjTAxtmIeH1rIOinA-- |title=Niger Delta offensive intensifies |publisher=234next.com |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2011-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218003527/http://www.234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/News/National/5418588-146/Governors,_lawmakers_meet_to_end_Niger.csp?CSPCHD=0020000100004310gmn9000000TvRs_tjTAxtmIeH1rIOinA-- |archive-date=2016-02-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It came in response to the kidnapping of Nigerian soldiers and foreign sailors in the Delta region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker |first=Andrew |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8068174.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Will Nigeria oil offensive backfire? |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Nigerians have fled their villages and hundreds of people may be dead because of the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=84512 |title=IRIN Africa &amp;#124; NIGERIA: Thousands flee violence, hundreds suspected dead &amp;#124; Nigeria &amp;#124; Conflict &amp;#124; Economy &amp;#124; Environment |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2009-05-22 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidential amnesty program (2009–2016) ===
Pipeline attacks had become common during the insurgency in the Niger Delta, but ended after the government on June 26, 2009 announced that it would grant amnesty and an unconditional pardon to militants in the [[Niger Delta]] which would last for 60 days beginning on 6 August, ending 4 October 2009. Former Nigerian President [[Umaru Musa Yar'Adua]] signed the amnesty after consultation with the National Council Of State. During the 60-day period, armed youths were required to surrender their weapons to the government in return for training and rehabilitation by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8118314.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Nigeria offers militants amnesty |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has been continued into the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eadi.org/typo3/fileadmin/Documents/Events/General_Conference/2014/gc2014-abazie-humphrey-41.pdf|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2015-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125115453/http://www.eadi.org/typo3/fileadmin/Documents/Events/General_Conference/2014/gc2014-abazie-humphrey-41.pdf|archivedate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationng.com/2015/04/why-buhari-will-sustain-amnesty-programme-presidency.html|title=Why Buhari Will Sustain Amnesty Programme – Presidency - INFORMATION NIGERIA|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Militants led their groups to surrender weapons such as rocket-propelled grenades, guns, explosives, and ammunition. Even gunboats have been surrendered to the government. Over 30,000 purported members signed up between October 2009 and May 2011 in exchange for monthly payments and in some cases lucrative contracts for guarding the pipelines. Though the programme has been extended through this year, the new government of [[Muhammadu Buhari]] sees it as a potentially enabling corruption and so feels that cannot be continued indefinitely.&lt;ref name=forcados&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0f4f4820-e53f-11e5-a09b-1f8b0d268c39.html?siteedition=intl#axzz4I5ksKUMo|publisher=Financial Times|date= March 8, 2016|title=Bombed pipeline to hit Nigeria oil output|author1=Maggie Fick in Lagos|author2=Anjli Raval in London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amnesty office has worked to reintegrate the fighters into society, primarily by placing and sponsoring them in vocational and higher education courses in Nigeria and abroad.&lt;ref name="CG2016"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/west-africa/nigeria/231-curbing-violence-in-nigeria-iii-re-visiting-the-niger-delta|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160218003528/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/west-africa/nigeria/231-curbing-violence-in-nigeria-iii-re-visiting-the-niger-delta|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 18 February 2016|publisher = Crisis Group|title = Curbing Violence in Nigeria (III): Revisiting the Niger Delta|date = 29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Presidential Amnesty Program (PAP) program proved to be a success, with violence and kidnappings decreasing sharply. Petroleum production and exports have increased from about 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) in mid-2009 to between 2.2 and 2.4 million bpd since 2011.&lt;ref name="CG2016"/&gt; However, the program is costly and chronic poverty and catastrophic oil pollution that which fueled the earlier rebellion, remain largely unaddressed. With Nigerian President [[Goodluck Jonathan]]’s defeat in the [[Nigerian general election, 2015|March 2015 elections]], the amnesty program seems likely to end in December 2015 and with patronage to former militant leaders terminated, local discontent is deepening.&lt;ref name="CG2016"/&gt;

===2016–present conflict===
{{main article|2016 Niger Delta conflict}}
A February 2016 explosion in a pipeline operated by Shell Petroleum Development Corporation, a Royal Dutch [[Shell Nigeria|Shell subsidiary]]&lt;!-- from where --&gt; to the Shell Forcados export terminal halted both production and imports. Speculation centered  on militants using divers. [[Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu]], the minister of state for petroleum and the head of Nigeria’s oil company{{who|date=November 2016}}, said Nigerian production was down 300,000 barrels a day as a result.&lt;ref name=forcados/&gt; On May 11 Shell closed its [[Bonny, Nigeria|Bonny]] oil facility. Three soldiers guarding the installation were killed in an attack, said Col.

The [[Niger Delta Avengers]] (NDA), a [[Insurgent|militant]] group in the [[Niger Delta]], publicly announced its existence in March 2016.&lt;ref name=BBCMay16&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36301835|title=Nigeria arrests 'Avengers' oil militants|date=16 May 2016|work=BBC News Online|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDA have attacked oil-producing facilities in the delta, causing the shutdown of oil terminals and a fall in Nigeria's oil production to its lowest level in twenty years.&lt;ref name=BBCMay16/&gt; The attacks caused Nigeria to fall behind Angola as Africa's largest [[List of countries by oil production|oil producer]].&lt;ref name=BIMay16&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/niger-delta-avengers-nigeria-oil-production-crash-2016-5?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Africa's largest oil producer has been dethroned|author=Elena Holodny|date=16 May 2016|work=Business Insider|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced oil output has hampered the Nigerian economy and destroyed its budget,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Niger Delta Avengers: Danegeld in the Delta|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21701124-nigerias-turbulent-oilfields-cannot-be-pacified-bribing-rebels-danegeld-delta|accessdate=25 June 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; since Nigeria depends on the oil industry for nearly all{{clarify|date=November 2016}} its government revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Avengers unite!

==Causes==
There are multiple reasons why people following GPS directions have become lost, been injured, or have died. The reasons listed below may also include the lack of a working communications systems to call for help. Consequently, drivers or hikers have ventured off the road or into remote, impassable, or dangerous areas; driven until their vehicles were out of fuel, mired, or disabled; succumbed to hazardous climate or weather conditions; or gotten lost.&lt;ref name=McKenzie1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Milner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Milner2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SacBee1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312936003_Understanding_Death_by_GPS_A_Systematic_Analysis_of_Catastrophic_Incidents_Associated_with_Personal_Navigation_Technologies|title=Understanding " Death by GPS " : A Systematic Analysis of Catastrophic Incidents Associated with Personal Navigation Technologies|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Uncritical acceptance of turn-by-turn commands; paying more attention to the navigation system than what was in front of them, such as road signs and signals, barriers, and terrain&lt;ref name=Milner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Milner2 /&gt;
*Unfamiliarity with or unawareness of hazardous conditions not noted by GPS (e.g., the local climate or weather conditions, construction, or closed, impassable, or dangerous roads)
*Unfamiliarity with the area
*Lack of a current, accurate written map or written directions to use in concert with or in lieu of those provided by GPS
*Outdated or incorrect GPS maps
*The GPS directions may reflect the shortest distance between locations, regardless of whether or not the route is navigable
Allen Lin, in research published in 2017, provided a systematic analysis of the key themes in these incidents and the roles that navigation technologies played in them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Proposed solutions==
Matthew McKenzie offers some precautions against death by GPS: "Use GPS and other mobile devices the way they should be used: as simple conveniences. Carry a real map, understand the local climate, and don't hesitate to turn around and go back the way you came if your directions don't 'feel' right."&lt;ref name=McKenzie1 /&gt; The [[National Park Service]] has posted the following message on the Directions &amp; Transportation page of the official Death Valley Park website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/deva/planyourvisit/directions.htm|title=Death Valley National Park, CA, NV: Plan Your Visit: Directions &amp; Transportation|accessdate=21 January 2018|website=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text='''Using GPS Navigation'''
GPS Navigation to sites to remote locations like Death Valley are notoriously unreliable. Numerous travelers have been directed to the wrong location or even dead-end or closed roads. Travelers should always carry up-to-date road maps to check the accuracy of GPS directions.

'''Disaster risk reduction''' ('''DRR''') is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing and reducing the risks of disaster. It aims to reduce socio-economic vulnerabilities to disaster as well as dealing with the environmental and other hazards that trigger them. Here it has been strongly influenced by the mass of research on vulnerability that has appeared in print since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Wisner B et al. 2004, ''At Risk: Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters'' (London: Routledge)&lt;/ref&gt; It is the responsibility of development and relief agencies alike. It should be an integral part of the way such organizations do their work, not an add-on or one-off action. DRR is very wide-ranging: Its scope is much broader and deeper than conventional [[emergency management]]. There is potential for DRR initiatives in just about every sector of development and humanitarian work.

The most commonly cited definition of DRR is one used by UN agencies such as [[UNISDR]], also known as the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, and [[UNDP]]: "The conceptual framework of elements considered with the possibilities to minimize vulnerabilities and disaster risks throughout a society, to avoid (prevention) or to limit (mitigation and preparedness) the adverse impacts of hazards, within the broad context of sustainable development."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unisdr.org/eng/about_isdr/bd-lwr-2004-eng.htm ''Living With Risk: A Global Review of Disaster Reduction Initiatives''], UNISDR, 2004; pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
[[File:Amazing-natural-disasters.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of disasters]]
Only 4% of the estimated $10 billion in annual humanitarian assistance is devoted to prevention(source), and yet every dollar spent on risk reduction saves between $5 and $10 in economic losses from disasters.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/03/23/a_needless_toll_of_natural_disasters/ "A Needless Toll of Natural Disasters"], Op-Ed, ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 23 March 2006, by [[Eric P. Schwartz|Eric Schwartz]] (UN Secretary General's Deputy Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the concept and approach==
The evolution of disaster management thinking and practice since the 1970s has seen a progressively wider and deeper understanding of why disasters happen, accompanied by more integrated, holistic approaches to reduce their impact on society. The modern paradigm of disaster management—disaster risk reduction (DRR)—represents the latest step along this path. DRR is a relatively new concept in formal terms, but it embraces much earlier thinking and practice. It is being widely embraced by international agencies, governments, disaster planners and civil society organisations.&lt;ref&gt;§ UN ISDR 2004, ''Living with Risk: A global review of disaster reduction initiatives'' (Geneva: UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction), [http://www.unisdr.org/eng/about_isdr/bd-lwr-2004-eng.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many see climate change as having a direct impact on the prevalence and seriousness of disasters, as well as causing them to be more frequent in the future. There are growing efforts to closely link [http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/climate-change/key-issues/disaster-risk-reduction#.UwTCR_l_uvM DRR and climate change] adaptation, both in policy and practice.

DRR is such an all-embracing concept that it has proved difficult to define or explain in detail, although the broad idea is clear enough. Inevitably, there are different definitions in the technical literature, but it is generally understood to mean the broad development and application of policies, strategies and practices to minimise vulnerabilities and disaster risks throughout society. The term 'disaster risk management' (DRM) is often used in the same context and to mean much the same thing: a systematic approach to identifying, assessing and reducing risks of all kinds associated with hazards and human activities. It is more properly applied to the operational aspects of DRR: the practical implementation of DRR initiatives.
[[File:Chennai damage 5.jpg|thumb|Chennai damage after 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake]]
There have been growing calls for greater clarity about the components of DRR and about indicators of progress toward resilience — a challenge that the international community took up at the UN's [[World Conference on Disaster Reduction]] (WCDR) in Kobe, Japan, in 2005, only days after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. The WCDR began the process of pushing international agencies and national governments beyond the vague rhetoric of most policy statements and toward setting clear targets and commitments for DRR. The first step in this process was the formal approval at the WCDR of the [http://www.unisdr.org/eng/hfa/hfa.htm Hyogo Framework for Action (2005–2015)] (HFA). This was the first internationally accepted framework for DRR. It set out an ordered sequence of objectives (outcome – strategic goals – priorities), with five priorities for action attempting to 'capture' the main areas of DRR intervention. The UN's biennial [http://www.preventionweb.net/english/hyogo/GP/ Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction] provided an opportunity for the UN and its member states to review progress against the Hyogo Framework. It held its first session 5–7 June 2007 in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, where [[UNISDR]] is based. The subsequent Global Platforms were held in June 2009, May 2011 and May 2013, all in [[Geneva]]. The successor accord to the [http://www.unisdr.org/eng/hfa/hfa.htm Hyogo Framework] was adopted at the [[World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction]] held on March 14–18, 2015 in the Japanese city of [[Sendai]]. It is known as the [http://www.wcdrr.org/preparatory/post2015 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030)].

UN initiatives have helped to refine and promote the concept at international level, stimulated initially by the UN's designation of the 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. In 1999, UN member states approved the [http://www.unisdr.org/who-we-are/international-strategy-for-disaster-reduction International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction], which reflected a shift from the traditional emphasis on disaster response to disaster reduction, by seeking to promote a "culture of prevention".

==Some issues and challenges==

===Priorities===

According to Mluver 1996 it is unrealistic to expect progress in every aspect of DRR : capacities and resources are insufficient. Governments and other organisations have to make what are in effect 'investment decisions', choosing which aspects of DRR to invest in, when, and in what sequence. This is made more complicated by the fact that many of the interventions advocated are developmental rather than directly related to disaster management. Most existing DRR guidance sidesteps this issue. One way of focusing is to consider only actions that are intended specifically to reduce disaster risk. This would at least distinguish from more general efforts toward sustainable development. The concept of  'invulnerable development' attempts this: In this formulation, invulnerable development is development directed toward reducing vulnerability to disaster, comprising 'decisions and activities that are intentionally designed and implemented to reduce risk and susceptibility, and also raise resistance and resilience to disaster'.&lt;ref&gt;McEntire DA 2000, 'Sustainability or invulnerable development? Proposals for the current shift in paradigms'. ''Australian Journal of Emergency Management'' 15(1): 58–61. [http://www.ema.gov.au/www/emaweb/RWPAttach.nsf/VAP/(3273BD3F76A7A5DEDAE36942A54D7D90)~AJEM_Vol15_Issue1.pdf/$file/AJEM_Vol15_Issue1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown the impact of further investment in effective preparedness, as the benefits with regards to reducing humanitarian caseloads far outweigh the costs; a case study of Niger showed positive cost and benefit results across all scenarios. Three different scenarios were modelled, from the absolute level of disaster loss, to the potential reduction in disaster loss and the discount rate. It is estimated that every $1 spent results in $3.25 of benefit in the most conservative scenario. This increases to $5.31 of benefit for the least conservative scenario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7955-dare-prepare-taking-risk-seriously ''Dare to prepare: taking risk seriously''] Kellett, J. and Peters, K. (2013) [[Overseas Development Institute]]. Retrieved 10 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships and inter-organisational co-ordination===

No single group or organisation can address every aspect of DRR. DRR thinking sees disasters as complex problems demanding a collective response. Co-ordination even in conventional emergency management is difficult, for many, organisations may converge on a disaster area to assist. Across the broader spectrum of DRR, the relationships between types of organisation and between sectors (public, private and non-profit, as well as communities) become much more extensive and complex. DRR requires strong vertical and horizontal linkages (central-local relations become important). In terms of involving civil society organisations, it should mean thinking broadly about which types of organisation to involve (i.e., conventional NGOs and such organisations as trades unions, religious institutions, amateur radio operators (as in the USA and India), universities and research institutions).

===Communities and their organizations===

Traditional emergency management/civil defense thinking makes two misleading assumptions about communities. First, it sees other forms of social organisation (voluntary and community-based organisations, informal social groupings and families) as irrelevant to emergency action. Spontaneous actions by affected communities or groups (e.g., search and rescue) are viewed as irrelevant or disruptive, because they are not controlled by the authorities. The second assumption is that disasters produce passive 'victims' who are overwhelmed by crisis or dysfunctional behavior (panic, looting, self-seeking activities). They therefore need to be told what to do, and their behavior must be controlled — in extreme cases, through the imposition of martial law. There is plenty of sociological research to refute such 'myths'.&lt;ref&gt;§ Quarantelli EL 1998, ''Major Criteria for Judging Disaster Planning and Managing and their Applicability in Developing Societies (University of Delaware: Disaster Research Center'', Preliminary Paper 268).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;§ Dynes RR 1994, 'Community Emergency Planning: False Assumptions and Inappropriate Analogies'. ''International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters'' 12(2): 141–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative viewpoint, informed by a considerable volume of research, emphasises the importance of communities and local organisations in disaster risk management. The rationale for community-based disaster risk management that it responds to local problems and needs, capitalises on local knowledge and expertise, is cost-effective, improves the likelihood of sustainability through genuine 'ownership' of projects, strengthens community technical and organisational capacities, and empowers people by enabling them to tackle these and other challenges. Local people and organisations are the main actors in risk reduction and disaster response in any case.&lt;ref&gt;§	Maskrey A 1989, ''Disaster Mitigation: A Community-Based Approach'' (Oxford: Oxfam).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it has been seen that understanding the social capital already existent in the community can greatly help reducing the risk at the community level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aldrich|first1=Daniel P.|last2=Meyer|first2=Michelle A.|title=Social Capital and Community Resilience|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=February 2015|volume=59|issue=2|pages=254–269 |doi=10.1177/0002764214550299 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764214550299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanyal|first1=Saswata|last2=Routray|first2=Jayant Kumar|title=Social capital for disaster risk reduction and management with empirical evidences from Sundarbans of India.|journal=International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction|date=2016-08-27|volume= 19|pages=101–111|doi=10.1016/j.ijdrr.2016.08.010|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420916301777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Learning from a Colombian community====

Widespread flooding affected most of Colombia's 32 regions between 2010 and 2012. Some 3.6 million people were affected. On 24 April 2012, President Juan Manuel Santos enacted a law, which aimed at improving natural disaster response and prevention at both national and local level.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17838868 Colombian army has growing role in flood defence], BBC News, 27 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Universidad Del Norte, based in Barranquilla, has investigated how one community reacted to the destruction caused by the floods, in an effort to try to make Colombian communities more resilient to similar events occurring in the future. With funding from the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], the project team spent 18 months working with women from the municipality of Manatí, in the Department of Atlántico.

Here, 5,733 women were affected by the floods. They had to reconstruct their entire lives in a Manatí they could no longer recognise. The project team worked with the women to find out how they coped with the effects of the floods, and to articulate the networks of reciprocity and solidarity that developed in the community. Their findings highlighted resilience strategies that the community used to respond to the extreme event. The researchers suggested that similar strategies could be used to inform government actions to reduce or manage risk from disasters. They also concluded that it is important to consider gender when planning for disasters as women and men often play very different roles and because, on average, disasters kill more women than men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/2013/10/31169/?loclang=en_gb ''FEATURE: Learning lessons from Manatí's resilient women''], [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], October 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance===

The DRR approach requires redefining the role of government disaster reduction. It is generally agreed that national governments should be main actors in DRR: They have a duty to ensure the safety of citizens, the resources and capacity to implement large-scale DRR, a mandate to direct or co-ordinate the work of others, and they create the necessary policy and legislative frameworks. These policies and programmes have to be coherent. More research is needed into why some governments are more successful than others in disaster management. There is still no general consensus on what drives changes in policy and practice. The shifting relationship between central government and other actors is another area requiring research.

===Accountability and rights===

The principle of accountability lies at the heart of genuine partnership and participation in DRR. It applies to state institutions that are expected to be accountable through the democratic process and to private sector and non-profit organizations that are not subject to democratic control. Accountability is an emerging issue in disaster reduction work. Accountability should be primarily toward those who are vulnerable to hazards and affected by them.

Many organisations working in international aid and development are now committing themselves to a 'rights-based' approach. This tends to encompass human rights (i.e., those that are generally accepted through international agreements) and other rights that an agency believes should be accepted as human rights. In such contexts, the language of rights may be used vaguely, with a risk of causing confusion.  Security against disasters is not generally regarded as a right although it is addressed in some international codes, usually indirectly. The idea of a 'right to safety' is being discussed in some circles.

===Policy and investment===

In a June 2012 study, researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] highlighted the need for more focus on disaster risk management (DRM) in the international policy frameworks to be agreed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, T. and Wilkinson, E. (2012) ''Disaster risk management in post-2015 policy frameworks: forging a more resilient future''. Overseas Development Institute Briefing Paper [http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/6663-disaster-risk-management-sustainable-development-policy-post2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic costs of disasters are on the rise, but most humanitarian investment is currently spent on responding to disasters, rather than managing their future risks. If this pattern continues, the researchers argue, then "spending on reconstruction and relief will become unsustainable." A more developed evidence base, enhanced political commitment, and dialogue across policy areas will be needed for this mainstreaming of disaster risk management to happen.

Further papers also highlighted the need to for strong gender perspective in disaster risk reduction policy. Studies have shown that women are disproportionally impacted by natural disasters. Following the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, 77% and 72% of the deaths in the districts of North Aceh and Aceh Besar, Indonesia, were female. And in India 62% of people who died were female.&lt;ref&gt;Neumayer, E and Plümper, T. (2007) 'The gendered nature of natural disastersL the impact of catastrophic events on the gender gap in making disaster risk reduction gender-sensitive: policy and practical guidelines life expectancy 1981–2002', Annals of the Association of American Geographers97(3): 551–566.&lt;/ref&gt; A gender-sensitive approach would identify how disasters affect men, women, boys and girls differently and shape policy to people's specific vulnerabilities, concerns and needs.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Virginie Le Masson and Lara Langston, Overseas Development Institute, March 2014, How Should the new international disaster risk framework address gender equality? http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CDKN_Gender_DRR_PolicyBrief_Final_WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Towards the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030)==
In March 2015, the 10-year-old [http://www.unisdr.org/eng/hfa/hfa.htm Hyogo Framework] came to an end and was replaced by the [http://www.wcdrr.org/preparatory/post2015 Sendai Framework]. It sets out four priorities: understanding disaster risk; strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience; enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response, and to "Build Back Better" in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. To support the assessment of global progress in achieving the outcome and goal of the Sendai Framework, seven global targets have been agreed: substantially reduce global disaster mortality by 2030, aiming to lower average per 100,000 global mortality between 2020–2030 compared to 2005–2015; substantially reduce the number of affected people globally by 2030, 
aiming to lower the average global figure per 100,000 between 2020–2030 compared to 2005–2015; reduce direct disaster 
economic loss in relation to global gross domestic product by 2030; substantially reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services, among them health and educational facilities, including through developing 
their resilience by 2030; substantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020; substantially enhance international cooperation to developing countries through adequate and sustainable
support to complement their national actions for implementation of the framework by 2030; substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to the people by 2030.

The Sendai document emerged from [http://www.wcdrr.org/uploads/post_2015_drr_timeline.jpg three years' of talks], during which UN member states, NGOs and other stakeholders made calls for an improved version of the existing HFA, with a set of common standards, a comprehensive framework with achievable targets, and a legally-based instrument for disaster risk reduction. Member states also emphasised the need to tackle disaster risk reduction and climate change adaption when setting the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], particularly in light of an insufficient focus on risk reduction and resilience in the original [[Millennium Development Goals]].

Emergency preparedness has the potential to be transformative in presenting sustainable and functioning national systems that will reduce the cost of long-term response and relieve the increasing burden on the humanitarian system. However, emergency preparedness is largely underfunded. Where the financing does exist, it is complex, fragmented and disorganised. This is particularly the case for the international contribution, with various separate institutions, mechanisms and approaches defining where the funding is directed and how it is spent. A report by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] suggests that although there are advantages to improving existing financing mechanisms for emergency preparedness, it is not sufficient to simply reinforce the current system. Incremental changes will still leave gaps and a global solution should be considered to improve long-term disaster risk reduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7955-dare-prepare-taking-risk-seriously "Dare to prepare: taking risk seriously"] Kellett, J. and Peters, K. (2013) [[Overseas Development Institute]]. Retrieved 11 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major international conferences and workshops==
With the growth of interest in disasters and disaster management, there are many conferences and workshops held on the topic, from local to global levels. Regular international conferences include:
* The annual conference of [http://www.tiems.org/ TIEMS]: The International Emergency Management Society.
* The [http://idrc.info/about/idrc-conferences/ International Disaster and Risk Conferences] (IDRC) and workshops, held each year since 2006, in Davos, Switzerland (even-numbered years), and other locations (odd numbered years).
* The meetings of the International Research Committee on Disasters (IRCD), held as part of the International Sociological Association's [http://www.isa-sociology.org/ World Congress of Sociology].

The '''Gaiety Theatre''' was a [[West End theatre]] in London, located on [[Aldwych]] at the eastern end of the [[Strand, London|Strand]].  The theatre was first established as the '''Strand Musick Hall''' (sic) in 1864 on the former site of the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. In 1868, it became known as the Gaiety Theatre and was, at first, known for [[music hall]] and then for [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]], [[pantomime]] and [[operetta]] performances. From 1868 to the 1890s, it had a major influence on the development of modern [[musical theatre|musical comedy]].

Under the management of [[John Hollingshead]] until 1886, the theatre had early success with ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', by [[W. S. Gilbert]], followed by many other burlesques of operas and literary works.  Many of the productions starred [[Nellie Farren]]. Hollingshead's last production at the theatre was the burlesque ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885–86), produced together with his successor, [[George Edwardes]]. Edwardes's first show, ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'', became a long-running hit.  In the 1880s and 90s, the theatre had further success with a number of burlesques with original scores by the theatre's music director, [[Wilhelm Meyer Lutz]], including ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890) and ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891).

In the 1890s, the theatre introduced new style of musical theatre in London now referred to as the [[Edwardian musical comedy]].  These shows employed female dancers known as the [[Gaiety Girls]] and were extraordinarily popular, inspiring imitations at other London theatres.  A success in this genre was ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894), which was followed by many "girl"-themed musicals.  The building was demolished in 1903, and the theatre was rebuilt at the corner of Aldwych and The Strand.  More hit musicals followed.  When Edwardes died in 1915, [[Robert Evett]], took over the management of the theatre and had a number of further successes, notably ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'' (1916) and ''[[Going Up (musical)|Going Up]]'' (1918).  By 1939 and in need of refurbishment, the theatre closed and stood empty during [[World War II]]. The building suffered extensive bomb damage during [[airstrike|air raids]] and stood empty until it was demolished in 1956.

==Beginnings==
The theatre was financed by a [[joint stock company]] and built in 1864 as the Strand [[Music Hall|Musick Hall]] by Bassett and Keeling.  This large theatre, with over 2,000&amp;nbsp;seats,&lt;ref name=opening&gt;&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/Opening.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (early history of the Gaiety)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013065457/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/Opening.htm |date=13 October 2006 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; was built at a time when many new theatres were being built in London.&lt;ref name=times&gt;&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/Times.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''The Times'' 11 December 1868] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013065503/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/Times.htm |date=13 October 2006 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike at many other music halls, the proprietors decided to ban smoking and drinking within the hall, and these activities were accommodated in the adjacent saloons.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

A novel gas lighting system was incorporated in the hall, using prisms and mirrors to create a soft light.  Exhausting the heat of the gas jets drew fresh air into the building.  The house was approached through an ambitious arcade, from the Strand.  This was never successful and, with the theatre, was demolished to allow the building of the [[Aldwych]].

==Hollingshead years==
[[File:Gaiety-interior-1868.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the Gaiety, 1869]]
In 1868, the theatre was sumptuously rebuilt by [[John Hollingshead]] as the Gaiety Theatre (announcing its dramatic policy in its name), on a nearby prominent site at the centre of the Aldwych, facing the eastern end of the Strand.&lt;ref&gt;"Architecture: A city in flux brought to book", ''The Times'', 11 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by the theatre architect [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]], who also designed the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]] (1871) in [[Dublin]].  A restaurant operated in the building, and patrons could eat before seeing the show and then go directly to their seats without having to worry about the weather outside.

The Gaiety Theatre opened on 21 December 1868, with ''On the Cards'' and several companion pieces, including the successful ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', by [[W. S. Gilbert]], a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of the opera ''[[Robert le Diable (opera)|Robert le Diable]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/gilbert_and_sullivan_part_1/Brief-Chronology.aspx Digital Guide to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031152934/http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/gilbert_and_sullivan_part_1/Brief-Chronology.aspx |date=31 October 2007 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was a venue primarily for burlesque, variety, continental [[operetta]] and light comedy under the management of John Hollingshead from 1868 to 1886, including several operettas by [[Jacques Offenbach]] and musical burlesques arranged by the theatre's music director, [[Wilhelm Meyer Lutz]]. Gilbert also wrote ''[[An Old Score]]'' for the theatre in 1869.&lt;ref name=spark&gt;Stewart, Maurice. 'The spark that lit the bonfire', in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nellie Farren]] soon became the theatre's star "principal boy" in all the burlesques and played in other comedies. She and comic [[Fred Leslie]] starred at the theatre for over 20 years, with [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] for much of that period.  Her husband, [[Robert Soutar]] was an actor, stage manager and writer for the theatre. A typical evening at the Gaiety might include a three-act comic play, a dramatic interlude, a musical [[extravaganza]], which might also include a ballet or [[pantomime]] (in the tradition of a [[Harlequinade]]). During such four-hour-long bills-of-fare, regular patrons might skip an item on the programme to eat in one of the theatre's plush restaurants, play billiards in the on-site Billiard Room or drink in one of its several bars.&lt;ref name=spark/&gt;

In 1870, [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''Uncle Dick's Darling'' starred a young [[Henry Irving]].  This was the last play that theatre buff [[Charles Dickens]] saw before his death.  Irving also played in the popular and frequently played comical interlude, ''The Trial of Mr. Pickwick'', with Gaiety favourites [[J. L. Toole]] and Nellie Farren, who played [[Sam Weller (character)|Sam Weller]].&lt;ref name=spark/&gt;  ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the first collaboration between [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], played at the theatre in 1871, with Farren as Mercury and [[J. L. Toole]] in the title role. Offenbach's ''[[Les deux aveugles]]'' played in 1872, starring [[Fred Sullivan]].  Two [[Dion Boucicault]] plays produced here in the early 1870s were ''Night and Morning'' and ''Led Astray''.

On 15 December 1880, the theatre presented ''Quicksands'', the first major English language adaptation of a drama by [[Henrik Ibsen]].  It was adapted by W. H. Vernon from Ibsen's ''[[The Pillars of Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibsen.net/index.gan?id=90071&amp;subid=0 "English first performances"], Ibsen.net, 12 May 2004, accessed 8 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Lutz and [[Robert Reece]]'s version of ''The Forty Thieves'' was performed in 1880 (following [[The Forty Thieves|an 1878 charity production]] of the same story), and ''[[Aladdin]]'' in 1881. In 1883, [[F. C. Burnand]] wrote a burlesque of ''[[The Tempest]]'' called ''Ariel'' for the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/10/22/106131305.pdf Review of ''Ariel''], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20040515home.html Information about ''Ariel'', 1883]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' was another 1883 burlesque.  Hollingshead's last production at the theatre was the burlesque ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885–86), produced together with his successor, [[George Edwardes]].  Hollingshead called himself a "licensed dealer in legs, short skirts, French adaptations, [[Shakespeare]], taste and musical glasses."&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=4 January 2008 }} accessed 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edwardes years==
[[File:1894 Lurcher.jpg|left|thumb|150px|1894: [[Arthur Williams (actor)|Arthur Williams]] as William Lurcher ''(A Sheriff's Officer)'', in ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'']]
Edwardes's first show was ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]''.  Although ''Dorothy'' called itself a [[comic opera]], as did most of the British musical works of the era that were neither burlesque, pantomime nor low farce, ''Dorothy'' incorporated some of the elements that US duo [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan and Hart]] were using on Broadway, integrating music and dance into the story line of the comedy.  Edwardes sold that production, but it went on to become the longest-running hit that the musical stage had ever seen.  Edwardes then returned the theatre to burlesque for a half dozen more years.  However, in the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were one-act pieces running less than an hour and using pastiches and parodies of popular songs, opera arias and other music that the audience would readily recognise.  Edwardes expanded the format, adding an original score composed chiefly by [[Meyer Lutz]], and the shows were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9, col. D&lt;/ref&gt;

These "new burlesques" included ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), ''[[Miss Esmeralda]]'' (1887), ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1888), ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890), ''Joan of Arc'' by [[Adrian Ross]] and J. L. Shine (1891) and ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1903), pp. 40–64&lt;/ref&gt; [[John D'Auban]] acted as the theatre's ballet-master and choreographed the Gaiety burlesques and other pieces from 1868 to 1891.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[E. J. Lonnen]] joined the Gaiety for many of Lutz's burlesques.  After these, however, the age of burlesque was coming to an end, and with the retirement of Nellie Farren and Fred Leslie, it was essentially over.

For ''Joan of Arc'', Edwardes had hired a young writer, [[Adrian Ross]], who next wrote a less baudy, more lightly comic piece, similar to ''Dorothy'', with a minimum of plot, focusing on songs with clever lyrics, ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), with stylish costumes and urbane, witty banter.  Edwardes also engaged [[Ivan Caryll]] as resident composer and music director at the Gaiety and soon put Caryll together with the writing team of [[Owen Hall]], [[Harry Greenbank]], Ross and [[Lionel Monckton]].  Edwardes and this team created a series of musical shows similar to ''Dorothy'', but taking its lighter, breezier style a step further. These shows featured fashionable characters, tuneful music, romantic lyrics, witty banter and pretty dancing. The success of the first of these, ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893), which played at other theatres, confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking.

For the next two decades, the "girl" musicals packed the Gaiety Theatre, including titles like ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894), ''My Girl'' (1896),&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead (1903), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (1896), and ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898).  These musicals were imitated at other theatres.  A particular attraction of the Gaiety shows was the beautiful, dancing [[Gaiety Girls]].  These were fashionable, elegant young ladies, unlike the corseted actresses from the burlesques.  Gaiety Girls were polite, well-behaved young women and became a popular attraction and a symbol of ideal womanhood.  Some became popular leading actresses.  The young ladies appearing in George Edwardes's shows became so popular that wealthy gentlemen, termed "Stage Door Johnnies", would wait outside the stage door hoping to escort them to dinner.  In some cases, a marriage into society and even the nobility resulted.  Edwardes arranged with Romano's restaurant, on the Strand, for his girls to dine there at half-price.  It was good exposure for the girls and made Romano's the centre of London's night-life.&lt;ref name=cuttings/&gt;

[[File:Gaietyprogramm.jpg|right|thumb|Part of the programme for the old Gaiety's farewell performance]]
[[Alan Hyman (writer)|Alan Hyman]], an expert on burlesque theatre who penned the 1972 book ''The Gaiety Years'', wrote:
:At the old Gaiety in the Strand the chorus was becoming a matrimonial agency for girls with ambitions to marry into the peerage and began in the nineties when [[Connie Gilchrist, Countess of Orkney|Connie Gilchrist]], a star of the Old Gaiety, married the [[Edmond FitzMaurice, 7th Earl of Orkney|7th Earl of Orkney]] and then in 1901, the [[Geoffrey Taylour, 4th Marquess of Headfort|4th Marquess of Headfort]] married Rosie Boote, who had charmed London the previous year when she sang Maisie in ''[[The Messenger Boy]]''.  After Connie Gilchrist and Rosie Boote had started the fashion a score of [[George Edwardes|the Guv'nor's]] budding stars left him to marry peers or men of title while other Gaiety Girls settled for a banker or a stockbroker.  The Guv'nor finding this was playing ducks and drakes with his theatrical plans had a 'nuptial clause' inserted in every contract....  [[Debutantes]] were competing with the other girls to get into the Gaiety chorus while upper-class youths were joining the ranks of the chorus boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.happenstances.com/other.html Information about the stagedoor Johnnie marriages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509195156/http://www.happenstances.com/other.html |date=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was demolished in 1903 as part of the road widening of the East Strand and the new Aldwych-Kingsway road development, and Edwardes quickly built the ''New Gaiety Theatre'' at the corner of Aldwych and the Strand.  ''[[The Orchid]]'' (1903) opened the new theatre, followed by ''[[The Spring Chicken]]'' (1905), ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907), ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' (1909), ''[[Peggy (musical)|Peggy]]'' (1911), ''[[The Sunshine Girl]]'' (1912), ''[[The Girl on the Film]]'' (1913), ''Adele'' (1914), and ''After the Girl'' (1914).

Perhaps to balance the "girl" musicals for which the Gaiety was famous, Edwardes also presented a series of "boy"-themed musicals, such as ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900), ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901, which introduced [[Gertie Millar]]), ''Two Naughty Boys'' (1906), ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' (1906), ''Havana'' (1908).  Later, [[George Grossmith, Jr.]] and [[Edward Laurillard]] produced a number of successes at the theatre, including ''[[Tonight's the Night (1914 musical)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (1915) and ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'' (1916).  Many of these popular musicals toured after their runs at the Gaiety, both in the British provinces and internationally.  [[Leopold Wenzel]] conducted during the Edwardian period, leaving the theatre in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;"Retirement of Gaiety Conductor", ''The Observer'', 23 February 1913, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and demise==
[[File:Gaiety1.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The theatre around 1910]]
Edwardes died in 1915, leaving his estate indebted and the theatre (as well as Edwardes' other theatres, including [[Daly's Theatre]]), in the hands of [[Robert Evett]], formerly a leading [[tenor]] of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].  [[Manuel Klein]] was music director at the Gaiety for several years beginning in 1915.  Under Evett's management, the theatre prospered with another hit, ''[[Going Up (musical)|Going Up]]'' (1918), followed by ''The Kiss Call'' (1919), and ''Faust on Toast'' (1921).  In 1922, Evett produced Gaiety adaptations of ''Catherine'' and ''[[The Last Waltz (operetta)|The Last Waltz]]'', a work of which he was co-author. The same year, the revue ''Pins and Needles'' opened starring the French beauty [[Agnès Souret]] and had a run of nine months before transferring to the Shubert Theatre, New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/15/109831329.pdf "Pins and Needles Here"], ''The New York Times'', 15 January 1922&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Evett produced ''Our Nell'', the revised version of ''Our Peg''.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Musicals continued at the Gaiety.  In 1929, ''[[Love Lies (musical)|Love Lies]]'', by [[Stanley Lupino]] and [[Arthur Rigby (actor)|Arthur Rigby]], starring [[Cyril Ritchard]] and [[Madge Elliott]], had a successful run at the theatre.  In the 1930s, the theatre played works such as ''[[Sporting Love]]'' (1934) by composer and pianist [[Billy Mayerl]], also with Lupino, which ran for 302 performances.  The last show at the theatre was the farce ''Running Riot'', in 1939.&lt;ref name=cuttings/&gt;

By 1938 the Gaiety Theatre was in need of refurbishment.  However, the theatre no longer conformed to the then current licensing regulations, and so extensive modernisation was required.  This was not considered to be financially viable and in 1939 the Gaiety Theatre closed.  The interior fittings were stripped from the building, and sold at auction.  Standing empty during [[World War II]], the building suffered further damage as a result of bombing during [[airstrike|air raids]].

In 1946 the shell of the Gaiety Theatre was purchased by [[Lupino Lane]] for £200,000.  It was the intention to rebuild the theatre and make it, once again, a centre of musical comedy.  Although restoration did commence, it was found that the structural problems were worse than expected and the work discontinued.  The building was once again sold, resulting in it being demolished in 1956&lt;ref&gt;"London land mark to be torn down", ''The New York Times'', 13 July 1950&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by an office development.

From 2006, a new luxury hotel was being built on the site, the Silken Hotel, designed by [[Foster &amp; Partners]].  At the rear, one of the walls of the old restaurant, which has [[listed building]] status, was being incorporated into all the new development.  However, work on the hotel was halted in 2008 when the developers went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/GaietyTheatreSiteThenAndNow.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (Images of the Gaiety)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116152150/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Strandmusikhall/GaietyTheatreSiteThenAndNow.htm |date=16 November 2007 }} accessed 26 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Grand 1894 Opera House''' in [[Galveston, Texas]] is currently operated as a not-for-profit performing arts theatre. The [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style Opera House is located at 2020 Post Office Street in Galveston's Historic Downtown Cultural Arts District. It was named "The Official Opera House of Texas" in 1993 by the 73rd Texas Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegrand.com/history.asp&lt;/ref&gt; It has a seating capacity of 1,040.&lt;ref&gt;http://conventionsouth.com/business-directory/9569/the-grand-1894-opera-house/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1894, Henry Greenwall (often spelled Greenwald) raised $100,000 for construction of The Grand Opera House and Hotel in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]]. It opened on January 3, 1895 with a live performance of the play, ''The Daughters of Eve''.

The Grand has stood through notable hurricanes, including the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], [[Galveston Hurricane of 1915]], [[Hurricane Carla]], and [[Hurricane Ike]]. The Grand began as a major, live performing arts theatre but after passing through a [[Vaudeville]] phase, it slowly evolved into a movie house. The movie house closed in 1974 and was purchased the same year by the Galveston County Cultural Arts Council. They transformed the movie house back into a theatre and then renovated and restored it to its former beauty. The restoration included volunteer efforts and support from private foundations. The theatre was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as "1894 Grand Opera House" in 1974.&lt;ref name="nris" /&gt; The Galveston County Cultural Arts Council owned the Opera House until 1986, when it became a stand-alone organization known as 1894, Inc. Maureen M. Patton is The Grand's Executive Director, having served as Director under the Arts Council beginning in 1981. Hurricane Ike hit Galveston Island on September 13, 2008, but The Grand was reopened on January 3, 2009 on its 114th anniversary. All of the damage that the hurricane and the flood had caused was repaired with only 92 days of construction.

The Grand also has been the presenter of several premieres: ''Red White &amp; Tuna'' and ''Tuna Does Vegas'', two of four comedic plays written and performed by ''[[Greater Tuna]]'' creators, Jaston Williams and Joe Sears; and ''ANN'', a one-woman play about the life of Texas Governor Ann Richards, written and performed by [[Holland Taylor]].

== Architecture ==
[[File:1894_Grand_Opera_House_Galveston.jpg|thumb]]
"When it opened in 1895, the 70' x 37' x 69' stage was THE LARGEST IN THE STATE OF TEXAS and one of the largest in the country... Even today, a stage whisper can be heard without a microphone, and no seat is more than 70 feet from the stage."

The Grand has been through natural disasters, such as fires and hurricanes, as well as neglect during its time as a movie house. It has been rebuilt and remodeled more than once, such as during the devastating [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], when its rear wall and roof caved in.

The front wall of the building is made of red stone, brick, and terra cotta; the large, glass doors are framed by a carved, Romanesque style stone arch. Inside, the glass box office sits in between the two sets of doors. The carpet is a historic pattern of colors found in the decorative curtain and stenciling of roses and scrolls on the ceiling and boxes. The floors are marble tile, and the walls are wainscot. The banisters and railings are of long leaf red-heart pine, like the wainscot. A large, bronze statue of a woman holding a torch stands on the newel post on The Grand staircase. Inside the theater auditorium, red, velvet curtains frame the stage and eight opera boxes. Blue velour lines the chairs. The stage curtain (originally painted by architect Frank Cox) is a replication of the original, depicting “Sappho and Companions”.

[[File:Monumento em homenagem da tragédia de entre-os-rios.JPG|thumb|Monument in memory of the victims of the Hintze Ribeiro disaster.]]

On the night of 4 March 2001, the '''Hintze Ribeiro disaster''' (also known as '''Entre-os-Rios disaster''') occurred when the [[Hintze Ribeiro Bridge]], made of steel and concrete, collapsed in [[Entre-os-Rios]], [[Castelo de Paiva]], [[Portugal]], killing 59 people, including those in a bus and three cars that were crossing the [[Douro]] river.

Fast waters and a storm at the time gave no chance for an immediate rescue, and the victims drowned. The strong river current carried bodies downstream more than {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us}} to the [[Atlantic ocean]]. Bodies were found as far away as the north coast of [[Spain]] and one even in [[France]].

Hours after the accident, the then Minister of Transportation Jorge Coelho resigned. The following week, dozens of bridges across Portugal were closed for immediate repair. The tragedy caused widespread shock across the nation, with all television networks broadcasting continuous news bulletins, and many solidarity campaigns being organized to help the victims' relatives.

The bridge had linked Castelo de Paiva and Entre os Rios. After the loss of the bridge, residents of Castelo de Paiva had to travel an additional 70&amp;nbsp;km to reach the [[Porto]] area.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2001:261E:0233:0234:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge was more than 100 years old. The collapse was caused by "two decades of [[sand#Resources and environmental concerns|uncontrolled sand extraction]], which compromised the stability of the bridge's [[column|pillar]]s, together with underestimating the warnings from divers and technicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/13/659/2013/|title=Multi-temporal SAR interferometry reveals acceleration of bridge sinking before collapse|first1=J.

The '''Holy Cross dispute''' occurred in 2001 and 2002 in the [[Ardoyne]] area of north [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]. During the 30-year conflict known as [[the Troubles]], Ardoyne had become segregated – [[Ulster Protestants]] lived in one area and [[Irish Catholic]]s in another. This left Holy Cross, a Catholic primary school for girls, in the middle of a Protestant area. In June 2001, Protestant [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] began [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] the school, claiming that Catholics were regularly attacking their homes and denying them access to facilities. For weeks, hundreds of protesters tried to stop the schoolchildren and their parents from walking to school through their area. Some protesters shouted [[sectarianism|sectarian]] abuse and threw stones, bricks, fireworks, [[blast bomb]]s and urine-filled balloons at the schoolchildren and their parents. Hundreds of [[riot police]], backed up by [[British Army|British]] soldiers, escorted the children and their parents through the protest each day. The "scenes of frightened Catholic schoolgirls running a gauntlet of abuse from loyalist protesters as they walked to school captured world headlines".&lt;ref name=heatley&gt;Heatley, Colm. [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/interface/docs/heatley04.htm ''Interface, Flashpoints in Northern Ireland''. Chapter 1: Alliance Avenue and Holy Cross Dispute]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt; Death threats were made against the parents and school staff by the [[Red Hand Defenders]], a loyalist paramilitary group. The protest was condemned by both Catholics and Protestants, including politicians. Some likened the protest to [[child abuse]] and compared the protesters to American [[white supremacist]]s in 1950s [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt;

The first picket took place in June, during the last week of school before the summer break. It resumed on 3 September, at the beginning of the new school term, and lasted until 23 November. During this time, the protest sparked fierce rioting between Catholics and Protestants in Ardoyne. The loyalists agreed to "suspend" the protest after being promised tighter security for their area.

In January 2002, a scuffle between a Protestant man and a Catholic woman outside the school sparked a large-scale riot in the area. The picket was not resumed and the situation has been mostly quiet since then. The following year, the [[BBC]] aired a documentary-drama about the protests.

Holy Cross is a girls-only Catholic primary school in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast. Ardoyne remains one of the most deprived areas of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nisra.gov.uk/deprivation/archive/Updateof2005Measures/NIMDM_2010_Statistics_Press_Release.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213065841/http://www.nisra.gov.uk/deprivation/archive/Updateof2005Measures/NIMDM_2010_Statistics_Press_Release.pdf |archivedate=13 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }} STATISTICS PRESS RELEASE –

Prof. Frank Gaffikin. [[Queen’s University Belfast]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the outbreak of [[the Troubles]] in the late 1960s, the area was "mixed", with Catholics and Protestants living alongside each other. However, after violence broke out between the two communities, the area became segregated. The area to the south of Alliance Avenue became almost wholly populated by Catholics&lt;ref name=niassembly1 /&gt; (who were mostly [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] and [[Irish republican|republican]]) while the area to the north (known as Glenbryn) became wholly populated by Protestants (who were mostly [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]]). This left Holy Cross in the middle of a Protestant area and some of the schoolchildren had to walk through it to get to school. A {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} [[Interface_area#North_Belfast|wall]] (known as a "[[peace line]]") was built to separate the two communities. During the 30 years of The Troubles, almost 20 people were killed in the area of the peace line by loyalists, republicans and the British Army.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt;

In the mid-1990s, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and the main loyalist paramilitary groups—the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) and [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF)—declared [[ceasefire]]s. In 1998, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was signed, which set up a government in which Irish nationalists/republicans and unionists/loyalists were to share power. However, the political situation remained tense. So-called [[dissident republicans]] and dissident loyalists continued to wage small-scale violent campaigns.

The origins of the dispute are contested. In December 2000, Protestant taxi driver Trevor Kell was shot dead on the edge of the Protestant area in Ardoyne. The IRA were suspected of involvement as forensic evidence linked the gun that fired the bullet with an IRA shooting in 1997. The next day, loyalists retaliated by shooting dead Catholic man Gary Moore as he was renovating a house in [[Newtownabbey]]. Later, the IRA was blamed for the "punishment shooting" of two men, one of whom is believed to have been questioned over Kell's death.&lt;ref name=natlines&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1524362.stm "Ardoyne stories: Behind nationalist lines"].

Those who took part in the protest claimed that their homes were being regularly attacked by Catholics and that they were being denied access to facilities in the Catholic area, such as shops and playgrounds.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt; Anne Bill, a community worker who was centrally involved in the protest, said "People in Glenbryn kept telling the Government about attacks on their houses and how vulnerable they felt but we weren't being listened to. That is why people protested on the Ardoyne Road, the focus wasn't so much the school itself".&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt; However, Catholics claimed that their homes were regularly being attacked also.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt; Other protesters alleged that the Provisional IRA was using the children's journey to-and-from school to gather intelligence.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt; Tension built and youths from both communities raised more and more flags along Ardoyne Road.&lt;ref name=natlines/&gt; On the 19th of June, a fight broke out between men putting up loyalist paramilitary flags and the occupants of a passing car.  Loyalists allege that the car from republican Ardoyne estate rammed the ladder and knocked the two men off. How the episode started remains disputed.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crimes of loyalty, Page 270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/22/northernireland.schools?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 "Violence engulfs friendly schools"].

In the summer of 2001, the RUC received intelligence that UDA members were planning to "exploit community tensions" to kill nationalists, Catholics and/or police officers.&lt;ref name="guardian-holy-cross-belfast-two-years-on"/&gt;

==Summer 2001==
[[File:Glenbryn Parade, Belfast - geograph.org.uk - 1461361.jpg|thumb|left|A street in Glenbryn, the Protestant area]]
On Tuesday 19 June, Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers had to protect children and parents entering the school after they were attacked by loyalist stone throwers. Police described the attack as "vicious". Following the incident, a blockade of the school developed, with loyalists standing across the road and RUC officers keeping the children and their parents away.&lt;ref name=cainchron&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch01.htm A Chronology of the Conflict: 2001], [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, the school was forced to close when loyalists blocked the entrance. During the evening, hundreds of loyalists and nationalists (up to 600) clashed with each other and with the police. Shots were also fired at the police and over 100 petrol bombs were thrown. During the riots the police fired a number of the new 'L21 A1' plastic baton rounds for the first time.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt; 39 RUC officers were injured. Nine shots in total were fired - six from loyalists and three from republicans. The trouble came after an explosion at the rear of Catholic homes next to a peace line. Both loyalist and nationalist politicians blamed each other for the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police injured in sectarian riots |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1399300.stm|accessdate=15 October 2018|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=21 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the first of many large riots to take place in Belfast within more than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Addley|first1=Esther|title=Riot City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/11/northernireland.estheraddley|work=The Guardian|date=11 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The morning blockade continued on Thursday 21 June. About 60 of the school's 230 pupils entered the school through the grounds of another school. Senior [[Sinn Féin]] member [[Gerry Kelly]] said: "It's like something out of [[Alabama]] in the 1960s". Three Protestant families left their homes in Ardoyne Avenue, saying they were afraid of a nationalist attack. During the evening and night there were serious disturbances in the area around the school. Loyalists fired ten shots, and threw six blast bombs and 46 petrol bombs at police lines.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt; Two Catholic homes were attacked with pipe bombs, and a child was thrown against a wall by one of the blasts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/22/northernireland.schools?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 "Violence engulfs friendly schools"].

On Friday 22 June, a number of schoolchildren again had to enter the school through the grounds of another school. This was the last day of school before the summer break.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

Talks between the protesters and the schoolchildren's parents took place over the summer, but no agreement was reached. On 20 August, a 'paint bomb' was thrown at the home of a Protestant man in Hesketh Park, smashing a window and causing paint damage to furniture. The man had taken part in the loyalist protest.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

==Autumn 2001==
[[File:"The Divide", Ardoyne Road, Belfast - geograph.org.uk - 1461300.jpg|thumb|Part of Ardoyne Road]]
The protest resumed on Monday 3 September, the first day of the Autumn school term. The RUC, supported by the [[British Army]], were by then better prepared and managed to force a path through the protesters. Loyalists jeered and shouted sectarian abuse as the children, some as young as four, were escorted into the school by their parents and the police. Stones and bottles were thrown at the children and their parents; one woman was injured.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt; A mother of one of the schoolgirls said: "It was absolutely terrifying. They were shouting 'dirty tramps', 'your kids are animals', '[[Fenian]] scum', 'you Fenian bastards'. And all we were trying to do was get our kids to school". Unionist politicians claimed a "heavy-handed" police presence had inflamed the situation, while the [[Progressive Unionist Party]]'s [[Billy Hutchinson]] alleged that five known IRA men had been allowed to walk with the children through the Protestant area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/04/northernireland.schools1 "All we wanted was to get our kids to school"]. ''The Guardian'', 4 September 2001. Retrieved 3 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the day the [[Red Hand Defenders]] (RHD), an illegal loyalist paramilitary group, warned parents and children to stay away from the Ardoyne Road. A threat was also issued against police officers. During the evening there was violence near the school as youths from both sides attacked each other and the security forces. Three Catholic-owned homes on Newington Avenue were badly damaged in a loyalist [[pipe bomb]] attack. The blast caused an oil tank to catch fire and the flames spread to three houses, one of which was completely destroyed. Another pipe bomb exploded in the garden of a house in the White City area. There was also violence on North Queen Street and Limestone Road.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

The following is a timeline of the major events during the Autumn protest.
;Week one
*Tuesday 4 September: Loyalist protesters tried to block access to the school, but riot police forced a path through the protesters and lined the road with armoured vehicles, creating a cordon for the children and parents to walk through. Loyalists attacked riot police with a [[blast bomb]] (an improvised grenade), injuring one officer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/04/northernireland.schools "Violence returns to disputed Belfast school"]. The Guardian. 4 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1524962.stm |title=Eyewitness: A second day of fear |date=4 September 2001 |publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the children and parents made their way through the cordon, loyalist protesters shouted abuse and threw stones at them. Some of the children were forced to turn back. There was more rioting near the school during the evening and night. A crowd of loyalists attacked police with bricks, bottles, stones, fireworks, ballbearings and blast bombs. A volley of shots was also heard in the Glenbryn estate. Police figures stated that 41 police officers and two soldiers had been injured, fifteen blast bombs and 250 petrol bombs had been thrown, and four civilian cars had been damaged.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Wednesday 5 September: As the parents and their children passed Glenbryn Parade, loyalists threw a blast bomb towards them. The device exploded, injuring four police officers and a police dog. Panic ensued. Children began screaming and "weeping uncontrollably" and one mother suffered a panic attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1527010.stm "Eyewitness: Bomb blast at school"]. BBC News, 5 September 2001. Retrieved 3 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; All were taken to hospital. The Red Hand Defenders (RHD) said it was responsible for the attack.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt; Afterward, Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) politician Billy Hutchinson said he was "ashamed to be a loyalist today after seeing these people attack young Catholic girls". However, he says he continued to stand with the protesters each morning to show leadership.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt; [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]], the British [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], called the attack "barbaric" and called for the protest to end immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1527094.stm "Anger over school protest blast"]. BBC News. 5 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Thursday 6 September: The protest was peaceful but very noisy as protesters used air horns (klaxons), blew whistles, and banged metal bin lids as the children passed through the security cordon. Four parents in the 'Right to Education' group were notified that death threats had been made against them by the RHD, who said they would be killed if they were seen taking their children to the school. John Reid, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, cut short his holiday and returned to Northern Ireland because of the situation.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Friday 7 September: Loyalists held a silent protest as children and parents passed through the security cordon. The silent protest was a mark of respect for Thomas McDonald (16), a Protestant killed in a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] incident after he had attacked a car with bricks and stones in another part of north Belfast on Tuesday. Catholic parents also held a minute's silence before beginning their walk to the school. Inside the school grounds, prayers involving clergymen from both denominations were said.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

;Week two
*Monday 10 September: The protesters were quiet as the children and their parents passed, but when the parents returned home the protesters used air horns (klaxons), blew whistles, and banged metal bin lids. Some of the protesters shouted "[[Fenian]] scum" at the parents. In London, [[Richard N. Haass|Richard Haass]], the [[United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland]], discussed the protest with John Reid. Senior Sinn Féin member [[Gerry Kelly]] introduced a private members' motion in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], proposing that "the Assembly supports the right to education of children attending the Holy Cross Primary School in north Belfast". [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] members proposed an amendment to the motion to make it apply to all schools in the area. The Assembly passed the amended motion.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Tuesday 11 September: The protest followed the pattern of yesterday. Father Aidan Troy, Chairman of the school's Board of Governors, together with a local Protestant clergyman, held a meeting with representatives of the Concerned Residents of Upper Ardoyne (CRUA) who were organising the protest. John Reid also held a meeting with the representatives.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt; Fr Troy said of the protest: "I really found it hard to comprehend the hatred that was shown to the school girls ... I walked with them and because of that I was spat on by the protesters. They held up posters accusing me of being a paedophile and they showed the children pornographic images. The intensity of the protest was hard to comprehend; I don't think people can really understand that from watching it on television".&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt;
*Wednesday 12 September: The protest followed the pattern of Monday and Tuesday. However, before going to the school the children and parents held a prayer service and a minute's silence for the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]]. On Friday, the protesters halted their protest for one day as a mark of respect for the victims of 11 September attacks.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

;Week three
*Thursday 20 September: Protesters reverted to the earlier tactic of making a lot of noise as the children passed. Six men appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on public order offences related to the school protest. The six men were remanded on bail but told not to take part in the protest. As a result of the arrests, the group representing the protesters, CRUA, announced that it had "suspended all business until further notice".&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

;Week four
*Wednesday 26 September: Protesters threw fireworks at children and parents returning from the school during the afternoon.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt; Meanwhile that evening a loyalist riot in nearby [[Crumlin Road]] injured 33 RUC officers and 50 shots were fired at police.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

;Week five
*Monday 1 October: Protesters continued their noisy protest as children and parents entered and left the school. Some protesters threw [[urine]]-filled balloons at the children and parents. Cups of cold tea and water were also thrown by protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/09/northernireland.features "How my daughter was cast into a maelstrom of hatred"]. ''The Guardian'', 9 November 2003. Retrieved 3 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reg Empey]] ([[Ulster Unionist Party]]), then Acting [[First Minister and deputy First Minister|First Minister of Northern Ireland]], and Seamus Mallon ([[Social Democratic and Labour Party]]), then Acting Deputy First Minister, met with local representatives to discuss the situation. Empy said there was no excuse for the ongoing protest.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Tuesday 2 October: British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Quentin Davies, Baron Davies of Stamford|Quentin Davies]], then [[Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], accompanied parents and children as they returned home through the protest. Davies called the protest "utterly unacceptable".&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

;Week six
*Tuesday 9 October: Aidan Troy, chairman of the school's Board of Governors, said he was considering taking legal action to try to end the protest. He said: "The weeks of suffering for these small girls were never justified ... This is no longer a legitimate protest; it is a form of [[child abuse]]". The cost of policing the protest was reported as having reached £1 million.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Wednesday 10 October: Many of the protesters had begun to hide their identity and some were wearing masks of characters from [[horror film|horror movies]]. Local doctor Michael Tan said that some of the schoolchildren's families were near "breaking point" and parents and children were in need of professional psychological care. Bryce Dickson, head of the [[Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission]], visited the scene of the protest. He spoke to some of the protesters but was criticised by some of the parents of the children for not walking the route with them as Quentin Davies had done. One of the protesters displayed a threatening letter allegedly sent by a group called the "Catholic Reaction Force". Meanwhile, it was announced that the security wall between the loyalist and nationalist areas would be extended.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

;Week seven
*Monday 15 October: Bryce Dickson again visited the protest and called for it to end. He said "The treatment of these children is inhumane and their right to effective education is being affected". Protestant parents in north and west Belfast said that there had been rising attacks on buses carrying Protestant schoolchildren.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Wednesday 17 October: As children and parents were returning home from the school, loyalists exploded a bomb at the back of a house on Alliance Avenue. No one was injured but the householder, and a number of parents and children, were described as being "in shock".&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

;Week eight
*Wednesday 24 October: There were disturbances on the Crumlin Road, not far from the school. Loyalists blocked the main road at about 4:30&lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt;, stopping Catholic schoolchildren from getting home. Catholic families arrived to try to escort their children home. Bricks and bottles were thrown by both groups and police moved in to keep the sides apart. The Crumlin Road is the 'alternative' route that loyalists want the Holy Cross children and their parents to use when going to and from the school.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Friday 26 October: Two people were arrested during the protest outside the school. Loyalists had tried to block the road and stop children parents from getting to the school.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt; The school was closed the following week after [[Halloween]].

;Week nine
*Monday 5 November: Protesters said they had reached an "understanding" with the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (the former RUC, now renamed) over the weekend. As a result, the police were not wearing full riot gear when the protest took place.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Wednesday 7 November: The mother of a child attending the school began legal proceedings against John Reid and the police. The mother said that police had not given enough protection to her daughter and had failed to identify, arrest, or prosecute protesters who broke the law in full public view. While on a visit to Northern Ireland, Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] met some of the schoolchildren and their parents. Tutu also met some of those involved in the protest.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Friday 9 November: The protest was halted for one day. Some of the schoolchildren sat their "11-plus" exams. [[Mary McAleese]], then [[President of Ireland]], called for an end to the protest.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

;Week ten
*Monday 12 November: There was a change in the policing tactics used at the protest. Instead of gathering together all the Catholic parents and children and escorting them to the school as a group, the police specified a time period in which parents could walk to the school. About 400 police officers (an eighth of the total in Belfast) were there to ensure that the children could get to school. The day's operation cost an estimated £100,000. Some Catholic parents complained that the new police tactics left them more exposed to the protesters. Police arrested a nationalist who was taking a video of the protesters.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

;Week eleven
*Monday 19 November: The media reported that the father of one of the schoolgirls had begun a [[hunger strike]]. The man said that he felt so frustrated by the protest that he was refusing food in an attempt to end the blockade. It was also revealed that a split had occurred in CRUA, the protest group. It was reported that as many as five of its committee members may have resigned. They are believed to include spokesmen Stuart McCartney and Jim Potts.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Tuesday 20 November: The [[Belfast Education and Library Board]] (BELB) provided two buses for those schoolchildren and parents who wished to use them to get through the protest. However, most of them made their way to the school on foot.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Thursday 22 November: [[David Trimble]] (UUP), then First Minister, and Mark Durkan (SDLP), then Deputy First Minister, held a meeting with the protest group. Before calling an end to the protest the protesters asked for [[CCTV]] to be introduced, along with road-calming measures, and tighter security in the area.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;
*Friday 23 November: In the afternoon there was a rally in the middle of Belfast in support of the schoolchildren. About 500 people attended. In the evening the protest group held a meeting and announced that the protest would be "suspended".&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

For months after the protest ended, police and British Army armoured vehicles sat outside the school and at the junction of Alliance Avenue each day. However, eventually parents were able to walk their children to school without a police and Army escort.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt;

== January 2002 ==
On Wednesday 9 January 2002, there were confrontations outside the school during the early afternoon. Disturbances and rioting quickly spread throughout Ardoyne during the evening and into the night. Catholic parents and Protestant residents each claimed that the other side had started the trouble. Catholic parents said that they had faced increased verbal abuse since Monday during their walks to and from school and that they were attacked while leaving the school on Wednesday afternoon. A Catholic mother claimed she was punched in the face as she walked home from the school with her child. Police officers said they arrived at a confrontation between a Protestant woman and a Catholic woman near the school. The police moved to make an arrest but the person was protected by other residents. Police officers said they had to draw their weapons. There was a report that loyalists had driven a car at the school gates in an attempt to break in. Some schoolchildren had to be taken home through the grounds of another school while a bus carrying other children was attacked on its way down Ardoyne Road. Protestant residents claimed the trouble started when Catholics removed a wreath from a lamp-post.&lt;ref name=cainchron2&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch02.htm A Chronology of the Conflict: 2002], [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 500 loyalists and nationalists were involved in the disturbances on the Ardoyne Road, Crumlin Road and Brompton Park areas. About 130 petrol bombs, acid bombs and fireworks were thrown. Four Catholic youths were hospitalised after being hit by shotgun pellets at Hesketh Park; loyalists petrol-bombed and destroyed a police vehicle; Catholic homes were attacked on the Upper Crumlin Road; a Catholic woman was knocked-down by a car on Twaddell Avenue; a Catholic man was struck by a police vehicle, and a 13-year-old Protestant schoolboy was injured when a bus was attacked. The police fired eight plastic bullets and arrested three people. As the trouble worsened, 200 police officers, backed by 200 soldiers, were deployed. At least 14 police officers were injured.&lt;ref name=cainchron2/&gt;

The following day, the Holy Cross school was forced to close for the day. Some other schools in the area closed early due to fears about the safety of schoolchildren. In the morning, six loyalists, one with a gun, rampaged through the grounds of Our Lady of Mercy Catholic girls' secondary school, smashing 18 cars with crowbars. Parents rushed to collect their hysterical daughters. In the afternoon, Protestant pupils from Boys' Model Secondary School were ferried home in police armoured Land Rovers past nationalist crowds on Crumlin Road.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/11/northernireland.schools "More schools caught in cycle of hate"]. ''The Guardian'', 11 January 2002. Retrieved 3 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic parents and Protestant residents held separate meetings to discuss the situation.&lt;ref name=cainchron2/&gt;

On Friday 11 January, the Red Hand Defenders issued a death threat against all Catholic teachers and all other staff working at Catholic schools in north Belfast. That weekend, two Catholic schools were set on fire and teachers' cars were attacked. On Monday, more than 750 armed police officers and soldiers were sent to guard Catholic schools in north Belfast while armoured vehicles lined Ardoyne Road.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/15/northernireland.schools?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 "Armed guards deployed to protect Catholic teachers"].

The [[Northern Ireland Office]] announced that permanent CCTV cameras would be installed on the Ardoyne Road. A temporary system was to be put in place while waiting for the permanent installation.&lt;ref name=cainchron2/&gt;

In February 2002, Holy Cross schoolchildren travelled to [[County Galway]] for a free holiday as guests of Peacock's Hotel. The owners of the hotel had made the offer of the holiday following the 2001 protests. Twenty of the schoolchildren also met [[Bertie Ahern]], then [[Taoiseach]], during a short visit to Dublin. Ahern said it would show support for the children from the people of the Republic.&lt;ref name=cainchron2/&gt;

In June, James Adair—brother of [[Ulster Defence Association]] leader [[Johnny Adair]]—was jailed for six months for riotous behaviour and given a concurrent sentence of four months for obstructing police during the riots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/adairs-brother-jailed-over-holy-cross-riots-302823.html "Adair's brother jailed over Holy Cross riots"], ''[[Irish Independent]]'', 13 June 2002.

In 2003, Loyalists placed a pipe bomb at the entrance of the school, it was defused and there were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/holy-cross-pipe-bomb-raises-fear-that-loyalists-may-revive-dispute-612706.html "Holy Cross pipe bomb raises fear that loyalists may revive dispute"], David McKitterick, ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 January 2003.

In April 2013, loyalists erected [[Union Jack]]s and loyalist flags outside the school and painted the kerbstones at its entrance red, white and blue. On 25 April the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) were called to the school to disperse a loyalist protest being held outside it. The protest was sparked by false rumours on social networks that [[Belfast City Council]] employees were due to arrive to remove the flags and the paint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/no-holy-cross-ii-vows-dup-following-loyalist-protest-outside-school-29225107.html No 'Holy Cross II' vows DUP following loyalist protest outside school], Belfast Telegraph, 27 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early hours of Sunday 23 April 2017, a bomb was found by a police patrol outside the gates of Holy Cross Boys' Primary School in Ardoyne. The police said the bomb was "significant in terms of its [undisclosed] shape", and that police on foot patrol were the likely target. A sense of outrage was reported in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-39690871 |title=Holy Cross school bomb 'significant shape', police say|website=BBC News |date=24 April 2017  |author= |accessdate= 24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
The Holy Cross protest was said to have heightened sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland in a way not seen since the [[Drumcree conflict|Drumcree dispute]] in the mid-1990s. PUP politician Billy Hutchinson said "The protest was a disaster in terms of putting their cause forward but it was a genuine expression of their anger and frustration and fear over what is happening in that part of North Belfast".&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt;

A month before the protest was ended the Department of Social Development announced a housing redevelopment package for Glenbryn. This angered some Catholics and nationalists, particularly in north Belfast, where almost 80% of those on the housing waiting list were Catholics. They saw the package as a "buy-off" for Glenbryn residents. Ardoyne Sinn Féin councillor Margaret McClenaghan says the common perception was that loyalists were being rewarded for intimidating schoolgirls. However, one Protestant community activist said "There is no victory for our area despite all the hype. It is actually a strategy of social political engineering between the NlO and the Housing Executive, to solve the issue of interface tension". He explained that 186 houses would be demolished and that only about 20% would be replaced. This, he said, would mean a shrinking of the Protestant population in Glenbryn.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt;

During the protest, a number of schoolchildren were moved to other schools. Applications for enrolment at Holy Cross had dropped by almost half.&lt;ref name=cainchron2/&gt;

Since the end of the protest, steps have been taken to heal relations. The North Belfast Community Action Unit was set up to foster inter-community talks, focusing on social and economic issues of interest to Ardoyne and Glenbryn. Nevertheless, community workers from both sides admit progress has been slow.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt;

The 1st Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was awarded the [[Wilkinson Sword of Peace]] for its role during the dispute.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Effect on the schoolchildren===
Brendan Bradley, head of the Survivors of Trauma group (which deals with victims of Troubles-related violence), said that the "trauma" experienced by the children was "almost without parallel" in the history of the Troubles:&lt;blockquote&gt;It wasn't as though this abuse lasted for a couple of days or was a one-off; it went on for months. Many needed counselling, some long-term counselling, in the wake of it all. Parents told how their daughters had changed from being fun-loving to being very withdrawn.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fr Aidan Troy said that some of the schoolgirls had been "put on heavy tranquillizers such as diazepam ... because of the trauma they were experiencing". Parents spoke of how their children had been wetting the bed and had started to throw tantrums and become withdrawn. When Holy Cross teachers asked girls in [[Education in Northern Ireland|Primary 6]] (aged 9–10) to draw a picture many had drawn mothers and fathers crying, surrounded by people with angry faces.&lt;ref name=heatley/&gt;

[[file:Hotel_Luxe_Moscow.jpg|thumb|The former Hotel Lux in Moscow.]]

'''Hotel Lux''' (Люксъ) was a hotel in [[Moscow]] that, during the early years of the [[Soviet Union]], housed many leading exiled Communists. During the [[Nazi]] era, exiles from all over Europe went there, particularly from Germany. A number of them became leading figures in German politics in the postwar era. Initial reports of the hotel were very good, although its problem with rats was mentioned as early as 1921. Communists from more than 50 countries came for congresses and for training or to work. By the 1930s, [[Joseph Stalin]] had come to regard the international character of the hotel with suspicion and its occupants as potential spies. His [[Great Purge|purges]] created an atmosphere of fear among the occupants, who were faced with mistrust, denunciations, and nightly arrests. The purges at the hotel peaked between 1936 and 1938. Germans who fled Hitler for safety in the Soviet Union found themselves interrogated, arrested, tortured, and sent to [[forced labor]] camps. Most of the 178 leading German communists who were killed in Stalin's purges were residents of Hotel Lux.

== Early history ==
Originally named ''Hotel Frantsiya'', the hotel was built as a luxury hotel in 1911&lt;ref name="welt"&gt;Peter Dittmar, [https://www.welt.de/politik/article1311902/Der_steinerne_Zeuge_des_stalinistischen_Terrors.html "Der steinerne Zeuge des stalinistischen Terrors"] ''Die Welt'' (October 30, 2007).

Retrieved November 14, 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located at [[Tverskaya Street]] 36, it had four stories and housed the Filippov Café.&lt;ref name="welt" /&gt;
The hotel was taken over by the [[Bolshevik]]s after the [[October Revolution]] and renamed Люксъ, i.e. ''Hotel de luxe.''
It came to be used by the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) as lodging for communist revolutionaries from other countries.&lt;ref name="zeit"&gt;Alexander Cammann, [http://www.zeit.de/2011/44/Film-Hotel-Lux "Müde Kalauer im roten Bunker"] ''[[Die Zeit]]'' (October 23, 2011).

In June and July 1921, 600 delegates who came to the [[Comintern#Third World Congress|Third World Congress of the Communist International]] from 52 countries were housed at Hotel Lux. With the sudden influx of so many international revolutionaries, the hotel began to be known as the "headquarters of the world revolution".&lt;ref name="welt"/&gt; Germany alone sent 41 delegates. The [[Hamburg Uprising]] was discussed at the hotel,&lt;ref name="zeit-jv" /&gt; both before and after the events. After the Comintern was founded, many of the Party's leading functionaries lived at the hotel, including [[Ernst Reuter]]&lt;ref name="weber-57"&gt;Weber (October 2006), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; and the hotel became the best known of the Comintern's buildings, although its offices were elsewhere.&lt;ref name="weber-56" /&gt;

== 1933 through World War II ==
In 1933, two stories were added, giving the hotel 300 rooms. The address, meanwhile, was changed to Gorky Street 10.&lt;ref name="welt" /&gt; 1933 was also the year [[Adolf Hitler]] gained power with the [[Machtergreifung]] and soon began to arrest and imprison his political opponents, arresting communists and socialists by the thousands. German communists began to flee to the Soviet Union and the Hotel Lux began to fill with German exiles.&lt;ref name="weber-58"&gt;Weber (October 2006), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to party functionaries, there were advisors, translators and writers who came with their families. Employees were brought to the Comintern [[Central Committee]]'s offices by bus.&lt;ref name="geo"&gt;[http://www.geo.de/GEO/heftreihen/geo_epoche/61487.html „Emigranten: Hotel Lux“] ''Geo Epoche'', No. 38 (August 2009).

The hotel was continually plagued by rats;&lt;ref name="welt" /&gt; the earliest reports of them were in 1921. There was hot water only twice a week, forcing people to shower in groups, as many as four people at a time. Communal kitchens for the use of residents cooked food next to boiling pots of diapers being sterilized. In spite of the conditions, initially, there was camaraderie among the residents.&lt;ref name="geo" /&gt; Children played in the halls&lt;ref name="welt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zeit-jv" /&gt; and attended a German-language school, the [[Karl Liebknecht School]], set up for the children of exiles.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5e3agUM_8qUC&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;ots=DWdksTwyaB&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Generation Exodus: The Fate of Young Jewish Refugees from Nazi Germany''] Tauris Parke Paperbacks (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;168–169 {{ISBN|1-86064-885-1}}.

An investigation or arrest was prompted more by the atmosphere of terror than by charges of wrongdoing, which were often baseless. Walter Laqueur later wrote of the period, "There was no rhyme or reason as to who was arrested and who was not, the security organs were given a plan to fulfill, a certain number of people were to be arrested in a certain region, and from this stage on it was more or less a matter of accident at whose door the NKVD (the secret police) emissaries would knock in the early hours of the morning."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-hgM5t1iu2MC&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;ots=MZomupvnEh&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Generation Exodus''] Brandeis University Press (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;171.

Then the NKVD returned to collect the accused and seal the door. One night, the NKVD knocked on the Langs' door and Franz Lang was told to get ready. Dutifully waiting outside his door to be picked up, the security police returned. "What are you doing standing around out here?", asked the NKVD. Lang replied that he'd been ordered to do so. "What's your room number?", asked the security officer. "Number 13." "We're only taking away the even numbers tonight!" Astonished, Lang went back to bed. Nor did the NKVD ever knock on his door again.&lt;ref&gt;"Nachts kamen Stalins Häscher", p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1938, in order to get upstairs in the hotel, a ''propusk'' was needed, a document that said one was authorized to get past the armed guard, standing in front of the elegant [[Art Nouveau]] elevator.&lt;ref name="spiegel-178-98"&gt;"Nachts kamen Stalins Häscher", p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Even high-level members of the Comintern could not get past the guard without a propusk.&lt;ref name="spiegel-178-98" /&gt;

The atmosphere affected the children. Rolf Schälike, who was a child at Hotel Lux, later wrote, "I grew up in Moscow, in the center of power, and state and non-state criminality, Gorky Street, Hotel Lux. It was the years 1938–1946. Around us too, there was juvenile violence. We played '[[Soviet partisans|partisan]] and German fascists' in our Hotel Lux, and one kid in our group was hanged—for fun. He couldn't be revived again. There were frequent battles with iron bands with the kids from the neighboring building."&lt;ref name="welt" /&gt;

Of the 1400 leading German communists, a total of 178 were killed in Stalin's purges, nearly all of them residents of Hotel Lux.&lt;ref name="weber-59"&gt;Weber (October 2006), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the Nazis killed 222 of those 1400 leading German communists. Within the top leadership itself, there were 59 [[Politburo]] members between 1918 and 1945, six of whom were killed by Nazis and seven by the Stalinist purges.&lt;ref name="weber-59" /&gt; The saying among the German communists was, "What the [[Gestapo]] left of the [[Communist Party of Germany]], the [[NKWD]] picked up."&lt;ref name="zeit-jv" /&gt; When [[Leon Trotsky]] was killed in August 1940, the purges at Hotel Lux stopped, bringing a brief respite to the exiles.

After the collapse of communism, the hotel housed offices, small travel agencies, liquidation companies and other small businesses on the lower floors, the upper floors remained hotel rooms.&lt;ref name="zeit-jv" /&gt;

The street name has been restored to Tverskaya; the building remains number 10.

== Legacy ==
Numerous guests and residents of Hotel Lux have written about the hotel, initially in reports and articles, later in books and memoirs. Early reports from before the purges were often positive, though mentions of rats appear from the beginning. Accommodations were described in favorable terms&lt;ref name="weber-57" /&gt; and the atmosphere as full of camaraderie.&lt;ref name="geo" /&gt;

In [[East Germany]] in the 1950s and 1960s, the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] commissioned memoirs (''Erinnerungsberichte'') from former exiles who had lived there.&lt;ref name="agross-159-60" /&gt; These were carefully written official reports that sanitized and supported the official version of events.  [[Franziska Reubens]], who lived there with her husband and children, wrote in guarded language, "It is not easy to write about the memories from that time, to write about them honestly."&lt;ref name="agross-159-60" /&gt; Other people turned away from the Communist Party, some as a result of their exile in the Soviet Union, and wrote more bluntly and critically about the hotel, such as [[Ruth von Mayenburg]], who in one passage, used [[cannibalism]] as a metaphor to describe the period.&lt;ref name="spiegel-köst"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464951.html "Köstliche Entdeckung"] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' (November 3, 1969).

The '''International GTSprint Series''' was a [[grand tourer]]-style [[sports car racing]] founded in 2010 by FG Group, led by [[Maurizio Flammini]], and afterwards by Superstars World of Racing SpA, a company managed by the same group. The series born under the name of '''Superstars GTSprint''' and took the current name the following year, and was canceled before the 2014 season due to lack of entries.

==History==
The series born in 2010, as a support for the [[Superstars Series|International Superstars Series]], under the name of Superstars GTSprint. 23 cars raced the first round in [[Monza]], and during the season the number of entries wandered around 17-18. [[Alessandro Bonetti]] and [[Maurizio Mediani]] won the title driving a [[Ferrari F430]].

In 2011, the series obtained an international titration, with a consistent increase of participants. The following year, International Trophies for GTS-Cup and GTS-Open classes were created, but the cars on the grid fell dramatically and before the beginning of the 2014 season the series was finally folded. [[Thomas Schöffler]] was the last overall champion.

==Format==
Since its birth, the series was focused on sprint races, as the name implies. There were two races for each weekend, consisting of twenty-five minutes + 1 lap. In 2012, the format changed into two races of thirty minutes, subsequently extended to one hour in 2013 with a mandatory pit stop in order to change the driver.

==Technical regulations==
The series was open to [[grand tourer]]-style cars, broken into different classes based on power and weight. [[Group GT2|GTS-2]], [[Group GT3|GTS-3]] and [[Group GT4|GT4]] classes were allowed respectively to the cars obeying their [[FIA]] regulations; GTS-Cup included cars used in manufacturer's one-make cup series; GT4-S was a subject of GT4 class and GTS-Open was open to [[grand tourer]] cars without precise regulations.

==Sporting regulations==
The scoring system was the same of [[Superstars Series|International Superstars Series]]. Since 2012, an additional point was awarded to every driver in the starting grid of each race, which became two in 2013, with one point awarded as a "qualification point".

[[File:Mary Queen of Scots reenactor.jpg|right|thumb|A reenactress playing the role of [[Mary Queen of Scots]] at a Scottish fair in 2003.]]

'''Living history''' is an activity that incorporates historical tools, activities and dress into an interactive presentation that seeks to give observers and participants a sense of stepping back in time. Although it does not necessarily seek to reenact a specific event in history, living history is similar to, and sometimes incorporates, [[historical reenactment]]. Living history is an educational medium used by [[living history museums]], [[historic site]]s, [[heritage interpretation|heritage interpreters]], schools and historical reenactment groups to educate the public or their own members in particular areas of history, such as clothing styles, pastimes and handicrafts, or to simply convey a sense of the everyday life of a certain period in history.

== Background ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0703-021, Schwerin, Indianistiktreffen.jpg|thumb|Eastern German Living history at an "Indianistikmeeting" 1982 in [[Schwerin]]]]
[[File:Guédelon - mai 2014 - 24.JPG|thumb|The [[Guédelon Castle]] in France is a castle currently built using only medieval construction techniques, tools, costumes and local materials.]]
Living history approach to gain [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] is less about replaying a certain event according to a planned script as in other reenactment fields. It is more about an immersion of players in a  certain [[era]], to catch, in the sense of [[Walter Benjamin]] the 'spiritual message expressed in every monument's and every site's own "trace" and "aura"', even in the [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|Age of Mechanical Reproduction]].&lt;ref name= MP&gt;Michael Petzet: "ln the full richness of their authenticity" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the spiritual and futuristic side of living history can be found in [[Guido von List]]'s book ''Der Wiederaufbau von Carnuntum'' (1900),&lt;ref Name="Ban"&gt;Karl Banghard: ''Unter dem Häkelkreuz. Germanische Living History und rechte Affekte: Ein historischer Überblick in drei Schlaglichtern.'' In: Hans-Peter Killguss: ''Die Erfindung der Deutschen. Rezeption der Varusschlacht und die Mystifizierung der Germanen.'' Verlag NS-Dokumentationszentrum, Köln 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-938636-12-1}}. (Mit Beiträgen von Professor Reinhard Wolters, Dr. Tilmann Bendikowski, Dirk Mellies, Michael Fehrenschild, Karl Banghard, Alexander Häusler, Jan Raabe, Dr. Michael Zelle)&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested rebuilding the Roman [[Carnuntum]] military camp in Vienna's neighborhood as a sort of [[amusement park]] (compare ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]''). List, himself a right wing neopagan, asked his staff of landlords, waiters and rangers to be dressed in historical gear. He also asked to have any visitors redressed in costumes and described rituals to signify "in-game" and "out-game" status to enhance the immersion experience. E.g. the role of the garment is of interest till today.&lt;ref Name="Ban" /&gt;

The term 'living history' describes the performance of bringing history to life for the general public in a rather freewheeling manner. The players are less confined in their actions, but often have to stay at a certain place or building. Historical presentation includes a continuum from well researched attempts to recreate a known historical event for educational purposes, through representations with theatrical elements, to competitive events for purposes of entertainment. The line between amateur and professional presentations at [[living history museum]]s can be blurred, same as the border to [[Live action role-playing game]]s.

While the pros latter routinely use museum professionals and trained interpreters to help convey the story of history to the public, some museums and historic sites employ living history groups with high standards of authenticity for the same role at special events. Such events do not necessarily include a mock battle but aim at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of people of the period. This often includes both military and civilian impressions. Occasionally, storytelling or acting sketches take place to involve or explain the everyday life or military activity to the viewing public. More common are craft and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. Combat training or duels can also be encountered even when larger combat demonstrations are not present.

In the United States, on the [[National Park Service]] land, NPS policy "does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wilson's Creek National Battlefield FAQ | date=23 April 2017| publisher=National Park Service | url=http://www.nps.gov/wicr/faqs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are exceptions i.e. Saylors Creek, Gettysburg.  These are highly controlled with exacting safety factors, as well as, exacting historical truths.

In [[Germany]] medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance faires and festivals, which are found in nearly each city. So e.g. the Peter and Paul festival in [[Bretten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landsknechte-bretten.de/galerie/der-tross-1-tag/ Der Tross 10. – 14. Juni 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Landshut Wedding]] or the [[Schloss Kaltenberg]] knights tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritterturnier.de/ Kaltenberg web entry]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated to some degree because of a strong focus on authenticity.

Events with the professional reenactment-group [[Ulfhednar]] lead to a controversy in German archaeology. The German Polish living history group was supported by large museums and scholars and, since 2000 has largely coined the image of early history in Germany and international. Among others, a paper with the programmatic title ''Under the crocheted Swastika, Germanic Living History and rightwing affects''&lt;ref Name="Ban" /&gt; started the dispute 2009. On the other hand, communist Eastern German had some problems with accepting "indianistic" living history reenactors, a widespread variety in Eastern Germany, which were closely monitored by the security forces.&lt;ref&gt;Borries/ Fischer: Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands, Frankfurt/ Main: 2008, S. 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich von Borries, Jens-Uwe Fischer: ''Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt/ Main 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
That sort of 'second hand' living history&lt;ref name=gf&gt;Volkskultur aus fremder Hand - Indianer- und Westernhobby in Deutschland zwischen Amerikanisierung, " Anti-Imperialismus" und popularisierter Ethnologie, doctorate Albert - Ludwigs - Universität zu Freiburg i. Br, Gabriele Wilczek 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is as well part of western Germany folklore and tries for a high level of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/zu-besuch-bei-deutschen-indianern/a-16716293 Zu Besuch bei deutschen "Indianern"] Deutsche Welle 07.05.2013, Ananda Grade&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Activities may be confined to wearing period dress and perhaps explaining relevant historical information, either in role (also called [[first-person interpretation]]) or  out of character (also called [[third-person interpretation]]).  While many museums allow their staff to move in and out of character to better answer visitor questions, some encourage their staff to stay in role at all times.

Living history portrayal often involves demonstrating everyday activities such as cooking, cleaning, medical care, or particular skills and [[handicrafts]]. Depending on the [[List of time periods#Historical periods|historical period]] portrayed, these might include [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[sewing]], [[loom]] [[weaving]], [[tablet weaving]], [[inkle weaving]] or [[tapestry]] weaving, [[cloth]] [[dyeing]], [[basket weaving]], [[rope]] making, [[Leather crafting|leather-working]], [[shoemaking]], [[metalworking]], [[glassblowing]], [[woodworking]] or other crafts. Considerable research is often applied to identifying authentic techniques and often recreating replica tools and equipment.

==Presentation==
[[File:Vikingtent.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A Viking encampment.]]

Historical reenactment groups often attempt to organize such displays in an [[Campsite|encampment]] or display area at an event, and have a separate area for [[combat reenactment]] activities. While some such exhibits may be conducted in character as a representation of typical everyday life, others are specifically organized to inform the public and so might include an emphasis on handicrafts or other day-to-day activities, which are convenient to stage and interesting to watch, and may be explained out of character. During the 1990s, reenactment groups, primarily [[American Civil War]] groups, began to show interest in this style of interpretation and began using it at their reenactments.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==In education==
[[File:Highlander-actor.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A reenactor from a living history group.]]
[[File:Lincoln living.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Abraham Lincoln in present time.]]
As David Thelen has written, many Americans use the past in their daily lives, while simultaneously viewing the place where they often encounter history – the school – with varying levels of distrust and disconnectedness.&lt;ref&gt;Thelen, David. "Learning from the Past: Individual Experience and Re-Enactment." Indiana Magazine of History, Jun 2003, Vol. 99 Issue 2, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  Living history can be a tool used to bridge the gap between school and daily life to educate people on historical topics. Living history is not solely an objective retelling of historical facts. Its importance lies more in presenting visitors with a sense of a way of life, than in recreating exact events, accurate in every detail.

Many factors contribute to creating a setting in which visitors to living history sites can become active participants in their historical education. Two of the most important are the material culture and the interpreters. Material culture both grounds the audience in the time and place being portrayed, and provides a jumping-off point for conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions''. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  “Interpreters” are the individuals who embody historical figures at living history sites. It is their responsibility to take the historical research that has been done on the sites and decide what meaning it has.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions.'' Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  These meanings are often a melding of fact and [[folklore]].

Folklore is an important aspect of living histories because it provides stories which visitors relate to. Whether it is an interpreter embodying a past individual’s personal story or discussing a superstition of the time, these accounts allow the audience to see these past figures not as names on a page, but as actual people. However, folklore is also more than stories. Objects, such as dolls or handmade clothing, among others, are considered “folk artifacts,” which are grouped under the heading of “material culture.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Folklore]], "Artifacts"&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals can participate in living histories as a type of [[experiential learning]] in which they make discoveries firsthand, rather than reading about the experience of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Experiential learning]], "About"&lt;/ref&gt;  Living history can also be used to supplement and extend formal education. Collaborations between professional historians who work at living history sites and teachers can lead to greater enthusiasm about studying history at all grade levels.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many living history sites profess a dedication to education within their mission statements. For instance, the motto of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], “That the Future May Learn from the Past,” proclaims the site’s commitment to public edification, as does the portion of the website created for the sole purpose of  aiding teachers in instruction on the village.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Williamsburg. "[http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm Our Mission.]" http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm. Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain educators, such as James Percoco in his Springfield, Virginia high school class, have chosen to integrate [[public history]] into their curricula.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1991, Percoco has led a class entitled “Applied History,” in which his students have contributed over 20,000 hours of service to various institutions of public history.&lt;ref&gt;James Percoco. "[http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm Biography.]" http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm. Retrieved 2010-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Formal education can help visitors interpret what they see at living history sites. By providing a structured way of looking at living histories, as well as questions to think about during visits, formal education can enrich the experience, just as living histories can enrich learning in the classroom.

Some museums such as [[Middelaldercentret]] in [[Denmark]] provides living history for school children as a part of their education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Born%20og%20skoler/skoletjenesten.html Skoletjenesten] (in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MPH Show''' was a supercar motor show later known as '''''Top Gear'' Live!'''.  It was held every year in both [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] and [[National Exhibition Centre|Birmingham NEC]]. The show took up either one or two halls at both venues, and there were usually two parts to it: the Exhibition and the Main Show. From 2011 the show was rebranded and relaunched as "''Top Gear'' Live", tying together its close links to the [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|''Top Gear'' television series]] and with a venue change to [[ExCeL London]]. ''Top Gear Live'' was later expanded, being used by [[BBC Worldwide]] as a brand of touring stadium show.

== Exhibition Section ==

Visitors arrive and have the opportunity to take a look at exhibitors' stands.  Many are there to advertise a product that they sell (for example there was a '[[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]' stand at MPH '06 advertising Shell V Power) There are also exhibition stands advertising car lease, whilst showing actual cars that can be leased at the stand.  These are the likes of the [[Enzo Ferrari (car)|Ferrari Enzo]], [[Lamborghini Murcielago LP640]], [[Ferrari F430]] or the [[Aston Martin DBS V12]].
[[Image:Mph 07 (Medium).JPG|left|thumb|250px|Two Spyker C8 Spyders at MPH 07]]
There are also a few car manufacturers exhibiting, although not to the scale of the 'Sunday Times Motor Show'.  At MPH '06, [[Land Rover]] turned half of the hall into a simulated off-road environment with ramps and severe slopes, in which people could drive on in the new Land Rover Discovery 3.

There are also VIP enclosures such as 'The Sunday Times' enclosure, or the 'Auto Express' enclosure in which people with VIP tickets can go and enjoy a glass of wine for example.  Overall, the exhibition side of the show is very trade based and does not include many car manufacturers.

== The Main Show ==
{{Advert|date=July 2016}}
The main reason many go to MPH show is to see the spectacular 90&amp;nbsp;minute show.  It takes up an entire hall and the audience sit in stadium like seating whilst watching the show. The show features stunt driving shows and a catwalk style presentation of new cars.  Also included in the show are the usual [[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]] antics.  At Mph '06 they placed James May in a shopping trolley and pushed him across the hall at 40&amp;nbsp;mph by a [[Ford Mustang]] into 10 huge ten pin bowling skittles.

There are also spectacular 3D presentations during the show. At Mph '05, a virtual and life-size 3D [[AH-64 Apache|Apache]] helicopter shot at a real [[Lotus Elise]] as it raced around the arena. Pyrotechnics added live explosions to the experience, simulating missile hits and Ricocheting gunfire, leaving audiences marveling in the high-octane and explosive thrill of it all. It was that successful, it made a return appearance in 2006. Also at MPH '06 a 3D [[Hummer]] was dropped out of an aircraft, shot down by a Tornado jet and landed in pieces the ocean! The 3D helicopter sequence and the 3D Hummer destruction sequence were both conceived and created by 3D director Julian Napier, [http://www.juliannapier.com] who was first to introduce a 3D element to the show and who also co-wrote and co-created the original ninety-minute show in 2005, alongside John Napier and Andy Wilman. In 2009 Julian wrote and directed the [[London Eye]] 4D Experience, which is the UK's first ever live-action 4D experience and is in permanent residence at The [[London Eye]]. At MPH '07 a 3D Gatso Camera/Dragon of the future (created by London-based 3D experts Inition [http://www.inition.co.uk] ) battles it out with the Stig.

The Mph '06, the show was presented by Jeremy Clarkson and [[James May]] (Top Gear Presenters) and [[Tiff Needell]] ([[Fifth Gear]] Presenter) who was drafted in to cover for [[Richard Hammond]] who could not make the show due to his crash.  At Mph '07 the presenters were Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond (the three Top Gear presenters).

Exhibited cars in the Mph '06 show included the [[Caparo T1]], [[Pagani Zonda F]], [[Jaguar XKR]], [[Lamborghini LP640]], [[Bentley GTC]], [[Koenigsegg CCX]], [[Spyker C8]], [[Spyker D8]], [[Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder]], [[Invicta (car)|Invicta]], and the [[Porsche Cayenne]] Magnum black gunsmoke.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was scheduled to be held in [[Myanmar]] (Burma) in May 2015.&lt;ref name=I&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/constitutional-amendments-election-shwe-mann.html No Constitutional Amendments Before Election: Shwe Mann] The Irrawaddy, 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfpress.com/2015/05/08/dyer-army-stifles-reform-in-burma Dyer: Army stifles reform in Burma] LF Press, 8 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; If approved, the proposed reforms would have come into effect after the [[Burmese general election, 2015|general elections]] in November.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dvb.no/news/no-constitutional-reform-before-2015-election-shwe-mann-burma-myanmar/45955 No constitutional reform before 2015 election: Shwe Mann] DVB, 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After most of the proposed amendments to the constitution were discarded, the referendum was postponed.

==Electoral system==
Proposed changes to the [[Constitution of Myanmar]] must be approved by at least 75% of both houses of the [[Assembly of the Union]] before going to a referendum. When the referendum is held, the changes must be approved by at least 50% of the registered voters, rather than 50% of those voting.&lt;ref name=I/&gt;

==Referendum bill==
The proposed constitutional amendment bill was discussed at the Assembly of the Union from 23 to 25 June 2015. Amendments were confined to four key clauses.  
*'''Article 436''' for ''amending the constitution'' be lowered from its current figure of more than 75 percent to at least 70 percent of votes, which would have ended the effective veto of the military
*'''Articles 59 and 60''' for ''presidency qualifications'' which bars opposition leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] from the presidency
*'''Article 418(b)''' for ''[[Tatmadaw|military]]’s role in the state of emergency'' is declared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/parliamentary-debate-begins-on-constitutional-reform-bill.html|title=Debate on Constitution Reform Bill Begins in Parliament|work=The Irrawaddy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assembly of the Union voted against most of the constitutional amendments on 25 June, ensuring that the military's veto power remained intact and that Aung San Suu Kyi could not become president in the 2015 general elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/06/25/myanmars-parliament-blocks-changes-to-constitution|title=Myanmar's parliament blocks changes to constitution - US News|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was no surprise given that 25% of the seats in the Assembly are, by law, held by the military. The proposal aimed to reduce the vote share needed to amend the constitution to 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/25/us-myanmar-politics-idUSKBN0P50Q820150625|title=Myanmar military retains veto after constitution change vote fails|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly of the Union approved only a minor change to article 59(d).&lt;ref name="rfa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/referendum-to-be-held-to-change-wording-of-requirement-for-top-political-officials-07012015164546.html|title=Referendum to Be Held to Change Wording of Requirement for Top Politicians in Myanmar|work=Radio Free Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
[[Union Election Commission]] requested to delay the referendum in July 2015 because it concerned only a minor change to article 59(d). On 22 July, the Assembly of the Union voted to postpone the referendum.&lt;ref name="PVP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/parliament-votes-to-postpone-planned-charter-referendum.html | title=Parliament Votes to Postpone Planned Charter Referendum | publisher=The Irrawaddy | date=22 July 2015 | accessdate=23 July 2015 | author=San Yamin Aung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9016">'''Narcissistic leadership''' is a [[leadership]] style in which the leader is only interested in him/herself. Their priority is themselves – at the expense of their people/group members. This leader exhibits the characteristics of a narcissist: arrogance, dominance and hostility. It is a sufficiently common leadership style that it has acquired its own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neider|first1=Linda L.|title=The Dark Side of Management|date=2010|publisher=Information Age Publishing|location=Charlotte, North Carolina|isbn=978-1607522645|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narcissism]] is most often described as unhealthy and destructive. It has been described as "driven by unyielding arrogance, self-absorption, and a personal [[egotistic]] need for [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Narcissistic supply|admiration]]".&lt;ref&gt;Linda L. Neider/Chester A. Schriesheim, ''The Dark Side of Management'' (2010) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissism and groups==
A study published in the journal ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'' suggests that when a group is without a leader, a narcissist is likely to take charge. Researchers have found that people who score high in narcissism tend to take control of leaderless groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/545089/ Narcissistic People Most Likely to Emerge as Leaders] Newswise, Retrieved on October 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freud]] considered "the ''narcissistic'' type... especially suited to act as a support for others, to take on the role of leaders and to... impress others as being 'personalities'.":&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) pp. 362–63&lt;/ref&gt; one reason may be that "another person's narcissism has a great attraction for those who have renounced part of their own... as if we envied them for maintaining a blissful state of mind—an unassailable libidinal position which we ourselves have since abandoned."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the book ''Narcissism: Behind the Mask'', there are four basic types of leader with narcissists most commonly in type 3 although they may be in type 1:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D Narcissism: Behind the Mask (2010) – Chapter 4 Leadership&lt;/ref&gt;
# authoritarian with task oriented decision making
# democratic with task oriented decision making
# authoritarian with emotional decision making
# democratic with emotional decision making

[[Michael Maccoby]] stated that "psychoanalysts don't usually get close enough to [narcissistic leaders], especially in the workplace, to write about them."&lt;ref&gt;Maccoby M Narcissistic leaders: The incredible pros, the inevitable cons. Harvard Business Review, (January–February), pp. 69–77, p. 75 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate narcissism==
According to Alan Downs, [[corporate narcissism]] occurs when a narcissist becomes the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) or other leadership roles within the [[senior management]] team and gathers an adequate mix of [[codependents]] around him (or her) to support the narcissistic behavior. Narcissists profess company [[loyalty]] but are only really committed to their own agendas, thus organizational decisions are founded on the narcissist's own interests rather than the interests of the organization as a whole, the various stakeholders, or the society in which the organization operates.&lt;ref name=downs&gt;Downs, Alan: Beyond The Looking Glass: Overcoming the Seductive Culture of Corporate Narcissism, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, "a certain kind of charismatic leader can run a financially successful company on thoroughly unhealthy principles for a time. But... the chickens always come home to roost".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1994) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neville Symington]] has suggested that "one of the ways of differentiating a good-enough organisation from one that is pathological is through its ability to exclude narcissistic characters from key posts."&lt;ref&gt;[[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2004) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of healthy v. destructive narcissistic managers==
Lubit compared healthily narcissistic managers versus destructively narcissistic managers for their long-term impact on [[organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;Lubit, R. (2002). The long-term organizational impact of destructively narcissistic managers. Academy of Management Executive, 16(1), 127–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New River''' ({{lang-es|Río Nuevo}}) flows north from near [[Cerro Prieto]], through the city of [[Mexicali]], [[Baja California]], Mexico, into the United States through the city of [[Calexico, California]], towards the [[Salton Sea]].  The river channel has existed since pre-historic times; however, the river as known today was formed from a [[levee]] failure that resulted in massive flooding that re-created the Salton Sea. Today, the river flow is not natural, mostly consisting of agricultural runoff, municipal discharge and industrial dumping. The river has been referred to as the most severely [[polluted]] river of its size within the United States.&lt;ref name=e1&gt;{{cite web|date=December 1, 1998 |url=http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb7/newriver/Historical/NewRiverHistory.pdf |title=New River Pollution in Mexico, A Historical Overview |format=PDF |publisher=Regional Water Quality Control Board |accessdate=February 16, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025163927/http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb7/newriver/Historical/NewRiverHistory.pdf |archivedate=October 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several projects have begun to reduce and mitigate the levels of pollution in the river, including upgrading [[sewage treatment]] infrastructure and enclosing the river channel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sdut-new-river-pollution-wetlands-mexicali-environment-2014apr23-story.html &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment]] has issued a safe eating [https://oehha.ca.gov/advisories/new-river advisory] for any fish caught in New River due to elevated levels of mercury, DDTs, PCBs, and selenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oehha.ca.gov/advisories/new-river|title=New River|last=Admin|first=OEHHA|date=2016-11-02|website=oehha.ca.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Flow==
The New River channel begins at a [[volcanic lake]], near [[Cerro Prieto]].&lt;ref name="laflin"/&gt; Today this lake feeds the [[Cerro Prieto Geothermal Power Station]]. The river flows north {{convert|15|mi}} through Baja California and another {{convert|66|mi}} through California into the Salton Sea, the largest lake in California. Flow at the border is approximately {{convert|200|ft3/s|m3/s|abbr=on|lk=on}}, and about three times this flow at the Salton Sea because of collected agricultural discharges.

The New River’s flow is composed of waste from agricultural and chemical runoff from the farm industry [[irrigation]] in the U.S. (18.4%) and Mexico (51.2%), [[sewage]] from [[Mexicali]] (29%), and manufacturing plants operating in Mexico (1.4%). By the time the New River crosses the Mexico–U.S. border near [[Calexico, California]], the channel contains a stew of about 100 [[contaminant]]s: [[volatile organic compounds]], [[heavy metals]] (including [[selenium]], [[uranium]], [[arsenic]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]), and [[pesticides]] (including [[DDT]]) and [[Polychlorinated biphenyls|PCBs]]. The waterway also holds the [[pathogen]]s that cause [[tuberculosis]], [[encephalitis]], [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], [[cholera]], [[hepatitis]] and [[typhoid]]; levels for many of these contaminants are in violation of [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and Cal/EPA standards by several hundredfold.&lt;ref name=e2&gt;{{cite web | date = February 28, 1996 | url = http://www.calexiconewriver.com/ed_pdf/usdhhsnewriverpetitionedstudy1996.pdf | title = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Division of Health Assessment and Consultation, Atlanta, Georgia | format = PDF | publisher = [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] | accessdate = February 16, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928193908/http://www.calexiconewriver.com/ed_pdf/usdhhsnewriverpetitionedstudy1996.pdf | archivedate = September 28, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fecal [[coliform bacteria]] are at levels of 100,000 to 16 million [[Colony-forming unit|colonies per milliliter]] at the border checkpoint (possibly more, as this is the measuring capacity threshold), far above the [[IBWC|U.S.–Mexico treaty]] limit of 240 colonies.&lt;ref name=e3&gt;{{cite web | date = March 6, 2006 | url = http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb7/newriver/nr-intro.html | title = Introduction to the New River/Mexicali Sanitation Program | publisher = State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) | accessdate = February 16, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060930122802/http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb7/newriver/nr-intro.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e4&gt;{{cite web |date=June 2005 | url = http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb7/newriver/dataindex.html | title = New River Water Quality Data | publisher = Colorado River Basin Regional Water Quality Control Board | accessdate = February 16, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060930122821/http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb7/newriver/dataindex.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined effects of increasing, highly polluted inflow from the New River and agricultural runoff have resulted in elevated bacterial levels and large algal blooms in the Salton Sea.  With the lack of an outlet, salinity has increased by approximately 1% per year. Due to high selenium levels, the public was strictly advised to limit fish consumption from the Salton Sea in 1986, after which any amount was likely a health risk.  Increasing water temperature, salinity and bacterial levels led to massive [[fish die-off]]s (1992, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2006, 2008), and created the ideal breeding grounds for [[Botulism|avian botulism]], [[cholera]] and [[Newcastle disease]], which also led to massive avian [[epizootic]]s from 1992–2008. Currently, the Salton Sea has a salinity of 4.4% (4.4 parts per 100), making it saltier than ocean water (3.5% for Pacific), and many species of fish are no longer able to reproduce or survive in the Salton Sea. It is now believed the [[tilapia]] may be the only fish species able to persist there for a limited time. Without restoration actions, the sea will likely increase in toxicity, and remain an [[ecological trap]] for avian species.

==History==
The creation of the modern courses of the New River and the [[Alamo River]], and the creation of the [[Salton Sea]], started in the autumn of 1904 when heavy rainfall and [[snowmelt]] caused the [[Colorado River]] to swell, overrunning a set of headgates for the [[Alamo Canal]].&lt;ref name="laflin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Laflin|first=Pat|title=The Salton Sea California's overlooked treasure|pages=21–26|url=http://www.saltonsea.ca.gov/ltnav/library_content/Hydrology/cal_orverlooked_treasure_lafin.pdf|publisher=Coachella Valley Historical Society|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting flood poured down the canal and breached an [[Imperial Valley]] dyke. The sudden influx of water and the lack of drainage from the basin resulted in the formation of the Salton Sea; the rivers had re-created a great inland sea in the [[Salton Sink]], an area which had frequently been inundated before.  Nearly two years passed before workers could control the Colorado River’s flow and stop the flooding, but the river was effectively dammed in the early part of 1907 and returned to its normal course.&lt;ref name="laflin"/&gt; The flood significantly enlarged the channels of the New and Alamo Rivers. Some water continued to flow, even after the dyke was repaired, as the larger channels collected and carried agricultural runoff to the Salton Sea.&lt;ref name="laflin"/&gt;

[[Image:Nrborderborderentrythreecolorsmay05-1-.JPG|thumb|right|The New River at the [[Mexico-United States border|US-Mexico border]], carrying foam and mixing with wastewater from the International Drain]]
Although thorough documentation of the pollution prior to 1960 is not available, records show the New River identified as a significant [[water pollution]] problem since the late 1940s.  It had such extremely high concentrations of [[fecal]] [[coliform bacteria]] that it had a stench at its entry to the U.S.  Under provisions of the 1944 Water Treaty with Mexico, the governments of the United States and Mexico agreed to give preferential attention to the solution of all border sanitation problems.  The [[International Boundary and Water Commission]] (IBWC) was first authorized by the two governments to study pollution of the New River from Mexico.

Studies in 1947 and 1948 to correct the New River problem resulted in the recommendation by IBWC that a joint plant be constructed in the United States to treat the sewage of the cities of Calexico and Mexicali.&lt;ref name=e1/&gt;

As Mexicali had a population explosion in the 1970s, and increased pollution levels because of an inadequate [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] infrastructure, the nations made various attempts in the 1980s and 1990s to address pollution of this river, as documented by the International Boundary and Water Commission of the [[U.S. Department of State]].&lt;ref name=e5&gt;{{cite web | date = August 26, 1980 | url = http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min264.pdf | title = Minute 264: Recommendations for solution of the New River border sanitation problem | format = PDF | publisher = International Boundary and Water Commission | accessdate = February 16, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070216195755/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min264.pdf | archivedate = February 16, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e6&gt;{{cite web | date = April 15, 1987 | url = http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min274.pdf | title = Minute 274: Joint Project for Improvement of the Quality of the Waters of the New River | format = PDF | publisher = International Boundary and Water Commission | accessdate = February 16, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070216200311/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min274.pdf | archivedate = February 16, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e7&gt;{{cite web | date = October 30, 1992 | url = http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min288.pdf | title = Minute 288: Conceptual Plan for the Long Term Solution to the Border Sanitation Problem of the New River | format = PDF | publisher = International Boundary and Water Commission | accessdate = February 16, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070216195445/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Minutes/Min288.pdf | archivedate = February 16, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBWC was established in 1889 to maintain the border, allocate river waters between the two nations, and provide for flood control and water sanitation.  Once viewed as a model of international cooperation, in recent decades the IBWC has been heavily criticized as an institutional anachronism, by-passed by modern social, environmental and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, Executive Authority, Adaptive Treaty Interpretation, and the International Boundary and Water Commission, U.S.-Mexico, 14–2 U. Denv. Water L. Rev. 197(Spring 2011) (also available for free download at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1839903).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the passing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in the 1990s, industrial manufacturing also became an increasingly significant contributor to pollution. Mexico's relatively lax [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]] on manufacturing plants or ''[[maquiladora]]s'', has allowed the plants to use the New River as an [[industrial waste]] [[drainage]] system over the years. [[Mexicali]] has become a bustling [[United States–Mexico border|border city]] with over one hundred ''maquiladoras''.

In the 1990s, a joint project was implemented to improve Mexicali's [[Water industry|wastewater infrastructure]], but although the EPA paid for 55 percent of a $50 million addition to Mexicali's sewage treatment facilities and refurbishing of equipment, the improvements would not treat all the waste discharges to the river.  The nations have yet to tackle the residual pollution affecting Mexico, and which has also been carried across the border through the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]] and deposited in the [[Salton Sea]].&lt;ref name=e3/&gt; In 2018, a [[bollard]] portion of the [[Mexico–United States barrier]] began to be built through the river.&lt;ref name=May2018LAT&gt;{{cite news |last=Mejia |first=Brittny |date=2 May 2018 |title=Three-eyed fish and two-headed turtles?

==Environmental justice==
The stench of the New River near the boundary is often overpowering, particularly at night and during the summer when temperatures can reach {{convert|120|°F}}. The New River is so heavily polluted that technicians usually wear two sets of gloves, aprons and other protective clothing when testing the water. Discarded tires, trash, dead animals and other wastes line the channel, foam blows into the streets of one of Calexico’s residential areas and toward its downtown area, [[mosquitoes]] and other [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s thrive during the summer season; all of these factors only serve to elevate the contagion risk.

In 2006, through another binational project, Mexicali finished building a second wastewater treatment facility to treat the {{convert|10|to|20|e6USgal|m3}} per day of raw and partially treated sewage that was being discharged into the river.  In May 2005, the New River was designated as one of two environmental justice water quality pilot projects for the State of [[California Environmental Protection Agency]] (CalEPA) to try to address the various pollution sources collaboratively between the various stakeholders.&lt;ref name=e8&gt;{{cite web | date = May 18, 2005 | url = http://www.calepa.ca.gov/EnvJustice/ActionPlan/PhaseI/June2005/NewRiver051805.pdf | title = CalEPA Environmental Justice Action Plan, Pilot Project Summary on Water New River (Calexico)| format = PDF | publisher = State Water Resources Control Board SWRCB | accessdate = February 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative Changes: SB 387===
On July 25, 2005, [[Governor of California]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed [[California State Legislature|Senate Bill]] 387, introduced by [[California State Senate|Senator]] [[Denise Moreno Ducheny]] (D-San Diego), which provided funding for the New River Improvement Project. It involves four main components:
# A trash screen;
# Construction of an enclosed box culvert alongside the current river channel through the developed areas of Calexico so that normal flow can be re-routed into the culvert, thereby eliminating resident exposure and allowing for treatment of contaminated flows;
# Construction of wetlands to address overall pollution, including pollution from sources in the United States; and
# Construction of green belts and recreational facilities in a restored New River floodplain.&lt;ref name=e9&gt;{{cite web | date = July 27, 2005 | url = http://www.calexiconewriver.com/index.php?build=view&amp;idr=80&amp;page=7&amp;pid=11 | title = CNRC Press Release – Governor Schwarzenegger Signs SB 387 | publisher = Calexico New River Committee | accessdate = August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=e10&gt;{{cite web | date = November 18, 2005 | url = http://info.sen.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=sb_387&amp;sess=PREV&amp;house=B&amp;site=sen | title = Senate Bill 387 Senator Denise Moreno Ducheny | publisher = California State Senate | accessdate = February 16, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090626133403/http://info.sen.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=sb_387&amp;sess=PREV&amp;house=B&amp;site=sen | archivedate = June 26, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlook===
According to the Colorado River Regional Water Quality Control Board, once the new wastewater treatment facility is fully operational, it will be handling the {{convert|10|to|20|e6USgal|m3}} per day of raw sewage currently being discharged into the New River. While this should result in measurable improved water quality of the New River at the border, particularly as it relates to [[pathogen]]s and [[nutrient]]s, the binational projects fail to address other problems that have significant adverse impacts on New River water quality at the border. More specifically, the projects do not address the indiscriminate dumping of trash into the New River and its [[tributaries]], the nutrients and pathogens from Mexicali's Zaragoza [[List of waste water treatment technologies|wastewater treatment lagoons]], the untreated and partially treated discharges of industrial wastes, agricultural runoff from the Mexicali Valley, and urban and storm runoff from the municipality.

Moreover, Mexico intends to reclaim the effluent from the treatment plant for onsite [[green belt]]s. This will result in a {{convert|20|e6USgal|m3}} per day decrease in flow of the New River at the border. This loss of flow, coupled with the projected {{convert|10|e6USgal|m3}} per day decrease in flow in the river at the border when the [http://www.intergen.com/ InterGen] and [[Sempra Energy]] power plants reach capacity in Mexicali, the estimated decrease in flow due to projects pursuant to the terms of the [http://www.crss.water.ca.gov/crqsa/index.cfm Quantification Settlement Agreement], and the water transfer between the [[Imperial Irrigation District]] and the [http://www.sdcwa.org San Diego County Water Authority] will have devastating water quality impacts on the [[Salton Sea]].&lt;ref name=e3/&gt;

According to the [[Imperial Irrigation District]], although water pollution is a severe problem at the border, by the time the river enters the Salton Sea, the issue is "not significant"; water quality improves as the water makes its way north due to the addition of agricultural drain water and through natural cleansing occurring in the intervening {{convert|60|mi}}.

'''''Orlando: A Biography''''' is a novel by [[Virginia Woolf]], first published on 11 October 1928. A high-spirited romp inspired by the tumultuous family history of Woolf's lover and close friend the aristocratic poet and novelist [[Vita Sackville-West]], it is arguably one of Woolf's most popular novels: a history of English literature in [[Satire|satiric]] form. The book describes the adventures of a poet who changes sex from man to woman and lives for centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history. Considered a feminist classic, the book has been written about extensively by scholars of [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]] and [[gender studies|gender]] and [[transgender studies]].

The novel has been adapted a number of times. In 1989, director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] and writer [[Darryl Pinckney]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitedagents.co.uk/darryl-pinckney|title=Darryl Pinckney {{!}} United Agents|website=www.unitedagents.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborated on a single-actor theatrical production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artforum.com/print/199002/robert-wilson-s-orlando-34227|title=Maria Nadotti on Robert Wilson's Orlando|magazine=[[Artforum]]|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had its British premiere at the [[Edinburgh International Festival|Edinburgh Festival]] in 1996;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4703376/Hes-not-afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf.html|title=He's not afraid of Virginia Woolf|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=1996-08-16|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/19/theater/theater-seizes-days-or-nights-at-edinburgh.html|title=Theater Seizes Days or Nights At Edinburgh|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=1996-08-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isabelle Huppert]] performed in the French version, which opened at the Lusanne in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=mwDMZbsEosMC&amp;pg=PA79|title=The Margins of the Text|page=79|last=Greetham|first=David C.|date=1997|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472106678|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film adaptation by [[Sally Potter]], simply titled ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]'', was released in 1992, starring [[Tilda Swinton]] in the title role.

== Plot ==
The eponymous hero is born as a male nobleman in England during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. He undergoes a mysterious change of sex at the age of about 30 and lives on for more than 300 years into modern times without ageing perceptibly.

As a teenage boy, the handsome Orlando serves as a page at the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan court]] and becomes "favorite" of the elderly queen. After her death he falls deeply in love with Sasha, an elusive and somewhat feral princess in the entourage of the Russian embassy. This episode, of love and ice skating against the background of the celebrated [[River Thames frost fairs|Frost Fair]] held on the frozen [[River Thames|Thames River]] during the Great Frost of 1608, when "birds froze in mid air and fell like stones to the ground", inspired some of Virginia Woolf's most bravura writing:&lt;blockquote&gt;Great statesmen, in their beards and ruffs, despatched affairs of state under the crimson awning of the Royal Pagoda ... Frozen roses fell in showers when the Queen and her ladies walked abroad ... Near London Bridge, where the river had frozen to a depth of some twenty fathoms, a wrecked wherry boat was plainly visible, lying on the bed of the river where it had sunk last autumn, overladen with apples. The old bumboat woman, who was carrying her fruit to market on the Surrey side, sat there in her plaids and farthingales with her lap full of apples, for all the world as if she were about to serve a customer, though a certain blueness about the lips hinted the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/05/winter-reads-orlando-virginia-woolf|title=Winter reads: Orlando by Virginia Woolf|last=Jordison|first=Sam Jordison|date=2011-12-05|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The melting of the ice coincides with Sasha's unfaithfulness and sudden departure for Russia. The desolate Orlando returns to writing ''The Oak Tree,'' a long poem started and abandoned in his youth. He meets and hospitably entertains an invidious [[poetaster]], Nicholas Greene, who proceeds to find fault with Orlando's writing. Later Orlando feels betrayed on learning that he has been lampooned in one of Greene's subsequent works. A period of contemplating love and life leads Orlando to appreciate the value of his ancestral stately home, which he proceeds to furnish lavishly. There he plays host to the populace.

Ennui sets in and the harassment of a persistent suitor, the tall and somewhat androgynous Archduchess Harriet, leads Orlando to look for a way to flee the country. He is appointed by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] as ambassador to [[Constantinople]]. Orlando performs his duties well, until a night of civil unrest and murderous riots. He falls asleep for a period of days, resistant to all efforts to rouse him. Upon awakening he finds that he has metamorphosed into a woman – the same person, with the same personality and intellect, but in a woman's body. Although the narrator of the novel professes to be disturbed and befuddled by Orlando's change, the fictional Orlando complacently accepts the change. From here on, Orlando's amorous inclinations change frequently although she stays biologically female.

The now ''Lady'' Orlando covertly escapes Constantinople in the company of a [[Romani people|Gypsy]] clan. She adopts their way of life until its essential conflict with her upbringing leads her to head home. Only on the ship back to England, with her constraining female clothes and an incident in which a flash of her ankle nearly results in a sailor's falling to his death, does she realise the magnitude of becoming a woman. She concludes it has an overall advantage, declaring "Praise God I'm a woman!" Back in England, Orlando is hounded again by the archduchess, who now reveals herself to be a man, the Archduke Harry. Orlando evades his marriage proposals. She goes on to live switching between gender roles, dressing alternately as both man and woman.

Orlando soon becomes caught up in the life of the 18th and 19th centuries, holding court with the great poets (notably [[Alexander Pope]]). Critic Nick Greene, apparently also timeless, reappears and promotes Orlando's writing, promising to help her publish ''The Oak Tree''.

Orlando wins a lawsuit over her property and marries a sea captain, Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine. Like Orlando, he is gender non-conforming, and Orlando attributes the success of their marriage to this similarity. In 1928, she publishes ''The Oak Tree,'' centuries after starting it, and wins a prize. The novel ends as Orlando's husband's ship returns and, in the aftermath of her success, she rushes to greet him.

== Inspiration ==
Woolf and Vita Sackville-West were both members of the [[Bloomsbury Group]], which was known for its liberal views on sexuality. The two began a sexual and romantic relationship that lasted for a decade, and continued as a friendship long after that. Notably, this inspiration is confirmed by Woolf herself, who noted in her diary the idea of ''Orlando'' on 5 October 1927: "And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1026408838|title=In Praise of Difficult Women: Life Lessons From 29 Heroines Who Dared to Break the Rules|last=Karbo|first=Karen|authorlink=Karen Karbo|isbn=9781426217951|location=Washington, D.C.|date=2018-02-27|oclc=1026408838|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Nicolson]], Sackville-West's son, wrote, "The effect of Vita on Virginia is all contained in ''Orlando'', the longest and most charming love letter in literature, in which she explores Vita, weaves her in and out of the centuries, tosses her from one sex to the other, plays with her, dresses her in furs, lace and emeralds, teases her, flirts with her, drops a veil of mist around her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9731959|title=A Guide to twentieth century literature in English|date=1983|publisher=Methuen|last=Blamires|first=Harry|authorlink=Harry Blamires|isbn=9780416364507|location=London|oclc=9731959}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|307}}

== Analysis ==
In the novel, Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people as it is the Romany caravan in the Balkans that first accepts Orlando as a woman, and it is hinted that it was a spell cast by the Romany witch that Orlando married that caused Orlando's transformation into a woman.&lt;ref name="Blair2004"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blair|first=Kirstie|date=2004|title=Gypsies and Lesbian Desire: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf|jstor=4149276|journal=Twentieth Century Literature|volume=50|issue=2|pages=141–166|doi=10.2307/4149276}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romany witch is named Rosita Pepita, which was also the name of Sackville-West's grandmother, a Spanish dancer.&lt;ref name="Daileander2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daileader|first=Celia R.

Fame? Love? Death? Marriage?".&lt;ref name="Smith2006" /&gt;{{rp|66}} For Woolf herself, the book was compensation for a sense of loss.&lt;ref name="Smith2006" /&gt;{{rp|67}} Woolf was often hurt by Sackville-West's promiscuity and unfaithfulness, and ''Orlando'' allowed her to have a more idealised version of Sackville-West that would belong to her forever.&lt;ref name="Smith2006" /&gt;{{rp|67}}

The American scholar Victoria Smith argued the book is about the impossibility of representing the female experience in its entirety  as a recurring theme of the book is Orlando's inability to properly describe emotions, people and even such banal occurrences as a sunset.&lt;ref name="Smith2006" /&gt;{{rp|59–60; 67–69}} Throughout the book, Orlando cannot describe Sasha or nature, the biographer cannot properly write up a description of Orlando, and the love which Orlando feels for Shelmerdine is referred to as undefinable.&lt;ref name="Smith2006" /&gt;{{rp|68}} When Orlando attempts to define love, he says to himself: "Every single thing, once he tried to dislodge it from his place in his mind, he thus cumbered with other matter like a lump of grass, which after a year at the bottom of the sea, is grown about with bones and dragon-flies, and the tresses of women's hair".&lt;ref name="Smith2006" /&gt;{{rp|69}} Likewise, when Orlando attempts to simply say the grass is green and the sky is blue, he instead finds himself thinking "...the sky is like the veils over which a thousand Madonnas have their hair fall; and the grass fleets and darkens like a flight of girls fleeing hairy satyrs for the woods".&lt;ref name="Smith2006" /&gt;{{rp|69}} Smith maintained whenever Orlando's attempt to say that the sky is blue and the grass is green, instead brings images of women, nature, classical mythology and religion into his mind, thus highlighting Woolf's viewpoint "...that the "natural"-the grass, the sky-already are encumbered with myths of and representations of women and their sexuality. Finally, the passage ends with precisely the conundrum of language that Woolf highlights: that even through the images used to convey the objects are "false", the object are nonetheless conveyed."&lt;ref name="Smith2006" /&gt;{{rp|69}} Smith argued that this rhetorical ambiguity that Woolf used was a commentary on "the love that dared not speak its name" as the book was meant to celebrate her love for Sackville-West while at the same time disguising it even though the two women were immune from being prosecuted by the authorities (homosexuality, but not lesbianism, was illegal in Britain until 1967).&lt;ref name="Smith2006" /&gt;{{rp|69}} Woolf intended the book to be therapeutic, to address the sense of loss felt by Sackville-West as well as herself, to provide a "spark" of hope to keep herself from drowning in she called in her diary "a great sea of melancholy".&lt;ref name="Smith2006" /&gt;{{rp|70}}

Woolf was often critical of British historiography, which at the time was largely concerned with political-military history, which she accused of neglecting the lives of women, which with the exceptions of leaders like Elizabeth I, Anne, and Victoria, were almost totally ignored.&lt;ref name="deGay2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Gay|first=Jane|authorlink=Jane de Gay|date=2007-03-01|title=Virginia Woolf's Feminist Historiography in ''Orlando''|url=http://berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/critical-survey/19/1/cs190107.xml|journal=Critical Survey|language=en-US|volume=19|issue=1|doi=10.3167/cs.2007.190107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62–63}} The novel takes place over several ages of British history, namely the Renaissance, the Restoration, the Enlightenment, the Romantic, the Victorian and the present, and Woolf uses the various ages to mock theories of history.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|63}} Orlando's biographer says that her style of poetry become less florid as the 17th century went on, which he suggests was because the streets were cleaner and the dishes less showy.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|63}} Woolf's father, the historian Sir Leslie Stephen, whom she both loved and hated at the same time, had proposed in his book ''English Literature and Society in the Eighteen Century'', a theory that what writers choose to write about reflects contemporary tastes, a "return to nature" as "literature must be produced by the class which embodies the really vital and powerful currents of thought which molds society".&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|63–64}} That Orlando's biographer believes that it was changes in British cuisine and the condition of the countryside that had changed Orlando's style of writing is a ''reductio ad absurdum'' of Stephen's theories.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|64}} Stephen identified various writers, all of them men, as the "key" figures of an age, whereas his daughter wanted historians to pay attention to women writers that they usually ignored, and the unflattering picture of Pope that Woolf presents is a caricature of her father's theories (Stephen had identified Pope as the "key" writer of early Georgian England).&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|64}} Likewise, when Orlando was a man, he had no hesitations about showing off his manuscript for ''The Oak Tree'', but as a woman, she constantly hides it when visitors come, as [[Jane Austen]] was alleged to do with the manuscripts for her books, which was Woolf's way of satirizing the different behavior expected of male and female writers.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|64}} Stephen believed that great writers must work in "the spirit of the age", which led him in his book ''Hours in the Library'' to praise Sir [[Walter Scott]] as representing the "spirit" of the Romantic age while [[Charlotte Brontë]] was dismissed as a writer because she was out of touch with the "spirit" of the Victorian age.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|65}} Woolf satirizes her father's theories as in during the Victorian Age that Orlando marries, changes drastically the quality of her writings, and the very idea of being pregnant makes her ashamed, which so sharply differs from the way that the character had been portrayed before as to imply these changes in her personality are forced as she struggles to conform to the "spirit" of the Victorian era.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|65}}

At the same time, Woolf, though she was critical of many aspects of British life, felt a deep sense of affinity in her country, where the past seemed to live on in so many ways.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|70}} Woolf was inspired to write ''Orlando'' when Sackville-West took her to Knole, to show her the place where she had grown up, that had belonged to the Sackville family for centuries, and as Sackville-West bitterly noted she would have inherited if only she had been born male.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|70}} During the course of their visit, a farmer came in with a wagon full of wood to be chopped up to heat Knole, which Sackville-West said had been done for hundreds of years, which gave Woolf the idea of the English past was not dead, but still alive, a theme that is expressed in ''Orlando'' by the ageless, timeless nature of the eponymous character.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|70}} That the 19th century begins with a heavy thunderstorm, and throughout the scenes set in the Victorian age it always seems to be raining, reflected Woolf's view of the Victorian era has a dark one in British history, as it was only with the Edwardian era that sunshine returns to ''Orlando''.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|65–66}} As part of her attack on Victorian values, Woolf satirized the theories of the influential critic [[John Ruskin]] who saw the Renaissance as a period of moral and cultural decline, which he called a "frost".&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|67}} On the contrary, Woolf depicted the parts of the book set in the Elizabethan-Jacobean era as one of rebirth and vitality, of a time when "the moon and stars blazed with the hard fixity of diamonds".&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|67}} It during this period that Orlando first falls in love with the Russian princess Sasha, which leads to "the ice turned to wine in his veins, he heard the water flowing and the birds singing".&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|68}} As an criticism of Ruskin, it was during the Great Frost of 1608 that Orlando first discovers his sexuality with Sasha, turning Ruskin's frost metaphor for the Renaissance on its head.&lt;ref name="deGay2007" /&gt;{{rp|67}}

That it was Constantinople that Orlando become a woman reflects the city's status in the 17th century as a melting pot of cultures with a mixed population of Turks, Greeks, Armenians, Sephardic Jews, Circassians, Sudanese, and other peoples from all over the Ottoman Empire, in short a place with no fixed identity that existed half in Europe and half in Asia, making the city the perfect backdrop for Orlando's transformation.&lt;ref name="Seshagiri2010"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/320799040|title=Race and the Modernist Imagination|last=Seshagiri|first=Urmila|date=2010|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=9780801448218|location=Ithaca, New York|oclc=320799040}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|180}} Furthermore, Constantinople had been founded by the Greeks as Byzantium in 7th century BC; had become the capital of the Roman empire in 324 AD when the Emperor Constantine the Great renamed the city after himself; for centuries had been seen as a bastion of Christianity against Islam; was taken by the Ottomans in a siege in 1453, becoming the capital of the world's most powerful Muslim empire; and was renamed Istanbul in 1924, making the city itself into a metaphor for shifting identities, whatever they be national, cultural, religious, gender, ethnic or sexual.&lt;ref name="Seshagiri2010" /&gt;{{rp|180}} In the 17th century, Constantinople was Europe's largest city as well as one of the most wealthiest. The American scholar Urmila Seshagiri wrote that the "fixed British hegemonies" of the early chapters set in London and in the English countryside seem "fragile" when Orlando is confronted with the vast, teeming, wealthy city of Constantinople with its multi-ethnic, multi-religious population that appears as a far more powerful and greater city than London, which was Woolf's way of undermining the assumption widely held in 1928 Britain that the British empire was the world's greatest empire.&lt;ref name="Seshagiri2010" /&gt;{{rp|180}} Sackville-West had lived in Constantinople in 1912-14 when Nicolson had been the Third Secretary at the British embassy and loved that city, which she viewed as a beautiful city full of diverse cultures and peoples. That Orlando's transformation occurs during the course of anti-Christian riots by the Muslim population of Constantinople is Woolf's attack on British imperialism.&lt;ref name="Daileander2013" /&gt;{{rp|64}} By the second half of the 17th century, the Ottoman Empire was in decline while the British empire was on the ascent, which is the precise time that Orlando changes sex.&lt;ref name="Daileander2013" /&gt;{{rp|64}} Woolf believed that the "[[Eastern Question]]" as imperial rivalry for control of Constantinople, "the city of all the world's desire" as it sits at a strategic location where Europe and Asia meet to have been one of the main causes of the First World War, and by dating Orlando's transformation at the moment that the Ottoman Empire began to decline was a political point.&lt;ref name="Daileander2013" /&gt;{{rp|64}} One of the main justifications for the British empire was the alleged need to protect white women from being raped by non-white men, and by having Lady Orlando escape from Constantinople without a man to protect her was an attack upon this theory.&lt;ref name="Daileander2013" /&gt;{{rp|64–65}}

Seshagiri accused Woolf of engaging in "[[Orientalism]]" by having Orlando become a woman in Constantinople, arguing that Orlando's transformation is made dependent upon "the dual Otherness of race and place", portraying the Ottomans as a strange, exotic people that makes such a strange transformation possible.&lt;ref name="Seshagiri2010" /&gt;{{rp|182}} As part of her accusation of racism against Woolf, Seshagiri argued though Orlando finds acceptance and equality with the Romany caravan, she nonetheless has a vision of the English countryside of "a great park-like space" in all four seasons of the year while staring at the barren hills of Anatolia and immediately realizes she belongs in England, not in this "savage land".&lt;ref name="Seshagiri2010" /&gt;{{rp|184}} Seshagiri argues that because when Orlando arrives in London on a ship, she sees and marvels at all of the architecture built after the Great Fire of 1666 such as St. Paul's, Greenwich Hospital, Westminster Abbey, the Royal Pavilion, and the Houses of Parliament this is meant to show that the British empire is growing in strength and London is in a sense the center of the world, especially when contrasted with the "savage land" of Anatolia that is barren and devoid of beautiful architecture of London that Orlando has just left.&lt;ref name="Seshagiri2010" /&gt;{{rp|184}} The American Celia Caputi Daileander likewise accused Woolf of racism, noting the novel begins with Orlando beheading a "Moor" (a term in Elizabethan England that described both Muslims and/or blacks) and causally kicking his head about.&lt;ref name="Daileander2013" /&gt;{{rp|56}} Daileander observed that the "Moor" that Orlando kills is considered so unimportant that Woolf does not even bother to give him a name, though Orlando twice refers to the Moor he beheaded as a nigger later on in the book.&lt;ref name="Daileander2013" /&gt;{{rp|56; 62}} At the novel's climax in 1928, when Shelmerdine is flying a plane above the English Channel, Orlando bares her gleaming white breasts, which shine with such brightness in the moonlight as to guide him back to England.&lt;ref name="Daileander2013" /&gt;{{rp|70}} The scholar Kathy Philips accused Woolf of racism, arguing that Orlando's white breasts, which shine so brightly, are symbol for the theory that to be white is be beautiful.&lt;ref name="Daileander2013" /&gt;{{rp|70}} Dailender disagreed with this interpretation, stating Orlando's skin is more dark than white; argued that it was her pearls, not her breasts were really shining; and noted that there was siren-like the way that Orlando guides Shelmerdine back to England, which was not at all like the "angel-in-the-house" language associated to glorify femininity and the British Empire.&lt;ref name="Daileander2013" /&gt;{{rp|70}}

== Influence and recognition ==
''Orlando'' was a contemporary success, both critically and financially, and guaranteed the Woolfs' financial stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tetterton.net/orlando/orlando95_talk.html|title=Virginia Woolf's Orlando: The Book as Critic|website=www.tetterton.net|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was generally viewed not just as high literature, but as a gossipy novel about Sackville-West. However, the ''New York Times'' review of the book acknowledged the importance of the work as an experiment into new forms of literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/08/reviews/woolf-orlando.html|title=Mrs. Woolf Explores the "Time" Element in Human Relationships|last=Chase|first=Cleveland B.&lt;!-- do not wl to H.

The work has been the subject of numerous scholarly writings, including detailed treatment in multiple works on Virginia Woolf.{{efn|group=notes|name=vanBuren|See for example, {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794933|title=The Novels of Virginia Woolf: Fact and Vision|last=Kelley|first=Alice van Buren|date=1973|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226429854|location=Chicago|oclc=794933}}}} An "annotated" edition has been published to facilitate critical reading of the text.

The novel's title has also come to stand in some senses for women's writing generally, as one of the most famous works by a woman author that directly treats the subject of gender.{{efn|group=notes|name=Hapman|For example: {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36241484|title=Orlanda: roman|last=Harpman|first=Jacqueline|authorlink=Jacqueline Harpman|date=1996|publisher=[[Éditions Grasset]]|isbn=9782246532118|location=Paris|oclc=36241484}} (published in English in 1999, {{ISBN|9781583220115}}.)}} For example, a project at the [[University of Cambridge]] on the history of women's writing in the [[British Isles]] was named after the book.{{efn|group=notes|name=CambIsles|[http://orlando.cambridge.org Orlando: Women's Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present].}}

The skating party on the Thames was featured in ''Simple Gifts'', a Christmas collection of six animated shorts shown on [[PBS]] in 1977.

The novel has been adapted for theatre and film. In 1989 the American director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]], and writer [[Darryl Pinckney]] collaborated on a theatrical production. A British [[Orlando (film)|film adaptation]] was released in 1992, starring [[Tilda Swinton]] as Orlando and [[Quentin Crisp]] as [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

A second theatre adaptation of ''Orlando'', by [[Sarah Ruhl]], premiered in New York 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/theater/reviews/24orlando.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "Orlando"]. ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently premiered for the Sydney Theatre Company in Australia at the [[Sydney Opera House]] starring [[Jacqueline McKenzie]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/whats-on/productions/2015/orlando|title=Orlando|website=Sydney Theatre Company|language=en|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Pavilion Theatre''' at 191–193 [[Whitechapel Road]], London, was the first major theatre to open in London's [[East End]]. It was destroyed by fire in 1856 and rebuilt as the '''New Royal Pavilion Theatre'''.

==History==
The theatre was opened in 1828 on the site of a former factory, and was the first major theatre to open in London's East End.&lt;ref name="DavisEmeljanow2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim Davis|author2=Victor Emeljanow|title=Reflecting the Audience: London Theatregoing, 1840-1880|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_LKMEgAARgC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=25 November 2016|date=1 April 2005|publisher=University of Iowa Press|isbn=978-1-58729-402-0|pages=55–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first managers were William Wyatt and John Farrell.&lt;ref name="elta-project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elta-project.org/browse.html?recordId=1142|publisher=elta-project.org|title=East London Theatre Archive|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Pavilion Theatre was entirely destroyed by fire on 13 February 1856, and was rebuilt in 1858 as the New Royal Pavilion Theatre, with a capacity of 3,500.&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PavilionTheatreAndWonderlandWhitechapelRoad.htm|publisher=arthurlloyd.co.uk|title=Pavilion Theatre and Wonderland, Whitechapel Road, Stepney|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was further reconstructed in 1871 by the architect [[J. T. Robinson]], and the capacity increased to 4,000.&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd"/&gt; [[Charles Dickens, Jr.]] (eldest child of [[Charles Dickens]]), in his 1879 book ''[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]'', described the Pavilion this way: "A large East-end theatre capable of holding considerably over 3,000 persons. Melodrama of a rough type, farce, pantomime, [[et cetera|&lt;!--SIC, &amp;c.--&gt;&amp;c.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dickens, Charles, Jr.|year=1879|title=Pavilion Theatre|work=[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-p.htm|accessdate=22 August 2007|authorlink=Charles Dickens, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century it became the home of Yiddish theatre, catering to the large Jewish population of the area, and gave birth to the Anglo-Jewish 'Whitechapel Boys' avant-garde literary and artistic movement.

In later years, it operated under the names, Royal Clarence Theatre, Eastern Opera House, and New Royal Pavilion Theatre,&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd"/&gt; continuing in business until 1935. The building was demolished in 1962.

A '''population decline''' (or '''depopulation''') in [[human]]s is any great reduction in a human population caused by events such as long-term demographic trends, as in [[sub-replacement fertility]], [[urban decay]], [[white flight]] or [[rural flight]], or due to violence, disease, or other catastrophes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/depopulation Depopulate] - Webster's Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A reduction over time in a region's population can be caused by several factors including [[sub-replacement fertility]] (along with limited [[immigration]]), heavy [[emigration]], [[disease]], [[famine]], and [[war]]. History is replete with examples of large-scale depopulations. Many wars, for example, have been accompanied by significant depopulations. Before the 20th century, population decline was mostly observed due to disease, starvation or emigration. The [[Black Death]] in Europe, the arrival of [[Old World]] diseases to the [[Americas]], the [[tsetse fly]] invasion of the [[Waterberg Massif]] in [[South Africa]], and the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] all caused sizable population declines. In modern times, the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]] caused declines in the population of some African countries. Less frequently, population declines are caused by [[genocide]] or mass [[execution]]; for example, in the 1970s, the population of [[Cambodia]]  declined because of wide-scale executions by the [[Khmer Rouge]].

==Underpopulation==
Sometimes the term '''underpopulation''' is applied to a specific economic system. It does not refer to carrying capacity, and is not a term in opposition to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], which deals with the total possible population that can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure.  "Underpopulation" is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system. Thus the term has nothing to do with the biological aspects of [[carrying capacity]], but is an economic term employed to imply that the [[transfer payment]] schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point. An example would be if retirees were supported through a [[social security]] system which does not invest savings, and then a large emigration movement occurred. In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generation.

==Changing trends==
Since the dire [[Limits to Growth|predictions]] of coming population overshoot in the 1960s and 70s, and many other social changes, more couples in many countries have tended to choose to have fewer children.
Today, emigration, [[sub-replacement fertility]] and high death rates in the former Soviet Union and its former allies are the principal reasons for that region's population decline.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} However, governments can influence the speed of the decline, including measures to halt, slow or suspend decline. Such measures include pro-birth policies and subsidies, media influence, immigration, bolstering healthcare and laws aimed at reducing death rates. Some of these have been applied in Russia, Armenia, and many Western European nations which have used immigration and other policies to suspend or slow population decline. Therefore, although the long-term trend may be for greater population decline, short term trends may slow the decline or even reverse it, creating seemingly conflicting statistical data.
A great example of changing trends occurring over a century is [[Irish population analysis|Ireland]].

==Interpretation of statistical data==
Statistical data, especially those comparing only two sets of figures, can be misleading and may require careful interpretation. For instance a nation's population could have been increasing, but a one-off event could have resulted in a short-term decline; or vice versa. Nations can acquire territory or lose territory, and groups of people can acquire or lose citizenship, e.g. [[statelessness|stateless]] persons, indigenous people, and illegal immigrants or long-stay foreign residents. Political instability can make it difficult to conduct a census in certain regions. Further, a country's population could rise in summer and decline in winter as deaths increase in winter in cold regions; a long census interval could show a rise in population when the population has already tipped into decline.

==Contemporary decline by country==
{{update|date=July 2015}}
A number of nations today are declining in population: this is occurring in a region stretching from [[North Asia]] ([[Japan]]) through [[Eastern Europe]], including [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and into [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]], including [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Hungary]], and now [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and [[Portugal]], in addition to [[Puerto Rico]] in the Caribbean. Countries rapidly approaching population declines in the 2020-25 period include [[Spain]], [[Germany]], and [[Slovenia]].

[[Russia]] also faces long-term population decline, although the trend has been stalled through a reversal of stagnant birth rates.

[[AIDS]] has played some role in temporary population decline; however, available data suggest that, even with high AIDS mortality, fertility rates in Africa are high enough for the [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] trend to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.prb.org/pdf06/06WorldDataSheet.pdf| format=PDF| title= 2006 World Population Datasheet| publisher= Population Reference Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIDS has contributed to a population explosion in Africa as money from fertility reduction programs was redirected into the HIV/AIDS crisis; African fertility rates have actually increased in the past two decades, and population has grown by over 50%.&lt;ref name="Nigeria142012"&gt;{{cite news|title= Nigeria Tested by Rapid Rise in Population |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/world/africa/in-nigeria-a-preview-of-an-overcrowded-planet.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |accessdate= April 14, 2012 |newspaper= the newyork times |date= April 14, 2012 |author= Elisabeth Rosenthal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are some examples of countries that are experiencing population decline.  The term population used here is based on the ''de facto'' definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship, except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of the country of origin.  This means that population growth in this table includes net changes from immigration and emigration.  For a table of natural population changes, see [[List of countries by natural increase]].

A long-term population decline is typically caused by [[sub-replacement fertility]], coupled with a net immigration rate that fails to compensate the excess of deaths over births.&lt;ref name="Bonin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Generational accounting: theory and application |last=Bonin |first=Holger |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-42266-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A long-term decline is accompanied by [[population aging]] and creates an increase in the ratio of [[Pensioner|retirees]] to workers and children.&lt;ref name="Bonin"/&gt;  When a sub-replacement fertility rate remains constant, population decline accelerates over the long term,&lt;ref name="Bonin"/&gt; however short term baby booms, healthcare improvements, among other factors created can cause flip-flops of trends.  Population decline trends have seen long term reversals in places such as Russia, Germany, Ireland, and the UK, the latter two seeing declines as early as the 1970s, yet the UK now is growing more rapidly than any year since it first tipped into declines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10465123/UK-population-growing-faster-than-any-other-EU-country.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Bruno | last=Waterfield | title=UK population growing faster than any other EU country | date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of more recent declines, it is very uncommon for population to dip under the levels shortly after World War II. Bulgaria and Latvia are the only nations with a net population decline since 1950, and half of all nations worldwide have more than quadrupled their populations.&lt;ref name="uscensus"&gt;https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/region.php?N=%20Results%20&amp;T=6&amp;A=both&amp;RT=0&amp;Y=1950&amp;R=-1&amp;C=AF,AL,AG,AQ,AN,AO,AV,AC,AR,AM,AA,AS,AU,AJ,BF,BA,BG,BB,BO,BE,BH,BN,BD,BT,BL,BK,BC,BR,BX,BU,UV,BM,BY,CB,CM,CA,CV,CJ,CT,CD,CI,CH,CO,CN,CF,CG,CW,CS,IV,HR,CU,UC,CY,EZ,DA,DJ,DO,DR,EC,EG,ES,EK,ER,EN,ET,FO,FJ,FI,FR,FP,GB,GA,GZ,GG,GM,GH,GI,GR,GL,GJ,GQ,GT,GK,GV,PU,GY,HA,HO,HK,HU,IC,IN,ID,IR,IZ,EI,IM,IS,IT,JM,JA,JE,JO,KZ,KE,KR,KN,KS,KV,KU,KG,LA,LG,LE,LT,LI,LY,LS,LH,LU,MC,MK,MA,MI,MY,MV,ML,MT,RM,MR,MP,MX,FM,MD,MN,MG,MJ,MH,MO,MZ,WA,NR,NP,NL,NC,NZ,NU,NG,NI,CQ,NO,MU,PK,PS,PM,PP,PA,PE,RP,PL,PO,RQ,QA,RO,RS,RW,TB,SH,SC,ST,RN,SB,VC,WS,SM,TP,SA,SG,RI,SE,SL,SN,NN,LO,SI,BP,SO,SF,OD,SP,CE,SU,NS,WZ,SW,SZ,SY,TW,TI,TZ,TH,TT,TO,TN,TD,TS,TU,TX,TK,TV,UG,UP,AE,UK,US,UY,UZ,NH,VE,VM,VI,VQ,WF,WE,WI,YM,ZA,ZI&lt;/ref&gt; UAE's current population is over 120 times that of 1950, and Qatar's population has grown over 80 times the 1950s level.&lt;ref name="uscensus"/&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Shrinking cities in the United States|Depopulation of the Great Plains}}
Despite ever increasing population in the United States, some American municipalities have shrunk due to [[urban decay]] in large cities and [[rural flight]] in smaller towns. [[Detroit#Demographics|Detroit]] is the most notable of a number of cities with population smaller than in 1950 and whose population shrinkage has been the most dramatic; Detroit's population was almost 1.85 million as of the 1950 census but has plummeted to 677,000 as of 2015, with the most rapid decline occurring between 2000 and 2010.

Other American cities whose populations have shrunk substantially since the 1950s – although some have begun to grow again – include [[New Orleans]]; [[St. Louis]]; [[Buffalo, New York]]; [[Philadelphia]]; [[Chicago]]; [[Cleveland]]; [[Pittsburgh]]; and [[Wilmington, Delaware]].

===Japan===
{{main|Aging of Japan}}
Though Japan's population has been predicted to decline for years, and its monthly and even annual estimates have shown a decline in the past, the 2010 census result figure was slightly higher, at just above 128 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/Csvdl.do?sinfid=000008640423|title=政府統計の総合窓口　GL08020104|website=www.e-stat.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; than the 2005 census. Factors implicated in the higher figures were more Japanese returnees than expected as well as changes to the methodology of data collection. The official count put the population as of Oct 1, 2015, at 127.1 million, down by 947,000 or 0.7% from the previous census in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-shrinking-of-japan-1456482692|title=Japan’s Net Loss: 947,000 People|first=Jun|last=Hongo|date=26 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/jinsui/tsuki/index.htm|title=Statistics Bureau Home Page/Population Estimates Monthly Report|website=www.stat.go.jp|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gender ratio is increasingly skewed; some 106 women per 100 men live in Japan. The total population is still 52% above 1950 levels.&lt;ref name="geohive"/&gt; In 2013, Japan's population fell by a record-breaking 244,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan’s population falls by a record 244,000 in 2013|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=March 21, 2014|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/01/01/national/japans-population-falls-by-a-record-244000-in-2013/#.UyzydYUxXIU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tohoku region]] in Japan now has fewer people than in 1950.

===Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics===
{{main|Aging of Europe|Russian Cross}}
Population is falling due to health factors and low replacement, as well as emigration of ethnic Russians to Russia. Exceptions to this rule are in those ex-Soviet states that have a Muslim majority ([[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Azerbaijan]]), where high birth rates are traditional. Much of Eastern Europe has lost population due to migration to Western Europe. In [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Russia]], [[Wiktionary:natality|natality]] fell abruptly [[history of post-Soviet Russia|after the end of the Soviet Union]], and death rates generally rose. Together these nations occupy over {{convert|8000000|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} and are home to over 400 million people (less than six percent of the world population), but if current trends continue, more of the developed world and some of the developing world could join this trend.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

====Albania====
Albania's population in 1989 recorded 3,182,417 people, the largest for any census.  Since then, its population declined to an estimated 2,893,005 in Jan 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Albania.html|title=Albania: Prefectures, Municipalities, Municipal Units, Cities and Agglomerations - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|website=www.citypopulation.de|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This represents a decrease of 10% in total population since the peak census figure.

====Armenia====
Armenia's population peaked at 3,604,000 in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armstat.am/en/|title=Armenian Statistical Service of Republic of Armenia|website=www.armstat.am|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declined to 3,010,600 in the Jan 2015 state statistical estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Armenia.html|title=Armenia: Regions, Districts, Cities, Towns, Villages - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|website=www.citypopulation.de|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This represents a 19.7% decrease in total population since the peak census figure.

====Belarus====
Belarus' population peaked at 10,151,806 in 1989 Census, and declined to 9,480,868 as of 2015 as estimated by the state statistical service.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.belta.by/en/news/society?id=688366&lt;/ref&gt;  This represents a 7.1% decline since the peak census figure.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
Bosnia and Herzegovina's population is thought to have peaked at 4,377,033 in 1991 Census, shortly before splitting from [[Yugoslavia]] before the ensuing war.  The latest census of 2013 reported 3,791,622 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citypopulation.de/Bosnia-Cities.html|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina: Political Entities, Cantons, Major Cities &amp; Settlements - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|website=citypopulation.de|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This represents a 15.4% decline since the peak census figure.

====Bulgaria====

Bulgaria's population declined from a peak of 9,009,018 in 1989 and since 2001, has lost yet another 600,000 people, according to 2011 census preliminary figures to no more than 7.3 million.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/2011/03/01/1052038_bulgarian-population-shrinks-by-about-600-000|title=Kapital Quarterly|first=|last=Capital.bg|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; further down to 7,245,000.  This represents a 24.3% decrease in total population since the peak, and a -0.82% annual rate in the last 10 years.

The main reasons for the decline since 1991 are: low birth rates, emigration and [[War in Croatia]]. From 2001 and 2011 main reason for the drop in population is due to a difference in definition of permanent residency used in census' till 2001 (census' of 1948, 1953, 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001) and the one used in 2011.&lt;ref name="Notes on methodology Census 2011"/&gt;

====Estonia====
In the last Soviet census of 1989, it had a population of 1,565,662, which was close to its peak population.&lt;ref name="citypop estonia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Estonia.html|title=Estonia: Regions, Municipalities, Cities and Towns - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|website=www.citypopulation.de|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state statistics reported an estimate of 1,314,370 for 2016.&lt;ref name="citypop estonia"/&gt;
This represents a 19.2% decline since the peak census figure.

====Georgia====
In the last Soviet census of 1989, it had a population of 5,400,841, which was close to its [[Demographics of Georgia (country)|peak population]].&lt;ref name="citypop georgia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Georgia.html|title=Georgia: Regions, Major Cities &amp; Urban Settlements - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|website=www.citypopulation.de|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state statistics reported an estimate of 4,010,000 for 2014 Census, which includes estimated numbers for quasi-independent [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]].&lt;ref name="citypop georgia"/&gt;   This represents a 25.7% decline since the peak census figure, but nevertheless somewhat higher than the 1950 population.

====Latvia====
When Latvia split from the Soviet Union, it had a population of 2,666,567, which was close to its peak population.&lt;ref name="citypop latvia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Latvia.html|title=Latvia: Regions, Municipalities, Cities and Towns - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|website=www.citypopulation.de|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest census
recorded a population of 2,067,887 in 2011, while the state statistics reported an estimate of 1,986,086 for 2015.&lt;ref name="citypop latvia"/&gt;
This represents a 25.5% decline since the peak census figure, only one of 2 nations worldwide falling below 1950 levels. The decline is caused by both a negative natural population growth (more deaths than births) and a negative [[net migration rate]].

====Lithuania====
When Lithuania split from the Soviet Union, it had a population of 3.7 million, which was close to its peak population.&lt;ref name="bizweek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9N8JV6G0.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525021143/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9N8JV6G0.htm |archivedate=2011-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest census recorded a population of 3.05 million in 2011, down from 3.4 million in 2001.,&lt;ref name="bizweek"/&gt; further falling to 2,988,000 in September 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/31907/|title= Lithuania’s population less than 3 million}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This represents a 23.8% decline since the peak census figure, and some 13.7% since 2001.

====Ukraine====
Ukraine census in 1989 resulted in 51,452,034 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_79.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324145212/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_79.php |archivedate=2010-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine's own estimates show a peak of 52,244,000 people in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2007/ds/nas_rik/nas_e/nas_rik_e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805214701/http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2007/ds/nas_rik/nas_e/nas_rik_e.html |archivedate=2012-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however this number has plummeted to 45,439,822 as of Dec 1, 2013.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2013/fin/ds/kn/kn_e/kn0213_e.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016}} Statistical Table Dec 2013&lt;/ref&gt; having lost Crimean territory and experienced war, the population has plunged to 42,981,850 as of August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukrstat.org/en/operativ/operativ2014/ds/kn/kn_e/kn0814_e.html|title=Population (by estimate) as of August 1, 2014.

====Hungary====
Hungary's population peaked in 1980, at 10,709,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.ksh.hu/pls/ksh/docs/eng/xstadat/xstadat_long/h_wdsd001a.html|title=STADAT – 1.1.

====Romania====
Romania's 1991 census showed 23,185,084 people, and the October 2011 census recorded 20,121,641 people, while the state statistical estimate for 2014 is 19,947,311.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citypopulation.de/Romania-Cities.html|title=Romania: Counties and Major Cities - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|website=citypopulation.de|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a decrease of 16.2% since the historical peak in 1991.

====Serbia====
Serbia recorded a peak census population of 7,576,837 in 1991, falling to 7,186,862 in the 2011 census.&lt;ref&gt;http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/userFiles/file/Aktuelnosti/Nacionalna%20pripadnost-Ethnicity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  That represents a decline of 5.1% since its peak census figure.

===Halted declines===

====Russia====
{{Further|Russian Cross}}
The decline in Russia's total population is among the largest in numbers, but not in percentage. After having peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, the population then decreased, falling to 142,737,196 by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbsd.gks.ru/|title=Интерактивная витрина|website=cbsd.gks.ru|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This represents a 4.0% decrease in total population since the peak census figure. However since then the Russian population has risen to 146,870,000 in 2018. This recent trend can be attributed to a lower death rate, higher birth rate, the annexation of Crimea and continued immigration, mostly from Ukraine and Armenia.  It is some 40% above the 1950 population.&lt;ref name="geohive"/&gt;

====Germany====
In Germany a decades-long tendency to population decline has been offset by waves of immigration. The 2011 national census recorded a population of 80.2 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/germany-census.php|title=Census Population (Germany): Federal States, Cities and Communes - Population Statistics, Charts and Map|website=www.citypopulation.de|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2012 it had risen to 82.0 million according to federal estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofoman.com/News/Article-6210.aspx |title=Immigration boosted German population in 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115002956/http://timesofoman.com/News/Article-6210.aspx |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents about 14% increase over 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Population of German territories 1800 - 2000.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
In the current area of the [[Republic of Ireland]], the population has fluctuated dramatically. The population of Ireland was 8 million in 1841, but it dropped due to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] and later emigration. The population of the Republic of Ireland hit bottom at 2.8 million in the 1961 census, but it then rose and in 2011 it was 4.58 million.

==Declines within race or ethnicity==
{{see also|Minority-Majority|White flight|New Great Migration|Antinatalism}}

Some large (and even majority groups within a population) have shown an overall decline in numbers, while the total population increased. Such is the case in California, where the [[Non-Hispanic Whites]] population declined from 15.8 million to 14.95 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/05/16/3629466/californias-latino-and-asian-population.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521040030/http://www.sacbee.com/2011/05/16/3629466/californias-latino-and-asian-population.html |archivedate=2011-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the total population increased from 33 million to over 37 million between 2000 and 2010. Singapore has one of the world's lowest birthrates. The ratio of native Singaporeans (whatever their ethnicity) towards immigrants and migrants continues to erode, with natives decreasing in absolute figures, despite the country planning to increase the population by over 20% in coming years.

==Economic consequences==
[[File:Nursing home.JPG|thumb|Old man at a [[nursing home]] in [[Norway]].]]
{{Further|Dependency ratio|Pensions crisis}}

The effects of a declining population can be adverse for an [[economy]] which has borrowed extensively for repayment by younger generations.
Economically declining populations are thought to lead to [[deflation (economics)|deflation]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}, which has a number of effects. However, Russia, whose economy has been rapidly growing (8.1% in 2007) even as its population is shrinking, currently has high ''inflation'' (12% as of late 2007).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html CIA World Factbook&amp;mdash;Russia [CIA World Factbook&amp;#93;] Retrieved on November 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For an agricultural or mining economy the average [[standard of living]] in a declining population, at least in terms of material possessions, will tend to rise as the amount of land and resources per person will be higher.

But for many industrial economies, the opposite might be true as those economies often thrive on mortgaging the future by way of [[debt]] and retirement [[transfer payments]] that originally assumed rising tax revenues from a continually expanding population base (i.e. there would be fewer taxpayers in a declining population). However, [[standard of living]] does not necessarily correlate with [[quality of life]], which may increase as the population declines due to presumably reduced pollution and consumption of natural resources, and the decline of social pressures and overutilization of resources that can be linked to overpopulation. There may also be reduced pressure on [[infrastructure]], education, and other services as well.

The period immediately after the Black Death, for instance, was one of great prosperity, as people had inheritances from many different family members. However, that situation was not comparable, as it did not have a continually declining population, but rather a sudden shock, followed by population increase. Predictions of the ''net'' economic (and other) effects from a slow and continuous population decline (e.g. due to low fertility rates) are mainly theoretical since such a phenomenon is a relatively new and unprecedented one.

A declining population due to low fertility rates will also be accompanied by [[population ageing]] which can contribute problems for a society. This can adversely affect the quality of life for the young as an increased social and economic pressure in the sense that they have to increase per-capita output in order to support an infrastructure with costly, intensive care for the oldest among their population. The focus shifts away from the planning of future families and therefore further degrades the rate of procreation. The decade-long economic malaise of [[Japan]] and [[Germany]] in the 1990s and early 2000s is often linked to these demographic problems, though there were also several other causes. The worst-case scenario is a situation where the population falls too low a level to support a current [[social welfare]] economic system, which is more likely to occur with a rapid decline than with a more gradual one.

The economies of both [[Japan]] and [[Germany]] both went into recovery around the time their populations just began to decline (2003–2006). In other words, both the total and per capita GDP in both countries grew more rapidly after 2005 than before. [[Russia]]'s economy also began to grow rapidly from 1999 onward, even though its population has been shrinking since 1992-93 (the decline is now decelerating).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Eberstadt. 2005.

Such renewed growth calls into question the conventional wisdom that economic growth requires population growth, or that economic growth is impossible during a population decline. However, it may be argued that this renewed growth is ''in spite of'' population decline rather than because of it, and economic growth in these countries would potentially be greater if they were not undergoing such demographic decline. For example, Russia has become quite wealthy selling fossil fuels such as oil, which are now high-priced, and in addition, its economy has expanded from a very low nadir due to the economic crisis of the late 1990s. And although Japan and Germany have recovered somewhat from having been in a deflationary recession and stagnation, respectively, for the past decade, their recoveries seem to have been quite tepid. Both countries fell into the global recession of 2008–2009, but are now recovering once again, being among the first countries to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/business/global/18inside.html | work=The [[New York Times]] | title=Japan Could Defy the Skeptics | first=Alan | last=Wheatley | date=August 18, 2009 | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article6794291.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=France and Germany emerge from recession | first1=Grainne | last1=Gilmore | first2=Dominic | last2=Walsh | date=August 13, 2009 | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a country with a declining population, the growth of GDP per capita is higher than the growth of GDP. For example, Japan has a higher growth per capita than the United States, even though the U.S. GDP growth is higher than Japan's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=10852462|title=Grossly distorted picture|date=13 March 2008|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when GDP growth is zero or negative, the GDP growth per capita can still be positive (by definition) if the population is shrinking faster than the GDP.

A declining population (regardless of the cause) can also create a [[labor shortage]], which can have a number of positive and negative effects. While some labor-intensive sectors of the economy may be hurt if the shortage is severe enough, others may adequately compensate by increased outsourcing or automation. Initially, the labor participation rates (which are low in many countries) can also be increased to temporarily reduce or delay the shortage. On the positive side, such a shortage increases the demand for labor, which can potentially result in a reduced unemployment rate as well as higher wages. Conversely, a high population means labor is in plentiful supply, which usually means wages will be lower. This is seen in countries like China and India.

Analysing data for 40 countries, Lee et al. show that fertility well above replacement and population growth would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement and population stability would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labour force is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Ronald|last2=Mason|first2=Andrew|last3=members of the NTA Network|title=Is Low Fertility Really a Problem?

A smaller national population can also have geo-strategic effects, but the correlation between population and [[power (international relations)|power]] is a tenuous one.  Technology and resources often play more significant roles.

==National efforts to reverse declining populations==
{{Further|Human population planning}}
Many European countries, including [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Elterngeld|Germany]] and [[Poland]], have offered some combination of bonuses and monthly payments to families.

Paid [[Parental leave|maternity and paternity leave policies]] can also be used as an incentive. Sweden built up an extensive [[welfare state]] from the 1930s and onward, partly as a consequence of the debate following [[Crisis in the Population Question]], published in 1934. Today, Sweden has extensive parental leave where parents are entitled to share 16 months paid leave per child, the cost divided between both employer and State.

==Alternative concept relative to skills==
{{main|Brain drain}}
Sometimes the concept of population decline is applied where there has been considerable emigration of skilled professionals. In such a case, the government may have ceased to reward or value certain skills (e.g. science, medicine and engineering), and sectors of the economy such as health care and technology may go into decline. Such characterizations have been made of [[Italy]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Russia]] in the period starting about 1990.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

{{Campaignbox Ganghwa Island War}}
The '''Geomun Island Incident''' or the '''Port Hamilton Incident''' was the occupation of the [[Geomundo]] (also Komundo or Port Hamilton) by the [[Royal Navy]] from 15 April 1885 to 27 February 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=  |first= |title= The Russo-Japanese war in global perspective: World War Zero |publisher= Brill Academic Pub |ISBN= 90-04-14284-3 |page= 448|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlg0lM8f9Y4C&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=%22Port+Hamilton+Incident%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Port%20Hamilton%20Incident%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia had intended to use the island as a coaling station.

While the British government was alarmed by rumours of a secret agreement between Russia and Korea, these rumours did not reach the British Cabinet until after the decision to occupy Geomundo had been taken.&lt;ref name="Lensen p54"&gt;Lensen, G. A. (1989) Balance of Intrigue: International Rivalry in Korea &amp; Manchuria, 1884–1899. University Press of Florida (2 vols.). Vol. 1: p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The port was taken to establish a British port in the Far East outside China in the event of a war with Russia, to mitigate the harmful potential of possible Chinese neutrality.&lt;ref name="Lensen p54" /&gt; In official statements, the British government claimed that the occupation had been undertaken to preempt Russian annexation of the islands. In response, diplomats such as the then French minister to Japan and newspapers such as the ''Novoe Vremiya'' speculated that Russia would counterbalance the British occupation by seizing Port Lazarev ([[Wonsan]]) or [[Jeju Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Lensen, Vol. 1, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia threatened to occupy parts of Korea, in response to British actions. After receiving assurances from the Russians that they would not occupy any part of Korea the British withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seth|first=Michael J|title=A History of Korea: From Antiquity to the Present|year=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0742567160|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Korea.html?id=WJtMGXyGlUEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal to occupy the islands had been considered earlier by the British Cabinet, in July 1875, but was rejected by Foreign Secretary [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] as setting a poor precedent.&lt;ref name="Lensen p54" /&gt;

[[Image:Principal agent.png|thumb|320px|right|Basic idea of agency theory (P: principal, A: agent)]]

The '''principal–agent problem''', in [[political science]] and [[economics]], (also known as '''agency dilemma''' or the agency problem) occurs when one person or entity (the "[[Agent (economics)|agent]]") is able to make decisions and/or take actions on behalf of, or that impact, another person or entity: the "[[Principal (commercial law)|principal]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhardt, K.M.. (1989). Agency Theory: An Assessment and Review. The Academy of Management Review, 14(1), 57–74. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/258191&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma exists in circumstances where agents are motivated to act in their own best interests, which are contrary to those of their principals, and is an example of [[moral hazard]].

Common examples of this relationship include corporate management (agent) and shareholders (principal), politicians (agent) and voters (principal), or brokers (agent) and markets (buyers and sellers, principals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencycosts.asp#ixzz1zbYtzjNh|title=Agency Costs|work=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider a legal client (the principal) wondering whether their lawyer (the agent) is recommending protracted legal proceedings because it is truly necessary for the client's well being, or because it will generate income for the lawyer. In fact the problem can arise in almost any context where one party is being paid by another to do something where the agent has a small or nonexistent share in the outcome, whether in [[informal sector|formal employment]] or a negotiated deal such as paying for household jobs or car repairs.

The problem arises where the two parties have different interests and [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]] (the agent having more information), such that the principal cannot directly ensure that the agent is always acting in their (the principal's) best interest,&lt;ref name=Bebchuk/&gt; particularly when activities that are useful to the principal are costly to the agent, and where elements of what the agent does are costly for the principal to observe (see [[moral hazard]] and [[conflict of interest]]). Often, the principal may be sufficiently concerned at the possibility of being exploited by the agent that they choose not to enter into the transaction at all, when it would have been mutually beneficial: a suboptimal outcome that can lower welfare overall. The deviation from the principal's interest by the agent is called "[[agency costs]]".&lt;ref name=Bebchuk&gt;''Pay Without Performance'' by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Harvard University Press 2004 ([http://www.pay-without-performance.com/Preface%20and%20Introduction.pdf preface and introduction])&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the agency problem between shareholders and managers, there is also another type of agency problem: the one derived from the existence of big shareholders and small shareholders, which is quite a common phenomenon in a listed company. In the process of dividend distribution, there exists not only information asymmetry but the different influence between big and small shareholders. Small shareholders' behaviors are affected by the big shareholders' decision; in return, they can also impact the big shareholders' decision but not significantly. Under such circumstance, the big shareholders will encroach on the interests by dividend policy.

Various mechanisms may be used to align the interests of the agent with those of the principal. In employment, employers (principal) may use [[piece rates]]/[[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]], [[profit sharing]], [[efficiency wages]], [[performance measurement]] (including [[financial statements]]), the agent posting a bond, or the threat of termination of employment to align worker interests with their own.

==Overview==
The principal and agent theory emerged in the 1970s from the combined disciplines of economics and institutional theory. There is some contention as to who originated the theory, with theorists Stephen Ross and Barry Mitnick claiming its authorship.&lt;ref&gt;Mitnick (2006) "The Origins of Agency Theory": http://www.pitt.edu/~mitnick/agencytheory/agencytheoryoriginrev11806r.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Ross is said to have originally described the dilemma in terms of a person choosing a flavor of ice-cream for someone whose tastes he does not know (''Ibid''). The most cited reference to the theory, however, comes from [[Michael C. Jensen]] and William Meckling.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Michael C. and William H. Meckling. 1976. Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure. Journal of Financial Economics (October), 3(4): 305–360. https://www.sfu.ca/~wainwrig/Econ400/jensen-meckling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has come to extend well beyond economics or institutional studies to all contexts of [[information asymmetry]], [[uncertainty]] and [[risk]].

In the context of law, principals do not know enough about whether (or to what extent) a contract has been satisfied, and they end up with [[agency cost]]s. The solution to this information problem—closely related to the [[moral hazard]] problem—is to ensure the provision of appropriate [[incentive]]s so agents act in the way principals wish.

In terms of [[game theory]], it involves changing the rules of the game so that the self-interested rational choices of the agent coincide with what the principal desires. Even in the limited arena of employment contracts, the difficulty of doing this in practice is reflected in a multitude of compensation mechanisms and supervisory schemes, as well as in critique of such mechanisms as e.g., [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] (1986) expresses in his [[W. Edwards Deming#Seven Deadly Diseases|Seven Deadly Diseases]] of management.

==Employment contract==
In the context of the employment contract, individual contracts form a major method of restructuring incentives, by connecting as closely as is optimal the information available about employee performance, and the compensation for that performance. Because of differences in the quantity and quality of information available about the performance of individual employees, the ability of employees to bear risk, and the ability of employees to manipulate evaluation methods, the structural details of individual contracts vary widely, including such mechanisms as "piece rates, [share] options, discretionary bonuses, promotions, profit sharing, efficiency wages, deferred compensation, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;

The secondary sector is characterised by short-term employment relationships, little or no prospect of internal promotion, and the determination of wages primarily by market forces. In terms of occupations, it consists primarily of low or unskilled jobs, whether they are blue-collar (manual-labour), white-collar (e.g., filing clerks), or service jobs (e.g., waiters). These jobs are linked by the fact that they are characterized by "low skill levels, low earnings, easy entry, job impermanence, and low returns to education or experience." In a number of service jobs, such as food service, golf caddying, and valet parking jobs, workers in some countries are paid mostly or entirely with [[gratuity|tips]].

The use of tipping is a strategy on the part of the owners or managers to align the interests of the service workers with those of the owners or managers; the service workers have an incentive to provide good customer service (thus benefiting the company's business), because this makes it more likely that they will get a good tip.

The issue of tipping is sometimes discussed in connection with the principal–agent theory. "Examples of principals and agents include bosses and employees ... [and] diners and waiters." "The "principal–agent problem", as it is known in economics, crops up any time agents aren't inclined to do what principals want them to do. To sway them [(agents)], principals have to make it worth the agents' while ... [in the restaurant context,] the better the diner's experience, the bigger the waiter's tip."&lt;ref&gt;Paula Szuchman, Jenny Anderson. ''It's Not You, It's the Dishes (originally published as Spousonomics): How to Minimize Conflict and Maximize Happiness in Your Relationship''. Random House Digital, Inc., June 12, 2012. Page 210. Accessed on May 31, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; "In the ... language of the economist, the tip serves as a way to reduce what is known as the classic "principal–agent" problem." According to "Videbeck, a researcher at the New Zealand Institute for the Study of Competition and Regulation[,] "[i]n theory, tipping can lead to an efficient match between workers' attitudes to service and the jobs they perform. It is a means to make people work hard. Friendly waiters will go that extra mile, earn their tip, and earn a relatively high income...[On the other hand,] if tipless wages are sufficiently low, then grumpy waiters might actually choose to leave the industry and take jobs that would better suit their personalities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Only the tip, but size is important |date=December 11, 2004 |work=The Age |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/12/10/1102625528796.html |accessdate=May 31, 2013 }} To tip or not to tip? It's a question causing heartburn, even for economists, writes Farah Farouque.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a solution to the principal–agent problem, though, tipping is not perfect. In the hopes of getting a larger tip, a server, for example, may be inclined to give a customer an extra large glass of wine or a second scoop of ice cream. While these larger servings make the customer happy and increase the likelihood of the server getting a good tip, they cut into the profit margin of the restaurant. In addition, a server may dote on generous tippers while ignoring other customers, and in rare cases harangue bad tippers.

===Non-financial compensation===
Part of this variation in incentive structures and supervisory mechanisms may be attributable to variation in the level of intrinsic psychological satisfaction to be had from different types of work. Sociologists and psychologists frequently argue that individuals take a certain degree of pride in their work, and that introducing [[performance-related pay]] can destroy this "psycho-social compensation", because the exchange relation between employer and employee becomes much more narrowly economic, destroying most or all of the potential for social exchange. Evidence for this is inconclusive—Deci (1971), and Lepper, Greene and Nisbett (1973) find support for this argument; Staw (1989) suggests other interpretations of the findings.

===Team production===
On a related note, Drago and Garvey (1997) use Australian survey data to show that when agents are placed on individual pay-for-performance schemes, they are less likely to help their coworkers. This negative effect is particularly important in those jobs that involve strong elements of "team production" ([[Alchian]] and Demsetz 1972), where output reflects the contribution of many individuals, and individual contributions cannot be easily identified, and compensation is therefore based largely on the output of the team. In other words, pay-for-performance increases the incentives to free-ride, as there are large positive externalities to the efforts of an individual team member, and low returns to the individual (Holmström 1982, McLaughlin 1994).

The negative incentive effects implied are confirmed by some empirical studies, (e.g., Newhouse, 1973) for shared medical practices; costs rise and doctors work fewer hours as more revenue is shared. Leibowitz and Tollison (1980) find that larger law partnerships typically result in worse cost containment. As a counter, peer pressure can potentially solve the problem (Kandel and Lazear 1992), but this depends on peer monitoring being relatively costless to the individuals doing the monitoring/censuring in any particular instance (unless one brings in social considerations of norms and group identity and so on). Studies suggest that profit-sharing, for example, typically raises productivity by 3–5% (Jones and Kato 1995, Knez and Simester 2001), although there are some selection issues (Prendergast).

===Empirical evidence===
There is however considerable [[empirical evidence]] of a positive effect of compensation on performance (although the studies usually involve "simple" jobs where aggregate measures of performance are available, which is where piece rates should be most effective). In one study, Lazear (1996) saw productivity rising by 44% (and wages by 10%) in a change from salary to piece rates, with a half of the productivity gain due to worker selection effects. Research shows that pay for performance increases performance when the task at hand is more repetitive, and reduces performance when the task at hand requires more creative thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us |first=Daniel H. |last=Pink |year=2009 |location=New York |publisher=Riverhead Books |isbn=9781594488849 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Paarsch and Shearer (1996) also find evidence supportive of incentive and productivity effects from piece rates, as do Banker, Lee, and Potter (1996), although the latter do not distinguish between incentive and worker selection effects.
* Rutherford, Springer and Yavas (2005) find evidence of agency problems in residential real estate by showing that real estate agents sell their own houses at a price premium of approximately 4.5% compared to their clients' houses.
* Fernie and Metcalf (1996) find that top British jockeys perform significantly better when offered percentage of prize money for winning races compared to being on fixed retainers.
* McMillan, Whalley and Zhu (1989) and Groves et al. (1994) look at Chinese agricultural and industrial data respectively and find significant incentive effects.
* Kahn and Sherer (1990) find that better evaluations of white-collar office workers were achieved by those employees who had a steeper relation between evaluations and pay.
* Nikkinen and Sahlström (2004) find empirical evidence that agency theory can be used, at least to some extent, to explain [[financial audit]] fees internationally.
* There is very little correlation between performance pay of CEO's and the success of the companies they manage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Performance Pay and Top-Management Incentives |last=Jensen |first=M. C. |last2=Murphy |first2=K. J. |year= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contract design==
Milgrom and Roberts (1992) identify four principles of contract design: When perfect information is not available, Holmström (1979) developed the '''Informativeness Principle''' to solve this problem. This essentially states that any measure of performance that (on the margin) reveals information about the effort level chosen by the agent should be included in the compensation contract. This includes, for example, Relative Performance Evaluation—measurement relative to other, similar agents, so as to filter out some common background noise factors, such as fluctuations in demand. By removing some exogenous sources of randomness in the agent's income, a greater proportion of the fluctuation in the agent's income falls under his control, increasing his ability to bear risk. If taken advantage of, by greater use of piece rates, this should improve incentives. (In terms of the simple linear model below, this means that increasing '''x''' produces an increase in '''b'''.)

However, setting incentives as intense as possible is not necessarily optimal from the point of view of the employer. The '''Incentive-Intensity Principle''' states that the optimal intensity of incentives depends on four factors: the incremental profits created by additional effort, the precision with which the desired activities are assessed, the agent's risk tolerance, and the agent's responsiveness to incentives. According to Prendergast (1999, 8), "the primary constraint on [performance-related pay] is that [its] provision imposes additional risk on workers ..." A typical result of the early principal–agent literature was that piece rates tend to 100% (of the compensation package) as the worker becomes more able to handle risk, as this ensures that workers fully internalize the consequences of their costly actions. In incentive terms, where we conceive of workers as self-interested rational individuals who provide costly effort (in the most general sense of the worker's input to the firm's production function), the more compensation varies with effort, the better the incentives for the worker to produce.

The third principle—the '''Monitoring Intensity Principle—'''is complementary to the second, in that situations in which the optimal intensity of incentives is high corresponds highly to situations in which the optimal level of monitoring is also high. Thus employers effectively choose from a "menu" of monitoring/incentive intensities. This is because monitoring is a costly means of reducing the variance of employee performance, which makes more difference to profits in the kinds of situations where it is also optimal to make incentives intense.

The fourth principle is the '''Equal Compensation Principle''', which essentially states that activities equally valued by the employer should be equally valuable (in terms of compensation, including non-financial aspects such as pleasantness of the workplace) to the employee. This relates to the problem that employees may be engaged in several activities, and if some of these are not monitored or are monitored less heavily, these will be neglected, as activities with higher marginal returns to the employee are favoured. This can be thought of as a kind of "[[disintermediation]]"—targeting certain measurable variables may cause others to suffer. For example, teachers being rewarded by test scores of their students are likely to tend more towards teaching 'for the test', and de-emphasise less relevant but perhaps equally or more important aspects of education; while [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]'s practice at one time of paying programmers by the number of lines of code written resulted in programs that were longer than necessary—i.e., program efficiency suffering (Prendergast 1999, 21). Following Holmström and Milgrom (1990) and Baker (1992), this has become known as "multi-tasking" (where a subset of relevant tasks is rewarded, non-rewarded tasks suffer relative neglect). Because of this, the more difficult it is to completely specify and measure the variables on which reward is to be conditioned, the less likely that performance-related pay will be used: “in essence, complex jobs will typically not be evaluated through explicit contracts.” (Prendergast 1999, 9).

Where explicit measures are used, they are more likely to be some kind of aggregate measure, for example, baseball and [[American Football]] players are rarely rewarded on the many specific measures available (e.g., number of home runs), but frequently receive bonuses for aggregate performance measures such as Most Valuable Player. The alternative to objective measures is subjective performance evaluation, typically by supervisors. However, there is here a similar effect to "multi-tasking", as workers shift effort from that subset of tasks which they consider useful and constructive, to that subset which they think gives the greatest appearance of being useful and constructive, and more generally to try to curry personal favour with supervisors. (One can interpret this as a destruction of organizational [[social capital]]—workers identifying with, and actively working for the benefit of, the firm – in favour of the creation of personal social capital—the individual-level social relations which enable workers to get ahead ("networking").)

===Linear model===
The four principles can be summarized in terms of the simplest (linear) model of incentive compensation:

:: &lt;math&gt;
w = a + b(e + x + gy) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''w''''' (wage) is equal to '''''a''''' (the base salary) plus '''''b''''' (the intensity of incentives provided to the employee) times the sum of three terms: '''''e''''' (unobserved employee effort) plus '''''x''''' (unobserved exogenous effects on outcomes) plus the product of  '''''g''''' (the weight given to observed exogenous effects on outcomes) and '''''y''''' (observed exogenous effects on outcomes). '''''b''''' is the slope of the relationship between compensation and outcomes.

:: &lt;math&gt;
\text{wage} = (\text{base salary}) 
+ (\text{incentives})
\cdot (\text{(unobserved) effort} + (\text{(unobserved) effects}) 
+ (\text{weight }Y)(\text{observed exogenous effects}))
&lt;/math&gt;

The above discussion on explicit measures assumed that contracts would create the linear incentive structures summarised in the model above. But while the combination of normal errors and the absence of income effects yields linear contracts, many observed contracts are nonlinear. To some extent this is due to income effects as workers rise up a tournament/hierarchy: "Quite simply, it may take more money to induce effort from the rich than from the less well off." (Prendergast 1999, 50).  Similarly, the threat of being fired creates a nonlinearity in wages earned versus performance. Moreover, many empirical studies illustrate inefficient behaviour arising from nonlinear objective performance measures, or measures over the course of a long period (e.g., a year), which create nonlinearities in time due to discounting behaviour. This inefficient behaviour arises because incentive structures are varying: for example, when a worker has already exceeded a quota or has no hope of reaching it, versus being close to reaching it—e.g., Healy (1985), Oyer (1997), Leventis (1997). Leventis shows that New York surgeons, penalised for exceeding a certain mortality rate, take less risky cases as they approach the threshold. Courty and Marshke (1997) provide evidence on incentive contracts offered to agencies, which receive bonuses on reaching a quota of graduated trainees within a year. This causes them to ‘rush-graduate' trainees in order to make the quota.

===Options framework===
In certain cases agency problems may be analysed by applying the techniques developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], as applied via a [[real options]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aswath Damodaran]]:  [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/lectures/opt.html Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation] and [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optequity.pdf Option Pricing Applications in Valuation].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Mauer and S. Sarkar (2001).  [http://www1.american.edu/academic.depts/ksb/finance_realestate/mrobe/Seminar/Mauer.pdf Real Options, Agency Conflicts, and Financial Policy]; G. Siller-Pagaza, G. Otalora, E. Cobas-Flores (2006). [http://realoptions.org/papers2006/Siller-Pagaza_RO2.pdf  The Impact of Real Options in Agency Problems]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stockholders]] and [[bondholders]] have different objective—for instance, stockholders have an incentive to take riskier projects than bondholders do, and to pay more out in [[dividends]] than bondholders would like. At the same time, since equity may be seen as a [[call option]] on the value of the firm, an increase in the [[variance]] in the firm value, other things remaining equal, will lead to an increase in the value of equity, and stockholders may therefore take risky projects with negative net present values, which while making them better off, may make the bondholders worse off. See [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|Option pricing approaches]] under [[Business valuation]] for further discussion. Nagel and Purnanandam (2017) notice that since bank assets are risky debt claims, bank equity resembles a subordinated debt and therefore the stock's payoff is truncated by the difference between the face values of the corporation debt and of the bank deposits. &lt;ref&gt;  [S. Nagel and A. Purnanandam (2017).  [https://www.dropbox.com/s/t6r9xvihh6lrntr/BankCreditRisk.pdf?dl=0 Bank Risk Dynamics and Distance to Default]; &lt;/ref&gt; Based on this observation, Peleg-Lazar and Raviv (2017) show that in contrast to the classical agent theory of Michael C. Jensen and William Meckling, an increase in variance would not lead to an increase in the value of equity if the bank's debtor is solvent. &lt;ref&gt; [S. Peleg-Lazar and A. Raviv (2017).

==Performance evaluation==

===Objective performance evaluation===
The major problem in measuring employee performance in cases where it is difficult to draw a straightforward connection between
performance and profitability is the setting of a standard by which to judge the performance. One method of setting an absolute objective performance standard—rarely used because it is costly and only appropriate for simple repetitive tasks—is [[time-and-motion studies]], which study in detail how fast it is possible to do a certain task. These have been used constructively in the past, particularly in manufacturing. More generally, however, even within the field of objective performance evaluation, some form of relative performance evaluation must be used. Typically this takes the form of comparing the performance of a worker to that of his peers in the firm or industry, perhaps taking account of different exogenous circumstances affecting that.

The reason that employees are often paid according to hours of work rather than by direct measurement of results is that it is often more efficient to use indirect systems of controlling the quantity and quality of effort, due to a variety of informational and other issues (e.g., turnover costs, which determine the optimal minimum length of relationship between firm and employee). This means that methods such as deferred compensation and structures such as tournaments are often more suitable to create the incentives for employees to contribute what they can to output over longer periods (years rather than hours). These represent "pay-for-performance" systems in a looser, more extended sense, as workers who consistently work harder and better are more likely to be promoted (and usually paid more), compared to the narrow definition of "pay-for-performance", such as piece rates. This discussion has been conducted almost entirely for self-interested rational individuals. In practice, however, the incentive mechanisms which successful firms use take account of the socio-cultural context they are embedded in ([[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] 1995, Granovetter 1985), in order not to destroy the [[social capital]] they might more constructively mobilise towards building an organic, social organization, with the attendant benefits from such things as "worker loyalty and pride (...) [which] can be critical to a firm's success ..." (Sappington 1991,63)

===Subjective performance evaluation===
Subjectivity is related to judgement based on a supervisor's subjective impressions and opinions, which can be expressed through the use of subjective performance measures, ''ex post'' flexibility in the weighting of objective performance measures, or ''ex post'' discretional adjustment, all of which are based on factors other than performance measures specified ''ex ante''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bicudo de Castro|first=Vincent|date=November 2017|title=Unpacking the notion of subjectivity: Performance evaluation and supervisor discretion|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bar.2017.08.003|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=49|issue=6|pages=532–544|doi=10.1016/j.bar.2017.08.003|issn=0890-8389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective performance evaluation allows the use of a subtler, more balanced assessment of employee performance, and is typically used for more complex jobs where comprehensive objective measures are difficult to specify and/or measure. Whilst often the only feasible method, the attendant problems with subjective performance evaluation have resulted in a variety of incentive structures and supervisory schemes. One problem, for example, is that supervisors may under-report performance in order to save on wages, if they are in some way residual claimants, or perhaps rewarded on the basis of cost savings. This tendency is of course to some extent offset by the danger of retaliation and/or demotivation of the employee, if the supervisor is responsible for that employee's output.

Another problem relates to what is known as the "compression of ratings". Two related influences—centrality bias, and leniency bias—have been documented (Landy and Farr 1980, Murphy and Cleveland 1991). The former results from supervisors being reluctant to distinguish critically between workers (perhaps for fear of destroying team spirit), while the latter derives from supervisors being averse to offering poor ratings to subordinates, especially where these ratings are used to determine pay, not least because bad evaluations may be demotivating rather than motivating. However, these biases introduce noise into the relationship between pay and effort, reducing the incentive effect of performance-related pay. Milkovich and Wigdor (1991) suggest that this is the reason for the common separation of evaluations and pay, with evaluations primarily used to allocate training.

Finally, while the problem of compression of ratings originates on the supervisor-side, related effects occur when workers actively attempt to influence the appraisals supervisors give, either by influencing the performance information going to the supervisor: multitasking (focussing on the more visibly productive activities—Paul 1992), or by working “too hard” to signal worker quality or create a good impression (Holmström 1982); or by influencing the evaluation of it, e.g., by "currying influence" (Milgrom and Roberts 1988) or by outright bribery (Tirole 1992).

==Incentive structures==

===Tournaments===
Much of the discussion here has been in terms of individual pay-for-performance contracts; but many large firms use internal labour markets (Doeringer and Piore 1971, Rosen 1982) as a solution to some of the problems outlined. Here, there is "pay-for-performance" in a looser sense over a longer time period. There is little variation in pay within grades, and pay increases come with changes in job or job title (Gibbs and Hendricks 1996). The incentive effects of this structure are dealt with in what is known as “[[tournament theory]]" (Lazear and Rosen 1981, Green and Stokey (1983), see Rosen (1986) for multi-stage tournaments in hierarchies where it is explained why CEOs are paid many times more than other workers in the firm). See the [[superstar]] article for more information on the tournament theory.

Workers are motivated to supply effort by the wage increase they would earn if they win a promotion. Some of the extended tournament models predict that relatively weaker agents, be they competing in a sports tournaments (Becker and Huselid 1992, in [[NASCAR]] racing) or in the broiler chicken industry (Knoeber and Thurman 1994), would take risky actions instead of increasing their effort supply as a cheap way to improve the prospects of winning. These actions are inefficient as they increase risk taking without increasing the average effort supplied.

A major problem with tournaments is that individuals are rewarded based on how well they do relative to others. Co-workers might become reluctant to help out others and might even sabotage others' effort instead of increasing their own effort (Lazear 1989, Rob and Zemsky 1997). This is supported empirically by Drago and Garvey (1997). Why then are tournaments so popular? Firstly, because—especially given compression rating problems—it is difficult to determine absolutely differences in worker performance. Tournaments merely require rank order evaluation. Secondly, it reduces the danger of [[rent-seeking]], because bonuses paid to favourite workers are tied to increased responsibilities in new jobs, and supervisors will suffer if they do not promote the most qualified person. Thirdly, where prize structures are (relatively) fixed, it reduces the possibility of the firm reneging on paying wages. As Carmichael (1983) notes, a prize structure represents a degree of commitment, both to absolute and to relative wage levels.  Lastly when the measurement of workers' productivity is difficult, e.g., say monitoring is costly, or when the tasks the workers have to perform for the job is varied in nature, making it hard to measure effort and/or performance, then running tournaments in a firm would encourage the workers to supply effort whereas workers would have shirked if there are no promotions.

Tournaments also promote [[risk seeking]] behavior.  In essence, the compensation scheme becomes more
like a [[call option]] on performance (which increases in value with increased [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] (cf. [[options pricing]]).
If you are one of ten players competing for the asymmetrically large top prize, you may benefit from reducing the expected
value of your overall performance to the firm in order to increase your chance that you have an outstanding performance
(and win the prize). In moderation this can offset the greater risk aversion of agents vs principals because their social capital is concentrated in their employer while in the case of public companies the principal typically owns his stake as part of a diversified portfolio. Successful innovation is particularly dependent on employees' willingness to take risks.  In cases with extreme incentive intensity, this sort of behavior can create catastrophic organizational failure. If the principal owns the firm as part of a diversified portfolio this may be a price worth paying for the greater chance of success through innovation elsewhere in the portfolio. If however the risks taken are systematic and cannot be diversified e.g., exposure to general housing prices, then such failures will damage the interests of principals and even the economy as a whole.
(cf. [[Kidder Peabody]], [[Barings]], [[Enron]], [[AIG]] to name a few). Ongoing periodic catastrophic organizational failure
is directly incentivized by [[tournament]] and other [[superstar]]/winner-take-all compensation systems (Holt 1995).

===Deferred compensation===
Tournaments represent one way of implementing the general principle of "deferred compensation", which is essentially an agreement between worker and firm to commit to each other. Under schemes of deferred compensation, workers are overpaid when old, at the cost of being underpaid when young. Salop and Salop (1976) argue that this derives from the need to attract workers more likely to stay at the firm for longer periods, since turnover is costly. Alternatively, delays in evaluating the performance of workers may lead to compensation being weighted to later periods, when better and poorer workers have to a greater extent been distinguished. (Workers may even prefer to have wages increasing over time, perhaps as a method of forced saving, or as an indicator of personal development. e.g., Loewenstein and Sicherman 1991, Frank and Hutchens 1993.) For example Akerlof and Katz 1989: if older workers receive efficiency wages, younger workers may be prepared to work for less in order to receive those later. Overall, the evidence suggests the use of deferred compensation (e.g., Freeman and Medoff 1984, and Spilerman 1986—seniority provisions are often included in pay, promotion and retention decisions, irrespective of productivity.)

==Other applications==
The "principal–agent problem" has also been discussed in the context of energy consumption by Jaffe and Stavins in 1994. They were attempting to catalog market and non-market barriers to energy efficiency adoption. In efficiency terms, a [[market failure]] arises when a technology which is both cost-effective and saves energy is not implemented. Jaffe and Stavins describe the common case of the landlord-tenant problem with energy issues as a principal–agent problem. "[I]f the potential adopter is not the party that pays the energy bill, then good information in the hands of the potential adopter may not be sufficient for optimal diffusion; adoption will only occur if the adopter can recover the investment from the party that enjoys the energy savings. Thus, if it is difficult for the possessor of information to convey it credibly to the party that benefits from reduced energy use, a principal/agent problem arises."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/rstavins/Papers/The%20Energy%20Efficiency%20Gap.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy efficiency use of the principal agent terminology is in fact distinct from the usual one in several ways. In landlord/tenant or more generally equipment-purchaser / energy-bill-payer situations, it is often difficult to describe who would be the principal and who the agent. Is the agent the landlord and the principal the tenant, because the landlord is "hired" by the tenant through the payment of rent? As (Murtishaw and Sathaye, 2006) point out, "In the residential sector, the conceptual definition of principal and agent must be stretched beyond a strictly literal definition."

Another distinction is that the principal agent problem in energy efficiency does not require any information asymmetry: both the landlord and the tenant may be aware of the overall costs and benefits of energy-efficient investments, but as long as the landlord pays for the equipment and the tenant pays the energy bills, the investment in new, energy-efficient appliances will not be made. In this case, there is also little incentive for the tenant to make a capital efficiency investment with a usual payback time of several years, and which in the end will revert to the landlord as property. Since energy consumption is determined both by technology and by behavior, an opposite principal agent problem arises when the energy bills are paid by the landlord, leaving the tenant with no incentive to moderate her energy use. This is often the case for leased office space, for example.

The energy efficiency principal agent problem applies in many cases to rented buildings and apartments, but arises in other circumstances, most often involving relatively high up-front costs for energy-efficient technology. Though it is challenging to assess exactly, the principal agent problem is considered to be a major barrier to the diffusion of efficient technologies. This can be addressed in part by promoting shared-savings performance-based contracts, where both parties benefit from the efficiency savings. The issues of market barriers to energy efficiency, and the principal agent problem in particular, are receiving renewed attention because of the importance of global [[climate change]] and rising prices of the finite supply of [[fossil fuels]]. The principal–agent problem in energy efficiency is the topic of an [[International Energy Agency]] report:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/publications/free_new_Desc.asp?PUBS_ID=1954|title=Publications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Mind the Gap—Quantifying Principal–Agent Problems in Energy Efficiency" (2007).

The problem manifests itself in the ways middle managers discriminate against employees who they deem to be "[[overqualified]]" in hiring, assignment, and promotion, and repress or terminate "[[whistleblower]]s" who want to make senior management aware of fraud or illegal activity. This may be done for the benefit of the middle manager and against the best interest of the shareholders (or members of a non-profit organization). [[Public official]]s are agents, and people adopt constitutions and laws to try to manage the relationship, but officials may betray their trust and allow themselves to be unduly influenced by [[lobby groups]] or they may abuse their authority and managerial discretion by showing personal favoritism or bad faith by hiring an unqualified friend or by engaging in corruption or [[patronage]], such as selecting the firm of a friend or family member for a [[no-bid contract]]. The problem arises in client–attorney, [[probate]] executor, bankruptcy trustee, and other such relationships. In some rare cases, attorneys who were entrusted with estate accounts with sizeable balances acted against the interests of the person who hired them to act as their agent by embezzling the funds or "playing the market" with the client's money (with the goal of pocketing any proceeds).

== Economic theory ==
In economic theory, the principal-agent approach (also called agency theory) is part of the field ''[[contract theory]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The theory of incentives: The principal-agent model|last = Laffont|first = Jean-Jacques|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Martimort|first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contract theory|last = Bolton|first = Patrick|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Dewatripont|first2 = Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agency theory, it is typically assumed that complete contracts can be written, an assumption also made in [[mechanism design]] theory. Hence, there are no restrictions on the class of feasible contractual arrangements between principal and agent. Agency theory can be subdivided in two categories: (1) In [[adverse selection]] models, the agent has private information about his type (say, his costs of exerting effort or his valuation of a good) ''before'' the contract is written. (2) In [[moral hazard]] models, the agent becomes privately informed ''after'' the contract is written. Hart and Holmström (1987) divide moral hazard models in the categories "hidden action" (e.g., the agent chooses an unobservable effort level) and "hidden information" (e.g., the agent learns his valuation of a good, which is modelled as a random draw by nature).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advances in Economics and Econometrics|last = Hart|first = Oliver|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = 71–155|last2 = Holmström|first2 = Bengt|editor-last = Bewley, T.|chapter = The theory of contracts}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hidden action models, there is a stochastic relationship between the unobservable effort and the verifiable outcome (say, the principal's revenue), because otherwise the unobservability of the effort would be meaningless. Typically, the principal makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the agent; i.e., the principal has all bargaining power. In principal–agent models, the agent often gets a strictly positive rent (i.e. his payoff is larger than his reservation utility, which he would get if no contract were written), which means that the principal faces agency costs. For example, in adverse selection models the agent gets an information rent, while in hidden action models with a wealth-constrained agent the principal must leave a limited-liability rent to the agent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to reduce the agency costs, the principal typically induces a second-best solution that differs from the socially optimal first-best solution (which would be attained if there were complete information). If the agent had all bargaining power, the first-best solution would be achieved in adverse selection models with one-sided private information as well as in hidden action models where the agent is wealth-constrained. Contract-theoretic principal–agent models have been applied in various fields, including financial contracting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The theory of corporate finance|last = Tirole|first = Jean|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; regulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Regulating a Monopolist with Unknown Costs|jstor = 1912769|journal = Econometrica|volume = 50|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/1912769|first = David P.|last = Baron|first2 = Roger B.|last2 = Myerson|date = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; public procurement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Public procurement in times of crisis: The bundling decision reconsidered|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016517651300462X|journal = Economics Letters|date = 2013|pages = 533–536|volume = 121|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.econlet.2013.10.015|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; monopolistic price-discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Monopoly with Incomplete Information|last = Maskin|first = Eric|date = 1984|journal = RAND Journal of Economics|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Riley|first2 = John|pages = 171–196|volume = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; job design,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Job design with conflicting tasks reconsidered|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001429211200147X|journal = European Economic Review|date = 2013|pages = 108–117|volume = 57|doi = 10.1016/j.euroecorev.2012.11.001|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; internal labor markets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Internal labor markets and worker rents|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268112001606|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2012|pages = 491–509|volume = 84|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2012.08.008|first = Matthias|last = Kräkel|first2 = Anja|last2 = Schöttner}}&lt;/ref&gt; team production,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Moral hazard in teams|last = Homström|first = Bengt|date = 1982|journal = Bell Journal of Economics|doi = |pmid = |pages = 324–340|volume = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others.

The '''Sahara International Film Festival''', also known as '''FiSahara''', is an annual event which takes place in the [[Sahrawi refugee camps]], at the South West corner of [[Algeria]], near the border with [[Western Sahara]]. It is the only film festival in the world taking place in a [[refugee camp]].&lt;ref name="ElMundoFiSahara08"&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/04/17/solidaridad/1208429499.html Comienza 'Fisahara 2008', el único festival de cine en un campo de refugiados] [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]], 18 April 2008 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three years the festival was held alternately in the [[Wilaya of Smara]], [[Wilaya of Ausserd]] and [[Wilaya of El Aaiun]], but since 2007 the FiSahara had stayed in the [[Wilaya of Dakhla]]. The event is backed by the [[Polisario Front]],&lt;ref name="Roape Article"&gt;[http://www.roape.org/cgi-bin/roape/show/9920.html Roape Article]&lt;/ref&gt; but largely organised and funded by donors from [[Spain]], the former colonial power in Western Sahara, attracting support from Spanish film celebrities as [[Penélope Cruz]], [[Javier Bardem]] and [[Pedro Almodóvar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FiSahara: The World’s Most Remote Film Festival|url=http://blog.africageographic.com/safari-blog/events-festivals/fisahara-the-worlds-most-remote-film-festival/|author=Holly Meadows|publisher=Africa Geographic|date=11 April 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430052640/http://blog.africageographic.com/safari-blog/events-festivals/fisahara-the-worlds-most-remote-film-festival/|archivedate=30 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Festival is an initiative to bring film as an entertainment and cultural form to the thousands of Sahrawis whose community has lived for more than thirty years in relative isolation in the Algerian desert, being the only film festival in the world taking place in a [[refugee camp]].
The first festival was in large part organised by Peruvian film director [[Javier Corcuera]].&lt;ref name="Roape Article"/&gt;

The festival has the two-fold aim of providing cultural entertainment and educational opportunities to refugees, and of raising awareness of the plight of the Sahrawi people, who have been exiled from their native Western Sahara for more than three decades. Western Sahara, “Africa’s last colony,” was given to Morocco and Mauritania by the Spanish when they withdrew in 1976. The Moroccans subsequently annexed the entire territory in 1979, in defiance of a ruling from the [[International Court of Justice]]. A sixteen-year war ensued between the Moroccans and the native Sahrawi independence movement, the Polisario Front. Under the terms of a 1991 UN ceasefire agreement, a referendum for self-determination was promised, but has been blocked by Morocco. In the meantime an estimated 165,000 refugees continue to live in four large camps in the inhospitable Algerian desert.

Home to around 30,000 refugees, Dakhla is the most remote of the camps, located 175&amp;nbsp;km away from the nearest city, [[Tindouf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FiSahara: Film Festival in the Desert|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/13/desert-film-festivalaccessdate=11|author=Stefan Simanowitz|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has no electricity or paved roads and is dependent on outside supplies of food and water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/how-a-saharan-refugee-camp-launched-an-international-film-festival-1685002.html The Riddle of the Sands: How a refugee camps set up an international film festival] Stefan Simanowitz, ''The Independent'', 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==White Camel Winners==
The '''White Camel''' ({{lang-ar|'''الجمل الأبيض'''}}) is the festival's highest prize, awarded for the best film by election of the spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivalsahara.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=204%3Aactividades-paralelas-2&amp;catid=53%3Aprogramacion-fisahara-2011&amp;Itemid=60&amp;lang=en Additional festival events] Festivalsahara.com&lt;/ref&gt; It consists on a white female [[camel]], which is traditionally donated to the refugee family who had hosted the actors or director of the winner film during the festival. Instead, the winners take home a trophy depicting a white camel and a [[Desert rose (crystal)|desert rose]].

[[File:Interior View of the Scala Theatre, London - 1917 (5327707820).jpg|thumb|The Scala in 1917]]
The '''Scala Theatre''' was a theatre in [[Charlotte Street]], London, off [[Tottenham Court Road]]. The first theatre on the site opened in 1772, and the theatre was demolished in 1969, after being destroyed by fire.  From 1865&amp;ndash;82, the theatre was known as the '''Prince of Wales's Theatre''' (not to be confused with [[The Prince of Wales Theatre]]).

==Origins==
The theatre began on this site as '''The New Rooms''' where concerts were performed, in Charlotte Street, in 1772, under the management of Francis Pasquali. Popularity, and royal patronage led to the building's enlargement by [[James Wyatt]], and its renaming as the '''King's Concert Rooms''' (1780–1786). It then became '''Rooms for Concerts of Ancient Music''' and '''Hyde's Rooms''' (1786–1802, managed by ''The Directors of Concerts and Ancient Music'').

In 1802, a private theatre club, managed by Captain Caulfield, the ''"Pic-Nics"'' occupied the building and named it the '''Cognoscenti Theatre''' (1802–1808). It became the '''New Theatre''' (1808–1815, under Saunders and Mr J. Paul) and was extended and fitted out as a public theatre with a portico entrance, on Tottenham Street.

It continued under a succession of managers as the unsuccessful '''Regency Theatre''' (1815–1820), falling into decline. The theatre then reopened as the '''West London Theatre''' (1820–1831, under Brunton), '''Queen's Theatre''' (1831–1833, 1835–1837, and again 1839-1865), and '''Fitzroy Theatre''' (1833–1835 and 1837–1839). The lessee of the theatre from 1843 to 1869 was a scenic artist, Charles James James, and the theatre became the home of lurid [[melodrama]], being nicknamed ''The Dusthole''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/html/specoll/theats.htm University of Kent, Theatre Collection] accessed 12 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~a0fs000/1800/0407.html University of Massachusetts, Theatre History] accessed 12 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scala&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/icons/playbills/3SCALA.HTM University of Kent, Scala Theatre] accessed 12 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prince of Wales's Royal Theatre 1865–1882==
In 1865, the theatre was renovated and named the '''Prince of Wales's Royal Theatre''' and this continued until it went dark in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatre-architecture.eu/en/db/?theatreId=1040 "Scala Theatre"], Theatre Database, Theatre-architecture.eu, accessed 28 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Savin|first=Maynard|title=Thomas William Robertson: His Plays and Stagecraft|year=1950|publisher=Brown University Press|location=Providence, RI| url=https://archive.org/stream/thomaswilliamrob011269mbp/thomaswilliamrob011269mbp_djvu.txt|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished in 1903.&lt;ref name=scala/&gt; In 1865, in partnership with [[Henry James Byron|Henry Byron]], [[Effie Bancroft|Effie Marie Wilton]] assumed the management of the theatre, having secured as a leading actor [[Squire Bancroft]].  He starred in J. P. Wooler's ''A Winning Hazard'', among other works.  Wilton provided the capital, and Byron wrote a number of plays.  His first was a burlesque of ''[[La sonnambula]]''.  However, Wilton wanted to present more sophisticated pieces. She agreed to produce three more burlesques by Byron, while he agreed to write his first prose comedies, ''War to the Knife'' (a success in 1865) and ''A Hundred Thousand Pounds'' (1866).  By 1867, Byron left the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Peter.

The house soon became noted for the successful domestic drama-comedies by [[Thomas William Robertson]], including his series of groundbreaking [[realism (dramatic arts)|realist]] plays, ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'' (1865), ''Ours'' (1866), ''[[Caste (play)|Caste]]'' (1867), ''Play'' (1868), ''School'' (1869), and ''M.P.'' (1870).  In 1867, Miss Wilton became Mrs. Bancroft and regularly took the principal female parts in these pieces opposite her husband.  Other plays were [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''Allow Me To Explain'' (1867; this ran as a companion piece to Robertson's ''Caste'')&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Arthur. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/allow_me/allow_me.html "''Allow Me To Explain''"], Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 27 November 1996, accessed 27 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874), as well as ''Tame Cats'' (1868), [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lytton's]] ''Money'' (1872), ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' (1874), a revival of [[Dion Boucicault|Boucicault's]] ''London Assurance'' (1877), and ''Diplomacy'' ([[Clement Scott]]'s 1878 adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]]'s ''Dora'').  A number of prominent actors played at the theatre during this period, among them [[John Hare (actor)|Hare]], [[Charles Francis Coghlan|Coghlan]], the [[William Hunter Kendal|Kendals]], and [[Ellen Terry]].

A big success in 1881 was [[F. C. Burnand]]'s ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'', which went on to run for 550 performances, transferring to the Imperial Theatre.  In 1882, the theatre went ''dark'', and from 1886 the theatre buildings were used as a [[Salvation Army]] Hostel, until it was demolished in 1903.&lt;ref name=scala/&gt;  A different London theatre began to use the name [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] in 1886.

== Scala Theatre 1905–1969 ==
In 1903, Dr. [[Edmund Distin Maddick]] bought the property, and adjoining properties, and enlarged the site. The main entrance was now situate on Charlotte Street, and the old portico, on Tottenham Street became the stage door. The new theatre, designed by [[Frank Verity]], opened in 1905, as '''The Scala Theatre''', seating 1,139 and boasting a large stage. The new venture was not particularly successful, however, and became a cinema from 1911–1918, run by Charles Urban.&lt;ref name=scala/&gt; In 1918, F. J. Nettlefold took over and ran the premises as a theatre again.

It became known as the ''New Scala'' in 1923, with D.A. Abrahams as licensee for both staging plays and showing films, becoming owner in 1925. Amateur productions and [[pantomime]] were performed, and for a while the theatre became home to the [[Gang Show]].  During [[World War II]], it again housed professional theatre, reverting to the ''Scala Theatre''. After the war, under the management of Prince Littler, amateur productions returned, with ''[[Peter Pan]]'' being the annual pantomime. This continued until 1969 when, after a fire, it was demolished for the building of offices, known as ''Scala House''. In 1964, the theatre was used by [[The Beatles]] for the concert sequences in the film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. Today it is the site of an apartment block.

'''''Stairs 1 Geneva''''' is a film by [[Peter Greenaway]]. It is also a large-scale [[art installation]], an exhibition, a catalogue and a [[Compact Disc|CD]] album.

==The film==

The film comprises one hundred sequences showing a location in the city of [[Geneva]], Switzerland. In 1994, over a period of one hundred days, one hundred white wooden staircases were installed around the city to be climbed by the public. At the top of each staircase was a simple hole framing a "living picture postcard", a perfect "cinema-image by [[Peter Greenaway]]" accompanied by a commentary of one sentence in French and English, printed below the viewfinder. Greenaway's idea was to create a reflection on location in cinema and to "take films out of the theatres".[http://www.filmfestivalen.se/1994/Stairsone.html]

==The event==

[[Searchlight|Spotlight]]s of different colors were installed throughout the city. The event was called "The Stairs: Geneva The Location", and was expanded into a wider project including other cities and other cinematic themes of relaxation. The events were also published in a catalogue form and a musical compact disc (Merrell, March 1995).

==The installation==

Approximately one hundred performers representing typical regional characters, with costumes and props, ([[John Calvin|Calvin]] and his fellows reformers, different spirits of the lake, [[Laura Ashley]] with her bicycle, living statues, etc.), were sited within the framed view of the staircases' viewfinders. They all were specially trained to perform a choreography (by Serge Campardon[http://www.compagnienomades.com]) every 15 minutes. Each performer was given a luxury Genevan watch to check the time throughout the five or more hours of their performance.

==Further details==

The film's scenes show day or night views in the exact frame defined by the staircase's viewfinder. Superimposed images make some of the characters of the installation appear and disappear in the frame under different lights, and are linked with different kind of local events, such as a cycle race or a children's choir on the cathedral steps. The voice-over patiently helps the visual description by numbering the scenes by the same number of each staircase, and reading the sentence printed on the viewfinder. Each scene is accompanied by a one-minute music pattern by Patrick Mimran,[http://www.mimran.com/]. The soundtrack CD which accompanies the project suggests each piece can be played randomly, just as a visitor could visit the staircases in any order.

An exhibition was also set in the [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire (Geneva)|Musée d'Art et d'Histoire]][http://www.ville-ge.ch/musinfo/mahg/musee/mah/mah.html] where lights and slide projections supplemented a display of one hundred sculpted heads found and chosen in the museum depot, as well as one hundred historical helmets.

'''''The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs''''' is an opera with music by American composer [[Mason Bates]] and an English-language libretto by Mark Campbell. It was commissioned by [[Santa Fe Opera]], [[Seattle Opera]], [[San Francisco Opera]], the [[Jacobs School of Music]] at Indiana University, with support from Cal Performances. The opera is about one of the most influential people in recent history; it is set at a time when he must confront his own mortality and circle back on the events that shaped his personal and professional life. 

The world premiere took place at the Santa Fe Opera in 2017, conducted by [[Michael Christie (conductor)|Michael Christie]]. The original production featured direction by Kevin Newbury, scenic design by Vita Tzykun, costume design by Paul Carey, lighting design by Japhy Weideman, projection design by Ben Pearcy for 59 Productions, and sound design by Rick Jacobsohn and Brian Loach; it was a co-production of Santa Fe Opera, Seattle Opera, San Francisco Opera, and the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. ''The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs'' was the most popular new opera in Santa Fe Opera’s history and one of the top-selling operas in the company's history. An extra performance had to be added to accommodate the demand for tickets. In May 2018, a recording of the work was issued under the Pentatone label. 

Bates was drawn to [[Steve Jobs]] as the subject for an opera, because, he says, opera “can illuminate the interior thoughts of different characters simultaneously through the juxtaposition of individual themes. That makes it an ideal medium to explore a man who revolutionized how we communicate.”&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Mason, "The Music of Communication" in Santa Fe Opera 2017 program book, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt; Bates asked Mark Campbell, one of America’s leading opera librettists, to create the story in the libretto. According to Campbell, “Learning that Jobs was a Buddhist his entire adult life lead me to the ensō, the circle that is drawn in Japanese calligraphy to express enlightenment. I connected that with Jobs’ habit of taking long walks and the Zen practice of pacing in a circular pattern called a kinhin and began to develop a story in which Steve ‘circles back’ on his life. The title actually refers less to the revolution Jobs helped create in technology rather than the kinhin of self-reflection that propels the story.” &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Mark, "The Evolution of ''(R)evolution''" in Santa Fe Opera 2017 program book, pp. 79–81&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Rydstrom of Skywalker Sound assisted Bates with the production of the opera’s electronic sounds.

== Synopsis==

This one-act opera features roles based on real-life figures [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]], [[Chrisann Brennan]], [[Kōbun Chino Otogawa]], and [[Laurene Powell]]. Inspired by the life and creative spirit of Steve Jobs, the opera does not purport to depict actual events as they occurred or statements, beliefs, or opinions of the persons depicted. 
Synopsis by Mark Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Fe Opera 2017 program book, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prologue, 1965: The Jobs family garage, Los Altos'''

Paul Jobs presents his son Steve with a workbench as a birthday present.

'''2007: Convention center, San Francisco'''

Steve Jobs delivers a public launch of his company's new product—"one device" that will revolutionize technology. At the end, he stops, noticeably weak and short of breath.

'''2007, directly after: Corporate offices, Cupertino'''

Steve retreats to his office. His wife, Laurene, chides him for not taking better care of himself and asks him to come home and reconnect with their family.

'''2007, later that afternoon: The hills around Cupertino'''

Steve goes on a long meditative walk. Kōbun Chino Otogawa, Steve's former spiritual advisor in Sōtō Zen Buddhism, joins him. As they gaze at the sunset, Kōbun prompts Steve to acknowledge his mortality.

'''1973: Reed College, Oregon'''

A teacher discusses the significance of the ensō, a circle drawn in Japanese calligraphy. Steve is inspired by aesthetic ideas of elegance and simplicity.

'''1973: The Jobs family garage'''

Steve's best friend, Steve Wozniak, has created a "blue box," a device that allows the user to make free calls. Steve and “Woz” celebrate the ease with which corporate giants can be toppled.

'''1974: An apple orchard near Los Altos'''

Steve and his girlfriend Chrisann lie together after taking LSD. Steve imagines their surroundings coming to life as an orchestra, playing Bach. The two start to make love when Kōbun interrupts them.

'''1975: Los Altos Zen Center'''

Kōbun informs Steve that he cannot live at the Zen Center and hints that his destiny may lie elsewhere.

'''1989: Lecture Hall, Stanford University'''

Steve meets Laurene Powell for the first time.

'''1976: Jobs family garage'''

Woz presents a new computer interface to Steve. They begin to celebrate when Chrisann arrives and tells Steve that she is pregnant. When Steve demands that Chrisann end the pregnancy, she leaves in tears. Steve and Woz dream about the future of their invention. Steve remembers the orchestra in the orchard playing Bach.

'''1989: Steve Jobs' home, Palo Alto'''

Steve shows Laurene his sparsely furnished home. Photographs by Ansel Adams in Steve’s home prompt a brief discussion about artistic inspiration. Laurene and Steve go to bed for the first time.

'''1980: Corporate offices, Cupertino'''

Steve severs ties with Chrisann and angers Woz by denying a fellow employee his pension. Chrisann and Woz lament the loss of the guy they once knew.

'''1981–1986: Corporate offices, Cupertino'''

Steve denies palimony to Chrisann for their child, Lisa, and offends Woz, who quits. Demoted by the board of directors, Steve bitterly leaves the company.

'''2007: The hills around Cupertino'''

Kōbun reminds Steve that it was necessary for him to learn from his mistakes. He shows Steve a brief replay of his life after he fell apart, revisiting the first meeting with Laurene and the evening when he fell in love with her.

'''2007, later that night: Steve Jobs' home'''

Steve returns home after his walk to find Laurene waiting for him. She confronts Steve and gets him to accept his illness and mortality. Kōbun reminds Steve of his wedding day.

'''1991: Yosemite National Park'''

Kōbun marries Steve and Laurene in a Buddhist ceremony. Steve expresses his love for Laurene and his gratitude to her for teaching him about the value of human connection. Kōbun’s 1992 death is revealed, prompting a meditation on mortality that segues into the next scene.

'''2011: Stanford University Chapel'''

Kōbun explains that Steve is witnessing his own memorial service. Steve protests a few production elements of the service, but Kōbun tells him to be still, to simplify. Laurene and Woz muse about Steve. Finally, Laurene is left alone and observes that while Steve will be both lionized and demonized, no one can deny his influence on the world.

'''Epilogue, 1965: Jobs family garage'''

As Laurene looks on, Paul Jobs presents his son with a workbench on his birthday as "a fine place to start."

Nana Patekar's acting as Rakesh Maria was appreciated. ''[[First Post (India)|First Post]]'' wrote in their review— "Nana holds the film together. He feels every line that he utters. His heart bleeds for each one of the 166 people who died on that night. When he tells Kasab in a choked voice, "I have a son of your age", Nana isn’t faking it. His performance goes way beyond acting."&lt;ref name="First Post review"&gt;{{cite news|title=First Post review|url=http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/movie-review-rgvs-the-attacks-of-2611-recreates-mumbais-horrific-night-644934.html|accessdate=18 May 2013|newspaper=First Post (India)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tiversk''' or '''Tiurinlinna''' ({{lang-fi|Tiurinlinna}}, {{lang-ru|Тиверск or Тиверский городок}}) is a site of ancient [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Karelian]] settlement&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Karelia|last=Uino|first=Pirjo|publisher=Suomen muinaismuistoyhdistyksen aikakausikirja 104|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=297–298|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ruined fortification near [[Melnikovo, Leningrad Oblast|Melnikovo]] (''Räisälä'' in Finnish) in the [[Karelian Isthmus]]. The fortification has been in use in different stages in history and it has also been described as a village.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The site used to be an island of the [[River Vuoksi]], which became a peninsula after 1857, near [[rapids]].&lt;ref name="lapshin"&gt;Лапшин В. А. Археологическая карта Ленинградской области. Часть 2. Санкт-Петербург:  Изд. СПбГУ, 1995. pp. 165–167. {{ISBN|5-87403-052-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is approximately {{convert|240|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The oldest findings indicating settlement on the site are dated between 500BC–300AD. Several researchers have come to the conclusion that the site served as a fortification in the 11th century and possibly even earlier. [[Anatoly Kirpichnikov]] asserts that the fortification was founded in the late 1330s. Archaeologists have found stone foundations of 19 buildings which varied in size between {{convert|4|by|5|m|ft|abbr=off}} and {{convert|8|by|7|m|ft||abbr=off}}. There has also been one much larger building with a floor area of {{convert|300|m2|ft2|abbr=off}} and a hearth in the middle of the building.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Treaty of Nöteborg]] established a Novgorodian-Swedish border in the immediate vicinity and left the fort on the Novgorodian side. Kirpichnikov believes that [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Karelian]] [[Vallittu]] who ruled the [[Korela Fortress]] started building Tiversk after the treaty. The fort is mentioned for the first time in the [[Nikon Chronicle]] in 1404 when the settlement was granted to Prince [[Yury of Smolensk]] as an [[appanage]]. Seven years later, the fort was sacked and destroyed by the Swedes during one of the [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars]].

The site of Tiversk was first identified and described by [[Jacob Groot]] in 1847. The remnants were excavated in 1888–1891 by [[Hjalmar Appelgren]], [[Theodor Schwindt]] and [[Alfred Hackman]],&lt;ref&gt;Appelgren, Hjalmar. Suomen muinaislinnat. ''Suomen Muinaismuistoyhdistyksen Aikakauskirja'' XII. Helsinki, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwindt, Theodor. Tietoja Karjalan rautakaudesta. ''Suomen Muinaismuistoyhdistyksen Aikakauskirja'' XIII. Helsinki, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1971 by [[Anatoly Kirpichnikov]], and in 1971–1974 by Svetlana Kochkurkina. Most remnants are dated the end of the 13th to the beginning of the 15th centuries. In 1890, archaeological works revealed a treasure trove of 13th–15th century Arabic silver coins. Some remnants dated 10th–early 12th century have also been discovered.&lt;ref name="lapshin"/&gt; The ramparts and stone walls of the settlement were {{convert|4.5|to|7|m|ft|abbr=off}} thick.&lt;ref name="lapshin"/&gt;

==Production==
''Too Close to the Sun'' began previews at the [[Comedy Theatre]] in the  [[West End Theatre|West End]] on 16 July 2009 and officially opened on 24 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/events/event_detail/17800 "''Too Close to the Sun'' Listing Detail,"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} playbill.com, 24 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It received uniformly unfavourable reviews and closed on 8 August, bringing its planned eight-week run to an end six weeks early.&lt;ref&gt;Baracaia, Alexa.

He was replaced by [[Christopher Howell]] who performed all of the remaining performances.&lt;ref name=Paddock /&gt; Sets and costumes were designed by Christopher Woods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambassadortickets.com/1287/667/London/Comedy-Theatre/Too-Close-To-The-Sun "''Too Close To The Sun'' Production Information and Cast List"], ambassadortickets.com, accessed 14 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In the summer of 1961 on the Hemingway ranch in [[Ketchum, Idaho]], Hemingway's young secretary, Louella, is plotting to become his fifth wife and heir to his estate. Rex De Havilland, an old friend of the author and now a struggling Hollywood producer, arrives to secure the film rights to Hemingway's life.  Anxious to achieve his goal by any means possible, he tries to convince Hemingway's wife Mary the project will give the ailing writer a new lease on life.  Hemingway, however, fails to succumb to the charms of either Louella or Rex, and he banishes both from his home before committing suicide with a shot to his head.

==Critical response==
The musical received unanimously unfavourable reviews. Dominic Maxwell of ''[[The Times]]'' rated it one out of five stars, calling it "pretty dire" and "such a muted, muddled experience, such a waste of time and talent, that there's not really much to snigger about." He described the score as "banal, borrowed and clumsy."&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Dominic. [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article6727260.ece "Too Close to the Sun, at the Comedy Theatre, SW1",] ''The Times'', 25 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] also rated the "implausible and unnecessary musical" one out of five stars and cited "the instantly forgettable two dozen numbers by John Robinson that fatally clog the action."&lt;ref&gt;Billington, Michael. [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/25/too-close-to-the-sun-review ''Too Close to the Sun'' review,] ''The Guardian'', 25 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Rhoda Koenig of ''[[The Independent]]'' similarly rated it one star, writing: "Robinson's trite music pootles about aimlessly and tunelessly, and the lyrics (a Robinson-Trippini collaboration) eschew rhyme as well as reason." In closing, she observed, "Trippini complained some years ago that West End musicals were based on 'formulas which have proved capable of attracting a steady flow of ... customers.' There seems little danger of anyone taking ''Too Close to the Sun'' for one of these."&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, Rhoda.

Dowell gave it a no-star rating.&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, Ben.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3578">The '''United States Road Racing Championship''' (USRRC) was created by the [[Sports Car Club of America]] in 1962.  It was the first SCCA series for professional racing drivers.  SCCA Executive Director John Bishop helped to create the series to recover races that had been taken by rival [[USAC Road Racing Championship]], a championship that folded after the 1962 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gousseau|first=Alexis|title=A tribute to John Bishop|url=http://alex62.typepad.com/imsablog/2006/04/a_tribute_to_jo.html|work=IMSAblog|accessdate=29 May 2010|date=23 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For its first three seasons, the series featured both open-topped sports cars and GT cars.  [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]] and [[Porsche]] dominated the Over- and Under-2 Liter classes, respectively.  The USRRC ran from 1963 until 1968 when it was abandoned in favor of the more successful [[Can-Am]] series, which was also run by the SCCA.

In 1998 the USRRC name was revived by the SCCA as an alternative to the [[IMSA GT Championship]], and revived the Can-Am name for its top class.  For [[1999 United States Road Racing Championship|1999]] the series reached an agreement with the [[FIA Sportscar Championship|International Sports Racing Series]] in Europe, in which the two series would share the same rules for prototypes.  Entries for the series were sparse, and the final two rounds were cancelled.  At the end of 1999 the series was taken over by the new [[Grand American Road Racing Association]] (GARRA), and the championship was reborn as the Grand American Road Racing Championship, known as the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]. In 2014 the [[Grand American Road Racing Association]] and [[American Le Mans Series]] merged to form the [[TUDOR United SportsCar Championship]]

'''''Utagaki''''' (歌垣), also read ''kagai'' (嬥歌), was an ancient Japanese ritual peasant gathering. Villagers would sing and dance on the way up to a mountaintop, where singing, dancing, eating, and the reciting of poetry would occur, in celebration of the beginning of spring or autumn. Closely associated with harvest rites, and therefore fertility, these events often also led into much free sexual activity.

Originating prior to the [[Nara period]], the practice of ''utagaki'' reached its height during that period (710-794). Many of the songs and poems, as well as accounts of the ritual itself, are recorded in the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' and other contemporary documents, making them among the oldest forms of literature in Japan.

The '''Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival''' is an [[Fringe theatre|alternative theatre festival]] held each year for twelve days in July in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada. The 28th festival ran July 13–24, 2016 and the 2017 festival ran from July 19–30.&lt;ref&gt;Winnipeg fringe festival sets attendance record, Winnipeg Free Press, July 29, 2015, p. C2&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 festival indoor attendance was 108,706, which was up from 104,859 in 2014. For the 10th straight year ticket sales were higher than the year before. Ticket sales were 101,488 in 2013 and 100,621 in 2012. The 2015 total was helped by 237 sellouts. Total ticket revenue was $800,142,&lt;ref&gt;Winnipeg fringe festival sets attendance record, Winnipeg Free Press, July 29, 2015, p. C2&lt;/ref&gt; up from $761,522 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/special/fringe/fringe-fest-sets-new-record-268991471.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, there were 169 companies and a total of 1,410 performances, which brought in $705,553.75 in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/arts/fringe-festival-sets-daily-overall-attendance-records-217546221.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 festival was the 25th anniversary festival. That year 100,621 tickets were sold up from 87,851 in 2011. The 2012 festival saw 175 sellouts and $686,188 in box office revenue. There were 172 companies performing at 32 venues and supported by 913 volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/special/fringe/25th-anniversary-edition-was-biggest-fringe-ever-164387916.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the 24th Winnipeg Fringe Festival had 150 companies performing at 24 venues with a total of 86,717 tickets sold for a total box office revenue of $600,698.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/arts/building-a-bigger-big-top-125471743.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==The History==

Founded in 1988 by the [[Manitoba Theatre Centre]] with [[Rick McNair]] as the first Executive Director, the festival has three key principles: 1. Festival is non-juried; 2. Artists have freedom to present whatever they want on stage; and 3. 100% of the box office goes directly to the artists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfringe.com/About-Us-Contact-%281%29.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first year ticket sales were 14,000 across nine days of performances. That figure was 26,000 in 1989 - year two of the festival. It climbed to 44,709 in 1999 and was over 60,000 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/special/fringe/the--festival--that---could-162833946.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Chuck McEwen, former director of the [[Toronto Fringe Festival]], is the current executive producer, and has been in charge since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Martin, "[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/story/4201486p-4793358c.html We asked ... Chuck McEwen]", ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'', 20 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival's venues are centred in  Winnipeg's historic [[Exchange District]] with the Old Market Square serving as the outdoor stage location. But as the festival has grown there are venues outside that district but still close to Winnipeg's downtown.

The Winnipeg Fringe Festival is modelled on the [[Edmonton Fringe Festival]] and provides several venues for performing companies, but some companies arrange their own venues, which is more like what occurs at the  [[Edinburgh Fringe]] festival. Regardless, all venues have paid technicians and volunteer ticket sellers and ushers.

The performing companies at the festival are both local and from across Canada and around the world. For example, the 2005 festival featured performers from [[France]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and [[South Africa]] as well as across [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].

[[File:Manitoba Theatre Centre (July 2006).jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Manitoba Theatre Centre]], 2006. During the Fringe, the front façade of the theatre is covered in hundreds of handbills and posters for various plays.]]Paid attendance briefly set a record high for North America in 2009 with 81,565 tickets sold,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://winnipegfringe.com The Fringe Factory cranks out record attendance!]", 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; surpassing the then previous record of 77,700 set at the 2006 Edmonton Fringe. However, the Edmonton Fringe festival currently holds the North American record for 2011 with 104,142 tickets sold.

==Annual theme==

The festival has a different theme each year. The theme in 2015 was "We're all &lt;blank&gt; here," where the blank was filled in variously. On the program, it was "mad," but on the website for Volunteers it was "friends." In 2014, "We like when you watch" was the theme. The Big Top was the theme in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/arts/building-a-bigger-big-top-125471743.html&lt;/ref&gt; and other previous themes have been the F word, meaning "fringe," and James Bond.  In 2012 there was no theme, as that was the 25th anniversary edition of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/special/fringe/the--festival--that---could-162833946.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harry S. Rintoul Memorial Award==

The Harry S. Rintoul Memorial Award was established by the Manitoba Association of Playwrights to recognize the best play written by a Manitoban and performed at the festival. The award was named in memory of [[Harry Rintoul]], a noted playwright from Winnipeg who died in 2002.
