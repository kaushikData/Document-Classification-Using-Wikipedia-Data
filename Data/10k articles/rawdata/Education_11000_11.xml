'''A Human Right''' is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free basic internet and phone access to developing countries, and to citizens of countries whose government has cut off or restricted internet access.&lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/free-internet-for-all.html|title=Free Internet For All|last=Staedter|first=Tracy|date=2 September 2011|work=Discovery News|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buy This Satellite==

In December 2010 they launched '''Buy This Satellite''', a fundraising effort to purchase the [[TerreStar-1]] communications satellite, after its owner, [[TerreStar Corporation]], filed for bankruptcy. The idea to purchase the satellite developed out of a meeting in [[Berlin]] of thirty people under the age of thirty, described by A Human Right's founder, [[Kosta Grammatis]], as a "do tank" (as opposed to a [[think tank]]). A Human Right hopes that providing internet access to impoverished regions of the world would help to solve many of their problems, such as shortages of food, [[Drinking water|potable water]], and health care. Grammatis believes that, "People are ingenious. If you give people access to information, they can solve their own problems."&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/buy-satellite-bring-web-access-developing-world/story?id=12298086&amp;page=1|title=Satellite for Sale: Buy It, Bring Web to Developing World|last=Heussner|first=Ki Mae|date=12 March 2010|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet and phone access to citizens of countries whose government has shut down all communications is another benefit proposed by A Human Right. This was inspired by the [[2011 Egyptian protests]], where the government shut down internet and phone access to its citizens.&lt;ref name="Time1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2045428,00.html |title=As Egypt Shuts Down the Internet, One Group Wants Online Access for All |last=Fields |first=Jim |date=31 January 2011 |work=Time Magazine |publisher=Time, Inc. |accessdate=11 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201052339/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0%2C8599%2C2045428%2C00.html |archivedate=1 February 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/02/02/looking-to-aid-egyptians-perhaps-you-want-to-buy-this-satellite/|title=Looking to Aid Egyptians?

The goal of A Human Right is to have a satellite in geo-synchronous orbit over Africa, which would provide free internet access to African nations.&lt;ref name="Time1" /&gt; A Human Right intends to pay for the operation of the satellite through buying and reselling high-speed bandwidth while providing low-bandwidth internet for free. They are also working on developing an open-source, low-cost modem as part of providing internet access to those who can't currently pay for it.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2010/1222/One-man-s-plan-for-free-Internet-for-the-world-via-satellite|title=One man's plan for free Internet for the world, via satellite|last=Hsu|first=Jeremy|date=22 December 2010|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=11 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110119225912/http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2010/1222/One-man-s-plan-for-free-Internet-for-the-world-via-satellite| archivedate= 19 January 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move This Cable==

[[SAex]] (South Atlantic Express) is a proposed submarine communications cable that will link South Africa and [[Angola]] to [[Brazil]], with onward connectivity to the United States. The cable route, as originally planned, was to narrowly miss the remote island of [[St. Helena|Saint Helena]], a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]].

The project was successful and in mid-2012 the cable's path was changed.

'''Anna Margaret Ross Alexander''' (1913–1995) was a philanthropist, who organized the first mental health fund drive in Marion County, Indiana. She was elected to the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners in 1966 during the desegregation and integration period. Under her administration as president in 1970, Indianapolis developed their desegregation plan. She was honored as Woman of the Year in 1970 by [[Theta Sigma Phi]] for her service in implementing integration and for being the only woman to have served on the board. She also served on the Tax Review Board and Historic Landmarks Foundation. She had a lifelong commitment to education and has had numerous awards named in her honor.

==Biography==
Anna Margaret Ross was born in November, 1913 in [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], [[Tippecanoe County, Indiana]] to Linn Carnahan Ross and Gladys Gould Ross. She attended Jefferson High School in Lafayette before earning her Bachelor of Science at [[Purdue University]] in 1935. That same year on 14 August 1935, she married John Arthur Alexander.&lt;ref name="Find A Grave (1995)"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lafayette Journal &amp; Courier|title=Anna Margaret Ross Alexander|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/49878771|website=Find A Grave|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=19 February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two met at Purdue and her husband became an attorney with Krieg, DeVault, Alexander, and Capehart in [[Indianapolis]]. The couple made their home in Indianapolis and had two sons.&lt;ref name=Purdue&gt;{{cite web|title=Anna Margaret Ross Alexander Papers, 1955-1994|url=https://www.ulib.iupui.edu/special/collections/philanthropy/mss014#speecheslist|website=Indiana University Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis|publisher=Ruth Lilly Special Collections and Archives|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Alexander organized the first mental health fund drive in [[Marion County, Indiana]] and spent six years on the Marion County Mental Health Board.&lt;ref name="Find A Grave (1995)" /&gt; She was concerned about reading levels and became involved in the school system, joining the Parent Teacher’s Associations of PS #80 and Broad Ripple High School. She was elected to the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners in 1966 and served until 1970. Her final year, she was president.&lt;ref name=Purdue /&gt;&lt;ref name="Attucks-Shortridge Phaseout"&gt;{{cite news|title=Attucks-Shortridge Phaseout Plans Made|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2205001/attucksshortridge_phaseout_plans_made/|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=UPI|publisher=Anderson Herald|date=28 January 1970|location=Andersonville, Indiana|page=9|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}  {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the period when Indianapolis’s public schools were desegregated, the teaching staff was integrated, and public busing began. Multiple lawsuits were filed and the school commissioners implemented the federal desegregation programs.&lt;ref name="Burns v. Board (1969)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Burns v. Board Of School Com'rs Of City Indianapolis|url=http://in.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19690605_0000001.SIN.htm/qx|website=Find a Case|publisher=United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=June 5, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final plan which was adopted, involved phasing out the two mostly black high schools and redirecting the elementary graduates to other high schools. Crispus Attucks High School would close after 3 years and Shortridge High School would be turned into a Community College. Alexander confirmed that the plan, while addressing the lawsuit mandate, had been developed independently from the federal recommendations by the board over several months with consultations from citizens and the schools.&lt;ref name="Attucks-Shortridge Phaseout" /&gt; Also during Alexander's tenure, hot lunches were implemented in all elementary schools in the school district and instructional TV was begun.&lt;ref name=Purdue /&gt; She was honored at a banquet attended by the governor as the Theta Sigma Phi Woman of the Year in 1970 for her service as the only woman on the Indianapolis School Board.&lt;ref name="Woman of the Year"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Richard M.

Alexander served on the Marion County Tax Review Board for three years in the early 1970s and served for nineteen years on the state's Historic Landmarks Foundation.&lt;ref name="Find A Grave (1995)" /&gt; Other organizations that Alexander was involved with included [[The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis]], [[Indiana Landmarks]], Indiana State Symphony Society, [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], Mother’s [[March of Dimes]] for Polio, and St. Paul’s Episcopal Church.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Margaret Ross Alexander Papers, 1955–1994, Ruth Lilly Special Collections and Archives, University Library, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander also was a long-term volunteer and donor at the Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, which gives out annual honors to volunteers, “Help &amp; Hope Hero Awards,” named in her honor.&lt;ref name=Rigg&gt;{{cite web|title=100th Anniversary Help &amp; Hope Breakfast|url=http://www.maryrigg.org/whats_new.php?id=50|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assistive technology in sport''' is an area of technology design that is growing. Assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play. Assistive technology may be used in [[disabled sports]], where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.

An increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new assistive technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|pages=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive technology devices can be simple, "low-tech", or they may use highly advanced technology, with some even using computers. Assistive technology for sports may also be simple or advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technologies|url=http://www.understandingdisability.org/AssistiveTechnologies|publisher=Spaulding Framingham|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to elite Paralympic games. More complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time, and as a result, sports for people with disabilities "have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|pages=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistive devices==
Assistive devices can enable exercise and training, on top of enabling participation in a sport. Below are some of the assistive devices currently available for different impairments:

* Mobility impairments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illness and Disability: Gear for sports and fitness |url=http://www.girlshealth.gov/disability/disbody/assist.cfm |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916081925/http://www.girlshealth.gov/disability/disbody/assist.cfm |archivedate=September 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technologies|url=http://www.understandingdisability.org/AssistiveTechnologies|publisher=Spaulding Framingham|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technology 101 |url=http://www.fctd.info/factsheet/at101 |publisher=The Family Center on Technology and Disability |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917140937/http://www.fctd.info/factsheet/at101 |archivedate=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Light-weight wheelchairs for basketball, tennis, and racing
** All-terrain wheelchairs with rugged frames and wheels for rolling over unpaved surfaces, like hiking trails, snow, or beach sand
** [[Handcycle]]s, or [[recumbent bicycle]]s, which are like bicycles with pedals and steering using only the rider's arms
** Cross-country sit skis that allow skiers to sit down and push along the trail with tips that dig into the snow
** Weights that users strap onto their wrists rather than having to hold them with the hands

{{div col end}}
Many of the sports listed above have attained international elite sport status, being included in the [[Paralympic Games]].

===Sports requiring assistive technology===
Some sports have developed with the goal of creating a challenge that players with a disability could enjoy. These sports require assistive technology for all players as part of the game. Some examples are: [[Sled hockey|Sledge (sled) hockey]]; [[wheelchair basketball]]; [[adaptive sailing]], with boats designed especially for sailors with disabilities; [[Nordic skiing|Nordic (cross-country) skiing]] with "sit-ski" buckets; and [[handcycle|handcycling]] races.

==Sport wheelchair design==
Sport wheelchairs are designed for the requirements of specific sports. Power chairs can also be fitted with assistive devices that are temporary adaptations to the demands of a sport, such as a kick plate attached to a power chair for [[powerchair football]] (power soccer).

Light-weight frames are a necessity for wheelchairs used in sports requiring sharp, fast turns and overall agility, such as tennis, basketball, and racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technology 101 |url=http://www.fctd.info/factsheet/at101 |publisher=The Family Center on Technology and Disability |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917140937/http://www.fctd.info/factsheet/at101 |archivedate=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairs with reinforced frames and impact protection are required for contact sports, such as [[wheelchair rugby]] or [[wheelchair basketball|basketball]].

Racing chairs are designed with bucket seats, angled wheels for improved stability, and a t-frame with a third wheel in front, allowing precision steering as well as improving balance. The athlete and wheelchair are viewed together by some sport researchers as a unified performance system. Improvements can be made to chairs by evaluating the chair and athlete separately or in performance conditions together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winnick|first=Joseph P.|title=Adapted Physical Education and Sport|year=2010|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736089180|pages=572, 575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Prosthetics==
Prosthetic devices come in a variety of designs suited to different athletic purposes. Prosthetic legs may be designed for rock climbing, running, or jumping. The technology is designed to attain goals such as greater [[gait]] efficiency when running. The technology is constantly improving, to meet the demands of athletes who set ever-higher sports challenges for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|pages=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African athlete [[Oscar Pistorius]], using energy-storing prosthetic legs, fought for the right to run against able-bodied athletes in the 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and won the right to compete, although he did not meet the qualifying time required for the traditional able-bodied competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|pages=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Functional classification==
Functional classification systems are used to evaluate and categorize athletes in elite sports, the classification determines the type and extent of assistive technology use by the athlete.

==Organizations==
Organizations and associations at the national and international level support the development of adaptive sport and recreation, often through the use of assistive technology for players. These organizations are "growing in number and scope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wendt|first=Oliver|title=Assistive Technology: Principles and Applications for Communication Disorders and Special Education|year=2011|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=9781780522944|pages=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother''''' is a book by American author and lawyer [[Amy Chua]] that was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Terry Hong, Special to The Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/08/RVAE1H3BSG.DTL |title=San Francisco Chronicle review of Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=January 9, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121045144/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2011%2F01%2F08%2FRVAE1H3BSG.DTL |archivedate=21 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author= Elizabeth Chang |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/07/AR2011010702516.html |title = Amy Chua's ''Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother'', on Chinese-American family culture | work =Washington Post |date = January 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly popularized the concept and term "[[tiger mother]]" while also becoming the inspiration{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} for the 2014-2015 Singaporean TV show ''[[Tiger Mum]],'' the 2015 mainland Chinese drama ''[[Tiger Mom (TV series)|Tiger Mom]],'' and the 2017 Hong Kong series ''[[Tiger Mom Blues]].''

==Summary==
The complete blurb of the book reads: "This is a story about a mother and two daughters. This was ''supposed'' to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones. But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures and a fleeting taste of glory."&lt;ref name="battle-hymn"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://amychua.com/ |title=Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother | isbn = 978-1-59420-284-1  |publisher=Penguin Press Hard Cover |date= January 11, 2011 | first = Amy | last = Chua | authorlink = Amy Chua |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published under the headline "Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior" in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' on January 8, 2011, contained excerpts from her book, in which Chua describes her efforts to give her children what she describes as a traditional, strict "Chinese" upbringing.&lt;ref name="wsj-jan-8-2011"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This piece was controversial. Many readers missed the supposed irony and self-deprecating humor in the title and the piece itself and instead believed that Chua was advocating the "superiority" of a particular, very strict, ethnically defined approach to [[parenting]]. In fact, Chua has stated that the book was not a "how-to" manual but a self-mocking memoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/fashion/16Cultural.html | title = Retreat of the 'Tiger Mother' | first = Kate | last = Zernike | date = January 14, 2011 | accessdate = December 25, 2011 | quote = "... ironic and self-mocking ... Here's what I did, and boy did I learn a lesson." | work= New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204791104577110870328419222 | title = Tiger Mom's Long-Distance Cub | work = The Wall Street Journal | first=Amy | last=Chua | date=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Chua defines "Chinese mother" loosely to include parents of other ethnicities who practice traditional, strict child-rearing, while also acknowledging that "Western parents come in all varieties", and not all ethnically Chinese parents practice strict child-rearing.&lt;ref name="battle-hymn" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

Chua also reported that in one study of 48 Chinese immigrant mothers, the vast majority "said that they believe their children can be 'the best' students, that 'academic achievement reflects successful parenting', and that if children did not excel at school then there was 'a problem' and parents 'were not doing their job'". Chua contrasts them with the view she labels "Western"{{spaced ndash}}that a child's [[self-esteem]] is paramount.&lt;ref name="wsj-jan-8-2011"/&gt;

In one extreme example, Chua mentioned that she had called one of her children "garbage", a translation of a term her own father called her on occasion in her family's native [[Hokkien]] dialect. Particularly controversial was the 'Little White Donkey' anecdote, where Chua described how she got her unwilling younger daughter to learn a very difficult piano piece. In Chua's words, "I hauled Lulu's dollhouse to the car and told her I'd donate it to the [[Salvation Army]] piece by piece if she didn't have '[[The Little White Donkey]]' perfect by the next day. When Lulu said, 'I thought you were going to the Salvation Army, why are you still here?' I threatened her with no lunch, no dinner, no Christmas or Hanukkah presents, no birthday parties for two, three, four years. When she still kept playing it wrong, I told her she was purposely working herself into a frenzy because she was secretly afraid she couldn't do it. I told her to stop being lazy, cowardly, self-indulgent and pathetic." They then "work[ed] right through dinner" without letting her daughter "get up, not for water, not even for bathroom breaks". The anecdote concludes by describing how her daughter was "beaming" after she finally mastered the piece and "wanted to play [it] over and over".&lt;ref name="battle-hymn"/&gt;{{rp|62}}&lt;ref name="wsj-jan-8-2011"/&gt;

Chua uses the term "[[Tiger Mother]]" to describe a mother who is a strict disciplinarian.

==Reviews==

The ''Wall Street Journal'' article generated a huge response, both positive and negative.&lt;ref name="wsj-jan-8-2011"/&gt; [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]] argued that "large numbers of talented children everywhere would profit from Chua's approach, and instead are frittering away their gifts—they're nice kids, not brats, but they are also self-indulgent and inclined to make excuses for themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Charles |url=http://blog.american.com/?p=24765 |title=Amy Chua Bludgeons Entire Generation of Sensitive Parents, Bless Her " The Enterprise Blog |publisher=Blog.american.com |date=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115042551/http://blog.american.com/?p=24765 |archive-date=2011-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a poll on the ''Wall Street Journal'' website regarding Chua's response to readers, two-thirds of respondents voted that the "Demanding Eastern" parenting model is better than the "Permissive Western" model.&lt;ref name="wsj-jan-13-2011"/&gt; Allison Pearson wondered the following in [[The Daily Telegraph]]: "Amy Chua's philosophy of child-rearing may be harsh and not for the fainthearted, but ask yourself this: is it really more cruel than the laissez-faire indifference and babysitting-by-TV which too often passes for parenting these days?"&lt;ref name="Allison_Pearson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearson |first=Allison |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/8255804/Why-we-all-need-a-Tiger-Mother.html |title=Why we all need a Tiger Mother |publisher=Telegraph |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110120111219/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/8255804/Why-we-all-need-a-Tiger-Mother.html| archivedate= 20 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annie Paul, writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', describes, "[i]n the 2008 book ''A Nation of Wimps'', author Hara Estroff Marano, editor-at-large of ''Psychology Today'' magazine, marshals evidence supporting Chua's approach: "Research demonstrates that children who are protected from grappling with difficult tasks don't develop what psychologists call 'mastery experiences'...Kids who have this well-earned sense of mastery are more optimistic and decisive; they've learned that they're capable of overcoming adversity and achieving goals".&lt;ref name="Annie_Murphy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy |first=Annie |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2043313-3,00.html |title=Tiger Mom: Amy Chua Parenting Memoir Raises American Fears |publisher=TIME |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Hulbert of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' remarked on Chua's "shocking honesty about tactics. She has written the kind of exposé usually staged later by former prodigies themselves...[Chua] is a tiger who roars rather than purrs. That's because no child, she points out, naturally clamors for the 'tenacious practice, practice, practice' that mastery demands."&lt;ref name="Ann_Hulbert"&gt;{{cite news | last=Hulbert |first=Ann |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2280712/pagenum/all/#p2 |title=Amy Chua's Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother: Her new book will make readers gasp |publisher= Slate Magazine |date=January 11, 2011 |accessdate= January 28, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110119050521/http://www.slate.com/id/2280712/pagenum/all/| archivedate= 19 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MSNBC]] stated that the article "reads alternately like a how-to guide, a satire or a lament".&lt;ref name="Adrienne_Mong"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mong |first=Adrienne |url=http://behindthewall.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/01/10/5805977-chinese-or-western-who-wins-the-mommy-war- |title=Behind The Wall - Chinese or Western?

In the ''[[Financial Times]]'', Isabel Berwick called the "tiger mother" approach to parenting "the exact opposite of everything that the Western liberal holds dear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2ebc6d28-1f56-11e0-8c1c-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1C0a7foqy |title=Review: Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother | first = Isabel |last = Berwick |publisher=The Financial Times, Ltd. |journal = Financial Times |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110120080237/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2ebc6d28-1f56-11e0-8c1c-00144feab49a.html| archivedate= 20 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', in an op-ed piece entitled "Amy Chua is a 'Wimp'", wrote that he believed Chua was "coddling her children" because "[m]anaging status rivalries, negotiating [[group dynamics]], understanding [[social norms]], navigating the distinction between self and group—these and other social tests impose cognitive demands that blow away any intense tutoring session or a class at Yale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/opinion/18brooks.html | work= New York Times | first=David | last=Brooks | title=Amy Chua Is a Wimp | date=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'', while not as critical, did suggest that "ending a parenting story when one child is only 15 seems premature".&lt;ref name="Post_Store"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/07/AR2011010702516.html |title=Amy Chua's "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother," on Chinese-American family culture |publisher=Washington Post |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have noted that the ''Wall Street Journal'' article took excerpts only from the beginning of the book, and not from any of the later chapters in which Chua describes her retreat from what she calls "Chinese" parenting. Author [[Amy Gutman]] felt many have missed the point of Chua's book, which she described as "[[coming of age]]", and states the controversial examples shown in the book "reflect where Chua started, not who she is today, and passing judgment on her based on them strikes me as a bit akin to passing judgment on [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' for her churlish behavior to Miss Bates. Like Emma's, Chua's narrative has an arc. It's a coming-of-age story—where the one to come of age is the parent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amy-gutman/tiger-mother-debate_b_810515.html|title=Rousing the Tiger Mother Inside Me|author=[[Amy Gutman]]| work =[[The Huffington Post]]|date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Carroll]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' felt the excerpts in the ''Wall Street Journal'' article failed to represent the content in Chua's book and states that "the excerpt was chosen by the editors of the Journal and the publishers. The editors wanted to make a sensation; the publishers want to sell books" but "it does not tell the whole story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/19/DDNG1HATR0.DTL |title= The Tiger Mother speaks | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |author=[[Jon Carroll]]|date=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokeswoman for the ''Wall Street Journal'' told the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' that "[w]e worked extensively with Amy's publisher, as we always do with book excerpts, and they signed off on the chosen extract in advance".&lt;ref name="chittum"/&gt; Chua maintains that the ''Wall Street Journal'' "basically strung together the most controversial sections of the book. And I had no idea they'd put that kind of a title on it".&lt;ref name="chittum"&gt;{{cite web | last=Chittum | first=Ryan | title= Audit Notes: Financial Capture, Homeless, Amy Chua Criticizes WSJ | url= http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/audit_notes_financial_capture.php | date=January 13, 2011 | work = Columbia Journalism Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2011, the ''Wall Street Journal'' organized an event called "The Return of Tiger Mom" in the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/03/30/tiger-mother-and-family-live-on-stage "Tiger Mother and Family, Live on Stage"], ''WSJ'' Blogs, March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This event discussed different aspects of child-raising, in a more nuanced and sensible manner, compared to controversy which the book had previously provoked. Amy Chua's husband, Jed Rubenfeld, and their two daughters also attended the event. Rubenfeld, who has become known as "Tiger Dad", said that he doesn't see the Tiger Mom education method as a representative of Chinese education, but rather a more traditional old-fashioned style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=262 华裔"虎妈"纽约分享育儿心得 - Chinese descendent 'Tiger Mom' shared her child-raising insights in New-York], [http://www.thinkingchinese.com/ ThinkingChinese.com], April 22nd, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He and Chua expressed a more liberal attitude compared with the ''Wall Street Journal'''s article, while still stressing the importance of discipline in a child's early years.

The book was on ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller list from January 30 to April 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best Sellers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-04-10/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|accessdate=17 April 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chua's defense===
Chua has openly confronted criticism in print and during her [[book signing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IClaudio |url=http://iclaudio2000.blogspot.com/2011/01/amy-chua-aka-tiger-mom-book-tour-review.html |title=I Claudio: Amy Chua aka "Tiger Mom" Book Tour Review |publisher=Iclaudio2000.blogspot.com |date=January 22, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a follow-up article in the ''Wall Street Journal'', Chua explains that "my actual book is not a how-to guide; it's a memoir, the story of our family's journey in two cultures, and my own eventual transformation as a mother. Much of the book is about my decision to retreat from the strict 'Chinese' approach, after my younger daughter rebelled at thirteen".&lt;ref name="wsj-jan-13-2011"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Tiger Mother Responds to Readers | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/01/13/the-tiger-mother-responds-to-readers | work =Wall Street Journal | date=January 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]], Chua addresses why she believes the book has hit such a chord with parents: "We parents, including me, are all so anxious about whether we're doing the right thing. You can never know the results. It's this latent anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5741872/tiger-mom-amy-chua-has-feelings-too |title=Tiger Mom Amy Chua Has Feelings Too | work =Jezebel |date =January 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conversation with ''[[Die Zeit]]'', Chua says about her book: "I would never burn the stuffed animals of my children—that was a hyperbole, an exaggeration. I have intensified many situations to clarify my position". She adds that the book "was therapy for me at the time of a great defeat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Amy Chua:In der Höhle der Tigerin (In the tigeress' den) | url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/11/Tiger-Mom-Amy-Chua | work = Die Zeit | date=March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original English transcript of the interview with Amy Chua is not available. The quote was translated by Die Zeit to German and was then translated back to English by Wikipedia users. For details about various translation options see the discussion page. The quote reads in German as follows: "Niemals würde ich die Stofftiere meiner Kinder verbrennen – das war ein Stilmittel, eine Übertreibung. Ich habe viele Situationen zugespitzt, um meine Position klarzumachen. (...) Es war für mich Therapie im Moment einer großen Niederlage."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction by Chua's daughter Sophia ===
On January 17, 2011, an [[open letter]] from Chua's older daughter, Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld, to her mother was published in the ''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;ref name="nyp-jan-17-2011"&gt;{{cite news | last=Chua-Rubenfeld | first=Sophia | title=Why I love my strict Chinese mom | url=https://nypost.com/2011/01/18/why-i-love-my-strict-chinese-mom | date=January 17, 2011 | work =[[New York Post]] | accessdate=July 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophia's letter defends her parents' child-rearing methods and states that she and her sister were not oppressed by an "evil mother". She discusses some of the incidents that have been criticized as unduly harsh, and explains that they were not as bad as they sound out of context. She ends the letter saying, "If I died tomorrow, I would die feeling I've lived my whole life at 110 percent. And for that, Tiger Mom, thank you."&lt;ref name="nyp-jan-17-2011"/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The term and behavior of the "Tiger Mother" has been satirized in the online anthropomorphic animal comic strip series ''[[Kevin and Kell]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kevinandkell.com/2011/kk0322.html|title=Tuesday Mar, 22 2011 - Kevin &amp; Kell|work=kevinandkell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the recurring characters Mei-Li Lee and her raising methods with her daughter Lin as well as in attitude, although it's been noted that she is not actually a tigress but a [[tabby cat]] who "willed" (assimilated) herself into becoming a tiger through sheer effort, and is married to a tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kevinandkell.com/2011/kk0321.html|title=Monday Mar, 21 2011 - Kevin &amp; Kell|work=kevinandkell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kevinandkell.com/2012/kk1213.html|title=Thursday Dec, 13 2012 - Kevin &amp; Kell|work=kevinandkell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bios for New York's Most Popular Tutors", a humor article by [[Ryan Max Riley]] on [[CollegeHumor]], explicitly satirizes [[Amy Chua]]'s ''Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother''.&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ryan Max |last=Riley |url=http://www.collegehumor.com/article/6920322/tutor-bios/ |title=Bios for New York's Most Popular Tutors |publisher=CollegeHumor |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger mom is described in the article as "the best known teacher", and among many other accomplishments, "her students achieve standardized test scores that range from perfect to perfect with less bruising and blood loss but the same amount of shame".&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt; The "students become so proficient at piano that they can embed hidden SOS messages in songs during concert performances".&lt;ref name="Riley" /&gt;

===Neologism===
The term ''tiger mom'' or ''tiger mother'' has been used as a [[neologism]] used to describe a tough, disciplinarian mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2043477,00.html | title=Tiger Moms: Is Tough Parenting Really the Answer? | work=[[Time Magazine]] | date=Jan 20, 2011 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | author=Paul, Annie Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the way [[Amy Chua]] describes bringing up her children in the strict, traditional Chinese way.&lt;ref name="wsj-jan-8-2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allison_Pearson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Annie_Murphy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ann_Hulbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adrienne_Mong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Post_Store" /&gt;

===Public reference by David Cameron===
In a speech in January 2016, British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] praised "tiger mums" as he laid out his strategy for tackling child poverty in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coates|first1=Sam|title=All children should have 'tiger mums' - Cameron|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4662945.ece|website=The Times|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech he stated, "No matter how clever you are, if you do not believe in continued hard work and concentration, and if you do not believe that you can return from failure, you will not fulfill your potential. It is what the Tiger Mothers' battle hymn is all about: work, try hard, believe you can succeed, get up and try again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/lifestyle-opinion/parenting-isnt-being-tiger-mum-10728816 | title=Why parenting isn't about being a Tiger Mum, Mr Cameron | publisher=Wales Online | date=16 January 2016 | accessdate=26 March 2016 | author=Mainwaring, Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister also criticized schools that have a culture where all children are rewarded prizes and insisted that "children thrive on high expectations."&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

Freud worked with [[John Malkovich]] in 1999 to produce three short films in forty-eight hours to document her fashion collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=How We Met: John Malkovich &amp; Bella Freud | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/sunday-review/regulars/how-we-met-john-malkovich--bella-freud-789145.html  | accessdate=2008-12-07 | date=2 March 2008 | work=[[The Independent]] | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081201065606/http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/sunday-review/regulars/how-we-met-john-malkovich--bella-freud-789145.html| archivedate= 1 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an appearance on the [[BBC]] current affairs program ''[[Newsnight]]'' on 2 August 2006, she voiced an impassioned denunciation of Israel's "disproportionately violent aggression" in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Middle East debates  | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/5254030.stm#freud | date=2 August 2006 | accessdate=2008-12-07 | work=[[BBC News]] | first=Bella | last=Freud}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bella Freud has contributed to the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' free magazine ''Stella'', with a column called "''Bella on Beauty''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This look really has legs |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/stellamagazine/3357230/This-look-really-has-legs.html |accessdate=2008-12-07 |author=Justine Picardie |date=4 October 2006 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She recently partook in a fashion shoot with the closest of Vivienne Westwood's friends and clientele, in which Freud was dressed in a gold boiler suit complete with pipe and hat.

In 2007, Freud launched her own knitwear collection. To illustrate her work she collaborated with Elle Muliarchyk, a model and artist who was called "Guerrilla Model" by [[The New York Times]]. On her travels around the world Elle Muliarchyk created imaginary film stills by photographing herself wearing Freud's designs, only at nights, at often dangerous locations. These images, called ''Journey to the End of the Night'', were exhibited during London's [[Frieze Art Fair]] in 2007.

Freud's recent collection was featured in The New York Times Exclusive Short "The Last Poet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Elle Muliarchyk| url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2010/02/26/t-magazine/1247467197597/t-exclusive-elle-muliarchyk.html | work=The New York Times | first=Sylvia | last=Rupani-Smith | date=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bella Ratchinskaia''' (born in Vorkuta (Russia) on 22.11.1953) is a classical [[ballet]] [[choreographer]] and maÎtre de ballet. She attended and graduated with honours at the State Academy of Ballet in Perm. After her studies, she joined the USSR "All-Union Contest" for young dancers and moved to Leningrad (San Petersburg) where she started a classical dance career at the [[Theatre]]. In 1972  she began to work as a principal dancer in the company "Choreographical Miniatures" directed by [[Leonid Yakobson]],  she performed all roles of the classical  repertory and Yakobson's own choreographical creations. She enjoyed critical acclaim during  international tours for her interpretation of these roles.

In the same year she began the renowned Teachers course at The Vaganova Ballet Academy. After graduation with honours and receiving the official title of Pedagogue for Classical, Historical, Character Ballet and Repertoire she began teaching at the Vaganova Academy. During the years while working in the  [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet]], another important field of activity was a close collaboration with the Ministry of Culture of Mongolia, developing educational methods for the training of [[classical ballet]] for both students and teachers. Her professional  success, was rewarded, in 1989, with the 'Honorary Board and Symbol of Ministry of Culture' of the USSR and Mongolia.

Together with Giuseppe Carbone (director of the La Scala ballet company ),  she started  "MaÎtre de ballet education course" with the objective of giving classical dancers ending their stage-career, a professional teaching qualification.

In the second half of the '90s, she actively collaborated with theatres and international companies as a training and rehearsal maÎtre for classical ballet also staging her own choreographic productions; in 1996 she produced " Ballet Class" for Sarasota Ballet Company  (Florida, USA) directed by [[Robert de Warren]].

In the same year she worked on "Sleeping Beauty" Ballet for the Hungarian State Opera (ballet company directed by Gyula Harangozo ).

In 2002 and 2003 respectively, she cooperated and created choreographies for the "Nacht des Ballets" Gala and  "[[Fanny Elssler]]" Gala (Eisenstadt, Austria), in the same year she worked as guest at the Dutch National Ballet Company (Amsterdam, Nederlands).

Between 2004 and 2011 she renewed her professional collaboration in Italy;  initially with the Opera and Ballet Academy of Rome  (respectively under the direction of Carla Fracci and Paola Jorio)  and then with the Ballet Academy "La Scala" in Milan. She was always ready for opportunities to choreograph classical and demi-charactére creations, and in 2007, for the Ballet Academy of Rome Opera, she  produced a ballet using the Russian folklore music the "Balaljka Magica", and in the next year on Giuseppe Verdi's music "Vespri Siciliani" a ballet called  "Colombine and Pulcinella".

'''Boaz Tsaban''' (born February 1973) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] mathematician on the faculty of [[Bar-Ilan University]]. His research interests include [[selection principle]]s within set theory and [[non-commutative cryptography|nonabelian cryptology]], within mathematical cryptology.

==Biography==
Boaz Tsaban grew up in [[Or Yehuda]], a city near Tel Aviv. At the age of 16 he was selected with other high school students to attend the first cycle of a [[Or Yehuda#Education|special preparation program]] in mathematics, at Bar-Ilan University, being admitted to regular mathematics courses at the University a year later. He completed his B.Sc., M.Sc. and [[Ph.D.]]&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=74323}}&lt;/ref&gt; degrees with highest distinctions. 
Two years as a post-doctoral fellow at [[Hebrew University]] were followed by a three-year Koshland Fellowship at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] before he joined the Department of Mathematics, Bar-Ilan University in 2007.

==Academic career==
In the field of selection principles, Tsaban devised the method of omission of intervals
&lt;ref&gt;Boaz Tsaban (2011), 'Menger's and Hurewicz's Problems: Solutions from "The Book"  and refinements', in "Set Theory and its Applications" Contemporary Mathematics 533, 211–226. https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5645&lt;/ref&gt; for establishing covering properties of sets of real numbers that have certain combinatorial structures. In nonabelian cryptology he devised the algebraic span method
&lt;ref&gt;Boaz Tsaban (2015), "Polynomial-time solutions of computational problems in noncommutative-algebraic cryptography", Journal of Cryptology 28, 601–622.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00145-013-9170-9&lt;/ref&gt;
,&lt;ref&gt;Adi Ben Zvi, Arkadius Kalka, Boaz Tsaban (2014), Cryptanalysis via algebraic spans, IACR Cryptology eprint 2014/041, Jan 2014. https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/041&lt;/ref&gt; that solved a number of computational problems that underlie a number of proposals for nonabelian public-key cryptographic schemes (such as the [[Anshel–Anshel–Goldfeld key exchange|commutator key exchange]]).

==Awards and recognition==
Tsaban's doctoral dissertation, supervised by the [[Wolf Prize]] laureate [[Hillel Furstenberg]], won, with [[Irit Dinur]], the Nessyahu prize&lt;ref&gt;https://imudotorgdotil.wordpress.com/nessyahu-prize&lt;/ref&gt; for the best Ph.D. in mathematics in Israel in 2003.  
In 2009 he won the Wolf Foundation Krill Prize&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolffund.org.il/index.php?dir=site&amp;page=winners&amp;cs=539&lt;/ref&gt; 
for Excellence in Scientific Research.

The '''Education Reform Act 1988''' is widely regarded as the most important single piece of [[education]] [[legislation]] in [[England]] and [[Wales]] since the 'Butler' [[Education Act 1944]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  

==Provisions==
The main provisions of the Education Reform Act are as follows:

* [[Academic tenure]] was abolished for academics appointed on or after 20 November 1987.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times Higher Education]]'', 5 December 1997, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=104896&amp;sectioncode=26 Memories of jobs for life]&lt;/ref&gt;
* An element of choice was introduced, where parents could specify which school was their preferred choice.
* [[City Technology College]]s (CTCs) were introduced. This part of the Act allowed new more autonomous schools to be taken out of the direct financial control of [[Local Authorities]]. Financial control would be handed to the head teacher and governors of a school. There was also a requirement for partial private funding. There were only 15 schools that were eventually set up. The successor to this programme was the establishment of [[Academies]].
* Controls on the use of the word 'degree' were introduced with respect to UK bodies.
* [[Grant-maintained school]]s (GMS) were introduced. Primary and secondary schools could, under this provision, remove themselves '''fully''' from their respective [[local education authority|local education authorities]] and would be completely funded by central [[government]]. Secondary schools also had limited selection powers at the age of 11.
* '[[Key Stage]]s' (KS) were introduced in schools. At each key stage a number of educational objectives were to be achieved.
* [[Local Management of Schools]] (LMS) was introduced. This part of the Act allowed all schools to be taken out of the direct financial control of [[local authority|local authorities]]. Financial control would be handed to the [[head teacher]] and governors of a school.
* The [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] (NC) was introduced.
* Took the control of higher and further education provision out of [[Local Authority]] control &lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/40/part/II/chapter/I&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

==Use of the word 'degree'==
The Act uses a common technique in UK legislation in that it makes it illegal to offer or advertise any qualification that appears to be, or might be mistaken for a UK degree. This restriction is then removed in respect of qualifications from bodies on a list maintained by [[Statutory Instrument]].

==Religion==
The act required "broadly Christian" acts of worship in schools. The [[National Muslim Education Council]] objected that the wording to be changed to "the worship of the one supreme God".&lt;ref&gt;New community, Volume 18, Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations, University of Warwick, 1991, p.465.&lt;/ref&gt;

This requirement was built upon in the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4692">An '''Education and Training Board''' ('''ETB''') ({{lang-ga|Bord Oideachais agus Oiliúna}}) is a [[statute|statutory]] local education body in the [[Republic of Ireland]] that administers some secondary education, most adult education and a very small amount of primary education in the state. They came into existence on 1 July 2013, when they replaced the existing system of [[Vocational Education Committee]]s (VECs) that had been in place since 1930.&lt;ref name=examiner&gt;{{cite news|title=Education and Training Boards replace VECs to save €2m a year|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/education-and-training-boards-replace-vecs-to-save-2m-a-year-599013.html|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to taking over the responsibilities of VECs, ETBs took on the training functions of [[Foras Áiseanna Saothair]] (FÁS), the national training and employment authority, when it was dissolved in 2013.&lt;ref name=roinn&gt;{{cite web|title=Education and Training Boards replace VECs|url=http://www.education.ie/en/Press-Events/Press-Releases/2013-Press-Releases/PR-%202013-%2007-%2001.html|publisher=[[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Skills]]|date=1 July 2013|access-date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) is the national representative association for the sixteen Education and Training Boards.

==Number and constitution==
There are 16 ETBS, replacing 33 VECs. On formation the existing VEC members became members of the replacement boards.&lt;ref name=roinn/&gt;

Each board has 21 members: 
*12 [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority representatives]]
*2 staff representatives
*2 parents' representatives
*5 members from bodies representing community/business interests: one community/business interest representative must be drawn from business, industry and employers; one from learners' representative bodies and one must be representative of "bodies connected to school management or leadership".&lt;ref name=examiner/&gt;&lt;ref name=roinn/&gt;

[[Image:Eggdrop1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A package designed to protect three [[eggs (food)|eggs]] from a fall of ten meters is dropped by a [[physics]] teacher on a lift.]]
The '''egg drop contest''' is an experiment usually performed by [[college]] or primary [[school]] students. Competitors typically attempt to create a device that can keep a raw [[chicken]] [[egg (food)|egg]] intact when dropped from a height. Students are asked to build a device made from a limited or not limited amount of materials to support an egg when dropped from various heights.

==Naked egg drop==
A variation of the egg drop competition is the naked egg drop, in which an exposed raw egg is dropped into a container below that must catch the egg and keep it from breaking. 

==Egg hurl==
Another common variation on the egg drop competition is the egg hurl competition, where the containers are hurled by a device such as a [[trebuchet]] or [[Pneumatic weapon|air cannon]].  This variation is often used by schools that lack tall structures from which to drop the containers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/egg_hurl_project/index.htm Canyon High School Egg Hurl Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518070740/http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/egg_hurl_project/index.htm |date=18 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/content/articles/2009/06/15/egg_throwing09_feature.shtml "The Rowntree's Randoms Egg Throwing Championships - Swaton 28 June"] ''[[BBC]]''-[[Lincolnshire]], June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The egg hurl variation adds additional difficulties to the design of the container, since it is initially hurled at high speed and has to cope with horizontal as well as vertical velocities upon landing.

==Regional competitions==
Often schools work together to make larger competitions that pit more students against each other.  One of the larger regional egg drop competitions is the Winston-Salem / Forsyth County Egg Drop Competition that takes place during Engineers Week (late February) each year. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsfceggdrop.com Forsyth County Egg Drop Competition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Egg drop is one of 18 events in the [http://www.sciencenc.com/ North Carolina Science Olympiad] elementary competition. More than 100 teams compete in this annual competition. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenc.com/event-help/EggDrop.php North Carolina Science Olympiad Egg Drop ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elgg''' is [[Open-source software|open source]] [[social networking]] software that provides individuals and organizations with the components needed to create an online social environment. It offers [[blog]]ging, [[microblogging]], file sharing, networking, groups and a number of other features. It was also the first platform to bring ideas from commercial social networking platforms to educational software.

== History ==
Elgg was the first platform to bring ideas found in commercial social networking platforms to education. It was founded in 2004 by [[Ben Werdmuller]] and [[Dave Tosh]], based on informal papers they had written over the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downes.ca/archive/04/07_16_news_OLDaily.htm OLDaily, July 16, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Combining their experience (Werdmuller was a web entrepreneur who had been building and facilitating [[online communities]] since 1995, while Tosh was a postgraduate student in online education) they created a social networking approach to [[e-learning]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/elgg.php Elgg - social network software for education] ReadWriteWeb, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with the former designing the architecture and writing most of the code. Subsequently, they founded the company Curverider Ltd to continue the development of the software and to provide Elgg-related services. Elgg has since become a cross-purpose open source social networking platform.

In April 2009, Werdmuller decided to leave the project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://benwerd.com/2009/04/end-of-an-era-start-of-a-new-one/ End of an era, start of a new one] benwerd.com, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving [[Brett Profitt]] in charge of development. Werdmuller has since released [[Known (software)|Known]], an open source publishing platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aaron|first1=Mendelson|title=Startups pitch their ventures at Matter Three demo day|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/9/12/startups-pitch-projects-matter-three-demo-day/|website=Knight Blog|publisher=Knight Foundation|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 a hosted version of Elgg launched in [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]]. In December 2010, Curverider was acquired by Thematic Networks and Elgg was transferred to a [[non-profit]] foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.elgg.org/pg/blog/dave/read/160/a-foundation-acquisition-and-change A foundation, acquisition and change] blog.elgg.org, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://benwerd.com/2010/12/the-elgg-foundation/ The Elgg Foundation] benwerd.com, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=54329&amp;format=html The Elgg Foundation] www.downes.ca, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elgg is free to download and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Download Elgg|url=http://elgg.org/download.php|publisher=Elgg Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dual licensed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) as published by the [[Free Software Foundation]] and the MIT License.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elgg License|url=http://elgg.org/license.php|publisher=Elgg Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elgg runs on the [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) platform. Elgg is used by Lorea as the engine of N-1.cc, the  self-organized social network of the Spanish [[15-M Movement|15-M social movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=129645 ''N-1, red social del movimiento #15M'']&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies for the self-organized  [[Anillo Sur]] and [[Saravea]] Lorea latinamerican social networks.

In April 2010 a multiple site version of Elgg was released by the former core developer Marcus Povey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcus-povey.co.uk/2010/04/19/multiple-site-support-elgg/ Multiple site support with MP's Multisite Elgg] marcus-povey.co.uk, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2013 this project can be found on Github &lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/mapkyca/Elgg-Multisite Elgg Multisite Project]&lt;/ref&gt;, a new version based on Elgg 2.x was released in 2018. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marcus-povey.co.uk/2018/03/15/elgg-multisite-2-released/ Elgg Multisite 2 released!]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Folk economics''' is the intuitive [[economics]] of [[Training|untrained]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubin |first=Paul H. |title=Folk Economics |journal=Southern Economic Journal |date=July 2003 |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=157–171 |jstor=1061637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is derived from the evolutionary basis for human intelligence.  In the evolutionary environment, life was static; there was essentially no economic growth and no innovation.  Moreover, there was relatively little specialization (except by age and gender) and the economy was simple.  Thus, our brains evolved to understand this sort of economy.  While there were many implications of such an economy,one of the most important is that we evolved to be zero-sum thinkers.  that is, when faced with an economic issue our natural tendency is to view it in zero-sum terms.  This leads to fallacies such as dislike of international trade and immigration.  Indeed, zero-sum thinking is probably the most important source of inefficient economic policies.

'''Guadalupe Ortiz de Landázuri Fernández de Heredia''' (12 December 1916 – 16 July 1975) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[professor]] and a member of the [[Opus Dei]] [[personal prelature]].&lt;ref name=OD&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://odnmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/files/Dossier%20Guadalupe%20EN20170506-111331.pdf|title=Venerable Servant of God Guadalupe Ortiz de Landázuri|date=2017|publisher=Opus Dei Press Office|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/92812|title=Serva di Dio Guadalupe Ortiz de Landázuri Fernández de Heredia|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the first women to join Opus Dei, after meeting the founder [[Saint Josemaría Escrivá]] in 1944. She helped start Opus Dei in [[Mexico]] and also collaborated directly with Escriva in Rome.&lt;ref name=OD/&gt; A serious heart condition eventually claimed her life in 1975.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; After a number of requests from people who knew her during her life, her cause of canonization opened on 3 November 2001. In mid-2017, [[Pope Francis]] declared that she had lived a life of [[heroic virtue]] and named her [[Venerable]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=OD/&gt; The same Pope confirmed a miracle attributed to her intercession (the healing of a [[cancer]] patient) in June 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/life-of-spanish-chemistry-professor-shows-holiness-is-in-the-ordinary-25943|title=Life of Spanish chemistry professor shows 'holiness is in the ordinary'|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Her beatification is to be held on 18 May 2019 in Madrid.

==Life==
Guadalupe Ortiz de Landázuri Fernández de Heredia was born in [[Pamplona]] on 12 December 1916 as the fourth of four children (and the only daughter) to Manuel Ortiz de Landázuri, a military officer, and Eulogia Fernández-Heredia. Her three elder siblings were Manuel, Eduardo, and Francisco, who died in childhood.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=OD/&gt; Her brother Eduardo (who became a [[Physician|doctor]] and college professor) and his wife (the two married in 1941) have both been named as [[Servant of God|Servants of God]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Her father's career in the armed forces meant the Ortiz de Landázuris moved from place to place each time he was sent on a new assignment. The Ortiz de Landázuri's moved to [[Tétouan]] in [[Morocco]] in 1927 after her father was sent there for further work. In 1932, they returned to [[Spain]] and lived in [[Madrid]] where her father was named [[Lieutenant Colonel]]), and Guadalupe finished high school at the Instituto Miguel de Cervantes.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; In June 1933, she enrolled in the [[Universidad Central de Madrid]] in [[chemical science]] and was just one of five women in a class of 70 students. Ortiz de Landázuri eventually pursued a [[doctorate]] since she wanted to teach chemistry at the university level.&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;

Crisis struck the nation with the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in the mid-1930s. When her father was taken prisoner and condemned to execution, Ortiz de Landázuri accompanied her brother, Eduardo, and their mother to bid a final farewell, just hours before his death. It was after this, in 1937, that she relocated with Eduardo and their mother to [[Valladolid]] where her elder brother Manuel resided; she remained there until the civil war ended, just a few months before the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

She returned to Madrid in 1939 where she began her career as a teacher. One day at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in 1944, she felt something that she interpreted as being a sign from [[God]]. Ortiz de Landázuri returned home to consult with a friend and expressed a desire to speak with a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]]. That friend gave her the phone number of a well-known priest [[Saint Josemaría Escrivá]] and Ortiz de Landázuri met Escrivá for the first time on 25 January 1944.&lt;ref name=OD/&gt; Shortly following this, Ortiz de Landázuri went on a [[spiritual retreat]] and on 19 March she sent a letter to Escrivá asking to be admitted to Opus Dei.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

On 5 March 1950 - at Escrivá's invitation - she moved to [[Mexico]] to spread the message of Opus Dei. While there, Ortiz de Landázuri enrolled in a doctoral program in chemical sciences so she could continue what she had already started in Spain.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; In [[Mexico City|its capital]] she set up a student residence for university women, creating an environment conducive to serious study, healthy diversion, and friendship.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; She also helped establish the [http://www.colegiomontefalco.edu.mx/ Montefalco School] and other social projects aimed at improving opportunities for the local people. For example, together with a doctor friend, she created a mobile medical clinic that allowed them to go from house to house in poorer neighborhoods, providing both free medicine and medical tests.&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;

Ortiz de Landázuri relocated to [[Rome]] in 1956 in order to work with Escrivá in the governance of Opus Dei. Not long after her arrival, she noted pain in her chest which turned out to be a serious heart condition, and she returned to Madrid for an operation. After partially recovering, she continued with her academic work, now in Spain.&lt;ref name=OD/&gt; During this time, she began a research project on insulating refracting materials from [[rice husks]]; she won the prize Juan de la Cierva for this project and finally completed and defended her [[doctoral thesis]] on 8 July 1965. She also worked at the Ramiro de Maeztu Institute and then at the Women's School for Industrial Sciences where she took on a leadership position that she held for the next decade. From 1968, she also took part in the planning and establishment of the Center of Studies and Research of Domestic Sciences.&lt;ref name=OD/&gt; 

In 1975, the doctors said it would be best for them to operate again, despite their being some risks. Ortiz de Landázuri left her Madrid home to check into the Clínica Universidad de Navarra where she was operated on 1 July. Though the surgery was successful, she developed a [[Respiratory failure|sudden failure in respiration]] which caused her death on 16 July at 6:30am; her mother died in the same clinic the next week on 23 July. Her remains were buried in Pamplona where she was born but were later transferred to Madrid on 5 October 2018.&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;&lt;ref name=MN&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.opusdei.org/en-au/article/guadalupe-ortiz-de-landazuri-to-be-beatified-18-may-2019/|title=Guadalupe Ortiz de Landázuri to be Beatified on 18 May 2019|date=26 October 2018|accessdate=27 October 2018|publisher=[[Opus Dei]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beatification==
In 2001 the Opus Dei prelate [[Javier Echevarría Rodríguez]] started the steps needed to launch the beatification process. The forum for the diocesan process for the cause was transferred on 30 March 2001 from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pamplona|Pamplona-Tudela diocese]] to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madrid|Madrid archdiocese]] at which point the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] on 3 November issued the "[[nihil obstat]]" (no objections) edit to begin the cause and to title her as a Servant of God. Cardinal [[Antonio María Rouco Varela]] opened the diocesan process on 18 November and later closed it on 18 March 2005. From 2002 to 2003 there were 66 sessions held with 32 witnesses from Madrid being called to provide evidence and interrogatories while another week-long session in mid-2003 in Mexico saw 22 witnesses giving evidence in support of Landázuri's virtues in 37 sessions.&lt;ref name=OD/&gt; The C.C.S. later received all the documents gathered during that process in 2005 (3008 pages in seven compiled volumes) and validated the process later on 17 February 2006. The postulation later compiled and submitted the [[Positio]] dossier to the C.C.S. in 2009 for evaluation.&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;

Theologians provided a positive vote to the cause on 7 June 2016 after having assessed the Positio's contents while the C.C.S. also provided their assent to the cause at their meeting held on 2 May 2017. [[Pope Francis]] titled Landázuri as [[Venerable]] on 4 May after determining that she had lived a model Christian life of [[heroic virtue]].

Landázuri's beatification depended upon the confirmation of a singular miracle attributed to her intercession; it had to be a healing that science could not be able to explain. There was such a case that was reported in Barcelona and which a diocesan process that Cardinal [[Lluís Martínez Sistach]] presided over from 25 May 2007 until 16 January 2008 investigated. The C.C.S. validated this process on 24 October 2008 and a medical panel of experts later confirmed that the healing in question was indeed miraculous at their meeting held on 5 October 2017. The medical board also examined the diagnostic process of the ailment and the healing in just a few hours without treatment. The experts declared the occurrences not explicable from a scientific perspective.&lt;ref name=MP&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://opusdei.org/en-us/article/cure-of-antonio-sedano-miracle-guadalupe-ortiz-de-landazuri/|title=The miraculous cure of Antonio Jesús Sedano Madrid, attributed to Guadalupe Ortiz de Landázuri|date=9 June 2018|publisher=Opus Dei|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postulation later drafted a Positio for the miracle which was submitted to the C.C.S. on 2 January 2018 before the theologians also issued their assent to the miracle on 1 March. The theologians determined the relationship between the healing and the invocation of Landázuri. The C.C.S. also confirmed the case on 5 June determining that it should be acknowledged as a miracle and passed to the pope for his approval.&lt;ref name=MP/&gt; Pope Francis approved a decree recognizing this miracle on 8 June which allows for Landázuri to be beatified. The beatification will be held in Madrid at the [[Palacio Vistalegre]] on 18 May 2019.&lt;ref name=MN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://opusdei.org/en-au/article/beatification-guadalupe-ortiz-landazuri-vistalegre-arena-madrid/|publisher=[[Opus Dei]]|date=5 November 2018|accessdate=7 November 2018|title=Guadalupe's Beatification will be held at Vistalegre Arena (Madrid)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is Fr. Antonio Rodríguez de Rivera.

===Beatification miracle===
The miracle that led to Landázuri's beatification was the healing from basocellular carcinoma on the night of 28-29 November 2002 of Antonio Jesús Sedano Madrid from Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=Opus Dei|date=4 May 2017|title=Interview with Postulator for Cause of Guadalupe Ortiz de Landázuri|accessdate=9 June 2018|url=http://opusdei.org/en/article/interview-with-postulator-for-cause-of-guadalupe-ortiz-de-landazuri/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Heather Corinna was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Chicago and [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="longshort"/&gt; She suffered sexual assault at age 12, and was [[homelessness|homeless]] by age 16.&lt;ref name="pi"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Everything teens wanted to know about sex ... is at Scarleteen|date=2007-05-13|first=Athima|last=Chansanchai|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has written about the role that her experience with sexual assault and other violence in her youth have played in motivating her art and activism.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, http://femmerotic.com/favorites/013002.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Corinna is a 1986 graduate of the [[Chicago Academy of the Arts]], where she studied music, creative writing, and art.&lt;ref name="birds"/&gt; She also attended [[Shimer College]], then located in [[Waukegan]], majoring in Humanities.&lt;ref name="longshort"/&gt;

During her twenties, Corinna worked for several years as an early childhood educator. After working in education with developmentally disabled adults and in a [[Montessori]] elementary classroom, she founded an alternative kindergarten/pre-kindergarten in Chicago, which she ran from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref name="staff"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scarleteen.com/the_scarleteen_staff_volunteers|title=The Scarleteen Staff &amp; Volunteers|accessdate=2015-02-04|work=Scarleteen}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to work as a kindergarten teacher until quitting to work on Scarleteen full-time.&lt;ref name="citypages"/&gt;

In the late 1990s, Corinna founded Scarlet Letters, an adult erotica online magazine targeted to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|title=Forbidden fruit: Anonymity, accessibility of Internet help turn women on to porn|first=Mark|last=O'Keefe|date=2003-11-19|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-11-19/features/0311190033_1_pornography-adult-web-sites-accessibility}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after creating the site, her site was removed by web hosting provider [[Verio]], forcing her to find alternate hosting.&lt;ref name="citypages"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[City Pages]]|date=1999-12-08|title=Women and Children First! |first=Dennis|last=Cass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the main content of the site was off-limits to teenagers, she posted five pages of basic sexual education content for teenagers to read.&lt;ref name="birds"&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=2007-05-24|title=The birds, the bees &amp; the book: Chicago native's new release, Web site teach teens about sex|first=Stacey|last=Skotzko|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-05-24/news/0705240484_1_sexual-education-education-guide-new-book}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon being deluged with requests for further information, she established Scarleteen in 1998.&lt;ref name="birds"/&gt;  The side of the website targeted to girls was originally known as "Pink Slip".&lt;ref name="citypages"/&gt;  In 1999, she added a section targeted to boys, initially known as "The Boyfriend".&lt;ref name="citypages"/&gt;

Both Scarlet Letters and Scarleteen faced difficulty obtaining both traffic and financial support in their early years.  In the 1990s, Scarleteen was often excluded by mainstream directories as too sexual, while pornographic sites also refused to provide it as a link for under-18 visitors.&lt;ref name="citypages"/&gt;  The site subsequently came to survive largely on donations,&lt;ref name="citypages"/&gt; some of which now come from past users with children of their own.&lt;ref name="georgia"/&gt;

In 2015, Corinna received the Sexual Health Champion award from Vancouver-based Options for Sexual Health.&lt;ref name="georgia"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Scarleteen founder Heather Corinna wins 2015 Sexual Health Champion award|newspaper=[[The Georgia Straight]]|date=2015-02-04|first=Stephen|last=Hui}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Art===

* Founded in 1998 by Corinna and co-editor [[Hanne Blank]], Scarlet Letters&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scarletletters.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the earliest adult erotica online magazines and was the first woman-owned, woman-run, and women-centered sexuality website. It initially featured erotic fiction, poetry, photography, and visual art and has since expanded to include non-erotic content that promotes progressive sexuality. The website is currently on hiatus.
* Corinna's personal website, [http://femmerotic.com/ Femmerotic], contains samples of her photography, writing, and journal entries.
* Corinna's work has also appeared in [https://www.theguardian.com/profile/heather-corinna The Guardian], ''Issues Magazine'', ''PIF Magazine'', ''Maxi Magazine'', ''CleanSheets'', LeisureSuit.Net, ''Other Rooms'', ''Cherrybomb'', ''Sexilicious'', ''Blood Moon'', ''BAACHOR Magazine'' (in which her essay "The Door Into One Moment, Eternal" was nominated for a [[Pushcart Prize]]) and ''Batteries Not Included''. Her fiction and creative nonfiction have also appeared in the anthologies ''Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and A World Without Rape'', ''Viscera'', ''The Adventures of Food'', ''Aqua Erotica'', ''Zaftig: Well-Rounded Erotica'', ''The Mammoth Book of Best New Erotica 1 &amp; 2'', ''Shameless: An Intimate Erotica'', and ''Penthouse'' and will appear in the forthcoming anthologies ''Breakthrough Bleeding: Essays on the Thing Women Spend a Quarter of Their Time Doing, but No One’s Supposed To Talk About'' and ''What We Think: Gender Roles, Women's Issues and Feminism in the 21st Century''.
*Her photography and visual art have been shown at/in 555 Gallery, Sex Worker Visions (New York), Babes in Toyland, Jane's Guide, Michelle 7, On Our Backs, the Bryant-Lake Bowl, Trixx (to benefit the GLBT youth center, District 202), The Independent, The Mammoth Book of Erotic Women, SEAF 2004, and other venues.

===Sexual education===

* Corinna founded [[Scarleteen]], an " independent, grassroots sexuality education and support organization and website," in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scarleteen.com/about_scarleteen|title= About Scarleteen|accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is staffed by Corinna and a group of volunteers.  As of 2007, the website received 10,000-30,000 visitors per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|magazine=[[WireTap (magazine)|WireTap]]|date=2007-07-24|first=Rachel Kramer|last=Bussel|title=21st Century S.E.X.

* According to Scarleteen, "Heather is currently also a sexuality, contraception and abortion educator and counselor for the [http://www.fwhc.org/ Cedar River Clinics/Feminist Women's Health Center], and the director of the CONNECT teen outreach and education program. In addition, she has recently completed the facilitator training for [http://www.teentalkingcircles.org/ Teen Talking Circles]. She is a sexuality consultant for the health department of [[New Moon (magazine)|New Moon]], a magazine for girls ages 8-12; and her young adults sexuality advice at Scarleteen is now syndicated weekly at the United Nations Foundation supported reproductive health hub [http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/tag/get-real-0 RH Reality Check]."&lt;ref name="staff"/&gt;
* Corinna's book, ''S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-To-Know Progressive Sexuality Guide To Get You Through High School and College'', was published by Da Capo Press in 2007.

The '''Institute of Asian Research (IAR) Graduate Conference''' at the [[University of British Columbia]] is an annual graduate conference organized by the IAR Conference Committee, and co-hosted by the University's [[Institute of Asian Research]]. The symposium is a forum for interdisciplinary discussion on Asia Pacific policy-relevant issues, where students in all fields are encouraged to demonstrate the policy significance of their work. The IAR Conference Committee, under its collaboration with the College for Interdisciplinary Studies ([http://www.cfis.ubc.ca/ CFIS]) at UBC, publishes the proceedings of the conference in the ''Journal of the College for Interdisciplinary Studies'', as well as the possibility of publication in the Asia Pacific Memo.

== Mandate ==
The mandate of the symposium, as stated by its organizer (IAR Conference Committee), is "to promote academic awareness towards the salience of policy-relevant issues in the Asia Pacific and its surrounding regions. The IAR Conference Committee, backed by its belief of academic research as a necessary precursor to sound policy-making and the interdisciplinary nature of such, strives to create a community of understanding between students of Asia Pacific policy and makers of Asia Pacific policy by providing a dynamic forum for the exchange of ideas".[http://www.iar.ubc.ca/mapps/mappssaconference.aspx]

'''Inter-cultural communication principles''' guide the process of exchanging meaningful and unambiguous information across cultural boundaries, in a way that preserves mutual respect and minimises antagonism. For these purposes, [[culture]] is a shared system of [[symbol]]s, [[belief]]s, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s, [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s, and [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s of [[behaviour]]. It refers to coherent groups of people whether resident wholly or partly within state territories, or existing without residence in any particular territory. Hence, these principles may have equal relevance when a tourist seeks help, where two well-established independent corporations attempt to merge their operations, and where politicians attempt to negotiate world peace. Two factors have raised the importance of this topic:
*Improvements in communication and transportation technology have made it possible for previously stable cultures to meet in unstructured situations, e.g. the internet opens lines of communication without mediation, while budget airlines transplant ordinary citizens into unfamiliar ''milieux''. Experience proves that merely crossing cultural boundaries can be considered threatening, while positive attempts to interact may provoke defensive responses. Misunderstanding may be compounded by either an exaggerated sensitivity to possible slights, or an exaggerated and over-protective fear of giving offence;
*Some groups believe that the phenomenon of [[globalisation]] has reduced cultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and so reduced the opportunity for misunderstandings, but characterising people as a homogeneous market is simplistic. One product or [[brand]] only appeals to the material aspirations of one self-selecting group of buyers, and its sales performance will not affect the vast multiplicity of factors that may separate the cultures.

==What can go wrong?==
People from different cultures encode and decode messages differently, increasing the chances of misunderstanding, so the safety-first consequence of recognizing cultural differences should be to assume that others' thoughts and actions are different. Such assumptions stem from potentially devastating ignorance and can lead to much frustration for members of both cultures. Entering a culture with this type of ethnocentrism, the assumption one's own culture is correct, is another byproduct of ignorance and cultural misunderstanding.

===Rights, values, and needs===
Some cultural characteristics will be easy to identify: whether people are conscious of status or make displays of material wealth. However, many rights are assumed, values are implied, and needs are unspoken, (for safety, security, love, a sense of belonging to a group, self-esteem, and the ability to attain one's goals).

For example, issues of personal security, dignity, and control will be very different as between an able-bodied and a disabled person. Similarly, there may be problems of respect when a person from a rigidly class-based culture meets a meritocrat or if there is racism, sexism or religious intolerance in play. In such situations, [[identity (social science)|identity]] is fundamental when disputing the proper role or "place" of the other, about who is in control of their lives, and how they present themselves to the outside world. The reality is more deeply rooted in power relationships, who is on top of the social, economic, and/or political hierarchy. Family members or longterm rivals may be obsessed with their mutual competition.

===Intercultural communication ethics===
Communication is something that no one can escape and it comes in many forms. Whenever a person from one culture sends a message to be processed from a different culture, intercultural communication is present.&lt;ref&gt;
Samovar, Larry A., and Richard E. Porter. "Chapter 1." Intercultural Communication: A Reader. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2011. 8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to recognize when it happens to able to make wise decisions as to how the communication takes place. Intercultural communication ethics incorporates learning about different goods, the discourse that arises from and shapes the texture of those goods, and practices that enable constructive conversation in a postmodern world of difference.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, Ronald C., Janie M. Harden Fritz, and Leeanne M. Bell. "Chapter 9." Communication Ethics Literacy: Dialogue and Difference. Los Angeles: Sage Publications, 2009. 158. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In any ethical dilemma situation, hard choices must be made in considering the intent, the action, the means, the consequence, the end goal, the situation, and the embedded cultural contexts of the case. In an intercultural decision-making context, in particular, often difficult choices must be made between upholding one's own cultural beliefs and values and considering the values of the other culture.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, George, Steve May, and Debashish Munshi. "Chapter 20." The Handbook of Communication Ethics. New York: Routledge, 2011. 335. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Acknowledging the different goods, values, and beliefs will help to interact with someone from a different culture. A knowledge of intercultural communication, and the ability to use it effectively, can help bridge cultural differences, mitigate problems, and assist in achieving more harmonious, productive relations.&lt;ref&gt;Samovar, Larry A., and Richard E. Porter. "Chapter 1." Intercultural Communication: A Reader. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2011. 8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important in today's world where the market is global.

===Assumptions===
People may misinterpret each other's motives. For example, one group may assume that they are simply exchanging information about what they believe, but the other believes that they are negotiating a change in behavior. That is most likely to arise when the parties are not completely honest with each other from the outset. Individuals may wish to protect their [[privacy]], corporations may be concerned about [[industrial espionage]], and politicians may be bound by requirements of secrecy in the national interest. Nevertheless, clarifying the purpose of the interaction is essential to eliminating confusion.

===Situation===
If time is not a factor and those interacting approach their meetings with good will and patience, effective communication is more likely. If the parties are under pressure (whether generated by external circumstances or internal needs), emotions may colour the exchange. [[Prejudice]] is a shortcut decision-making tool. In a crisis, fear and anger may trigger more aggressive tactics, particularly if the meeting is being staged under the gaze of the news media.

==Improving intercultural communication==
It is essential that people research the cultures and communication conventions of those whom they propose to meet to minimise the risk of making the elementary mistakes. It is also prudent to set a clear agenda so that everyone understands the nature and purpose of the interaction. When language skills are unequal, clarifying one's meaning in five ways will improve communication:
#Avoid using slang and idioms, choosing words that will convey only the most specific ''denotative'' meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, P. (2010). Cross-Cultural Blunders in Professional Communication from a Semantic Perspective. Journal of Technical Writing and Communication,40(2), 179-196. doi:10.2190/tw.40.2.e&lt;/ref&gt;
#Listen carefully and, if in doubt, ask for confirmation of understanding (particularly important if local accents and pronunciation are a problem).
#Recognise that accenting and intonation can cause meaning to vary significantly.
#Respect the local communication formalities and styles, and watch for any changes in body language.
#Investigate their culture's perception of your culture by reading literature about one's culture through their eyes before entering into communication with them. This will allow one to prepare yourself for projected views of one's culture that will be borne as a visitor in their culture.
#Use politeness strategies such as hedging opinions, and making requests that allow freedom of action.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, P. S., &amp; Lee-Wong, S. M. (2003). Reconceptualizing Politeness to Accommodate Dynamic Tensions in Subordinate-to-Superior Reporting. Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 17(4), 379-412. doi:10.1177/1050651903255401&lt;/ref&gt;

If it is not possible to learn the other's language, show some respect by learning a few words. In all important exchanges, a translator can convey the message.

When writing, the choice of words represent the relationship between the reader and the writer so more thought, and care should be invested in the text since it may be thoroughly analysed by the recipient.

===Books: Annotated===

====''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship''====
*''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship (Sixteenth Century to the Present)'' (Leiden: E.J.Brill 1970).

A survey of mostly academic studies of [[Islam]] and the [[Arabs]]. Monroe also reviews these works in terms of their literary origin and social context with regard to the evolving national consciousness of Spain, i.e., how the self-reflective nature of the issues addressed in these studies develops over the course of several centuries.  Such a survey is particularly resonant with subtleties because of the seven hundred year presence of [[Arabic language|Arabic-speaking]] [[Al-Andalus|Muslim regimes]] in [[History of Spain|Spain]], chiefly in the central and southern regions.

The book is divided into three parts:

1. the Study of Arabic [[Grammar]] and [[Lexicography]] (covering scholarship of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Chapter I);

2. the Study of Political History in Al-Andalus (regarding nineteenth century scholarship, Chapters II to V);  and,

3. the Study of the Cultural History of [[Al-Andalus]] (early and middle twentieth century scholarship, Chapters VI to X).

Among figures discussed:  [[:es:Francisco Javier Simonet|Francisco Javier Simonet]] (III); [[:es:Francisco Codera y Zaidín|Francisco Codera y Zaidín]] (V); [[Julian Ribera y Tarrago|Julián Ribera y Tarragó]] (VI); [[Miguel Asín Palacios]] (VII); [[Emilio García Gómez]] and [[:es:Angel González Palencia|Angel González Palencia]] (VIII); [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]], and [[Américo Castro]] (X).

====''The Shu'ubiyya in al-Andalus''====
*''The Shu'ubiyya in al-Andalus. The risala of Ibn Garcia and five refutations'' (University of California Press 1970).

A translation from Arabic, with introduction and notes by Monroe.  Concerns the literary reflections and polemical writings with regard to an intra-Muslim ethnic conflict in [[al-Andalus]] (medieval Spain). [[Ibn Gharsiya]] [Ibn Garcia], a [[muladi]] poet (perhaps of [[Basque people|Basque]] lineage), wrote his essay (''[[risalah (fiqh)|risala]]'') during the 11th century. It contests the then current Arab claims of supremacy over Muslims of other or mixed ethnicity. Hence it echoes the earlier [[Shu'ubiyya|Shu'ubite]] movement in [[Islamicization in post-conquest Iran|Iran]], which had challenged the Arab ascendancy there several centuries before.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard N. Frye]], ''The Golden Age of Persia. The Arabs in the East'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson 1975), pp. 121-125. Shu'ubiyya in 8th and 9th century Iran.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Risālat al-tawābi' wa z-zawābi' ''====
*''Risalat al-tawabi' wa z-zawabi'. The treatise of familiar spirits and demons by Abu 'Amir ibn Shuhaid al-Ashja'i al-Andalusi'' (University of California Press 1971).
 
A translation with introduction and notes by Monroe. The poet Ibn Shuhaid (992-1035) of [[al-Andalus]] wrote this fictional narration of a voyage to the land of the [[djinn]]. Although only fragments survive, it has been reconstructed to some extent; Monroe dates it to 1025-1027. Into his stories Ibn Shuhayd places his poetry (see below, Monroe's ''Hispano-Arabic Poetry''). Probably following somewhat [[al-Hamadhani]]'s earlier invention, it is marginally of the [[maqama]] genre (see below, Monroe's ''The art of Badī' az-Zamān''). The ''Risālat'' is sometimes mentioned among [[Miguel Asín Palacios#Dante Alighieri|possible influences]] on [[Dante]]'s ''Divina Commedia''. Monroe notes that here Ibn Shuhaid "developed a metaphysics into an aesthetics to account for the origin of beauty and the creative process in Arabic literature."&lt;ref&gt;Monroe (1971) at 39 (quoted by Moreh (1988) at 106).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Hispano-Arabic Poetry''====
*''Hispano-Arabic Poetry. A student anthology'' (University of California Press 1974, reprint [[Gorgias Press]] 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Online "preview" at [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Poems in Arabic script with English translation on facing page, as compiled by Monroe. In his sixty-page introduction Monroe seeks to situate the poets within the political and social environment, following poetry's fortunes over several centuries in the culture of [[al-Andalus]]. A poet's status varied: from being lauded and well [[Patronage|patronized]], to being religiously suspect and not welcome at the palace. Monroe also sheds light on the [[Meter (poetry)|technical poetics]] of al-Andalus in terms general to [[Arabic literature]].

Works by three dozen poets are translated, including: Ibn Shuhaid (992-1035),&lt;ref&gt;Monroe (1974, 2004) in his "Introduction" 9-71, at 15, writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Ibn Shuhaid proposed the refreshing doctrine that poets are born not made, that the ability to write good poetry is a gift from God. ...the nature of poetry was determined by the physical and spiritual qualities of the poet. If the body of the [poet] was controlled by the soul, then his resulting poetry would be beautiful, he claimed. ... [I]t was the soul of the poet that determined the beauty of his poetry, not his technical mastery of language and rhetoric."&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; poet and author (see above, Monroe's ''Risalat''); the well-known [[Ibn Hazm]] (994-1064), author of ''Tauq al-hamama'' ["The Dove's Necklace"], Ibn Hazm was also a [[Zahiri]] jurist and a [[Miguel Asín Palacios#Ibn Hazm|philosopher-theologian]]; [[Ibn Zaydún]] (1003-1071), neoclassical poet; [[Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad]] (1040-1095), king of [[Seville]], later deposed; [[Ibn Kafaja]] (1058-1139), nature poet; [[Ibn Baqi]] (died 1145 or 1150), [[muwashshah]]a poet; Al-Abyad (d.1130), muwashshaha poet, later crucified; Ibn Zuhr ''al-hafid'' (1113-1198), physician, muwashshaha poet; the great mystic and [[sufi]] shaykh [[Ibn 'Arabi]] (1165-1240); [[Ibn al-Khatib]] (1313-1374), [[vizier]] of [[Granada]], historian, assassinated in [[Fes|Fez]]; [[Ibn Zamrak]] (1333-1393), whose poems are engraved on the walls of the [[Alhambra]], later assassinated; and, [[Yusuf III, Sultan of Granada]] from 1408 until his death in 1417.

====''The art of Badī' az-Zamān al-Hamadhānī''====
*''The art of Badi'u 'l-Zaman al-Hamadhani as picaresque narrative'' (American University of Beirut c1983).

[[Al-Hamadhani]] (d.1008) of [[Hamedan|Hamadhan]] or Hamadan (Ecbatana of ancient Iran) is credited with inventing the literary genre of [[Maqama|''maqamat'']]. This form employs a combination of poetry and prose, in which often a wandering vagabond makes his living on the gifts his listeners give him following his extemporaneous displays of rhetoric, erudition, or verse, often done with a [[trickster]]'s touch.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], ''Trickster Travels'' (London: Faber and Faber 2006), p. 190: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The vagabond poets of the ''maqamat'' came in and out of their disguises, roles, and tricks, admitting who they were to the traveling narrator at the end of each adventure and appearing in a new disguise and place for the next."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hamadhani has become known by the title ''Badi' az-Zaman'' or ''Badi'u 'l-Zaman'', "wonder of the age".  See below, Monroe's translation of ''al-Maqamat al-Luzumiyah'', and above his translation of ''Risalat al-tawabi' ''.

====''Ten Hispano-Arabic Strophic Songs''====
*''Ten Hispano-Arabic [[Strophic form|Strophic]] Songs in the Modern [[Oral tradition|Oral Tradition]]'', co-authored with Benjamin M. Liu (University of California 1989).&lt;ref&gt;Online "full view" at [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors discuss the medieval genres of ''[[muwashshah]]as'' and ''[[zajal]]s'' as they are currently sung in North Africa (the ''[[Maghrib]]'').  Because this music was not written, the oral performances are a crucial source.  The Muslims of Spain (''[[al-Andalus]]'') were connected closely and directly with ''al-Maghrib'', i.e., with those who later continued the [[Andalusian classical music|music traditions of Andalus]] following the Spanish ''[[reconquista]]''.

The book contains [[transliterated]] texts and translations of the verses, and about twenty pages of western [[musical notation]] of the ''songs'', as well as discussion of their performance. Also translated are two chapters on music from a medieval ''Maghribi'' encyclopedia in Arabic by Ahmad al-Tifasi. The mutual relation of the ''songs'' to [[troubadours|European romance]] is also addressed, with views and examples of a 'west-east' influence/counter-influence.&lt;ref&gt;Lui and Monroe (1989) at 6-9, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors note that evidence of a "zealous guardianship of a vernerable tradition... makes it conceivable that the Andalusian music we hear today does not differ radically from what we might have heard in medieval Andalus."&lt;ref&gt;Lui and Monroe (1989) at 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, e.g., Monroe's 1989 and 1992 articles cited herein.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Al-Maqāmāt al-Luzūmīyah, by al-Saraqustī''====
*''Al-Maqamat al-Luzumiyah, by Abu-l-Tahir Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Tamimi al-Saraqusti ibn al-Astarkuwi'' (Leiden: Brill 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Online "preview" at [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer al-Saraqusti ibn al-Astarkuwi or al-Ashtarkuni (d.1143) here wrote in the genre [[Maqama|''maqamat'']]. Saraqusti's collection of stories follows ''maqamat'' format in which, e.g., a [[trickster]] story teller may relate his adventures (see above, Monroe's book ''The Art of Badi' az-Zaman'' by al-Hamadhani). This literary [[genre]] is said to have influenced such works as the Spanish ''[[Libro de buen amor]]'' by [[Juan Ruiz]] (circa 1330).&lt;ref&gt;Alice E. Lasater, ''Spain to England'' (University of Mississippi 1974), pp. 98-99. It "contains in the adventures of the archpriest both the picaresque hero and the combination of verse and prose which characterizes the ''maqamat''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also comparable to the ''maqamat'' are later European [[picaresque novel]]s (Spanish ''picaro'': "rascal"), the first of note (although perhaps a poor example) being the anonymous ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' published in 1554 at [[Alcalá de Henares]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Translation by Monroe with a 108-page preliminary study. Therein Monroe discusses: What is Maqamat? - Life of the Author - Works of the Author - Analysis of Four Maqamat - Doubling and Duplicity [originality within the genre] - Literary Decadence and Artistic Excellence - Remarks on the [[Translation]] and Annotations. About Saraqusti's collection of Maqamat, Monroe (at 108) comments on the difficulty to render it into a foreign language, as it is "a work studded with [[pun]]s, rhymes, and ''[[double entendres]]''." Over fifty Maqamat are translated here. Monroe gives high praise for the "[[baroque]]" art of Saraqusti, although acknowledging that his ornamented style, with verse and contrivance, is now out of fashion. Saraqusti was an Arab of 12th century [[al-Andalus]].

Monroe (at 46-80) analyses four of the [[maqama]]t. In "Maqamat 41 (The Berbers)" the [[narrator]] Abu l-Gamr is a character who tells his own story, which includes contradictions and misinformation. An Arab, he is proud of his noble ancestry and traditions of generosity. On the other hand, he makes cutting remarks about the barbaric Berbers. Later as a guest of a party of [[Berber people|Berbers]], Abu l-Gamr is treated very well and trusted, but he nonetheless steals their wealth. Monroe comments that Saraqusti, here using negative example, teaches about the disagreeable and distorting nature of ethnic animosity.&lt;ref&gt;"Maqamat of the Berbers" in Monroe (2002): translated at 418-424; analysis at 46-55, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Little Computer 3''', or '''LC-3''', is a type of computer [[educational programming language]], an [[assembly language]], which is a type of [[low-level programming language]].

It features a relatively simple instruction set, but can be used to write moderately complex assembly programs, and is a theoretically viable target for a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[compiler]]. The language is less complex than [[x86]] assembly but has many features similar to those in more complex languages. These features make it useful for beginning instruction, so it is most often used to teach fundamentals of programming and computer architecture to [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]] students.

The LC-3 was developed by [[Yale Patt|Yale N. Patt]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Sanjay J. Patel]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]. Their specification of the instruction set, the overall architecture of the LC-3, and a hardware implementation can be found in the second edition of their textbook.&lt;ref name="CompSysBook"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond |last=Patt |first=Yale N. |authorlink=Yale Patt |last2=Patel |first2=Sanjay |year=2003 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-246750-9 |url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072467509/ |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses based on the LC-3 and Patt and Patel's book are offered in many computer engineering and computer science departments.

== Architectural specification ==
The LC-3 specifies a word size of 16 bits for its registers and uses a 16-bit addressable memory with a 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;-location address space. The register file contains eight registers, referred to by number as R0 through R7. All of the registers are general-purpose in that they may be freely used by any of the instructions that can write to the register file, but in some contexts (such as translating from C code to LC-3 assembly) some of the registers are used for special purposes.

Instructions are 16 bits wide and have 4-bit [[opcode]]s. The instruction set defines instructions for fifteen of the sixteen possible opcodes, though some instructions have more than one mode of operation. Individual instructions' execution is regulated by a [[finite state machine|state machine]] implemented with a control [[read-only memory|ROM]] and microsequencing unit.

The architecture supports the use of a keyboard and monitor to regulate input and output; this support is provided through [[memory mapped I/O]] abstractions. In simulation, these registers can be accessed directly, and the architectural specification describes their contents. Higher-level I/O support is also provided through the use of the TRAP instruction and a basic operating system. The operating system provides functions to read and echo characters from the keyboard, print individual characters to the monitor, print entire strings in both packed and unpacked forms, and halt the machine.

All data in the LC-3 is assumed to be stored in a [[two's complement]] representation; there is no separate support for unsigned arithmetic. The I/O devices operate on [[ASCII]] characters. The LC-3 has no native support for [[floating-point]] numbers.

The hardware implementation given in the Patt and Patel text is not pipelined or otherwise optimized, but it is certainly possible to create a fast implementation using more advanced concepts in computer architecture.

== Instruction set ==

The LC-3 instruction set implements fifteen types of instructions, with a sixteenth opcode reserved for later use. The architecture is a load-store architecture; values in memory must be brought into the register file before they can be operated upon.

Arithmetic instructions available include addition, bitwise AND, and bitwise NOT, with the first two of these able to use both registers and sign-extended immediate values as operands. These operations are sufficient to implement a number of basic arithmetic operations, including subtraction (by negating values) and bitwise left shift (by using the addition instruction to multiply values by two). The LC-3 can also implement any bitwise logical function, because NOT and AND together are [[functional completeness|logically complete]].

Memory accesses can be performed by computing addresses based on the current value of the [[program counter]] (PC) or a register in the register file; additionally, the LC-3 provides indirect loads and stores, which use a piece of data in memory as an address to load data from or store data to. Values in memory must be brought into the register file before they can be used as part of an arithmetic or logical operation.

The LC-3 provides both conditional and unconditional control flow instructions. Conditional branches are based on the arithmetic sign (negative, zero, or positive) of the last piece of data written into the register file. Unconditional branches may move execution to a location given by a register value or a PC-relative offset. Three instructions (JSR, JSRR, and TRAP) support the notion of subroutine calls by storing the address of the code calling the subroutine into a register before changing the value of the program counter. The LC-3 does not support the direct arithmetic comparison of two values.  Computing the difference of two register values requires finding the negated equivalence of one register value and then, adding the negated number to the positive value in the second register. The difference of the two registers would be stored in one of the 8 registers available for the user.

Because there is no room left in the LC-3 instruction set for dedicated [[port-mapped I/O]] instructions, hardware implementations typically reserve part of the [[memory map]] for [[memory-mapped I/O]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming language support ==

While it has not been implemented on a physical chip, the LC-3 can be used in simulation on Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and Windows environments. The simulation tools include an assembler with support for computerized offset computation with labels and the insertion of constants, strings, and blank memory locations into a block of assembly code. There is also a convention for using the C language on the LC-3. A sample assembler, compiler, and simulator are provided by McGraw-Hill.&lt;ref name="CompSysBook" /&gt;

=== C and the LC-3 ===

The calling convention for C functions on the LC-3 is similar to that implemented by other systems, such as the x86 ISA. When running C programs, the architecture maintains a memory model that includes space for a [[call stack]] and [[dynamic memory allocation]]. In this model, four of the processor's eight general purpose registers take on special roles: R4 is used as a base register for loading and storing global data, R5 is used to point to the current function's area on the call stack, and R6 is used as a stack pointer. Additionally, R7 is usually reserved for storage of return addresses from function calls; the JSR, JSRR, and TRAP instructions automatically store return addresses in this register during their execution.

When a C function is called under this model, the function's parameters are pushed onto the stack right to left. Space is then made on the stack for the return value of the function being called, the address of the instruction in the caller to return to, and the caller's value of R5. Local variables in the function being called are pushed onto the stack in the order that they are declared. Note that the LC-3 does not have native PUSH and POP instructions, so addition and memory storage instructions must be used separately to implement the stack.

== The LC-3b ==

The [http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/07s.360N/handouts/360n.appC.pdf LC-3b ISA] describes a modified version of the LC-3 that includes the following changes:

* The machine's word size remains 16 bits, but its memory is now byte-addressable with the same address space.
* The LD and ST instructions (load and store data using PC-relative addressing) have been removed.
* The LDI and STI instructions (indirect loads and stores) use register-based addressing instead of PC-relative addressing.
* Two instructions, LDB and STB, have been added to manipulate individual bytes of memory; the other load and store instructions continue to act on entire words.
* The reserved opcode has been converted into a shift instruction, SHF, that supports [[arithmetic shift|arithmetic]] and [[logical shift]]s of arbitrary size in both directions.

These changes make the hardware of the LC-3b slightly more complex than that of the LC-3. For example, the LC-3b needs a shifter (the LC-3 does not) and extra logic in its memory unit to properly handle loading and storing data of various sizes.

'''Lakers Public School &amp; College''', commonly known as '''LPSC''', is a private school located in Kathaltoli, [[Rangamati]], [[Bangladesh]]. It is managed by the [[Bangladesh Army]], Rangamati Cantonment, Rangamati. The school was established in 1991. It targets pupils from the Bangladesh armed forces and civilian communities in Rangamati city, especially those living in the Rangamati area and its periphery. A substantial proportion of its students are from civilian backgrounds.

The lack of educational services in the English medium for defence officers was a prominent reason the school was established.

==History==
LPS started its functions in hired accommodation at Kalindipur under the principleship of Begum Rukhshana Amin, with 60 students and 7 teachers. The local government council in Rangamati allotted {{convert|1.3|acre|m2}} of ''khash'' land at Kathaltali on which the ground floor of the present school building was constructed and started with 7 classes from nursery to [[Fifth grade|Std V]] from 1 September 1995.

==Background==

Ontario public libraries are created by [[municipal]] [[by-laws]] and governed by public library boards. The Ontario [[Ministry of Tourism and Culture (Ontario)|Ministry of Tourism and Culture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.on.ca/english/culdiv/library/index.html Ministry of Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; has responsibility for the administration of the [[Public Libraries Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isysquery/4414a43b-574f-4149-898c-022ac244ebde/2/frame/?search=browseStatutes&amp;context= Public Libraries Act]&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry's Culture Services Unit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.on.ca/english/culdiv/library/libdirectory.htm   Heritage and Libraries Branch]&lt;/ref&gt; provides support for the public library system and the [http://www.mtc.gov.on.ca/en/libraries/resources.shtml Ontario Library Service] deliver programs on behalf of the ministry.

'''''Mad TV''''' is a [[television station]] management simulation [[computer game]] produced in 1991&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/amiga/strategy/madtv/index.html?tag=tabs;summary Mad Tv] at gamespot.com&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Rainbow Arts]]. The game puts the player in the role of a new [[program director]] for a TV station.  The player is in charge of selecting programming and earning advertising for the station, while simultaneously trying to marry Betty, an attractive woman working in the building.

== Gameplay ==
The main interface of the game involves moving a thin man through a multistory building via mouse clicks. By clicking on various doors, the player's character can enter other locations, which are portrayed in [[cut scene]]s. Each day is timed, and after eight game hours the day of programming ends.

For each day, the player must program seven hours of television and provide an advertisement block  for each of those programs.  The game offers many options to fill programming, such as purchasing the rights to classic movies and shows, or by producing your own shows. However, programming must be regularly cycled, otherwise it gets stale with the audience and produces low ratings.

Advertising is also offered via [[contracts]], which require certain rating marks to pay out. For example, a contract for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] might pay better than one for a local business, but the Nike contract will require substantially more viewers. Access to more viewers can be achieved by buying more transmitters and satellites.

The player competes against two other television stations, run by computer-controlled program directors, in the same building. These program directors inhabit the same space and locations as the player, and they can directly influence the game by outbidding the player for certain movies or sabotaging programming lineups.

The eventual goal of the game is to win Betty's love. She is a cultural reporter who works on the top floor of the building. The other television station directors are also competing for Betty. Her affection rises when the player airs her culture program or buys her gifts, ranging from [[fur coats]] to [[diamond]] rings. Furthermore, Betty's love depends indirectly on the reputation the player has (which in turn depends on several factors such as ratings). Her affection level will never outrun the player's reputation level, so there is no use in simply pleasing her and neglecting the audience.
Unfortunately cultural programs are not popular; airing only Betty's favorites will cause bankruptcy. The player has to balance his budget.

=== Gameplay issues ===
The game suffers from many translation issues, resulting from its origin as a game originally produced in [[Germany]]. Much of the in-game text features typos and [[Denglisch]].

== Sequel ==
''Mad TV'' has a sequel, ''Mad TV 2'', which was only released in Germany. In 2001 ''Mad TV''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcwelt.de/downloads/Mad-TV-578305.html |title=Mad TV |publisher=[[PC Welt]] |first=Panagiotis|last=Kolokythas|date=2001-10-11 |quote=''Im Fernsehen läuft nichts gescheites?

== Remakes ==
There are several attempts to remake ''Mad TV'' like ''TVTower'' (for [[Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS]]), ''Mad TV Online'' (as [[browser game]]) and ''mobileTV'' (for [[mobile device]]s). But a game similar to Mad TV called [[Empire TV Tycoon]] by Dreamsite Games was released in October 21, 2015.

'''[[NASA]] RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge''' encourages students in grades 7–12 to explore and to build skills for successful careers in science, technology, engineering, and math ([[STEM fields]]) through two phases of project-based learning and team competition. The RealWorld-InWorld experience provides teams of students working initially with teachers/coaches the opportunity to solve NASA-inspired engineering problems and then to build solutions with university students and engineering mentors in a virtual reality setting. Teams consider real-world questions related to both the James Webb Space Telescope and the dextrous humanoid robot known as Robonaut 2, and then work to develop logistical solutions to the actual problems that researchers and scientists are solving today. RealWorld-InWorld is a joint education initiative of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the [[National Institute of Aerospace]] (NIA), USA TODAY Education, and LearniT-TeachiT.

The RealWorld-InWorld NASA Engineering Design Challenge builds on the successful SIGHT/INSIGHT design challenge developed by USA TODAY Education and NASA and the Virtual Exploration Sustainability Challenge (VESC) developed by NIA and NASA. Both education initiatives were based upon NASA themes and content for students in grade 7-12. They deepen students' understanding of STEM careers, project management, and NASA innovation.

==Problem solving==
Students will attempt to answer one of two questions regarding either the James Webb Space Telescope or Robonaut 2.
*Robonaut 2 has an incredible pair of arms, and a set of legs in development, but what it needs is a way to attach itself to the outer walls of the International Space Station while in open space. Design a "zero-G-foot" for Robonaut 2 that will provide stability and support during space walks.
*The James Webb Space Telescope is a large infrared space telescope designed to replace the Hubble Space Telescope. Design a large shield that can keep JWST cold while also allowing it to detect infrared light from faint sources such as distant galaxies and extrasolar planets.

==Robonaut 2==

===History and application===
Robonaut 2 is a highly dextrous anthropomorphic humanoid robot built and designed at [[NASA Johnson Space Center]]. Robonaut 2 is employed in situations where risk factors are too high and thus endanger human life. The development of Robonaut 2, and in the future, other dextrous humanoid robots, will enhance our capabilities for exploration and construction in space, by allowing us to send robots, with greater mobility than suited astronauts, to complete complicated missions or venture into environments not safe for humans. Robonaut 2 has the distinction of being the first of its kind (there are four similar robots) to not only go into space, but also perform tasks aboard the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). Robonaut 2, or R2, as it's commonly referred to as, is the first U.S. robot to board ISS. The value of being a "dextrous humanoid" robot as opposed to any other design, is that R2 can use the same tools we use and work beside us in the same spaces. This is incredibly efficient as there will be no need to create new tools to facilitate Robonaut 2's missions. For the development of R2, NASA is partnering with [[General Motors]] (GM) and [[Oceaneering Space Systems]] (OSS). These partnerships will aid in the acceleration of R2 as a new technology, and help the robot exceed human dexterity - to which it has not yet matched - and then be employed in both the aerospace and automotive industry.

R2 improves on its predecessor, R1, in a number of ways.  R2 moves four times faster than R1, is more compact, and has a higher level of dexterity and a deeper and wider range of sensing capabilities.  R2 incorporates many advanced technologies including optimized overlapping dual arm dexterous workspace, series elastic joint technology, extended finger and thumb travel, miniaturized 6-axis load cells, redundant force sensing, ultra-high speed joint controllers, extreme neck travel, and high resolution camera and IR systems.

==The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)==

===History and application===
The James Webb Space Telescope is the next generation in deep space imaging systems. The James Webb Space Telescope seeks to provide a better understanding of the origins of the earth and life in the universe. This telescope is significant to future scientific breakthroughs and through the RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge students use the engineering design process to solve problems related to the James Webb Space Telescope.

===James Webb===
The James Webb Space Telescope, also known as JWST, was named after former NASA Administrator James Webb. Webb ran the space agency from February 1961 until October 1968.&lt;ref name="jwst.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/whois.html |title=The James Webb Space Telescope |publisher=Jwst.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to have made great contributions to space science which led to the JWST, the next-generation space telescope, which bears his name. Webb is most commonly linked to the [[Apollo Space Program]]. It is surprising, considering his vast accomplishments, that Webb was somewhat reluctant to accept the position as NASA administrator. He was not an engineer or scientist, but had held other notable positions in government and aerospace industry. President Kennedy believed Webb to be the best man for the position and convinced him that the position of NASA Administrator was a largely policy oriented position.

Although President Kennedy had committed to landing a man on the moon before the end of the century, Webb believed the challenge to be important in many sectors, such as education and industry, rather than strictly political. Webb is credited with the great scientific productivity of the space agency during the 1960s. Many programs allowed Americans to discover new information about outer space with probes sent to Mars and Venus, while others prepared Americans to make the first steps on the Moon, with robotic exploration of the surface.&lt;ref name="jwst.nasa.gov"/&gt; By the time Webb retired in 1968, shortly before the moon landing in 1969, the agency had launched over 75 missions.

Webb enhanced the role of scientists in the decision making of the agency. He also played an active role in creating a link between NASA and university education in America. Webb created the NASA University Program which helped establish space grants, provide fellowships to graduate students, and build scientific research laboratories at universities. This linkage between NASA and education continues today and is evidenced in the RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge. This challenge is focused on the telescope which bears the name of James Webb, the man that launched America into the successful era of space exploration that provided much understanding and scientific breakthrough.

===Telescope===
The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled for launch in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/ |title=The James Webb Space Telescope |publisher=Jwst.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its orbit of about 1 million miles from the Earth's surface the JWST will use infrared technology to peer into space, helping scientists make observations about the origins of the universe. The JWST will observe the history of the universe from the moments following the [[Big Bang]] through the formation of solar systems, including our own. It will study the origin of life supporting environments and the process of planetary formation.

The JWST is a collaborative effort between [[NASA]],the [[European Space Agency]], and the [[Canadian Space Agency]]. The project is currently being managed by the [[Goddard Space Center|NASA Goddard Space Center]]. The contracting company involved in the development is [[Northrup Grumman]]. After launch the telescope will be operated by the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]]. The project was formerly known as the "[[Next Generation Space Telescope]]" but was renamed after James Webb in 2002.

The goals of the JWST are grouped into four scientific themes:
# The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization
# Assembly of Galaxies
# The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems
# Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life

The JWST is similar to its predecessor, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], in some ways but in many ways it is different, allowing scientists to gain new prospective and understanding of the universe. The JWST "views" the universe in the infrared, whereas the Hubble views the universe in optical and ultra-violet. This combination of viewpoints allows scientists to put together a more complete picture of the universe. The mirror on the JWST is also much larger than the mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope allowing it to collect even more light and peer even farther back in time. Since light travels at a great speed, the farther away it has traveled from the greater amount of time has passed since its origination. The JWST will also orbit much farther away from earth than the Hubble. The Hubble resides very close to earth, whereas the JWST will reside much farther away than even the moon.

==Getting started 2011==

=== Phase 1: RealWorld ===

====Who====
Teachers/coaches and high-school-aged students

====What====
Work cooperatively as engineers and scientists to explore and design solutions for one of two real-world problems related to either the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] or [[Robonaut 2]]. RealWorld Solutions are created in a face-to-face environment of small teams of high school students and coaches/teachers. Submitted final project solutions will be featured on the RealWorld-InWorld website and teams will receive recognition for their work. Only teams that submit their final RealWorld project solutions by January 27, 2012, are eligible to move into the InWorld phase.

===Phase 2: InWorld===

==== Who ====
Participating college students select teams of 3-5 high-school-aged students and their teacher/coach. Each team selects a participating engineering mentor.  Many of the participants are also participants in NASA's INSPIRE program.&lt;ref&gt;[[NASA INSPIRE]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/9-12/features/inspire-students-speak-out.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====What====
Work in a 3D virtual environment using 21st Century tools to refine designs and to create 3D models of the Webb Telescope and Robonaut 2. Engineers from both distinct projects will visit and "chat" InWorld throughout the challenge. Unlike RealWorld, the InWorld Challenge is located in a virtual environment hosted within the NIA Universe virtual reality world. Teams create and build their solutions to the proposed problems within this virtual environment.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
The '''National Diploma''' ('''NDip''') ({{Lang-ga|Dioplóma Náisiúnta}}) was a three-year [[Legal term#Ab initio|ab initio]] specialised [[higher education]] qualification in a technology discipline offered by an [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Institute of Technology]] or other [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council|HETAC]] designated institution in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

Alternatively, a National Diploma could be offered as a one-year post [[National Certificate]] type course. The diploma generally exempted a student from the first two or three years of a four-year university [[Honours Bachelor's Degree]] in Ireland. [[List of universities in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland universities]] considered the standard equivalent to the [[Business And Technology Education Council (BTEC)|BTEC]] [[Higher National Diploma]], this was also the position adopted by most [[British universities]] that have large entrance from the Republic. Many of the courses were in [[business]], [[engineering]] and [[science]]. Most entrants were school leavers presenting the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] or the National Certificate and many continued their studies to honours [[Bachelor's degree]] level.

The National Diploma in Ireland was first awarded in 1973 by several [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Regional Technical College]]s. The National Diploma has been replaced by the ''[[Ordinary Bachelor's Degree]]'' under the [[National Framework of Qualifications]]. This was decided by the [[National Qualifications Authority of Ireland]] recently. The National Diploma has not been awarded since June 2006, however holders of a National Diploma can claim equivalence to the newer award, the Ordinary Bachelor's Degree.

==Partner Agencies==
[[File:Veteran family.jpg|thumb|A young Veteran family hold onto each other as they search for affordable housing.]]
Operation Sacred Trust began as a collaboration of service providers with "aligned missions who have come together to bring their unique experiences and expertise to serve 1,000 homeless and low-income Veteran and their family members in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, located in the heart of South Florida." The four initial OST partners, [[Carrfour Supportive Housing]], [[PAIRS Foundation]], Henderson Behavioral Health, and Neighborhood Housing Services of South Florida, brought combined experience of more than 100 years in the South Florida community serving homeless and other at-risk populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operationsacredtrust.com] - Operation Sacred Trust website.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2016, Operation Sacred Trust began operating as an independent agency with staff members provided by [[Carrfour Supportive Housing]], Purpose Built Families Foundation, and the University of Miami Health Law Clinic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.411Veterans.com] - 411Veterans.com website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
[[File:Veteran and son.jpg|thumb|A Veteran and his young son searching for affordable housing in Miami.]]
Funding for the Supportive Services for Veterans Families program was initially provided by the [[111th United States Congress]] through implementation of the provisions of section 604 of the Veterans’ Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008, as published in the [[Federal Register]].&lt;ref name="gpo"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-11-10/pdf/2010-28407.pdf] - 38 CFR Part 62, Department of Veterans Affairs. From GPO website.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial grant that funded the program was $1 million annually. In 2013, funding from the VA was increased to $1.75 million annually with an additional $3 million provided for a three-year surge in Miami-Dade County in October 2014.&lt;ref name="ssvf"/&gt;

In total, between FY 2012 and 2017, the [[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]], provided $28.8 million in grant funds to three unique Supportive Services for Veteran Families programs in Broward and Miami-Dade counties, including $12.1 million to Operation Sacred Trust (42%), $8.7 million to Advocate Program (30%), and $8 million to the United Way's Mission United initiative (28%).&lt;ref name="ssvf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farray|first=Yanira|title=VA Awards $300 in SSVF Grants to Help End Veteran Homelessness|url=http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/08/30/va-awards-300-in-ssvf-grants-to-help-end-veteran-homelessness/|publisher=Veteran News Now|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
In order to receive services through Operation Sacred Trust, participants must be '''very low-income veteran families''' living in Florida's Broward or Miami-Dade counties who are either:&lt;ref name="gpo"/&gt;
# Residing in permanent housing;
# Homeless and scheduled to become a resident of permanent housing within 90 days pending the location or development of housing suitable for permanent housing; or
# Exited permanent housing within the previous 90 days to seek other housing that is responsive to the very low-income veteran family’s needs and preferences.

==Definitions==
As defined by the '''Final Rule''' adopted by the [[111th United States Congress]]:&lt;ref name="gpo"/&gt;

'''Very low-income veteran family''' means a veteran family whose annual income does not exceed 50 percent of the median income for an area or community, as will be adjusted by VA based on family size and as may be adjusted and announced by VA based on residency within an area with unusually high or low construction costs, fair market rents (as determined under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f)), or family incomes. Unless VA announces otherwise, the median income for an area or community will be determined using the income limits most recently published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for programs under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f).

'''Veteran''' means a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable.

'''Veteran family''' means a veteran who is a single person or a family in which the head of household, or the spouse of the head of household, is a veteran.

{{expert|date=December 2011}}
'''Pedology''' ('''paidology''', '''paedology''') is the study of children's behavior and development (as distinct from [[pedagogy]], the art or science of teaching, and [[pediatrics]], the field of medicine relating to children). 

The origins of this trend in [[psychology]] and pedagogy go back to the end of the 18th century with the separation of a branch of psychology that would form the basis of pedagogy, a pedagogic psychology or "experimental pedagogic psychology", "experimental pedagogy", "experimental education". 

[[G. Stanley Hall]] (1844-1924) fostered pedology as a separate study, and also became instrumental in the development of modern [[educational psychology]].  An American researcher, [[Oscar Chrisman]], proposed the term "pedology" in 1893. At the end of the 19th century, pedology as a comprehensive study of the child came to prominence in Europe as an attempt to create a study of children in the manner of [[natural sciences]]. In 1909 Professor [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] organized a Pedological Society in [[Lviv]], [[Austro-Hungary]] (now Ukraine). In 1910 a similar society was organized in [[Kraków]]. In 1911 the first World Congress in Pedology took place in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], with attendants from 22 countries.

[[World War I]] (1914-1918) effectively put an end to the development of this study in Western Europe.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

Since pedology as a branch of science never reached its maturity, there is no common established understanding as to the scope or instruments of pedology. 

[[Bowie State University]] in Bowie, Maryland became the first university in the United States to offer a Bachelor's Degree in pedology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bowiestate.edu/academics/departments/behavioral/pedology/ | title=Pedology Major| publisher= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318204420/http://www.bowiestate.edu/academics/departments/behavioral/pedology// | archive-date=18 March 2008 | accessdate=11 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 document from the university refers to "the pedology major (now known as child and adolescent studies)".&lt;ref name="assessment"&gt;{{cite journal|work=Assessment Times|url=https://www.bowiestate.edu/files/resources/newsletter-fall-2014.pdf|publisher=Bowie State University|date=August 2014 | title=Faculty Spotlight: Behavioral, Health and Human Services|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedology in the Soviet Union==
In [[Imperial Russia]] a prominent developer of the field was [[Aleksandr Petrovich Nechayev|Aleksandr Nechayev]] (Александр Петрович Нечаев) in [[St. Petersburg]], who in 1901 created the laboratory of experimental pedagogical psychology. Soviet pedology is traditionally thought to be founded by the efforts of [[Vladimir Bekhterev]]; in particular, in 1918 he founded the Institute of Pedology as part of psychological institutions united into the Institute for Study of Brain and Psychical Activity.

This science was intensively pursued in 1920s-1930s in the [[Soviet Union]]. A journal ''Pedologiya'' ("Педология") was issued.  [[Lev Vygotsky]] was one of its prominent supporters. 

While many works of pedologists were of considerable value, the approach was severely criticized for over-enthusiastic but poorly grounded approach of [[Test (student assessment)|testing]] for predicting a child's mental development, in addition to estimating its status. 

It was officially banned in 1936 after a special decree of [[VKP(b)]] [[Central Committee]] "On Pedological Perversions in the [[Narkompros]] System" on July 4, 1936 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/36976031/Russian_Federation_in_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_the_History_of_Psychology_Pt_1 | title=Russian Federation | archive-date=4 June 2018 | accessdate=4 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Paul Laffoley''' (August 14, 1935 – November 16, 2015) was an American [[visionary artist]] and [[architect]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], represented by [[Kent Fine Art]] in New York.

==Biography==

Paul Laffoley, as one of America's foremost visionary artists, seemed to work in a perpetual present tense (there is no "late" or "old age" style for him). From a young age, spiritual productivity was measured by how deeply one's wisdom could be developed, and how broadly one's compassion could exert itself.

Paul Laffoley was born on August 14, 1935 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to an [[Irish Catholic]] family.  His father, Paul Laffoley, Sr., the president of the Cambridge Trust Company, was also a [[lawyer]] and taught classes at [[Harvard Business School]]. Although his father had been against him pursuing painting as a career, Laffoley was indoctrinated with his father's religious philosophical beliefs including aspects of Buddhism and Hinduism and what he called "mind-physics". Laffoley senior also instructed Paul that there was "no gravity" which was a source of great humor when Paul was given the assignment to explain in grade school.

Laffoley wrote that his first spoken word was "[[Constantinople]]" at the age of six months. He did not speak again until he was four years old.&lt;ref name="madone"/&gt; He was diagnosed as having Asperger's Syndrome testing both high and low academically.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to Laffoley, he attended the progressive Mary Lee Burbank School in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], where his draftsman's talent was ridiculed by his [[abstract expressionist]] teachers.  After further studies at the Waldorf School, Laffoley would complete undergraduate studies at [[Brown University]], graduating in 1961 with honors in classics, philosophy, and [[art history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Laffoley Bio|url=http://kentfineart.net/artists/paul-laffoley|publisher=Kent Fine Arts LLC|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021031335/http://kentfineart.net/artists/paul-laffoley/|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As written by Paul in The Phenomenology of Revelation, he was given eight [[electroshock]] treatments after the termination of "about a year of weekly sessions with a psychiatrist, who had treated me for a mild state of catatonia" while at Brown in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafolley|first=Paul|title="The Dream As The Initiation" from The Phenomenology of Revelation|year=1989|publisher=Kent Fine Arts|location=New York, NY|isbn=1878607057|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, he enrolled at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he studied architecture because it consisted of diagrams that rendered objects in space with accuracy and precision.  He also studied with the sculptor Mirko Basaldella at Harvard's Carpenter Center that he cited was an early influence. After one year, he was summarily grand juried out of the GSD by the faculty for being "overly involved in his work". By chance, Laffoley was given an issue of Progressive Architecture by his uncle with Frederick Kiesler on the cover.  Laffoley felt Kiesler work was what he had been searching for, and after writing 17 letters, Laffoley came to New York and succeeded in apprenticing with [[Frederick John Kiesler|Frederick Kiesler]].  While canvasing the art scene in New York, Laffoley would meet [[Andy Warhol]], who offered him a place to sleep at his 87th Street fire station if he would report on late night television between 1 and 5 am. It was from watching these Indian Head Test Patterns along with his early exposure to a Hindu tutor that Laffoley would arrive at a format for his large scale paintings that would dominate his work for five decades.

After the death of his father in 1963, Paul would return to Boston from New York, and eventually established his first dedicated studio space at 36 Bromfield Street on Christmas Day, 1968.  It was there that Paul's career would begin to "connect" with an early show at the Orson Welles Theater that was "highjacked" and taken to the Woodstock Music Festival for presentation by Dean Gitter without Paul's permission.  In an effort to recover his work, Paul took the bus to Woodstock which lead to his exposure to the current countercultures of the day, and would be followed by numerous exhibition opportunities and curatorial projects that would lead to the creation of his Boston Visionary Cell (1971).  The Boston Visionary Cell, which Paul Laffoley founded on the model of an artists’ guild, was a highly communal and curatorial undertaking.  The charter of the Boston Visionary Cell underscores Laffoley’s thought processes “to develop and advance visionary art”.

By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, and evolved to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging [[psychotronics|psychotronic]] device, perhaps similar to architectural monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] or the Cathedral of Notre Dame and their spiritual aura.  Works such as Thanaton III (1989), The Orgone Motor (1983), and the Geochronmechane: The Time Machine from Earth (1990) would follow this concept.

After the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on [[September 11, 2001]], Laffoley was one of a number of architects who, in 2002, submitted designs for the competition to plan the [[One World Trade Center|Freedom Tower]]. Laffoley took his inspiration from the work of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] architect [[Antoni Gaudí]]. His conception was to plan a gigantic hotel in the style of Gaudí's [[Sagrada Família]] church in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Glenn|title=Postmodern, In a Manner Of Speaking; A Shape Out of 1908 Is Offered Downtown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/21/nyregion/postmodern-in-a-manner-of-speaking-a-shape-out-of-1908-is-offered-downtown.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="madone"&gt;{{cite web|last=Larroque|first=Jean-Pierre|title=The Mad One|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmBuzdLUFsc|publisher=Doublethink Productions|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Austin Museum of Art organized a traveling survey of his career in 1999, Mr. Laffoley became something of a cult figure for curators around the world. The Palais de Tokyo in Paris devoted an entire room to his work in its 2009 exhibition "Chasing Napoleon", and several of his works were included in "The Alternative Guide to the Universe" at the Hayward Gallery in London in 2013. Other major shows include Premonitions of the Bauharoque at the Henry Art Gallery, Seattle (publication), Secret Garden at the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (publication) and the recent monograph entitled ''The Essential Paul Laffoley'' edited by Douglas Walla and published by the University of Chicago Press in Spring 2016.

==About==
Following his formal education in the classics at Brown and architectural studies at [[Harvard]], Laffoley would begin to assimilate and systematically cross-pollinate his related strands of intellectual inquiry.  In a search for expanded opportunities, he went to New York in 1963 to work with the visionary artist and architect [[Frederick Kiesler]], and was also recruited to view late-night TV for [[Andy Warhol]] in exchange for a place to sleep.  Weekdays, Laffoley found employment with [[Emery Roth &amp; Sons]] where he worked on the plans for the yet to be built [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] Towers before being terminated upon his suggestion of bridges joining the two buildings.

At that time, Laffoley had been painting in the basement of his family home in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] on the weekends, completing his first fully mature vision:  The [[Kali-Yuga]]: The End of the Universe at 424826 A.D.  From this point forward, Laffoley began to formulate his unique trans-disciplinary approach to a new discipline combining, [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[architecture]] and spirituality to the practice of painting.  Laffoley first began to organize his ideas in a format related to eastern [[mandalas]], partially inspired by the late night patterns he watched for Warhol on late night television.  This quickly developed into four general subcategories of paintings: [[operating system]]s, [[Psychotronics|psychotronic]] devices, meta-energy, [[time travel]], and [[lucid dream]]ing.  Conceived of as "structured singularities", Laffoley never works in series, but rather approaches each project as a unique schematic.  Working in a solitary lifestyle, each 73 ½ x 73 ½ inch canvas would take up to three years to paint and code.  By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging psychotronic device, a modern approach to trans-disciplinary enlightenment and its spiritual aura.

From an early age, Laffoley manifested an obsessive interest in [[UFO]]s.  He had seen the movie ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' 873 times.  He explains that his obsessive interest in the film derives partly from a fascination with the architecture of the space ship in the film which, early on in his life, was subconscious. While he was still a child he made a vow to become an architect so that he could design flying saucers, although he did not become a registered architect until he was 50 years of age.

As a result, a miniature metallic-like "implant" was discovered in my brain near the pineal gland.  A local chapter of [[MUFON]] (Mutual UFO Network) declared it to be a "nanotechnological laboratory" capable of accelerating or retarding my brain activity.

==Work==

Painted on large canvases, the majority of Paul Laffoley's paintings combine words and imagery to depict a spiritual architecture of explanation, tackling concepts like dimensionality, time travel through hacking relativity, connecting conceptual threads shared by philosophers through the millennia, and theories about the cosmic origins of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outsider Art Sourcebook|date=March 2009|publisher=Raw Vision|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0954339326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=The Boston Visionary Cell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/arts/design/paul-laffoley-the-boston-visionary-cell.html?_r=0|accessdate=12 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=ART IN REVIEW: Paul Laffoley, 'Portaling'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/06/arts/art-in-review-paul-laffoley-portaling.html|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010,

Laffoley's writings as well as works of art were published in May 2016 by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in a new book entitled ''The Essential Paul Laffoley'' edited and texts by Douglas Walla, with further texts by [[Linda Dalywimple Henderson]], [[Arielle Saiber]] and [[Steven Moskowitz]].

British writer [[Michael Bracewell]], in his collection of essays entitled ''When Surface was Depth'' observed: "If Laffoley's work within the Boston Visionary Cell can be said to have one principal preoccupation - a common denominator of his eclectic scholarship and practice - then that preoccupation would be to understand the process by which one goes from becoming to being." Bracewell has also written that, "The Boston Visionary Cell, as a concretized manifestation of its inhabitant's work and preoccupations, describes the way in which a chaos of data - no less than a chaos of marble - can be sculpted by research to release the perfect forms within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|title=when surface was depth|date=July 9, 2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=London|isbn=0306811308|pages=346–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Estate of Paul Laffoley is represented by [[Kent Fine Art]] in New York.

'''Penkkarit''' (more formally '''penkinpainajaiset''', "benchpressing [fest]", or '''bänkskuddardagen''' ("penkis, penkisdagen") in Swedish) is a yearly tradition among [[Finland|Finnish]] [[upper secondary school]] ({{lang-fi|lukio}}) students. The event is celebrated in the spring of their final, usually third, year as the final day of school, before the start of the [[Abitur#Finland|matriculation exams]]. Traditionally, the date of ''penkkarit'' is a Thursday in late or mid-February.&lt;ref name="virkkunen"&gt;[http://yrttis.pyhajoki.fi/kuulumiset/arkisto/pdf/2003/008pyhajoenkuulumiset8-03.pdf Virkkunen, K. Penkinpainajaiset ennen ja tänään] Pyhäjoen kuulumiset 19.2.2003. Retrieved 9-4-2007. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The origin==
Until 1919, the Finnish matriculation exam took place in [[University of Helsinki]] and was formally the entrance exam of this university. The upper secondary school students who wished to graduate left their hometowns for Helsinki, usually somewhat ceremonially. After 1919, the examination was conducted in schools. However, since the 1920s, the students stop attending classes in February, devoting themselves to solitary preparation for the exams which are held in March.&lt;ref name="virkkunen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ylioppilastutkinto.fi/koepaivat/kevat_2008/ Kevään 2008 koepäivät]. Ylioppilastutkintolautakunta. Retrieved 9-4-2007. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebration==

The celebration of the ''penkkarit'' varies from school to school. Usually, the school-leaving students dress as for a masquerade, following a theme decided by themselves. The event often includes following elements
*school-leavers visiting the classes of junior students, interrupting the teaching and replacing it with a parody class.
*throwing candy at the junior students
*visiting lower secondary or primary school, meeting old teachers and throwing candy
*singing parodic songs about the teachers
*presenting a humorous short film (Finnish: ''abivideo'') to other students at the school hall

The ceremonies usually end with the school-leavers riding away from the school on [[lorry|lorries]] decorated for the purpose. The design of the decorations is usually a mixture of pride in and insult at the own school. Often, the students then visit the major local elementary schools.

In larger towns, the ''penkkarit'' culminate at a parade where the lorries drive across the city at a slow speed, and the final-year students on top of them shouting slogans and throwing [[candy]] at passers-by.  The event is particularly popular among children, who come to the streets to collect free candy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5750">[[Image:Schloessl 1.jpg|thumb|250px|The “Springer-Schlössl”, Seat of the Political Academy of the ÖVP.]]

The '''Political Academy of the Austrian People's Party''' is the educational institution of the [[Austrian People's Party]] (Österreichische Volkspartei).

The “Political Academy” supports civic, political and cultural education by means of seminars, training courses, lectures, publications, applied research, etc. The Political Academy is located in the "Springer Schlössl" (Springer Castle) in Vienna.

It is a member of the [[Centre for European Studies (think tank)|Centre for European Studies]], the official foundation/think tank of the [[European People's Party]].

== Development ==
On 9 July 1972, the Austrian National Assembly passed the “Federal Law on the Promotion of Civic Educational Activities in the Area of the Political Parties as well as Journalism”. This federal law determined that the government would promote the “civic educational activities of the political parties through allocation of funds to foundations or associations”.&lt;ref&gt;''BGBl. 82. Stück, Nr. 272. Bundesgesetz v. 9.7.1972'', ''[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblPdf/1972_272_0/1972_272_0.pdf Förderung staatsbürgerlicher Bildungsarbeit im Bereich der politischen Parteien sowie der Publizistik ]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Political Academy was founded in the same year. In 1975 the definitive training and administration centre was completed in the Springer Schlössl in the Viennese district of Meidling and handed over to the Political Academy. The Springer Schlössl had formerly been the site of the ÖVP’s Vogelsangheim. 
The Political Academy’s predecessor was named after Karl von Vogelsang, the Austrian social reformer and spiritual founder of the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)]].

At the same time, the other parties represented in the National Assembly founded their own political academies: The Social Democratic Party’s Dr. Karl Renner Institute and the Freedom Party’s Education Institute. The foundation of the Green’s Educational Workshop followed in 1987 and, in 2006, the BZÖ’s Austrian Future Academy.

== Political Further Education ==
The political further education activities of the Political Academy of the ÖVP are in keeping with the stipulations determined in the currently valid “Law for the Support of Journalism” from 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''Gesamte Rechtsvorschrift für Publizistikförderungsgesetz 1984'', ''[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?QueryID=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10000784 Publizistikförderungsgesetz 1984 - PubFG]''&lt;/ref&gt; These include that the activities of the Political Academy not be aimed at profit-making and that the Political Academy support civic education in the sense of the principles in the federal constitution. The Political Academy divides its activities into three areas: Academy, Think Tank and Network.

In numerous events and publications, the '''Austrian Think-tank''' deals with socio-political matters, the further development of Christian-Democratic programmes and the implementation of political concepts in practice.

== Recent Publications ==

The '''Public Orator''' is a traditional official post at universities, especially in the [[United Kingdom]]. The person in this position acts as the voice of the university during public occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |year=1913 |title=Definition: public orator |url=http://dictionary.die.net/public%20orator |work=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=[http://dictionary.die.net/ die.net] |accessdate=10 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position at [[Oxford University]] dates from 1564.&lt;ref name="hibbert"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Hibbert |editor-first=Christopher |editor-link=Christopher Hibbert |year=1988 |title=[[The Encyclopaedia of Oxford]] |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |chapter=Public Orator |page=341 |isbn=0-333-39917-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Orator at the University presents [[honorary degree]]s, giving an [[oration]] for each person that is honoured. They may be required to compose addresses and letters as directed by the [[Hebdomadal Council]] of the University. Speeches when members of the royal family are present may also be required. The post was instituted for a visit to [[Oxford]] by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1566. The Public Orator, [[Thomas Kingsmill (professor)|Thomas Kingsmill]], gave a very long historical speech. Sir [[Isaac Wake]] addressed [[King James I]] similarly in 1605.

At the [[University of Cambridge]], the title for the position changed from "Public Orator" to "Orator" in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orator/Public Orator |url=http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/Documents/acad/lists/Orato.html |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinity College Dublin]] in [[Ireland]] also has a Public Orator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Victor Luce, Public Orator 1972–2005 |url=http://www.tcd.ie/Classics/jvl/ |publisher=[[Trinity College Dublin]] |location=[[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]] |accessdate=10 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no equivalent position in [[United States|American]] universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schilling |first=Bernard N. |date=June 1959 |title=The Public Orator and Gradum Honoris Causa |journal=[[AAUP Bulletin]] |volume=45 |number=2 |pages=260–271 |publisher=[[American Association of University Professors]] |jstor=40222429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roland Poska''' (1938 – February 2, 2017) was an American artist who was notable for pioneering [[papermaking]] in modern art,&lt;ref name="rrs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rrstar.com/news/20170206/stupid-man-kicks-bucket?template=printart|title='Stupid' man kicks the bucket|last=Haas|first=Kevin|date=February 6, 2017|work=Rockford Star|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[printmaking]], and for frequently combining the two into completed works of art. He was also a teacher at the [[Layton School of Art]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], a co-founder of the [[Milwaukee Institute of Art &amp; Design]], and founder of the lithography studio the Fishy Whale Press.

==Biography== 
Poska was born to Lithuanian parents in Scotland in 1938. At age 10, he and his parents immigrated to the United States, and settled in [[Rockford, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="RRT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rockrivertimes.com/wpapp/vibe-entertainment/2010/09/22/ethnic-heritage-museum%E2%80%99s-polish-gallery-profiles-roland-poska/|title=Ethnic Heritage Museum’s Polish Gallery profiles Roland Poska|date=September 22–28, 2010|work=The Rock River Times|accessdate=August 22, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822095312/http://rockrivertimes.com/wpapp/vibe-entertainment/2010/09/22/ethnic-heritage-museum%E2%80%99s-polish-gallery-profiles-roland-poska/|archivedate=August 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving degrees from [[Rockford College]] and [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook Academy of Art]], he became an instructor at Rockford College, then in 1963, moved to Milwaukee, where he taught at the [[Layton School of Art]].&lt;ref name="Lituanus"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilman|first=Mack|date=Winter 1987|title=Roland Poska|journal=Lituanus|publisher=LITUANUS Foundation, Inc.|volume= 33|issue=4|issn=0024-5089}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Layton closed, he co-founded the Milwaukee School of Art and Design and taught there.&lt;ref name="rrs"/&gt;

In 1963, while attending Cranbrook, Poska was introduced to papermaking by [[Laurence Barker]], the dean of the school's graphics department.&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cutting Edge: New Directions in Handmade Paper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EI5PAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=roland+poska&amp;dq=roland+poska&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJu_7G6OnVAhUL7oMKHZANDf0Q6AEILDAB|year=1988|publisher=The Institute|isbn=0933742142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he purchased his first "beater", a machine that grinds rags and pulp in the initial step of producing handmade paper, and established his lithography studio the Fishy Whale Press.&lt;ref name="Lituanus"/&gt; At the time, his lithography press was among the largest in the United States, using {{convert|600|lb}} blocks of stone. Under the Fishy Whale imprint, Poska and artist John Doyle produced ''The Great Human Race'', a series of prints designed by Doyle that appear in the collections of a number of American museums.&lt;ref name="Lituanus"/&gt; Poska continued to develop ''The Great Human Race'' as a perpetual art and philosophy project for over 30 years.&lt;ref name="JRK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jrkortman.com/the-art-of-roland-poska-and-music-from-keith|title=The art of Roland Poska and music from Keith Grace's iPod this First Friday @ J.R.

By 1984, Poska was a nationally known artist.&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mywebtimes.com/news/illinois_ap/rockford-artist-envisions-day-without-prejudice/article_deb85984-70a9-57d6-92ce-f49978e1d9c1.html|title=Rockford artist envisions day without prejudice|last=Associated Press|date=July 28, 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he received a commission to produce a {{convert|270|ft|adj=on}} long painting ''From Blue to Blue'', which was displayed on Main Street in Rockford&lt;ref name="TT"/&gt; before its installation in Milwaukee's [[Henry S. Reuss]] Federal Plaza Building. This piece was produced in sections {{convert|6|to|8|ft}} high and {{convert|12|to|16|ft}} long, and then assembled to complete the full installation.&lt;ref name="Lituanus"/&gt;

His works are included in the collections of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/artist/Poska%2C+Roland|title=Poska, Roland The Art Institute of Chicago|work=The Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/661944|title=Prints of the Fishy Whale|work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, Poska became an outspoken activist for equality and common human rights,&lt;ref name="rrs"/&gt; and was a frequent speaker at Rockford town hall meetings.&lt;ref name="rrs2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rrstar.com/news/20160815/man-banned-from-rockford-city-hall-for-one-month-after-golf-club-incident|title=Man banned from Rockford City Hall for one month after golf club incident|last=Haas|first=Kevin|date=August 15, 2016|work=Rockford Star|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on February 2, 2017, in Rockford.&lt;ref name="rrs" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2079">A '''''répétiteur''''' (from [[French language|French]] [[verb]] ''répéter'' meaning "to repeat, to go over, to learn, to [[rehearsal|rehearse]]"&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;) is an accompanist, tutor or coach of ballet dancers or opera dancers.

== Opera ==
In [[opera]], a ''répétiteur'' is the person responsible for coaching singers and playing the [[piano]] for music and production rehearsals.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50203075?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=repetiteur&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 Oxford English Dictionary], Oxford University Press, accessed 27 July 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; When coaching solo singers or choir members, the ''répétiteur'' will take on a number of the roles of a [[vocal coach]]: advising singers on how to improve their pitch and pronunciation, and correcting note or phrasing errors.

''Répétiteurs'' are skilled musicians who have strong [[sight-reading]] and score reading skills. In addition to being able to sight read piano parts, a ''répétiteur'' can play on the piano an orchestral score reducing it in real-time ([[orchestral reduction]]), by reading from a large open score of all of the instruments and voice parts. ''Répétiteurs'' are also skilled in following the directions of a conductor, in terms of changing the tempo, pausing, or adding other nuances.

== Ballet ==
In [[ballet]], a ''répétiteur'' teaches the steps and interpretation of the roles to some or all of the company performing a dance.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; Several late 20th-century choreographers, such as [[George Balanchine#External links|George Balanchine]], [[Jerome Robbins#External links|Jerome Robbins]] and [[Twyla Tharp]], have established trusts and appointed conservators—hand-picked dancers who have intimate knowledge of particular ballets—as ''répétiteurs'' of their works.

SHU Luxembourg is the European branch of the [[Sacred Heart University]], Jack Welch College of Business,in Fairfield, Connecticut (CT) &lt;sup&gt;'''(*1).'''&lt;/sup&gt; The university has been established in Luxembourg for over 25 years '''&lt;sup&gt;(*2)&lt;/sup&gt;,''' offering MBA graduate level programs tailored to the needs of working professionals. Its program specializations feature full-time MBA program with an internship, a part-time MBA program, part-time certificate programs, as well as a variety of one-week seminars.

== History ==
In 1991 the Jack Welch College of Business opened its European branch in Luxembourg. Since then the Sacred Heart University (SHU) Luxembourg has been offering a part-time MBA program and graduate certificates tailored to the needs of the professionals working in Luxembourg. Executive Education and 1-week seminars are also available. In 2012 the full-time MBA with Internship program was added. 

Created in 1991, the university was derived out of the need to connect professionals with an academic institution which would provide the necessary training in order to advance in their career. Henri Ahlborn '''&lt;sup&gt;(*15)&lt;/sup&gt;,''' the then director of the Chamber of Commerce, reached out to universities in the United States in order to find a suitable institution. As a result, Sacred Heart University has been offering an internationally accredited MBA program in Luxembourg, the first of its kind in Luxembourg. The Program taking flight in 1991, its focus surrounded providing a sustainable executive education conjoined with hands on experience in international business affairs.&lt;sup&gt;'''(*3)'''&lt;/sup&gt;

In January 2006, the Sacred Heart’s College of Business was named after the former chairman and CEO of the [[General Electric]] Company, [[Jack Welch|John F. Welch]]. As part of his commitment to the university, Mr. Welch has volunteered to be actively involved with the Jack Welch College of Business through ongoing advice and guidance&lt;sup&gt;'''(*4)'''&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Sarkis Djanbazian''' ({{lang-hy|Սարգիս Ջանբազյան}}; {{lang-fa|سرکیس جانبازیان}}), also written as Sarkis '''Janbazian''', (15 January 1913 in [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]] &amp;ndash; 11 December 1963 in [[Tehran]]) was a [[Imperial Russia|Russian]]-born [[Iranian Armenians|Iranian-Armenian]] artist. He was the first male ballet master, dancer, choreographer, producer, as well as the founder of a ballet academy in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

==Biography==
Sarkis Djanbazian was born in [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Armenia]]). As the ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' states, from early childhood, Djanbazian took an avid interest in the arts, especially in dance.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; After graduating from high school, he went to [[Leningrad]] (St. Petersburg at the time) to study dance. He graduated from [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet|Vaganova Dance Academy]] of Leningrad on 14 January 1936 and from [[Lesgaf University]] with a Masters of Arts degree on 15 November 1936.&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/djanbazian-sarkis--ballet-master|title=DJANBAZIAN, Sarkis|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, he worked as a principal dancer, choreographer, and artistic director in [[Kirov Theatre]] in Leningrad until July 1938.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

As the Russian Communist government exercised heavy political pressure on [[Armenians in Russia|Armenians]], Djanbazian left Russia for Iran in 1938, settling in [[Qazvin]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; There, he decided to found a dance school. However, upon being expelled after this proposal to the city council, he turned himself to the Armenian Church in Qazvin. With allowance of the Church's head priest, he was allowed to hold dance classes on the rooftop of the church,&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; in the same year of 1938.&lt;ref name=snodgrass&gt;Mary Ellen Snodgrass. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=DNvaCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA155 ''The Encyclopedia of World Ballet''] Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 8 jun. 2015 {{ISBN|978-1442245266}} p 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Djanbazian left Qazvin for Tehran in 1942. There, he started to give dancing classes in the Armenian Kušeš high school after the lessons had ended, initially for some 150 students.&lt;ref name=snodgrass /&gt; His perseverance, energy, and tireless effort made him establish the [[Tehran Ballet School]] in 1942 in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

Djanbazian staged many full stage ballets in Iran. As the ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' states, these included but are not limited to [[Alexander Pushkin]]’s “Fountain of Baghchehsarai” and “Dreams of Hafez,”&lt;ref name=snodgrass /&gt; and [[Reinhold Glière]]’s “Chinese Flower Girl,”&lt;ref name=snodgrass /&gt; and choreographed shorter ballets such as “Jealousy” (Ḥesādat),&lt;ref name=snodgrass /&gt; “Persian Miniature” (Miniātorhā-ye Irāni),&lt;ref name=snodgrass /&gt; “Anuš,” as well as several classical and traditional Persian dance pieces including “Gol-e gandom,” “Woodchopper” (Tabar-zan), “Sailors” (Malavānān), “Life and Death” (Zendegi va marg, widely known as “Snake Dance” or Raqṣ- mār), “Prayers in the mountains” (Raqṣ-e namāz), “Qāli-e Kermān,” and “Šālikāri”.&lt;ref name=snodgrass /&gt; As the ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' states, Djanbazian took a great deal of interest in [[Iranian culture]], and tried tirelessly to incorporate Iranian themes and stories in his artistic work. Despite his lack of fluency in [[Persian language|Persian]], his interest in Persian literature led him, with the collaboration of [[Ehsan Yarshater]], to the production and staging of “Rostam and Tahmina” ballet, based on a love story in the Ferdowsi’s [[Shahnameh]]. Over the course of his career, he collaborated with many artists and intellectuals of the time. He also served, in 1948, as the head of the faculty at the National Guard and Armed Forces Academy (Laškar-e gard-e šāhanšāhi), where he trained high-ranking officials of the country.&lt;ref&gt;communication with A. Djanbazian; “Djanbazian Dance Academy,” ref. no. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ''Encyclopedia Iranica'' lastly states, Djanbazian founded the Folk Dance and Song Ensemble (Goruh-e raqṣ o āvāz-e maḥalli) conducted by maestro Edik Hovespian in 1959. Later on, this ensemble continued their performances under the direction of maestro Hovik Gasparian at the second national dance festival in Iran in 1962. Sarkis Djanbazian died of heart attack at the age of fifty on 11 December 1963 in Tehran. His greatest concern was that his school might not continue after his death. The school remained open and instructors such as Yagāna Šāygān, ʿAbd-Allāh Nāẓemi, Yerjanik Djanbazian, and Zohra Amjadi taught there until Djanbazian’s daughter, Anna, returned home after the completion of her dance education in Russia. She took over the academy in 1972 and managed it until 1984, when she left Iran and continued her dance activities in the United States, at the [[Djanbazian Dance Company]] in [[La Crescenta, California]].&lt;ref name=snodgrass /&gt;

===Personal life===
In 1950, Djanbazian married Fleur Djanbazian; they had two children, Anna and Albert Djanbazian. Anna received her education in dance first under her father’s direction and then continued her training in [[Soviet Union|Russia]] after her father died.

'''Somali National Academy of Culture''' ('''SNAC'''), also known as the '''Somali National Academy of Arts, Sciences and Literature''', was an important institution in [[Somalia]] that was responsible for the preservation and exploration of national [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] and other material of national importance. 

==Establishment==
The Somali National Academy of Culture was created to further the Somali cultural repository by collecting and researching all things [[Somali people|Somali]]. In 1969, nine years after independence, the Somali central government began many national development projects. 

SNAC was born out of the 1972 government decree, which called for a standard [[Somali orthography|orthography ]] for the [[Somali language]]. The Somali National Academy and its supporting institutions played an important role when it came to researching and understanding Somali [[history of Somalia|history]], [[Somali culture|culture]] and [[Somali mythology|folklore]]. The center's first president was the Somali [[linguist]] who invented the [[Somali alphabet|Somali National Script]], [[Shire Jama Ahmed]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, "Cultures and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwoord Press : 2001), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area of responsibility==
Somali National Academy of Culture collected and stored volumes of material which was previously in the hands of private individuals.  SNAC administration and staff had direct collaborations with other higher learning institutions such as the Gaheyr and [[Lafoole University|Lafoole universities]]. Garhey University later became the [[Somalia National University]] (Jaamacada Ummada Soomaaliyeed). Public institutions in Mogadishu including the Somali National University, received significant improvements and expansion throughout the 1970s and 80s.  

There were a number of Somali government ministries which housed material for the Somali National Academy of Culture. These ministries included education (Waxbarashada), National Guidance Hanuuninta), higher education (Tacliinta Sare), Movie Agency (Wakaalada Filimada) and other government centers.  

==Use as a research center==
The Somali National Academy of Sciences, Arts and Culture presented any new material among other places, at either the [[National Theatre of Somalia|National Theatre]] (Tiyaatarka Qaranka) or [[National Museum of Somalia|National Museum]] (Madxafka Qaranka), both situated in [[Mogadishu]]. University graduates went to do postgraduate work at the National Academy.&lt;ref&gt; I.M. Lewis, ''A Pastoral Democracy: A study of Pastoralis and politics among....'', (Hamburg, 1999, prevace to the 19982&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The National Academy contributed in the famous Literacy Campaign in Somalia, where it released and collected new volumes of recorded material, movies, paintings and posters. Later on, by the mid 1970s, university students and foreign researchers found enough material to conduct research at various SNAC run centers.

'''Stemettes''' is a [[social enterprise]] which encourages girls aged between 5–22 years old to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths, or [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]. Stemettes runs panel events, [[hackathon]]s, the Student to Stemette mentoring programme supported by [[Deutsche Bank]], Outbox Incubator and an app, OtotheB, an online platform for girls interested in STEM and [[entrepreneurship]].

==History==
Stemettes was started in 2013 by British mathematics and computing child prodigy [[Anne-Marie Imafidon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Women in Science: Meet the Stemettes star inspiring more girls into STEM|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/women-science-meet-stemettes-star-inspiring-more-girls-into-stem-1543094|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Jacquelyn Guderley became co-founder of Stemettes alongside Imafidon.{{clarify|reason=makes no sense - if she joined 2 years after it was started then she cannot be co-founder|date=December 2017}}

Stemettes has partnered with organisations including [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Salesforce]], [[Accenture]], [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[BP]] and [[Microsoft]]. The organisation is regularly called upon by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] and [[European Commission]] to consult on matters related to women in STEM.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Outbox Incubator==
For six weeks from July–August 2015, Stemettes ran Outbox Incubator in London. This residential business incubator for girls with STEM start-ups became known as the “X-men house for girls”&lt;ref&gt;Ravanona, Anna. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anne-ravanona/inside-outbox-incubator-m_b_8423472.html Inside Outbox Incubator: Meet the Startups Built By Girls in STEM - Part 1], [[The Huffington Post]], 29 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the Outbox Incubator spin-off app, OtotheB, was officially launched. The app is an online platform for girls interested in STEM and entrepreneurship. The app has been well received by some STEM figures such as academic and campaigner [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], who described the app as a “…fantastic new resource for young women interested in technology”.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, John. [http://irishtechnews.net/ITN3/stemettes-launch-ototheb-app-to-inspire-girls-into-stem-careers Stemettes launch OtotheB app to inspire girls into STEM careers],[http://irishtechnews.net/ITN3/ Irish Tech News], 11 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Stemettes was named as European Digital Impact Organisation of the Year in October 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalimpactaward.com/2014/11/01/2014-european-digital-impact-organisation 2014 European Digital Impact Organisation],[http://dlii.org/ Digital Leadership Institute].

The '''Technology for Improved Learning Outcomes (TILO)''' program works in nine (9) governorates across [[Egypt]] to improve the quality of teaching and learning through the use of technology in schools.

The [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] and the TILO team are working closely with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology and private sector partners to develop scalable models to integrate the use of education technology into school based reform activities in ways that improve student learning outcomes.

==Schools==
TILO works in two different types of schools:

* 85 experimental prep schools that are transformed into TILO Smart Schools (TSS schools) in seven governorates
* 192 primary and preparatory schools undergoing school based reform (SBR schools) in seven governorates

==History==
Israel's Compulsory Education Law&lt;ref&gt;CMIP 2000 report, p. 9: "The Compulsory Education Law adopted in 1949, extended in 1968, 1979 and 1999"&lt;/ref&gt; provides free and compulsory education for all children between the ages of 5 to 18, from the last year of kindergarten up to 12th grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Or Kashti |date=25 December 2007 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/knesset-extends-compulsory-education-law-to-12th-grade-1.235897 |title=Knesset extends compulsory education law to 12th grade |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments of Hebrew textbooks in relation to their depiction of Arabs==

===''Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace'' findings===
An analysis of Israeli textbooks in 2000 by the [[Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace]] (CMIP), now known as the Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education, found that the legitimacy of the State of Israel as an independent Jewish state on the territory of the Land of Israel and the immigration of Jews to the country was never questioned. There was no indoctrination against the Arabs as a nation, nor a negative presentation of Islam. Islam, Arab culture and the Arabs' contribution to human civilization were presented in a positive light. No book called for violence or war. Many books express the yearning for peace between Israel and the Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecomtrade.co.il/eMall/shops/1559/imgbank/Israeli%20Report%20-%20September%202000.pdf CMIP 2000 report, p. 6 Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace report]&lt;/ref&gt;

In textbooks for state-run schools, there was an effort to remove stereotypes and educate towards tolerance. In some textbooks for the Orthodox Jewish community, the researchers found derogatory adjectives, prejudices, patronizing expressions and disrespect toward Arabs. The Arab leadership was portrayed as motivated by an eternal hatred independent of historical circumstances. In textbooks for every age, Israel's wars are described as justified wars of defense, and the Arabs held responsible for them.&lt;ref&gt;CMIP 2000 report, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]] is attributed to the fact that the Arabs fled from their homes. Only a few textbooks stated that some refugees were expelled by Israel or were forced to flee through threats. Some do not mention the Palestinian exodus at all.&lt;ref&gt;CMIP 2000 report, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, [[Islam]] is described with respect in both the general the religious state-run educational streams. Many books elaborate in detail how [[Muhammad]] established Islam and explain its fundamentals in a factual, objective manner. Many books highlight positive aspects in Islam. The language is factual and devoid of offensive terms and stereotypes. Sites holy to both Jews and Muslims are not presented as exclusively Jewish and the Arabs' attachment to these sites is taught. The students are even taught about the Muslims affinity to Jerusalem, although, the focus is on the religious, rather than the political dimension.&lt;ref name="CMIP 2000 report, p.7"&gt;CMIP 2000 report, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The CIMP report found that it was only in the ultra-orthodox stream that textbooks contained prejudice, patronizing expressions and disrespect to Arabs.&lt;ref name=CMIP_rpt2000&gt;[http://www.teachkidspeace.org/reports/IsraeliTextbooks2000.pdf Arabs and Palestinians in Israeli Textbooks, September 2000 Report] by [[Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace]] (also available at [http://www.edume.org]), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

The report further stated that in textbooks of both the general state-run network and the religious state-run network, there was a genuine effort to remove stereotypes and to build a foundation for coexistence and mutual respect between the two peoples. There are many stories that describe friendships between Jews and Arabs in Islamic countries and in Israel even in times of war. There are stories of Jews helping Arabs in daily life and in war as well as stories of Arabs rescuing Jews from physical harm and helping Jews to maintain their religion and identity. In many literary anthologies there are stories about the daily life of Arabs written by Arab authors. Some stories deal with the tensions created by the transition from a traditional society with its values and customs, to a modern western society.&lt;ref name="CMIP 2000 report, p.7"/&gt; In some books in the ultra-orthodox network relations between Arabs and Jews were portrayed in negative terms.  The official list of textbooks referred to is not compulsory, but was an indication of the Ministry of Education's recommendations, as published in a memo signed by the Ministry's Director.&lt;ref name=CMIP_rpt2000/&gt;

;2001 update
CMIP states that no negative changes were noted in the new textbooks with regard to the image of the Arabs, the description of the conflict, the presentation of Islam, questions of war and peace and education to tolerance and conciliation. On the contrary, the positive trends noted in the earlier report were strengthened. The textbooks of the ultra-Orthodox schools continued to use language conveying an air of superiority.

Maps of Israel included all the territory between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan. Many textbooks showed maps of the Middle East on which only Israel's name appeared, with the territories of the surrounding Arab countries left blank.&lt;ref name=CMIP_rpt2001&gt;[http://www.teachkidspeace.org/reports/IsraeliTextbooks2002.pdf 2002 Update by CMIP]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2011}}

===Other studies===
In his 2004 article "The Arab Image in Hebrew School Textbooks", Dan Bar-Tal of [[Tel Aviv University]] studied 124 textbooks used in Israeli schools. He concluded that generations of Israeli Jews have been taught a negative and often delegitimizing view of Arabs. He claims Arabs are portrayed in these textbooks as primitive, inferior in comparison to Jews, violent, untrustworthy, fanatic, treacherous and aggressive. While history books in the elementary schools hardly mentioned Arabs, the high school textbooks that covered the Arab–Jewish conflict stereotyped Arabs negatively, as intransigent and uncompromising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=len traubman|title=Reports on Palestinian kids' hatred grossly exaggerated|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/21668/reports-on-palestinian-kids-hatred-grossly-exaggerated/|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=[[j.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nurit Peled-Elhanan]], a professor of language and education at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], published ''Palestine in Israeli School Books: Ideology and Propaganda in Education'', an account of her study of the contents of Israeli school books. She asserts that the books promote [[racism]] against and negative images of Arabs, and that they prepare young Israelis for their compulsory military service. After examining "hundreds and hundreds" of books, Peled-Elhanan claims she did not find one photograph that depicted an Arab as a "normal person". She has stated that the most important finding in the books she studied concerns the historical narrative of events in 1948, the year in which Israel fought a war to establish itself as an independent state. She claims that the killing of Palestinians is depicted as something that was necessary for the survival of the nascent Jewish state. "It's not that the massacres are denied, they are represented in Israeli school books as something that in the long run was good for the Jewish state."&lt;ref name=Elhanan&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Academic claims Israeli school textbooks contain bias|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/israeli-school-racism-claim|accessdate=8 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he Israeli version of events are stated as objective facts, while the Palestinian-Arab versions are stated as possibility, realized in openings such as 'According to the Arab version' ... [or] 'Dier [sic.] Yassin became a myth in the Palestinian narrative ... a horrifying negative image of the Jewish conqueror in the eyes of Israel's Arabs'.&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine in Israeli School Books'', pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to previous studies of Israeli school textbooks, Peled-Elhanan states that, despite some signs of improvement in the 1990s, the more recent books do not ignore, but justify, issues such as the Nakba. For example, in all the books mentioning Deir Yassin, the massacre is justified because: "the slaughter of friendly Palestinians brought about the flight of other Palestinians which enabled the establishment of a coherent Jewish state."&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine in Israeli School Books'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

She also states that contrary to the hope of previous studies "for 'the appearance of a new narrative in [Israeli] history textbooks' ... some of the most recent school books (2003–09) regress to the 'first generation' [1950s] accounts — when archival information was less accessible — and are, like them 'replete with bias, prejudice, errors, [and] misrepresentations'" (''Palestine in Israeli School Books'', p. 228).

In 2013, it was reported that Israeli science textbook publishers had been instructed to remove details of "human reproduction, pregnancy prevention and sexually transmitted diseases from science textbooks used in state religious junior high schools as well as from their teacher manuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lior Dattel |author2=Yarden Skop |title=Israeli Science Textbook Publishers Ordered To Censor Human Reproduction |url=http://forward.com/articles/183346/israeli-science-textbook-publishers-ordered-to-cen/ &lt;!-- original: http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.545015 --&gt; |accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=The Forward|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arabic textbooks==

According to a 2011 report by the Arab Cultural Association, Arabic textbooks provided to third grade to ninth grade students in Israeli schools contained at least 16,255 mistakes. The report was based on a study and examination of textbooks in all subjects by a committee, headed by Dr. Elias Atallah. Association director Dr. Rawda Atallah said the findings were not surprising, since they were similar to the findings of a previous study published in November 2009, which reported that more than 4,000 mistakes in language and syntax were found in textbooks for second grade students in Arab schools. Researchers also spoke about the way in which Arab students' cultural and national identities are covered. For example, while textbooks state that Jews and non-Jews live in the Galilee, the word "Arab" is never mentioned. Dr. George Mansour, who examined the history textbooks, reported that they ignored the presence of the Arab-Palestinian people in Israel and stressed the Promised Land of the Jewish people: "There is a process of de-Palestinization, instilling of the Zionist narrative and minimizing of Arab culture," reported Dr. Mansour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-s-textbooks-in-arabic-are-full-of-mistakes-study-finds-1.360617|title=Israel textbooks in Arabic are full of mistakes|newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date= 9 May 2011| author= Jack Khoury |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nakba terminology==
Israel has ordered the word [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]] to be removed from Israeli Arab textbooks. The term was introduced in books for use in Arab schools in 2007 when the Education Ministry was run by [[Yuli Tamir]] of the Labour party. Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] justified the ban by saying that the term was "propaganda against Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLM2389 |title=Israel bans "catastrophe" term from Arab schools |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tsunesaburō Makiguchi''' (牧口 常三郎, ''Makiguchi Tsunesaburō'' 23 July 1871&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Makiguchi|first=Tsunesaburō|date=1989|title=Education for Creative Living|trans-title=Ideas and Proposals of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Education_for_Creative_Living.html?id=AUY4AAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|language=English|location=Iowa, U.S.|publisher=Iowa State University Press|isbn=0813803918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.verypdf.com/u/71844/api/20150918-030325-5850041233.pdf|title=Significant SGI Dates|work=VeryPDF Software|publisher=VeryPDF Software}}&lt;/ref&gt; [Lunar calendar date on 6 June] – 18 November 1944) was a Japanese educator who founded and became the first president of the Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai (Value-Creating Education Society), the predecessor of today's [[Soka Gakkai]].

== Early life and career ==
Makiguchi was born in the small village of [[Kashiwazaki, Niigata]] Prefecture, Japan, in 23 July 1871 (Lunar calendar date on 6 June). Adopted by the Makiguchi family, he moved to [[Hokkaido]], Japan's northernmost island, at the age of 14. Working his way through school, he graduated from [[Sapporo]] Normal School (today's [[Hokkaido University of Education]]). First employed as an assistant teacher at a primary school affiliated with his alma mater, he later taught high school and served as a dormitory superintendent.

Although he was recognized as an able teacher, Makiguchi's uncompromising attitude toward authorities created problems. His clashes with officials of the Ministry of Education, school inspectors, ward assemblymen, city councilmen, and top officials of the city of Tokyo were frequent and resulted in his frequent transfers from one school to another.&lt;ref&gt;Murata, Kiyoaki. ''Japan's New Buddhism: An Objective Account of Soka Gakkai.'' New York and Tokyo: Weatherhill, 1969. pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to Tokyo, he served as principal in a succession of six primary schools, from 1913 to 1932.

During those years, he devoted much consideration to the relationship between life and education, developing his theories on ''sōka'' or the creation of value, the happiness of the individual, the prosperity of society at large, and their interrelationships in practice.

== Educational reformer ==
His pioneering work ''Jinsei Chirigaku'' (''A Geography of Human Life''), published in 1903, predates the academic study of geography at the [[Imperial Universities]] of Kyoto and Tokyo in 1907 and 1911, respectively. Written between the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the work presents [[human geography]] as a subject for both [[formal learning|formal]] and [[nonformal learning]] to advance an understanding of cultural differences shaping and shaped by the relationship between human activity and its natural environment.&lt;ref name=Odata1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Odata |first=Toshihiro |date=1994 |title=牧口常三郎 『人生地理学』 の地理学史上の再評価 |trans-title=A Reappraisal of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi's 'Jinsei Chirigaku' in the History of Geography in Japan |language=Japanese |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/chirikagaku/49/4/49_KJ00003719645/_pdf/-char/en |format=pdf |journal=Chiri-Kagaku [Geographical Sciences] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=197–212 |doi=10.20630/chirikagaku.49.4_197 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |layurl=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/chirikagaku/49/4/49_KJ00003719645/_article}}&lt;/ref&gt; While "Japanese geographers of the time were chiefly concerned with describing the physical features of the earth,"&lt;ref&gt;Murata, p72&lt;/ref&gt; Makiguchi was arguably the first to discuss human geography as a system of knowledge correlating [[location theory]] and [[spatial distribution]] of human phenomena with economic, social and political geographies.&lt;ref name=Takeuchi-Nozawa1988&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Takeuchi |first1=Keiichi |last2=Nozawa |first2=Hideki |title= Recent Trends in Studies on the History of Geographical Thought in Japan—Mainly on the History of Japanese Geographical Thought |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/grj1984b/61/1/61_1_59/_pdf/-char/en |format=pdf |journal= Geographical Review of Japan |volume=61 (Ser. B) |number=1 |pages=59–73 |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64–65}} In Makiguchi's words, "it is through our spiritual interaction with the earth that the characteristics that we think of as human are ignited and nurtured within us."&lt;ref&gt;Makiguchi, Tsunesaburo. A Geography of Human Life. Ed. by Dayle M. Bethel. Caddo Gap Press, 2002, p25&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Makiguchi also formulated the concept of humanitarian competition as an approach to international relations, writing that: "The important thing is the setting of a goal of well being and protection of all people, including oneself but not at the increase of self-interest alone. In other words, the aim is the betterment of others and in doing so, one chooses ways that will yield personal benefit as well as benefits to others. It is a conscious effort to create a more harmonious community life."&lt;ref&gt;Makiguchi. A Geography of Human Life. p.286&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to problems throughout the education system that resulted from the Meiji government's adoption of the [[Imperial Rescript]], Makiguchi published the first volume of ''Sōka Kyōikugaku Taikei'' (''The System of Value-Creation Pedagogy'') together with his close friend and disciple [[Jōsei Toda]] on November 18, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Kumagaki, Kazunori. "Value-Creating Pedagogy and Japanese Education in the Modern Era," ''The Journal of Oriental Studies, vol. 10 (2000) Special Issue'', p31&lt;/ref&gt; The date was later adopted as the Founding Day of Sōka Gakkai. The four-volume work, published over a period of five years, sets forth his thoughts on education and proposals for systemic reform. Rather than education serving the state, as embodied in the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]], Makiguchi proposed a student-centered education with the purpose of ensuring the happiness of the learner.&lt;ref&gt;Kumagai, pp32-34&lt;/ref&gt;

He also proposed the creation of an educational system comprising a partnership of school, home and community. In this system, a child would spend half a day in school and the other half in apprenticeships and other types of work activities at home and in the community befitting the nature and needs of the child. Makiguchi felt that implementing such a system would change bored, apathetic learners into eager, self-directed students.

"Makiguchi developed a theory of value that combined the idea of happiness as the goal of life with that of value as something that can be created. ... In value-creating pedagogy the main point of education is to aim for a happy life and develop the ability and attitude required to create value."&lt;ref&gt;Kumagai, p41&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai ==
In 1928, Makiguchi and Jōsei Toda converted to [[Nichiren Buddhism]]. Makiguchi's encounter with this school of Buddhist thought took his life into an even deeper and broader dimension, resulting in the establishment of the Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai (Value-Creation Education Society), the predecessor of today's Soka Gakkai. In Nichiren's teachings Makiguchi found support for his theory of value-creation and a world view consistent with his aims of educational reform and social betterment centered on addressing the subjective realities of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miwa |first=Zeho |date=December 2002 |title=A consideration of how the works of Nichiren were received by readers: the case of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi |journal=Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies |volume=51 |number=1 |pages=520–524 |doi=10.4259/ibk.51.524 |access-date=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be said that Makiguchi created and developed a grassroots movement as the foundation of a lasting peace, an objective he perceived at the very heart of Nichiren Buddhism.

== Wartime arrest ==
During [[World War II]], he opposed Japan's military government's attempts to impose the doctrine of [[State Shinto]] through strict control of religions and thoughts inimical to its war effort. While there was some debate as to whether Makiguchi's actions were in direct opposition to the war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miyata|first=Koichi|year=2002|title=Critical Comments on Brian Victoria's "Engaged Buddhism: A Skeleton in the Closet?"|url=http://www.globalbuddhism.org/jgb/index.php/jgb/article/view/38/46|deadurl=no|journal=Journal of Global Buddhism|volume=3|pages=79–85|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801184920/http://www.globalbuddhism.org/jgb/index.php/jgb/article/view/38/46|archivedate=August 1, 2018|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Victoria|first=Brian|year=2001|title=Engaged Buddhism: A Skeleton in the Closet?|url=http://www.globalbuddhism.org/2/victoria011.html|deadurl=yes||journal=Journal of Global Buddhism|volume=2|pages=72–91|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531021739/http://www.globalbuddhism.org/2/victoria011.html|archivedate=May 31, 2013|accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is clear that "his outspoken criticism of the prevailing belief system represents an implicit and explicit protest against an extreme [[brainwashing|abuse of the educational process]] for militarist purposes."&lt;ref name=Ito2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ito |first=Takao |title=Reading Resistance: The Record of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi's Interrogation by Wartime Japan's 'Thought Police' |journal=Educational Studies|volume=45 |issue=2|pages=133–145 |doi=10.1080/00131940902762169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, due to his refusal to accept the [[talisman]] and support the war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tmakiguchi.org/religiousreformer/asreligiousreformer/detainmentinterrogation.html|title=Tsunesaburo Makiguchi|author=Tsunesaburo Makiguchi Website Committee|work=Religious Reformer|publisher=Soka Gakkai}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was arrested and imprisoned as a "thought criminal" together with [[Jōsei Toda]] and 20 senior leaders of Sōka Kyōiku Gakkai for violating the [[Peace Preservation Law#Public Security Preservation Law of 1925|Peace Preservation Law]] revised in 1941 and under which tens of thousands were arrested. Yet, in spite of being subjected to harsh interrogations, he never retreated from his beliefs; the 72-year-old former principal continued to assert the value of [[freedom of religion]] as a fundamental [[human rights|human right]]. On November 18, 1944, he died in prison of extreme malnutrition. His remains were laid to rest at [[Taiseki-ji]], the head temple of [[Nichiren Shōshū]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel B. Montgomery: Fire in the Lotus, Mandala 1991, S. 186-187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrs.vcu.edu/profiles/SokaGakkai.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Makiguchi is remembered to this day by members of the Soka Gakkai in Japan and the [[Soka Gakkai International]] (SGI) around the world. During morning and evening prayers, members take a moment to express gratitude to the first three presidents of Soka Gakkai: Tsunesaburō Makiguchi (president from 1930-1944), Jōsei Toda (president from 1951–1958), and [[Daisaku Ikeda]] (president from 1960–1979, honorary president from 1979 to the present and president of SGI from 1975 to the present).

A secular network of Soka schools around the world, including several independent secondary schools, and two universities ([[Sōka University]] of Japan and [[Soka University of America]]) were established by Daisaku Ikeda based on Makiguchi's pedagogy.

Makiguchi's value-creating system of education has attracted the attention of educators around the world. His ''Sōka Kyōikugaku Taikei'' has been translated into [[English language|English]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. In [[Brazil]], Makiguchi's theory of education based on value-creation has been sponsored in 55 schools and introduced in 1,103 classrooms to more than 340,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;de Melo Silva, Dilma, "Makiguchi Project in Action—Enhancing Education for Peace," The Journal of Oriental Studies, vol. 10 (2000), p62&lt;/ref&gt;

It is listed as a [[University college (Scandinavia)|university college of art]], but unlike the other university colleges its name is officially translated into English as "university".&lt;/ref&gt; offering higher education in the fields of [[dance education]], [[folk dance]], [[dance]], [[dance therapy]], [[historical dance]], [[choreography]] and [[contemporary circus]]. Since 1 January 2014, DOCH is a part of [[Stockholm University of the Arts]]. It operates under the [[Ministry of Education (Sweden)|Ministry of Education]], and is fully funded by the Government and therefore has no tuition fees for Swedish and EU citizens.

The University of Dance and Circus was previously known as the University College of Dance (''Danshögskolan'').

==Circus programme==
Attendance at the [[circus school]] is awarded on the basis of live auditions held in [[Stockholm]], with tests of physical strength, flexibility, endurance and theatrical skill. In addition each applicant is required to give a demonstration of their own performance specialty.

The program, headed by [[Ivar Heckscher]], trains students in [[acrobatics]], [[equilibristics]], [[Aerial circus arts|aerial technique]], and [[juggling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.danshogskolan.se/dh/english/programme_in_neo_circus.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609220839/http://www.danshogskolan.se/dh/english/programme_in_neo_circus.html |archive-date=2007-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, each student receives advanced training in at least one discipline. The neocircus program includes theoretical studies to complement each student's personal artistic development.

Until 2007 no Americans had ever been accepted into the neocircus program.  In June 2007, American [[juggling|juggler]] [[Wes Peden]] became one of 16 students chosen from 68 candidates, who were culled from 200 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airplayjugglers.com/peden2sweden.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Where Do Teenagers Come From?''' was an American television teen comedy/documentary that aired as an ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' on March 5, 1980. The live action/animation  program was produced by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]] and was a sequel to the 1977 program ''[[My Mom's Having a Baby]].'' The special was notable for its signature song "Growing Up," written by Doug Goodwin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvmusicmuseum.com/documents/612.html From TV Music Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
When 12-year-old Kelly begins to experience changes in her body, she, along with Petey and Oscar,  once again visit Dr. Lendon Smith, who uses an animated film that explains in detail (via Smith's narraration) of how teenagers, especially young girls, experience adolescence and how her body changes.

==Critical reception==
As with the first outing, it also had its share of criticism for using a daytime program to showcase what was seen as [[sex education]]. However, this sequel was not as popular as the first outing.

==Cast==
*Shane Sinutko as Petey Evans
*Jarred Johnson as Oskar
*Rachael Longaker as Kelly
*[[Lendon Smith]] as himself
*Stephanie Steele as Julie
