In 2001, the [[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] and the [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]] ended their partnership with the California AIDSRide over concerns that not enough money was going to the charities. They hired Honeycutt Group, a consulting firm started by three former Pallotta TeamWorks employees, to organize [[AIDS/LifeCycle]], a similar event. [[Dan Pallotta]] unsuccessfully sued the "copycat" event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/03/01/319484/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Dan Pallotta's bike-tour and walkathon business has raised more than $200 million for AIDS research &amp; other charities.

An '''Agonalia''' or '''Agonia''' was an obscure archaic [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious observance]] celebrated in [[ancient Rome]] several times a year, in honor of [[List of Roman deities|various divinities]]. Its institution, like that of other religious rites and ceremonies, was attributed to [[Numa Pompilius]], the [[Roman mythology|semi-legendary]] second [[king of Rome]]. [[Roman calendar|Ancient calendars]] indicate that it was celebrated regularly on January 9, May 21, and December 11.

A festival called Agonia or '''''Agonium Martiale''''', in honor of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], was celebrated March 17, the same day as the [[Liberalia]], during a prolonged "war festival" that marked the beginning of the season for [[military campaign]]ing and [[Roman agriculture|agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "On the Magical Significance of the Tail," in ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), p. 148; [[John Scheid]], ''An Introduction to Roman Religion'' (Indiana University Press, 2003), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The object of this festival was a disputed point among the ancients themselves, but as [[Johann Adam Hartung|J.A. Hartung]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Adam Hartung]], ''Die Religion der Römer'', vol. ii p33, 1836&lt;/ref&gt; the offering was a [[Sheep|ram]] ''(aries)'', the usual victim sacrificed to the [[tutelary deity#Ancient Rome|guardian gods of the state]]; the presiding priest was the ''[[rex sacrificulus]]'', and the site was the [[Regia]], both of which could be employed only for ceremonies connected with the highest gods that affected the wellbeing of the whole state.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name was also a subject of much dispute among the ancients. The various etymologies proposed are given at length by [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' i.319‑332&lt;/ref&gt; None of these, however, is satisfactory. One possibility is that the sacrifice in its earliest form was offered on the [[Quirinal|Quirinal Hill]], which was originally called ''Agonus'', at the [[Porta Collina|Colline gate]], ''Agonensis''. The sacrifice is explicitly located at the Regia, or the ''[[domus]] regis'' ("house of the king"), which in the historical period was at the top of the [[Via Sacra]], near the [[arch of Titus]], though one ancient source states that in earliest times, the Regia was on the Quirinal.

The Circus Agonensis, as it is called, is supposed by some to have occupied the place of the present [[Piazza Navona]], and to have been built by the emperor [[Alexander Severus]] on the spot where the victims were sacrificed at the Agonalia. It may not, however, have been a [[circus (building)|circus]] at all, and Humphrey omits the site in his work on Roman circuses.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing'' (University of California Press, 1986), p. 543; Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==January 9==
An ''Agonium'' occurs on January 9 in the ''[[Fasti Praenestini]]'', albeit in mutilated form.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ovid]]'s poem on the Roman calendar, he calls it once the ''dies agonalis'' ("agonal day")&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' 1.318 and 324; Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 6.12, called it ''agonales'', plural.&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere the Agonalia,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 1.325.&lt;/ref&gt; and offers a number of etymologies of varied plausibility. [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] explains the word ''agonia'' as an [[Old Latin|archaic Latin]] term for ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#hostia|hostia]]'', a sacrificial victim.&lt;ref&gt;See also Ovid, ''Fasti'' 1.331.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo]] thought the Romans had a god named Agonius,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' 4.11.16.&lt;/ref&gt; who might then have been the god of the Colline part of the city&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 281, note 5, citing Ambrosch, ''Studien'', p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#Etymology|"Etymology" above]]).

==December 11==
This third occurrence of the Agonia or Agonalia shares the date of December 11 with the [[Septimontium]] or ''Septimontiale sacrum'', which only very late Roman calendars take note of and which depends on a [[textual criticism|textual conjecture]]. The relation between the two observances, if any exists, is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; A fragmentary inscription found at Ostia that reads: "Agonind" testifies that this festival was dedicated to Sol Indiges. It was indeed the second festival celebrating this deity, after that of August 10.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grenier ''Indigetes et noveniles'' "Boletim de filologia" 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Agonium Martiale''==
The Agonia to Mars occurs during a period of festivals in March (Latin ''Martius''), the namesake month of Mars. These were the [[chariot race]]s of the Equirria February 27, a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feria]]'' on the [[Kalends]] of March (a day sacred also to [[Mars (mythology)#Birth|his mother]] [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]), a second Equirria on March 14, his Agonalia March 17, and the [[Tubilustrium]] March 23.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 37; the views of [[Georg Wissowa]] on the festivals of Mars framing the military campaigning season, with additional festivals in October, are summarized by C. Bennett Pascal, "October Horse," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 85 (1981),  p. 264, with bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

A note on the holiday from [[Varro]] indicates that this Agonia was of more recondite significance than the [[Liberalia]] held on the same day. Varro's source is the books of the Salian priests surnamed ''Agonenses'', who call it the Agonia instead.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 6.14.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Masurius Sabinus]], the Liberalia was called the ''Agonium Martiale'' by the [[College of Pontiffs|pontiffs]].&lt;ref&gt;As preserved by [[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.4.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars are inclined to think that the sharing of the date was a coincidence, and that the two festivals were unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], concurring with [[Georg Wissowa]], ''Roman Festivals'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Russian News Agency "TASS"]], "Arirang is a gymnastics and artistic festival, known as mass games. The extravaganza unfolds an epic story of how the Arirang nation of Korea, a country of morning calm, in the Orient put an end to the history of distress and rose as a dignified nation with the song 'Arirang'. The Arirang performance has been included in the Guinness Book of Records."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DPRK prepares for celebration of victory in the 1950–1953 war under rain|url=http://tass.ru/en/russia/697486|accessdate=16 March 2015|agency=[[Russian News Agency "TASS"]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Laika ac Arirang Mass Games (7934639696).jpg|thumb|A scene from the 2012 Arirang Festival]]
The name refers to "[[Arirang]]", a Korean folk story about a young couple who are torn apart by an evil landlord, here intended to represent the [[division of Korea]].

The festival was held annually between 2002 and 2013, with the exception of 2006. The mass games were not held in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nknews.org/2014/02/no-arirang-mass-games-this-year/|title=No Arirang Mass Games this year|author=Leo Byrne|publisher=NK News|date=6 February 2014|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, foreign tourists have been allowed to watch one of the many performances.&lt;ref name="reuters flood 2007"&gt;{{cite news| url=  http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKSEO29172020070827
| title=  North Korea halts showcase mass games due to flood| publisher=  [[Reuters]]| date=  27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass games returned after a five-year hiatus, taking place from 9 September through 30 September 2018. The new installment is called [[The Glorious Country]] ({{lang|ko|빛나는 조국}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mailchi.mp/e94e5cd6d1d8/highlight-tour-70th-anniversary-national-day-visit-mt-paektu-volcano-1357721|title=The Mass Games are confirmed| work=[[Uri Tours]] | date=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
The Mass Games possess an important ideological character praising the [[Workers' Party of Korea]], [[Korean People's Army|its armed forces]], [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Kim Jong-il]]. These messages may not be clear to [[Tourism in North Korea|foreign spectators]], who are not aware of North Korean iconography: a rising sun symbolizes Kim Il-sung. When a gun is shown, it signifies the gun which Kim Il-sung gave to his son Kim Jong-il. The colour red, particularly in flowers, stands for the working class, and the colour purple and red flowers represent Kim Il-sung (as the flower [[Kimilsungia]] is a purple [[orchid]] and the flower [[Kimjongilia]] is a red [[begonia]]). A snowy mountain with a lake represents [[Baekdu Mountain|Mount Paektu]], where Kim Jong-il is said to have been born in a log cabin.

"'''Bastille Day'''" is a song by the Canadian [[rock music|rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], and is the opening track from their third album, ''[[Caress of Steel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caress of Steel: Released September 1975 |url=http://www.2112.net/xanadu/archives.htm#cos |publisher=2112.net |accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most Rush songs, the music was written by [[Geddy Lee]] and [[Alex Lifeson]], and the lyrics by [[Neil Peart]]. The song uses the [[storming of the Bastille]], which began the [[French Revolution]], as an allegory for revolutionary fervor needed in the struggle against tyrannical government.  It is therefore in the same vein as other libertarian-themed songs from the early stages of Rush's career, including "Anthem", "[[Closer to the Heart]]", "[[Freewill (song)|Freewill]]", "Something for Nothing", and "A Farewell to Kings", when the band — Neil Peart and Geddy Lee in particular — was influenced by the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] philosopher [[Ayn Rand]].&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Rush, and Rock, Chris Matthew Sciabarra, The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies (Volume 4, Number 1): 161-85 (2002), reprinted at https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/rush.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Live versions of the song appear on the albums ''[[All the World's a Stage (album)|All the World's a Stage]]'' and ''[[Different Stages (Rush album)|Different Stages]]''. The last time it was performed live was in 1981, but an instrumental section was played during the ''[[R30: 30th Anniversary Tour|R30 Tour]]'' as part of the "[[Rush instrumentals#R30 Overture|R30 Overture]]," which opened concerts on that tour.

[[Progressive metal]] band [[Dream Theater]], originally known as "Majesty," took their original name from founding drummer [[Mike Portnoy]]'s description of the ending of "Bastille Day" as "majestic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dream Theater: 20 Majestic Years |url=http://www.therecordmag.com/sep2006/dream.htm |publisher=therecordmag.com |accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3449">'''''Bisaya Magasin''''' is a weekly [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] magazine now published by the [[Manila Bulletin Publishing Corporation]], [[Philippines]]. It has the record of being the oldest magazine in Cebuano which is still published, and "the most successful periodical in Cebuano" (CCP, p. 542).

==History==
''Bisaya Magasin'' was established by [[Ramon Roces]] upon the request of Cebuano poet [[Vicente Padriga]], who became its first editor. Its first issue appeared on August 15, 1930, as part of the magazines published by Liwayway Publishing, Inc.

During the [[Second World War]], the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops including the local Visayan guerrilla resistance fighters was fought against the Japanese Imperial forces led by General Sosaku Suzuki during the Battle for the Liberation of Visayas in 1945. ''Bisaya'' stopped publication; it was revived on August 14, 1946. It had an initial circulation of 5,000, which rose to around 60,000 in the 1960s.

In June, 1948, ''Bisaya'' started a monthly sister publication, ''Saloma'', a literary pamphlet which carried a complete novel in every issue. ''Saloma'' lasted until the late 1950s, with a circulation ranging from 8,000 to 22,000.

==Popular writers==
''Bisaya'' magazine is considered the barometer for Visayan literary artist. Many Cebuano literary stalwarts made their names in the pages of ''Bisaya'': Natalio Bacalso, Severino Retuya, Marcel Navarra, Piux Kabahar, Sulpicio Osorio, Estrella Alfon, Lina Espina-Moore, and President [[Carlos P. Garcia]]. 

Contemporary Cebuano writers today, such as Gremer Chan Reyes with his historical novel about Cebu entitled ''Ang Gugma Walay Pag-abot'' (English: Tomorrow Will Not Come; Tagalog: Hindi Darating Ang Bukas), currently serialized in ''Bisaya''. From Atty. Ver Quimco's legal column to Prof. Amelia Bojo's opinion pieces, and a host of others, ''Bisaya'' offers a variety of reading fare.

==Content==
''Bisaya'' has a balanced content (40% literary and 60% popular).
Ang Gugma Walay Pag-abot means "Love Can't Wait"

==Award==
One of the latest accolades ''Bisaya'' received together with its sister regional publications ''[[Bannawag]]'', ''[[Liwayway]]'' and ''[[Hiligaynon magazine|Hiligaynon]]'' is the Diamond Cultural Award presented by Publishers Association of the Philippines on December 12, 2008 in [[Baguio City]], Philippines.

[[File:The House of Leaves - Burning 4.jpg|thumb|Contemporary book burning.]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14597, Berlin, Opernplatz, Bücherverbrennung.jpg|thumb|Thousands of books smoulder in a huge bonfire as Germans give the Nazi salute during the wave of book-burnings that spread throughout Germany.]]

'''Book burning''' is the ritual destruction by fire of books or other written materials, usually carried out in a public context. The burning of books represents an element of [[censorship]] and usually proceeds from a cultural, religious, or political opposition to the materials in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005852 |title=Holocaust Encyclopedia: Book Burning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the destroyed works are irreplaceable and their burning constitutes a severe loss to [[cultural heritage]]. Examples include the [[burning of books and burying of scholars]] under China's [[Qin Dynasty]] (213–210 [[BCE]]), the burning of the [[Library of Alexandria]] (c. 49), the obliteration of the [[House of Wisdom|Library of Baghdad]] (1258), the destruction of [[Aztec codices]] by [[Itzcoatl]] (1430s), and the burning of [[Maya codices]] on the order of bishop [[Diego de Landa]] (1562).

In other cases, such as the [[Nazi book burnings]], other copies of the destroyed books survive, but the instance of book burning becomes emblematic of a harsh and oppressive regime which is seeking to censor or silence an aspect of a nation's culture.

Book burning can be an act of contempt for the book's contents or author, and the act is intended to draw wider public attention to this opinion. Examples include the burning of [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s books by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and the [[2010 Qur'an-burning controversy]].

[[Art destruction]] is related to book burning, both because it might have similar cultural, religious, or political connotations, and because in various historical cases books and artworks were destroyed at the same time.

In modern times, other forms of media, such as [[gramophone record|phonograph records]], [[Video|video tapes]], and [[Compact disc|CDs]] have also been burned, shredded, or crushed.

When the burning is widespread and systematic, destruction of books and media can become a significant component of [[cultural genocide]].  

==Historical background==
[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|In 1933, Nazis burned works of Jewish authors, and other works considered "un-German", at the library of the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] in Berlin.]]

The burning of books has a long history as a tool wielded by authorities both [[civil authority|secular]] and [[Religion|religious]], in efforts to suppress [[dissent]]ing or [[heresy|heretical]] views that are perceived as posing a [[threat]] to the prevailing order.

=== 700 BC===

According to the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), in the 7th century BCE King [[Jehoiakim]] of Judah burned part of a scroll Baruch ben Neriah had written at prophet [[Jeremiah]]'s dictation (Jeremiah 36).

=== Burning of books and burying of scholars in China (210-213 BC) ===
[[File:Killing the Scholars, Burning the Books.jpg|thumb|[[Burning of books and burying of scholars|''Killing the Scholars and Burning the Books'']] in 210-213 BC (18th century Chinese painting).]]

[[Qin Shi Huang]], first emperor of [[Qin Dynasty]], ordered a [[Burning of books and burying of scholars]] in 213 BC and [[burial alive]] of 460 Confucian scholars in 210 BC in order to stay in the throne. Some of these books were written in [[Shang Xiang]], a superior school founded in 2208 BC. The event caused the loss of many philosophical treatises of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. The official philosophy of government ("[[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]]") survived.

=== Christian burnings ===
In Acts in the New Testament Paul performed an exorcism in Ephesus. After men in Ephesus failed to perform the same feat many gave up their "curious arts" and burned the books because apparently they didn't work.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And many that believed, came and confessed and shewed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.&lt;ref&gt;
Acts 19:18-20.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the [[First Council of Nicea]] (325 AD), Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]] issued an [[edict]] against [[nontrinitarian]] [[Arians]] which included a prescription for systematic book-burning: &lt;blockquote&gt; "In addition, if any writing composed by [[Arius]] should be found, it should be handed over to the flames, so that not only will the wickedness of his teaching be obliterated, but nothing will be left even to remind anyone of him. And I hereby make a public order, that if someone should be discovered to have hidden a writing composed by Arius, and not to have immediately brought it forward and destroyed it by fire, his penalty shall be death. As soon as he is discovered in this offense, he shall be submitted for capital punishment....."&lt;ref&gt;Edict by Emperor Constantine against the Arians. {{cite web |last= Athanasius |title= Edict by Emperor Constantine against the Arians |url= http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/urkunde-33 |work= Fourth Century Christianity |publisher= Wisconsin Lutheran College |accessdate= 2 May 2012 |date= 23 January 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110819215807/http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/urkunde-33 |archivedate= 19 August 2011 |df= dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; According to [[Elaine Pagels]], "In AD 367, [[Athanasius]], the zealous bishop of [[Alexandria]]... issued an Easter letter in which he demanded that [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian monks]] destroy all such unacceptable writings, except for those he specifically listed as 'acceptable' even 'canonical'—a list that constitutes the present 'New Testament'".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Pagels, ''Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas'' (Random House, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pkSrV5cEBp8C&amp;pg=PT64&amp;lpg=PT64&amp;dq=%22Athanasius,+the+zealous+bishop%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=unXWU7aJPc&amp;sig=zzREpVJnvIgLLPmg55fONbDlCXI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YB7_U7LiOM_pggTCtoLoCg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Athanasius%2C%20the%20zealous%20bishop%22&amp;f=false n.p.]&lt;/ref&gt; (Pagels cites Athanasius's Paschal letter (letter 39) for 367 AD, which prescribes a canon but does not explicitly order monks to destroy excluded works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xxv.iii.iii.xxv.html |title= NPNF2-04.

==== Burning of the Library of Alexandria ====
{{Main|Destruction of the Library of Alexandria}}
The stories surrounding the loss of the great [[Library of Alexandria]] include:

* Emperor [[Aurelian]]'s (270–275 AD) sack of Alexandria in 272 AD, which badly damaged the section of the city which housed part of the library.
* Supposedly (but incorrectly) the religious riots aimed against pagan temples and their rituals in 391 AD, sanctioned by decree of Emperor [[Theodosius I]] and led by [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Pope]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Phillips|first1= Heather|title= The Great Library of Alexandria?|journal= Library Philosophy and Practice|date= 2010|url= http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm|accessdate= 3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Much of its downfall was gradual, often bureaucratic, and by comparison to our cultural imaginings, somewhat petty."&lt;ref&gt;Heather Phillips (2010). "The Great Library of Alexandria?". Library Philosophy and Practice.&lt;/ref&gt; (Compare: El-Abbadi, M. (1990). The Life and Fate of the Ancient Library of Alexandria. Mayenne, France: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, for tales of survival of the collection, in part, into the era of the [[Caliphate]].)

==== Burning of Nestorian books ====
Activity by [[Cyril of Alexandria]] ({{circa}} 376–444) brought fire to almost all the writings of Nestorius (386-450) shortly after 435.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aina.org/books/mokk/mokk.htm#fn1 |title=The Monks of Kublai Khan |publisher=Aina.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'The writings of Nestorius were originally very numerous',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Chapman|first1= John|title= Nestorius and Nestorianism|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10755a.htm|website= New Advent|publisher= The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Baum, Wilhelm and Dietmar W. Winkler. 2003. The Church of the East: A Concise History. London: Routledge.

==== Burning of Arian books ====

According to the [[Chronicle of Fredegar]], [[Recared]], [[Visigothic Kingdom|King of the Visigoths]] (reigned 586–601) and first Catholic king of [[Hispania|Spain]], following his conversion to [[Catholicism]] in 587, ordered that all [[Arian]] books should be collected and burned; and all the books of Arian theology were reduced to ashes, along with the house in which they had been purposely collected.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan McMillan, Wolfgang van Emden, Philip E. Bennett, Alexander Kerr, Société Rencesvals, ''Guillaume d'Orange and the chanson de geste: essays presented to Duncan McMillan in celebration of his seventieth birthday by his friends and colleagues of the Société Rencesvals'', University of Reading, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', 1776–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Which facts demonstrate that Constantine's edict on Arian works was not rigorously observed, as Arian writings or the theology based on them survived to be burned much later in Spain.

==== Burning of Jewish manuscripts in 1244 ====

In 1244, as an outcome of the [[Disputation of Paris]], twenty-four carriage loads of [[Talmud]]s and other Jewish religious manuscripts were set on fire by French law officers  in the streets of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The history of the Talmud, from the time of its formation, about 200 B.

==== Burning of Aztec and Mayan manuscripts in 1560s ====

During the conquest of the Americas and in the aftermath of the encounter between European and indigenous American civilizations, many books written by indigenous peoples were destroyed. There were many{{quantify|date=April 2018}} books written by the [[Aztec]]s in existence at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] in the 16th century.{{cn|date=April 2018}} However, most were destroyed by the [[Conquistador]]s and the Catholic [[priests]], with the exception of the work of the priest [[Bartolomé de las Casas | Bartolome de la Casas]]. In particular, many books in [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] were ordered destroyed by [[Diego de Landa|Bishop Diego de Landa]] in July 1562. De Landa wrote: "We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they (the [[Maya peoples | Maya]]) regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction." Ironically, most of the books that were destroyed by the Europeans were biased and based upon the Aztec people's version of the history of the region.{{cn|date=June 2018}} The Aztecs had previously conquered the area and destroyed many of the Mayan books and documents.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== Burning of Abbeys in Tudor and Stuart England ===

The schism between the Church of England and that of the Roman Catholic Church reached a tipping point during the Tudor and Stuart periods of England (1485-1603, 1603-1714), when the citizens loyal to Crown and Country sacked Abbeys and Monasteries across the British countryside, and pillaged their valuable books to burn, degrade, or destroy. David Cressy’s (2005) article, ''Book Burning in Tudor and Stuart England'' discussed the mechanics of these book burnings and how the enforcement was trickled down to the citizens; that everyone had a part in this “spectacle”. “Over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries book burning developed from a rare to an occasional occurrence, relocated from an outdoor to an indoor procedure, and changed from a bureaucratic to a quasi-theatrical performance” &lt;ref&gt;Cressy, D. (2005). Book Burning in Tudor and Stuart England. The Sixteenth Century Journal, 36(2), 359-374. doi:10.2307/20477359&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Burning of US Library of Congress ===

The [[Library of Congress]] was founded in 1800, 24 years after the United States gained its independence from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. In 1814, 3,000 books from the [[Library of Congress]] were used by the British forces to burn down the [[US Capitol]] during the [[Burning of Washington]]. Although there were dissenting voices to this wanton destruction, the conflagration was motivated by a strong desire on the part of the British to humiliate the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishin|location=Chicago, IL|isbn= 9781616084530|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutions dedicated to book burnings ===

[[Anthony Comstock]]'s [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], founded in 1873, inscribed book burning on its seal, as a worthy goal to be achieved. Comstock's total accomplishment in a long and influential career is estimated to have been the destruction of some 15&amp;nbsp;tons of books, 284,000&amp;nbsp;pounds of plates for printing such 'objectionable' books, and nearly 4,000,000 pictures. All of this material was defined as "[[Lascivious|lewd]]" by Comstock's very broad definition of the term—which he and his associates successfully lobbied the [[United States Congress]] to incorporate in the [[Comstock Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nazi regime (1933) ===
''Main: [[Nazi book burnings]]''

The Nazi government decreed broad grounds for burning material:

==Notable book burnings and destruction of libraries==
{{Main article|List of book-burning incidents|List of destroyed libraries}}

==Burnings by authors==
In 1588, the exiled English Catholic [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Cardinal Allen]] wrote "''[[An Admonition to the Nobility and People of England]]''", a work sharply attacking Queen [[Elizabeth I]]. It was to be published in Spanish-occupied England in the event of the [[Spanish Armada]] succeeding in its invasion. Upon the defeat of the Armada, Allen carefully consigned his publication to the fire, and it is only known of through one of Elizabeth's spies, who had stolen a copy.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic encyclopedia'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01727c.htm Spanish Armada]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hassid]]ic Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]] is reported to have written a book which he himself burned in 1808. To this day, his followers mourn "The Burned Book" and seek in their Rabbi's surviving writings for clues as to what the lost volume contained and why it was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acco-tour.50webs.com/SIDEMENU/aharonim/nahman.htm |title=עכותור - מדריכי טיולים לעיר עכו ולכל הארץ &amp;#124; מדריך טיולים &amp;#124; מסלולי טיול לקבוצות עברית + צרפתית |publisher=Acco-tour.50webs.com |date= |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlo Goldoni]] is known to have burned his first play, a [[tragedy]] called ''[[Amalasunta]]'', when encountering unfavorable criticism.

[[Nikolai Gogol]] burned the second half of his magnum opus ''[[Dead Souls]]'', having come under the influence of a priest who persuaded him that his work was sinful; Gogol later described this as a mistake.

In the 1870s [[Tchaikovsky]] destroyed the manuscript full score of his first opera, ''[[Voyevoda (opera)|The Voyevoda]]''. During the Soviet period ''The Voyevoda'' was posthumously reconstructed from surviving orchestral and vocal parts and the composer's sketches. 

After [[Hector Hugh Munro]] (better known by the [[pen name]] ''Saki'') was killed in [[World War I]] in November 1916, his sister Ethel destroyed most of his papers.

[[Joe Shuster]], who together with [[Jerry Siegel]] created the [[fictional]] [[superhero]] [[Superman]], in 1938 burned the first Superman story when under the impression that it would not find a publisher.

==Books saved from burning==

In Catholic [[hagiography]], Saint [[Vincent of Saragossa]] is mentioned as having been offered his life on condition that he consign Scripture to the fire; he refused and was martyred. He is often depicted holding the book which he protected with his life.

Another book-saving Catholic Saint is the Tenth Century St. [[Wiborada]]. She is credited with having predicted in 925 a [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasion]] of her region in Switzerland. Her warning allowed the priests and religious of St. Gall and St. Magnus to hide their books and wine and escape into caves in nearby hills.&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite mailing list | last =O'Donnell | first =Jim | publisher =[[Georgetown University]] | title =Patron saints | mailinglist =liblicense-l@lists.yale.edu | date =2003-11-20 | url =http://www.library.yale.edu/~llicense/ListArchives/0311/msg00071.html | accessdate =2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiborada herself refused to escape and was killed by the marauders, being later canonized. In art, she is commonly represented holding a book to signify the library she saved, and is considered a patron saint of [[library|libraries]] and librarians.

At the beginning of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] in the [[World War II]], two German officers - Viennese-born Lt.Col. Julius Schlegel (a Roman Catholic), and Captain Maximilian Becker (a Protestant) - had the foresight to transfer the [[Monte Cassino]] archives to the Vatican. Otherwise the archives - containing a vast number of documents relating to the 1500-years' history of the Abbey as well as some 1,400 irreplaceable manuscript [[Codex|codices]], chiefly [[patristic]] and historical  -  would have been destroyed in the Allied air bombing which almost completely destroyed the Abbey shortly afterwards. Also saved by the two officers' prompt action were the collections of the [[Keats-Shelley Memorial House]] in Rome which had been sent to the Abbey for safety in December 1942.

The [[Sarajevo Haggadah]] - one of the oldest and most valuable Jewish [[illustrated manuscript]]s, with immense historical and cultural value - was hidden from the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and their [[Ustashe]] collaborators by Derviš Korkut, chief librarian of the National Museum in [[Sarajevo]]. At risk to his own life, Korkut smuggled the Haggadah out of Sarajevo and gave it for safekeeping to a Muslim cleric in [[Zenica]], where it was hidden until the end of the war under the floorboards of either a mosque or a Muslim home. The Haggadah again survived destruction during the wars which followed the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geraldinebrooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Korkut_near-final-pages.pdf|title= The Book of Exodus: A Double Rescue in Wartime Sarajevo|date=3 December 2007|last=Brooks|first=Geraldine|format=PDF| journal=The New Yorker|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1940's France, a group of anti-fascist exiles created a Library of Burned Books which housed all the books that [[Adolf Hitler]] had destroyed. This library contained copies of titles that were burned.  These book burnings from the Nazis was an idea to help cleanse German culture of Jewish and foreign influences such as pacifist and decadent literature. The Nazis were going to make a "museum" of Judaism once the ''[[Final Solution]]'' was complete to house certain books that were saved by the Nazis themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books:A Living History|year=2011|publisher=J.Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book burning wills==

When [[Virgil]] died, he left instructions that [[Aeneid#Virgil's death and editing of the Aeneid|his manuscript of the ''Aeneid'' was to be burnt]], as it was a draft version with uncorrected faults and not a final version for release. However, this instruction was ignored. It is mainly to the ''Aeneid'', published in this "imperfect" form, that Virgil owes his lasting fame – and it is considered one of the great masterpieces of classical literature as a whole.

Before his death, [[Franz Kafka]] wrote to his friend and [[literary executor]] [[Max Brod]]: "Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Publisher's Note to ''The Castle'', Schocken Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Brod overrode Kafka's wishes, believing that Kafka had given these directions to him, specifically, because Kafka knew he would not honour them – Brod had told him as much. Had Brod carried out Kafka's instructions, virtually the whole of Kafka's work – except for a few short stories published in his lifetime – would have been lost forever. Most critics, at the time and up to the present, justify Brod's decision.

A similar case concerns the noted American poet [[Emily Dickinson]], who died in 1886 and left to her sister Lavinia the instruction of burning all her papers. Lavinia Dickinson did burn almost all of her sister's correspondences, but interpreted the will as not including the forty notebooks and loose sheets, all filled with almost 1800 poems; these Lavinia saved and began to publish the poems that year. Had Lavinia Dickinson been more strict in carrying out her sister's will, all but a small handful of Emily Dickinson's poetic work would have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Habegger|first=Alfred|title=My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson|year=2001|page=604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farr (ed.)|first=Judith|title=Emily Dickinson: A Collection of Critical Essays|year=1996|publisher=Prentice Hall International Paperback Editions|isbn=978-0-13-033524-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern biblioclasm==
Biblioclasm still occurs. All over the world schools and libraries have been destroyed in recent years. Despite the act of destroying books being condemned by the majority of society, people still participate on small and/or large scale.

In Azerbaijan, when a modified Latin alphabet was adopted, books published in Arabic script were burned, especially in the late 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Aziza Jafarzade, "[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai141_folder/141_articles/141_aziza_jafarzade.html Memoirs of 1937: Burning Our Books, The Arabic Script Goes Up in Flames]," in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 14:1 (Spring 2006), pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The texts were not limited to the Quran; medical and historical manuscripts were also destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Asaf Rustamov, [http://azeri.org/Azeri/az_english/73_folder/73_articles/73_justforkids.html "The Day They Burned Our Books,"] in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 7:3 (Autumn 1999), pp. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Book burnings were organised regularly in [[Nazi Germany]] in the 1930s by [[Sturmabteilung|stormtroopers]] to destroy ''degenerate'' works, especially by Jewish authors such as [[Thomas Mann]], [[Marcel Proust]] and [[Karl Marx]].

In the 1950s, over six tons of books by [[William Reich]] were burned in the U.S. under judicial orders.&lt;ref name="IDP"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/reich-wilhelm Reich, Wilhelm (1897-1957)], International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], a [[comic book]] burning took place 23 June 1955. It was a [[bonfire]] consisting of comic books and on top of that a life size cardboard cutout of [[The Phantom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/fantomet-paa-baalet-1955/ |title=Fantomet på bålet 1955 |publisher=Danmarkshistorien.dk |date=1940-04-09 |accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kjell Ludvik Kvavik, a senior Norwegian official, had a penchant for removing maps and other pages from rare books and was noticed in January 1983 by a young college student. The student, Barbro Andenaes, reported the actions of the senior official to the superintendent of the reading room and then to the head librarian of the university library in Oslo. Hesitant to make public something that would greatly hurt the career of Kvavik even if the accusation proved false, media kept the name of the perpetrator quiet until his house was searched by police. The authorities seized 470 maps and prints as well as 112 books that Kvavik had illegally obtained. While this may not be the large scale, violent demonstration seen during wars, Kvavik's disregard for libraries and books shows that destruction of books on any scale can affect an entire country. Here, a senior official in the Norwegian government was disgraced and the University Library was refunded only a small portion of the costs it incurred from the loss and destruction of rare materials as well as the security changes that had to be made. In this case, the draw of personal profit and enhancing one's own collection was the cause of the defacement of rare books and maps. While the main goal was not destruction for destruction's sake, the resulting damage to the ephemera still carries weight within the library community.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Lawrence. "Biblioclasm in Norway". ''Library and Archival Security'' 6. (1984): 13-16.&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1984, Amsterdam's South African Institute was infiltrated by an organized group bent on drawing attention to the inequality of the apartheid. Well-organized and ensuring patrons of the library that no harm would come to them, group members systematically smashed microfiche machines and threw books into the nearby waterway. Indiscriminate of the content being destroyed, shelf after shelf was cleared of its contents until the group left. Staff members fished books from the water in hopes of salvaging the rare editions of travel books, documents about the Boer Wars, and contemporary materials both for and against apartheid. Many were destroyed by oil, ink, and paint that the anti-apartheid demonstrators had flung around the library. The world was outraged at the loss of knowledge that these demonstrators had caused, and instead of winning support and getting attention on the issue of apartheid, the international audience cried out against the actions at the Amsterdam's South African Institute. Some demonstrators came forward to explain that they believed the institute was pro-apartheid and that nothing was being done to change the status quo in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, Rebecca. Burning Books and Leveling Libraries. Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of the digital age has resulted in an immense collection of written work being catalogued exclusively or primarily in digital form. The intentional deletion or removal of these works has been often referred to as a new form of book burning.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, Lucia. (n.d.).

Some supporters have celebrated book burning cases in art and other media. Such is the bas-relief by [[Giovanni Battista Maini]] of ''The Burning of Heretical Books'' over a side door on the façade of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, which depicts the burning of 'heretical' books as a triumph of righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Touring Club Italiano, ''Roma e Dintorni'' 1965:344.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, during the years of the Chilean fascist dictatorship under [[Augusto Pinochet]], hundreds of books were burned as a way of repression and censorship of leftist literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burning Books|last=Bosmajian|first=Haig|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=0786422084|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/the-books-have-been-burning-1.887172 |title=The books have been burning - World - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar incident also occurred in [[Mullumbimby]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] in 2009. Reported as "just like the ritual burning of books in Nazi Germany", a book-burning ceremony was held by students of the "socially harmful cult" [[Universal Medicine]], an [[Alice Bailey#Esoteric Healing|esoteric healing]] business owned by Serge Benhayon.&lt;ref name="Whitbourn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/self-styled-healer-serge-benhayon-leads-socially-harmful-cult-jury-20181010-p508ux.html|title=Self-styled healer Serge Benhayon leads 'socially harmful cult': jury|last1=Whitbourn|first1=Michaela|date=October 15, 2018|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students were invited to throw their books onto the [[pyre]].

It is estimated that during 1990s in [[Croatia]] over 2,8 million books were destroyed by the Croatian government.

==Sikh book burning==
In the [[Sikh]] religion, any copies of their sacred Guru, [[Guru Granth Sahib]] which are too badly damaged to be used, and any printer's waste which bears any of its text, are cremated. Such a cremation is called ''Agan Bhet'', and is similar to that performed when cremating a deceased Sikh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harjas.com/downloads/Press_Release_BC_Sikh_Community_March30.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Harjas.com |title=Presss Release BC Sikh Community |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615224715/http://www.harjas.com/downloads/Press_Release_BC_Sikh_Community_March30.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sikhnn.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=383 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007130434/http://www.sikhnn.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=383 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-07 |publisher=Sikhnn.com |title=4 copies damaged in New Orleans by the flood caused by Hurricane Katrina |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedsikhs.org/ghanaia/0121051.html |title= on the Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami (end of page) |publisher=unitedsikhs.org |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2006/01/happiness-and-siri-guru-granth-sahib_09.html |publisher=Mrsikhnet.com |title=Blog query about an accumulation of download printouts of Sikh sacred text |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110133818/http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2006/01/happiness-and-siri-guru-granth-sahib_09.html |archivedate=10 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book burnings in popular culture==
&lt;!-- Please include citations for any entries in this section, to keep it from becoming a list of trivia. See [[WP:INPOPCULTURE]]. --&gt;
In his 1821 play, ''Almansor'', the German writer [[Heinrich Heine]]—referring to the burning of the [[Muslim]] holy book, the [[Qur'an]], during the [[Spanish Inquisition]]—wrote, "Where they burn books, so too will they in the end burn human beings." ("''Dort, wo man Bücher verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am Ende Menschen.''") Over a century later, Heine's own books were among the thousands of [[List of book-burning incidents#Jewish, anti-Nazi and "degenerate" books (by the Nazis)|volumes that were torched]] by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in Berlin's [[Bebelplatz|Opernplatz]], even while his poem [[Die Lorelei]] continued to be printed in German schoolbooks as "by an unknown author".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/10/book-burning-quran-history-nazis|title=Book-burning: fanning the flames of hatred|last=Henley|first=Jon|date=10 September 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ray Bradbury|Ray Bradbury's]] [[Fahrenheit 451]], the book deals with the concept of censorship via burning books. It is said that Bradbury wrote the book due to his concerns of literature being burned in America during the McCarthy era and as well, fearing that mass media (television especially) reduce the interest in reading books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-13|title=Fahrenheit 451|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fahrenheit_451&amp;oldid=836176213|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese light novel series {{Nihongo|[[Library War]]|図書館戦争|Toshokan Sensō}}, by [[Hiro Arikawa]], describes how an armed Library Defence Force protects libraries from censorship after a lethal attack at library. Which is later adapted to manga, 12-episode anime, internet radio shows, and finally live action films and special TV episode.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4467">'''Christmas in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]''' starts with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Feast of St Thomas (Basque)|eu|3=San Tomas jaia|lt=Feast}} of [[Thomas the Apostle|Santo Tomas]] on 21 December, a celebration in which most people go out onto the streets&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/basque-country-big-society-spain Basque country’s thriving big society] Retrieved 29 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to dance and eat [[Talo (food)|talo]] with [[chistorra|txistorra]] (a type of [[Basque people|Basque]] [[chorizo]]). They wear a traditional outfit called the [[casera]] dress. For girls it consists of a long skirt and a long-sleeved old-fashioned shirt with headscarves and aprons. The boys wear a long black shirt, trousers and '''[[Beret#Basque Country|txapela]]''' (traditional black [[beret]]). The casera outfits are normally dark blue, but can come in many colors. They wear caseras because that is what the people of the mountain wear and the holiday used to celebrate the peasants who sold their goods in town and came on Santo Tomas to pay rent to landlords in the city.

==The Santa of Basque Country==
In the Basque Country the equivalent of [[Santa Claus|Santa]] is [[Olentzero]], and Olentzero lives or lived (depending on what you believe) in the mountains, and he wears the boys' casera. He is a mythical Basque character who is widely portrayed as a messenger who cries out that it is [[Christmas]] time throughout all the corners of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tourism.euskadi.net/x65-12375/en/contenidos/evento/0000038221_m1_rec_turismo/en_38221/38221.html Christmas in Basque country at the Euskadil Tourism board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303184013/http://tourism.euskadi.net/x65-12375/en/contenidos/evento/0000038221_m1_rec_turismo/en_38221/38221.html |date=2014-03-03 }} Retrieved 29 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions, the [[Olentzero]] is a farmer or a shepherd. Nevertheless, it is common in all of the tales&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andalusia-travel.com/174/2010-0217/bask-olenzero-en.html The Basque Country is waiting for Olentzero via Spain news] Retrieved 29 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Olentzero]] brings good news to people.

He is also known as the coal man who comes down from the mountains on his [[pottok]] (wild Basque horse) to hand out presents&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourisme-aquitaine.fr/news/christmas-traditions.html Christmas traditions] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130702012300/http://www.tourisme-aquitaine.fr/news/christmas-traditions.html |date=2013-07-02 }} Retrieved 29 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to children. Chestnuts and wine are given to the villagers. By tradition, on December 24, the Basque television and radio stations broadcast that the [[Olentzero]] has begun his journey from the mountains to children's homes.

In [[Francoist Spain]] (1939 - 1975), Olentzero was banned as a symbol of regional separatism. It was only after the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] that the tradition was restored to the Basque Country.

==Christmas Day==
On Christmas Day all the children in the Basque Country go to sleep early&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buber.net/Basque/Folklore/christ.html Christmas in the Basque Country] Lifted from Euskal Etxeak 6-7, page 11. Retrieved 29 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and they leave their shoes in the middle of whatever room in the house that isn't the bathroom or their bedroom. Olentzero leaves all the presents beside the shoes. On [[New Year's Day]] some people put on their casera dresses and they go sing to the retired people in the retirement home. The day after in the morning, whether it's raining or snowing, it's a tradition for some people to go swim in the sea (if there is a sea in their town or city). The one other day that is important to the Basques is the 6th of January (the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Day of the Three Kings]]).  On that night the same happens. The children leave their shoes out and in the night the Three Kings come and leave presents, but much less than [[Olentzero]] does.

'''''Dmitry Donskoy''''' ''({{lang-ru|Дмитрий Донской}}''), also known as ''The Battle of Kulikovo ({{lang-ru|Куликовская битва}})'' was the first [[opera]] written by [[Anton Rubinstein]]. It has three acts and a [[libretto]] by Count [[Vladimir Sollogub]] and [[Vladimir Zotov]], based on a drama by [[Vladislav Ozerov]]. First performed in 1852, the opera, apart from its overture, is now lost.

==Background==
Rubinstein asked for a libretto from Sollogub, who had also worked on [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s successful opera ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'', on what was ostensibly also a nationalist theme, the success of [[Dmitry Donskoy]] at the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] (1380) against the commander of the [[Tatars|Tatar]] [[Golden Horde]], [[Mamai]]. However he ignored the historic elements in favour of a fairly routine operatic love story.

The overture was completed first and was performed at a concert in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2007), 27&lt;/ref&gt; But Rubinstein faced trouble with the Russian [[censorship|censor]]s, who forbade any stage presentation of Donskoy himself singing. Eventually the score was approved in 1851, and the first performance took place on 30 April 1852 at the [[Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre]] in [[St. Petersburg]]. The censors however insisted that the title be rendered as ''The Battle of Kulikovo''. Rubinstein wrote to his mother 'This is not so terrible. The public will gradually find out what the real names are'.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2007), 30&lt;/ref&gt; The composer was pleased by the reception, although he complained about the quality of the singers: nonetheless he reported that 'The success was enthusiastic!' &lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2007), 34&lt;/ref&gt; However the opera had only four performances and does not seem to have been revived. Only the score of the overture has survived, together with one aria and some vocal parts in archives in St. Petersburg.

==Synopsis==
Donskoy wins the hand of Ksenia over his rival Tverskoy when he leads the victory over Mamai in the Battle of Kulikovo.

== History ==
The rover is an autonomous six-wheeled terrain vehicle originally planned and designed to weigh up to {{convert|295|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, approximately 60% more than NASA's 2004 [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'',&lt;ref name="mepag.jpl.nasa.gov"&gt;{{Cite conference |url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/mar-09/09_ExoMars_Status_MEPAG_09_Final.pdf |title=ExoMars Status |conference=20th Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group Meeting. 3–4 March 2009.

Since the rover communicates with the ground controllers via the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]], and the orbiter only passes over the rover approximately twice per sol, the ground controllers will not be able to actively guide the rover across the surface.

On 27 March 2014, a "Mars Yard" was opened at [[Airbus Defence and Space]] in [[Stevenage]], UK, to facilitate the development and testing of the rover's autonomous navigation system.

=== Core drill ===
The present environment on Mars is exceedingly hostile for the widespread proliferation of surface life: it is too cold and dry and receives large doses of solar [[UV]] radiation as well as [[cosmic radiation]]. Notwithstanding these hazards, basic [[microorganism]]s or their ancient remains may be found in protected places underground or within rock cracks and inclusions.&lt;ref name="orbiter"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2009/03/nasa_pursues_mars_methane_orbi.html |title=NASA pursues Mars methane orbiter |work=Nature.com/Newsblog |first=Eric |last=Hand |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sampling from beneath the Martian surface with the intent to reach and analyze material unaltered or minimally affected by [[cosmic radiation]] is the strongest advantage of the ExoMars rover. The ExoMars [[core drill]] was fabricated in Italy and is called DEEDRI.&lt;ref name="Coradini2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~atreya/Proceds/2001_MA_MISS.pdf |title=MA_MISS: Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies |journal=Advances in Space Research |first1=A. |last1=Coradini |first2=G. |last2=Piccioni |first3=S. |last3=Amici |first4=R. |last4=Bianchi |first5=F. |last5=Capaccioni |first6=M.

The drill will acquire a core sample {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter by {{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, extract it and deliver it to the inlet port of the Rover Payload Module, where the sample will be distributed, processed and analyzed. The ExoMars drill embeds the Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies (Ma-Miss) which is a miniaturised [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrometer]] devoted to the borehole exploration. The system will complete experiment cycles and at least two vertical surveys down to 2 metres (with four sample acquisitions each). This means that a minimum number of 17 samples shall be acquired and delivered by the drill for subsequent analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/43611-rover-drill/ |title=The ExoMars drill unit |publisher=European Space Agency |date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/43612-rover-sample-handling/ |title=Sample Preparation and Distribution System (SPDS) |publisher=European Space Agency |date=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drill mechanism transfers the sample to the sample container that presents the material to three analytic instruments: [[MicrOmega-IR]], [[Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer|MOMA]] and [[Raman Laser Spectrometer]].

=== Pasteur instrument suite ===
The science package in the ExoMars rover will hold a variety of instruments collectively called ''Pasteur suite'';&lt;ref name="Instruments"/&gt; these instruments will study the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] for [[Planetary habitability|habitability]], and possible past [[biosignature]]s on Mars. These instruments are placed internally and used to study collected samples:&lt;ref name="instruments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/ |title=The ExoMars Rover Instrument Suite |publisher=European Space Agency |date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news8-2012"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/50692-inside-exomars-issue-8/ |title=Inside ExoMars |publisher=European Space Agency |issue=8 |date=August 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer]]''' ('''MOMA''') is the rover's largest instrument. It will conduct a broad-range, very-high sensitivity search for organic molecules in the collected sample. It includes two different ways for extracting organics: [[Soft laser desorption|laser desorption]] and thermal volatilisation, followed by separation using four [[GC-MS]] columns. The identification of the evolved organic molecules is performed with an [[Quadrupole ion trap|ion trap mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref name=Vago/&gt; The [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] is leading the development.

These data will be vital for interpreting past and present geological processes and environments on Mars.

===Optional scouting micro rover===

NASA's Mars rover [[Spirit (rover)|''Spirit'']] got stuck permanently in soft sand in 2009, so European engineers are assessing the option of including a "scout" micro rover to prod the ground 5 meters ahead of this primary rover to improve the mission safety and speed by determining the suitability of the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thenakedscientists.com/articles/interviews/what-does-mars-feel |title=What does Mars feel like? |work=The Naked Scientists |first1=Izzie |last1=Clarke |first2=Elie |last2=Allois |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sonsalla&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.faster-fp7-space.eu/uploads/90_1.pdf |title=Concept Study for the FASTER Micro Scout Rover: Abstract |conference=12th Symposium on Advanced Space Technologies in Automation and Robotics. 15-17 May 2013.

==Types of errors==
A list of types of errors that can occur:
* An omission error is when one or more responses fails.
* A [[computer crash|crash error]] is when nothing happens. A crash is a special case of omission when all responses fail.
* A [[Timing failure|Timing]] error is when one or more responses arrive outside the time interval specified. Timing errors can be ''early'' or ''late''. An omission error is a timing error when a response has infinite timing error.
* An arbitrary error is any error, (i.e. a wrong value or a timing error).
* When a client uses a [[server (computing)|server]] it can cope with different type errors from the server.
** If it can manage a crash at the server it is said to assume the server to have crash failure semantics.
** If it can manage a service omission it is said to assume the server to have omission failure semantics.
*** Failure semantics are the type of errors that are expected to appear.
* Should another type of error appear it will lead to a service failure because it cannot be managed.

'''''Fritz the Cat''''' is a 1972 American [[adult animated]] [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]].  It was Bakshi's feature film debut and is loosely based on the [[Fritz the Cat]] comic strips by [[Robert Crumb]].  It was the first animated feature film to receive an [[X rating]] in the United States.

The film stars Fritz (voiced by [[Skip Hinnant]]), an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] cat in mid-1960s New York City who explores the ideals of [[hedonism]] and sociopolitical consciousness. The film is a [[satire]] focusing on American college life of the era, race relations, the [[free love]] movement, and [[left-wing|left-]] and [[right-wing politics]].

The film had a troubled production history and controversial release. Crumb had disagreements with the filmmakers over the film's political content.&lt;ref name="Maremaa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrier-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrier-5"/&gt; ''Fritz the Cat'' was controversial for its rating and content, which many viewers at the time found to be offensive.  It was produced on a budget of $700,000&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;Cohen, Karl F. (1997). ''Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America''. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers, pgs 82-83, {{ISBN|978-0786420322}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and grossed over $90 million worldwide.  Its success led to a slew of other X-rated animated films and a sequel, ''[[The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat]]'' (1974), made without Crumb's or Bakshi's involvement.

==Plot==
In a [[New York City]] park, [[hippie]]s have gathered with guitars to sing [[protest song]]s. Fritz and his buddies show up in an attempt to meet girls. When a trio of attractive females walk by, Fritz and his friends exhaust themselves trying to get their attention, but find that the girls are more interested in the [[crow]] standing a few feet away. The girls attempt to flirt with the crow, making unintentionally condescending remarks about [[black (people)|black]]s, while Fritz looks on in annoyance. Suddenly, the crow rebukes the girls with a snide remark, indicates that he is [[gay]] and walks away. Fritz invites the girls to "seek the truth", bringing them up to his friend's apartment, where a wild party is taking place. Since the other rooms are crowded, Fritz drags the girls into the bathroom and the four of them have [[group sex]] in the bathtub.

Meanwhile, the [[police]] (portrayed as [[pig]]s) arrive to raid the party. As the two officers walk up the stairs, one of the party-goers finds Fritz and the girls in the bath tub. Several others jump in, pushing Fritz to the side where he takes solace in [[marijuana]]. The two officers break into the apartment, but find that it is empty because everyone has moved into the bathroom. Fritz takes refuge in the toilet when one of the pigs enters the bathroom and begins to beat up the partygoers. As the pig becomes exhausted, a very stoned Fritz jumps out, grabs the pig's gun, and shoots the toilet, causing the water main to break and flooding everybody out of the apartment. The pigs chase Fritz down the street into a [[synagogue]]. Fritz manages to escape when the congregation gets up to celebrate the United States' decision to send more weapons into [[Israel]].

Fritz makes it back to his dormitory, where his roommates ignore him. He decides to ditch his bore of a life and sets all of his notes and books on fire. The fire spreads throughout the dorm, finally setting the entire building ablaze. In a bar in [[Harlem]], Fritz meets Duke the Crow at a billiard table. After narrowly avoiding getting into a fight with the bartender, Duke invites Fritz to "bug out", and they steal a car, which Fritz drives off a bridge, leading Duke to save his life by grabbing onto a railing. The two arrive at the apartment of a drug dealer named Bertha, whose [[Joint (cannabis)|cannabis joints]] increase Fritz's libido. While having sex with Bertha, he comes to a realization that he "must tell the people about the revolution!" He runs off into the city street and incites a riot, during which Duke is shot and killed.

Fritz hides in an alley where his older fox girlfriend, Winston Schwartz, finds him and drags him on a road trip to San Francisco. When the car runs out of gas in the middle of the desert, he decides to abandon her. He later meets up with Blue, a [[heroin]]-addicted [[Nazi]] rabbit biker. Along with Blue's horse girlfriend, Harriet, they take a ride to an underground hide-out, where several other revolutionaries tell Fritz of their plan to blow up a power station.

When Harriet tries to get Blue to leave with her to go to a Chinese restaurant, he hits her several times and ties her down with a chain. When Fritz objects to their treatment of her, he is hit in the face with a candle by a member of the group. Blue and the other revolutionaries then gang-rape her. After setting the dynamite at the power plant, Fritz suddenly has a change of heart, and unsuccessfully attempts to remove it before being caught in the explosion. At a [[Los Angeles]] hospital, Harriet (disguised as a nun) and the girls from the New York park come to comfort him in what they believe to be his last moments. Fritz, after reciting the speech he used to pick up the girls from New York, becomes revitalized and has sex with the trio of girls while Harriet watches in astonishment.

==Background==
[[Robert Crumb]] (b. 1943) was still a teenager when he created the character [[Fritz the Cat]] for self-published comics magazines he made with his older brother [[Charles Crumb|Charles]].  The character first appeared to a wider public in [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s humor magazine ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]'' in 1965.{{sfn|Creekmur|2010|p=228}}  &lt;!-- no need to go overboard on the detail on how this progressively developed --&gt;The strips place anthropomorphic characters—normally associated with children's comics—in stories with drugs, sex, and other adult-oriented content.{{sfn|Creekmur|2010|p=229}}  Crumb left his wife in 1967 and moved to San Francisco, where he took part in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and indulged in drugs such as [[LSD]].  He had countercultural strips published in underground periodicals{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=193}} and in 1968 published the first issue of ''[[Zap Comix]]''.  Crumb's cartoons became progressively more transgressive, sexually explicit, and violent,{{sfn|Harvey|1996|pp=195–196}} and Crumb became the center of the burgeoning [[underground comix]] movement.{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=214}}  Fritz became one of Crumb's best-known creations, particularly outside the counterculture.{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=218}}

[[Ralph Bakshi]] majored in cartooning at the [[High School of Art and Design]]. He learned his trade at the [[Terrytoons]] studio in New York City, where he spent ten years animating characters such as [[Mighty Mouse]], [[Heckle and Jeckle]], and [[Deputy Dawg]]. At the age of 29, Bakshi was hired to head the [[Famous Studios|animation division]] of [[Paramount Pictures]] as both writer and director, where he produced four experimental short films before the studio closed in 1967.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. |location=North Carolina |ISBN=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Ralph Bakshi's ''Fritz the Cat'' and ''Heavy Traffic'' |pages=81–84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With producer [[Steve Krantz]], Bakshi founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions. In 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for [[Coca-Cola]] and ''[[Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse]]'', a series of educational shorts paid for by [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |page=58|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Television/radio Age |year=1969 |publisher=Television Editorial Corp |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. In a 1971 article for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Bakshi said that the idea of "grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous."&lt;ref name="Barrier-1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartOne/FritzOne.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'': Bucking the Tide |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |author=Barrier, Michael |authorlink=Michael Barrier (historian) |date=Spring 1972 |work=Funnyworld | issue=14 |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi soon developed ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'', a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt;

While browsing the East Side Book Store on [[St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St. Mark's Place]], Bakshi came across a copy of ''R. Crumb's Fritz the Cat'' (1969). Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |page=60|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi was interested in directing the film because he felt that Crumb's work was the closest to his own.&lt;ref name="BakshiOn-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=38&amp;pos=0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027075512/http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=38&amp;pos=0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 27, 2007 |title=Bakshi on ... Fritz |accessdate=October 6, 2007 |work= |publisher=The official Ralph Bakshi website |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Krantz arranged a meeting with Crumb, during which Bakshi showed Crumb drawings that had been created as the result of Bakshi attempting to learn Crumb's style to prove that he could translate the look of Crumb's artwork to animation.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; Impressed by Bakshi's tenacity, Crumb lent him one of his sketchbooks as a reference.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"/&gt;

As Krantz began to prepare the paperwork, preparation began on a pitch presentation for potential studios, including a poster-sized painted [[cel]] setup featuring the strip's cast against a traced photo background, as Bakshi intended the film to appear.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"/&gt; In spite of Crumb's enthusiasm, he was unsure about the film's production, and refused to sign the contract.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"/&gt; Cartoonist [[Vaughn Bodé]] warned Bakshi against working with Crumb, describing him as "slick".&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"/&gt; Bakshi later agreed with Bodé's assessment, calling Crumb "one of the slickest hustlers you'll ever see in your life".&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-60"/&gt; Krantz sent Bakshi to San Francisco, where Bakshi stayed with Crumb and his wife Dana in an attempt to persuade Crumb to sign the contract. After a week, Crumb left, leaving the film's production status uncertain,&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-62"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=62–63|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Dana had power of attorney and signed the contract. Crumb received US$50,000, which was delivered throughout different phases of the production, in addition to ten percent of Krantz's take.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-62"/&gt;

==Production==

===Funding and distribution===
With the rights to the character, Krantz and Bakshi set out to find a distributor. "When I say that every major distributor turned it down, this is not an exaggeration",&lt;ref name="Barrier-3"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartOne/FritzThree.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'': Crumb, His Cat, and the Dotted Line |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |author=Barrier, Michael |authorlink=Michael Barrier (historian) |date=Spring 1972 |work=Funnyworld | issue=14 |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; remembers Krantz. "There has never been a project that was received with less enthusiasm. Animation is essentially a dirty word for distributors, who think that only [[Walt Disney|Disney]] can paint a tree, and in addition to that, ''Fritz'' was so far out that there was a failure to understand that we were onto something very important."&lt;ref name="Barrier-1"/&gt;

In the spring of 1970, [[Warner Bros.]] agreed to fund and distribute the film.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=COOL%20WORLD%20(MOVIE)&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer=JAMIE%20DIAMOND&amp;pdate=&amp;v_id= |title=Animation's Bad Boy Returns, Unrepentant |accessdate=March 21, 2007 |author=Diamond, Jamie |date=July 5, 1992 |work=New York Times |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harlem sequences were the first to be completed. Krantz intended to release these scenes as a 15-minute short if the film's funding was pulled; Bakshi was nevertheless determined to complete the film as a feature.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-62"/&gt; Late in November, Bakshi and Krantz screened a presentation reel for the studio with this sequence, pencil tests, and shots of Bakshi's storyboards.&lt;ref name="Barrier-4"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartTwo/FritzFour.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'': Coast to Coast Animation |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |author=Barrier, Michael |authorlink=Michael Barrier (historian) |date=Fall 1973 |work=Funnyworld | issue=15 |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi stated, "You should have seen their faces in the screening room when I first screened a bit of ''Fritz''. I'll remember their faces until I die. One of them left the room. Holy hell, you should have seen his face. 'Shut ''up'', Frank! This is not the movie you're allowed to make!' And I said, Bullshit, I just made it."&lt;ref name="BlackBook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/ralph-bakshi-on-the-fritz |title=Ralph Bakshi on the 'Fritz' |accessdate=April 4, 2008 |last=Haramis |first=Nick |date=March 16, 2008 |publisher=BlackBook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's budget is disputed. In 1972, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that ''Fritz the Cat'' recouped its costs in four months following its release. A year later the magazine reported that the film grossed $30 million worldwide and was produced on a budget of $1.3 million. In 1993, director Ralph Bakshi said "''Fritz the Cat'', to me, was an enormous budget -- at $850,000 -- compared to my [[Terrytoons|Terrytoon]] budgets ..." In an intereview published in 1980, Bakshi stated "We made the film for $700,000. Complete".&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt;

Warner executives wanted the sexual content toned down, and to cast big names for the voices. Bakshi refused, and Warner pulled their funding from the film, leading Krantz to seek funds elsewhere.  This led to a deal with Jerry Gross, the owner of [[Cinemation Industries]], a distributor specializing in [[exploitation film]]s. Although Bakshi did not have enough time to pitch the film, Gross agreed to fund its production and distribute it, believing that it would fit in with his [[grindhouse]] slate.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-62"/&gt; Further financing came from [[Saul Zaentz]], who agreed to distribute the [[Fritz the Cat (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] on his [[Fantasy Records]] label.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-62"/&gt;

[[File:RalphBakshiJan09.jpg|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders of a bearded older man in glasses. Smiling, with eyes nearly closed, he is wearing a plain sweater and holding a microphone.|The film was the feature debut of writer and director Ralph Bakshi.]]
Bakshi was initially reluctant to direct ''Fritz the Cat'' because he had spent years working on animated productions featuring animal characters and wanted to make films focusing on human characters.&lt;ref name="DirectorsSeries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8744784132440773336&amp;hl=en |title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=March 16, 2007 |author=Gallagher, John A. |year=1983 |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124050714/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8744784132440773336&amp;hl=en |archivedate=January 24, 2009 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in working on the film because he loved Crumb's work and considered him a "total genius".&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt; During the development of the film, Bakshi says that he "started to get giddy" when he "suddenly was able to get a pig that was a cop, and this particular other pig was [[Jewish]], and I thought, 'Oh my God—a Jewish pig?' These were major steps forward, because in the initial ''[[Heckle and Jeckle]]'' for Terrytoons, they were two black guys running around. Which was hysterically funny and, I think, great—like [[Uncle Remus]] stuff. But they didn't play down south, and they had to change two black crows to two Englishmen. And I always told him that the black crows were funnier. So it was a slow awakening."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/518/518805p1.html |title=An Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=April 27, 2007 |first=Ken |last=P. |date=May 25, 2004 |work= |publisher=IGN |pages= |language= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218211315/http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/518/518805p1.html |archivedate=February 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his notes to animator Cosmo Anzilotti, Bakshi is precise, and even specifies that the crows smoked marijuana rather than tobacco. Bakshi states that "The weed had to read on screen. It's an important character detail."&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-66"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=66–67|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's opening sequence sets the satirical tone of the film. The setting of the story's period is not only established by a title, but also by a voiceover by Bakshi playing a character giving his account of the 1960s: "happy times, heavy times". The film's opening dialogue, by three construction workers on their lunch break, establishes many of the themes discussed in the film, including drug use, promiscuity, and the social and political climate of the era. When one of the workers urinates off of the scaffold, the film's credits play over a shot of the liquid falling against a black screen. When the credits end, it is shown that the construction worker has urinated on a long-haired hippie with a guitar. Karl F. Cohen writes that the film "is a product of the radical politics of the period. Bakshi's depiction of Fritz's life is colorful, funny, sexist, raw, violent, and outrageous."&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt;

Of his direction of the film, Bakshi stated, "My approach to animation as a director is live action. I don't approach it in the traditional animation ways. None of our characters get up and sing, because that's not the type of picture I'm trying to do. I want people to believe my characters are real, and it's hard to believe they're real if they start walking down the street singing."&lt;ref name="Barrier-1"/&gt; Bakshi wanted the film to be the [[antithesis]] of any animated film produced by [[the Walt Disney Company]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt; Accordingly, ''Fritz the Cat'' includes two satirical references to Disney. In one scene, silhouettes of [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Daisy Duck]], and [[Donald Duck]] are shown cheering on the [[United States Air Force]] as it drops [[napalm]] on a black neighborhood during a riot. Another scene features a reference to the "[[Pink Elephants on Parade]]" sequence from ''[[Dumbo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinepassion.org/Reviews/f/FritzCat.html |title=Cinepassion: Review of ''Fritz the Cat'' (1972) |accessdate=April 6, 2007 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequence of the camera panning across a garbage heap in an abandoned lot in Harlem sets up a visual device which recurs in ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']]''.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

===Writing===
The original screenplay consisted mostly of dialog and featured only a few changes from Crumb's stories. The script and storyboards went largely unused in favor of more experimental storytelling techniques.&lt;ref name="Barrier-5"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartTwo/FritzFive.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'': A Strange Breed of Cat |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |author=Barrier, Michael |authorlink=Michael Barrier (historian) |date=Fall 1973 |work=Funnyworld | issue=15 |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrier-4"/&gt; Bakshi said, "I don't like to jump ahead on my films. The way you feel about a film on Day One, you may not feel the same way forty weeks down the road. Characters grow, so I wanted to have the option to change things, and strengthen my characters&amp;nbsp; ... It was sort of a stream of consciousness, and a learning process for myself."&lt;ref name="Barrier-4"/&gt; Bakshi wrote the characters without feral animal behavior to lend the material greater realism.&lt;ref name=Arrow&gt;{{cite video | people = Ralph Bakshi | date = 2006 | title = Interview | url = | medium = ''The Fritz the Cat Collection'' DVD set, disc 3| publisher = Arrow Films}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the film's plot was adapted from a self-titled story published in a 1968 issue of ''R. Crumb's Head Comix'',&lt;ref name="Barrier-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |title=Fritz the Cat |year=1968 |publisher=R. Crumb's Head Comix |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the second part is derived from "Fritz Bugs Out", which was serialized in the February to October 1968 issues of ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]'',&lt;ref name="Barrier-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |title=Fritz Bugs Out |date=February–October 1968 |work=Cavalier |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final part of the story contains elements of "Fritz the No-Good", first published in the September/October 1968 issue of ''Cavalier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crumb |first=Robert |title=Fritz the No-Good |date=September–October 1968 |work=Cavalier |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last half of the film makes a major departure from Crumb's work. Animation historian [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] describes this section of the film as being "much grimmer than Crumb's stories past that point, and far more violent."&lt;ref name="Barrier-5"/&gt; Bakshi stated that he deviated from the comics because he felt that the strips lacked depth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was cute, it was sweet, but there was nowhere to put it. That's why Crumb hates the picture, because I slipped a couple of things in there that he despises, like the rabbis—the pure Jewish stuff. Fritz can't hold that kind of commentary. Winston is 'just a typical Jewish broad from Brooklyn'.&amp;nbsp; ... [The strip] was cute and well-done, but there was nothing that had that much depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Heater |first=Brian |title=Interview: Ralph Bakshi Pt. 2 |url=http://thedailycrosshatch.com/2008/06/30/interview-ralph-bakshi-pt-2/ |date=June 30, 2008 |work=The Daily Cross Hatch |accessdate=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bakshi's unwillingness to use anthropomorphic characters that behaved like feral animals led him to rewrite a scene in "Fritz Bugs Out" where Duke saves Fritz's life by flying while holding Fritz; in the film, Duke grabs a railing before the car crashes into the river, a solution that Bakshi wasn't entirely satisfied with, but prevented him from having to use any feral animal behavior in that scene.&lt;ref name=Arrow/&gt;

In the film, there are two characters named "Winston" – one appears at the beginning and end of the film, the other is Fritz's girlfriend Winston Schwartz. Michael Barrier notes that Winston Schwartz (who appears prominently in "Fritz Bugs Out" and "Fritz the No-Good") never has a proper introduction in Bakshi's film, and interprets the naming of a separate character as Bakshi's attempt to reconcile this; however, the two characters look and sound nothing alike.&lt;ref name="Barrier-5"/&gt; Bakshi intended to end the film with Fritz's death, but Krantz objected to this ending, and Bakshi eventually changed it to the final ending.&lt;ref name=Arrow/&gt;

===Casting===
The film's voice cast includes [[Skip Hinnant]], [[Rosetta LeNoire]], John McCurry, Judy Engles, and comic book distributor/convention organizer [[Phil Seuling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1971/film/reviews/fritz-the-cat-1200422802/ |title=Review of ''Fritz the Cat'' |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |date=January 1, 1972 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |pages=  |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hinnant, who would become known as a featured performer on ''[[The Electric Company]]'', was cast because he "had such a naturally phony voice", according to Bakshi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=38&amp;pos=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027074537/http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=38&amp;pos=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 27, 2007 |title=Bakshi on ...

===Audio design===
Some scenes used documentary recordings which were made by Bakshi and edited to fit the scene;&lt;ref name="A.V. Club"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22810 |title=Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=April 27, 2007 |first=Tasha |last=Robinson |date=January 31, 2003 |work= |publisher=The Onion A.V.

When I went to have the film mixed, the sound engineers gave me all kinds of crap about the tracks not being professionally recorded; they didn't even want to mix the noise of bottles breaking in the background, street noise, tape hiss, all kinds of shit. They said it was unprofessional, but I didn't care." Although the sound designers insisted that Bakshi needed to re-record the dialogue in the studio, Bakshi persisted on their inclusion.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

Almost all of the film's dialogue, except for that of a few of the main characters, was recorded entirely on the streets of New York City.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/bio.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040824000136/http://www.ralphbakshi.com/bio.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 24, 2004 |title=Biography |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |work= |publisher=Ralph Bakshi.com |pages= |language= |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the film's opening sequence, Bakshi paid two construction workers US$50 each, and drank [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] with them, recording the conversation.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; In the Washington Square Park sequence, only Skip Hinnant was a professional actor; Fritz's friends were voiced by young males Bakshi found in the park.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; One of the sequences that was not based upon Crumb's comics involved a comic chase through a [[synagogue]] full of praying [[rabbi]]s. For the voices of the rabbis, Bakshi used a documentary recording of his father and uncles. This scene continued to have a personal significance on Bakshi after his father and uncle died. Bakshi states, "Thank God I have their voices. I have my dad and family praying. It's so nice to hear now."&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-66"/&gt; Bakshi also went to a [[Harlem]] bar with a tape recorder and spent hours talking to black patrons, getting drunk with them as he asked them questions.&lt;ref name="Barrier-4"/&gt;

===Music===

{{Main|Fritz the Cat (soundtrack)}}

The film's score was composed by [[Ed Bogas]] and [[Ray Shanklin]]. The soundtrack was released by [[Fantasy Records]] and Ampex Tapes, along with the single, "You're the Only Girl" b/w "Winston". The film also featured songs by [[Charles Earland]], [[Cal Tjader]], [[Bo Diddley]], and [[Billie Holiday]]. Bakshi bought the rights to use Holiday's performance of the song "Yesterdays" for $35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/interview/1032/RALPH+BAKSHI+INTERVIEW |title=Ralph Bakshi on the recent DVD release of ''Wizards'' |accessdate=March 6, 2007 |author=Simmons, Stephanie |authorlink= |author2=Simmons, Areya |work= |publisher=Fulvue Drive-In |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animation===
[[Image:A Soul Tormented.jpg|alt=Four cartoon figures of cats dressed in human clothes, walking single file.|thumb|220px|Fritz trying to [[Pickup artist|pick up]] a trio of young females at [[Washington Square Park]]. The background is a watercolor painting based on a tracing from a photograph, giving the film a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt;]]
Many of the animators who worked on the film were professionals that Bakshi had previously worked with at Terrytoons, including Jim Tyer, John Gentilella, Nick Tafuri, [[Martin Taras]], Larry Riley, and Cliff Augustine.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=88–89 |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakshi, it took quite a long time to assemble the right staff. Those who entered with a smirk, "wanting to be very dirty and draw filthy pictures", did not stay very long, and neither did those with a low tolerance for vulgarity. One cartoonist refused to draw a [[African-American|black]] crow shooting a pig policeman. Two female animators quit; one because she could not bring herself to tell her children what she did for a living, the other because she refused to draw exposed breasts.&lt;ref name="Kanfer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kanfer |first=Stefan |title=Serious Business: The Art and Commerce of Animation in America from Betty Boop to Toy Story |year=2001 |publisher=Da Capo |location= |isbn=978-0-306-80918-7|page=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to save money by eliminating the need for model sheets, Bakshi let animator John Sparey draw some of the first sequences of Fritz. Bakshi states that he knew that "Sparey would execute them beautifully." Poses from his sequences were photocopied and handed out to the rest of the crew.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; The film was produced almost entirely without [[Pencil test (animation)|pencil tests]]. According to Bakshi, "We pencil tested I'd say a thousand feet [of footage], tops. ... We do a major feature without pencil tests—that's tough. The timing falls off. I can always tell an animator to draw it better, and I know if the attitude of the characters is right, but the timing you really can't see." Bakshi had to judge the timing of the animation simply by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand, until he could see the completed animation on the screen.&lt;ref name="Barrier-1"/&gt; Veteran Warner Bros. animator Ted Bonnicksen was incredibly dedicated to his work on the film, to the point where he completed his animation for the synagogue sequence while suffering from leukemia, and would take the scenes home at night to work on them.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-66"/&gt;

In May 1971, Bakshi moved his studio to Los Angeles to hire additional animators there. Some animators, including [[Rod Scribner]], [[Dick Lundy (animator)|Dick Lundy]], [[Virgil Walter Ross]], [[Norman McCabe]], and [[John Sparey]], welcomed Bakshi's presence, and felt that ''Fritz the Cat'' would bring diversity to the animation industry.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-72"/&gt; Other animators disliked Bakshi's presence, and placed an advertisement in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', stating that Bakshi's "filth" was unwelcome in California.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-72"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |page=72|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakshi, "I didn't know who these guys were because I was from New York, so I threw the ad away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.04/4.04pages/bakshidrawing.php3 |title=Draw What You Want To Draw |accessdate=April 27, 2007 |last=Bakshi |first=Ralph |date=July 1999 |work=Animation World | issue=4.4 |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bakshi found the negative reaction to the film from his peers to be disheartening.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-72"/&gt;

===Cinematography===
Because it was cheaper for Ira Turek to trace photographs to create the backgrounds, Bakshi and Johnnie Vita walked around the streets of the [[Lower East Side]], [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]], [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] and [[Harlem]] to take moody snapshots. Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a [[Rotring|Rapidograph]], the [[technical pen]] preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds stylized realism that had never been portrayed in animation before.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; After Turek completed a background drawing in ink on an animation cel, the drawing would be photocopied onto watercolor paper for Vita and onto animation paper for use in matching the characters to the backgrounds. When Vita finished his painting, Turek's original drawing, on the cel, would be placed over the watercolor, obscuring the photocopy lines on the painting.&lt;ref name="Barrier-4"/&gt; However, not every background was taken from live-action sources.&lt;ref name="Funnyworld-2"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartTwo/FritzFour.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'', Part Two |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |author=Barrier, Michael |authorlink=Michael Barrier (historian) |date=Fall 1973 |work=Funnyworld | issue=15 |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced by the "[[Ashcan School|Ash Can style]]" of painters, which includes [[George Luks]] and [[John French Sloan]].&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-77"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=77–78|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also used bent and [[Fisheye lens|fisheye]] camera perspectives in order to replicate the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-77"/&gt;

==Rating==
By the time production finished, Cinemation had released [[Melvin Van Peebles]]' ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'' to considerable success, and the distributor hoped that ''Fritz the Cat'' would be even more profitable.{{clarify|reason=Why?|date=June 2016}} ''Fritz'' received an [[X-rated|X rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the first animated film to receive such rating.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-80"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=80–81|chapter=''Fritz the Cat'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Krantz stated that the film lost playdates due to the rating, and 30 American newspapers rejected display advertisements for it or refused to give it editorial publicity.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt; The film's limited screenings led Cinemation to exploit the film's content in its promotion of the film, advertising it as containing "90 minutes of violence, excitement, and SEX&amp;nbsp; ... he's X-rated and animated!"&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-80"/&gt; According to Ralph Bakshi, "We almost didn't deliver the picture, because of the exploitation of it."&lt;ref name="Barrier-1"/&gt;

Cinemation's advertising style and the film's rating led many to believe that ''Fritz the Cat'' was a [[pornographic film]]. When it was introduced as such at a showing at the [[University of Southern California]], Bakshi stated firmly, "''Fritz the Cat'' is not pornographic."&lt;ref name="Barrier-1"/&gt; In May 1972, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Krantz had appealed the X rating, saying "Animals having sex isn't pornography." The MPAA refused to hear the appeal.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt; The misconceptions about the film's content were eventually cleared up when it received praise from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the film was accepted into the [[1972 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-80"/&gt; Bakshi later stated, "Now they do as much on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as I got an X rating for ''Fritz the Cat''."&lt;ref name="UGO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/ralphbakshi/interview.asp |title=Ralph Bakshi Interview |accessdate=April 27, 2007 |first=Daniel Robert |last=Epstein |work= |publisher=UGO.com Film/TV |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060605131239/http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/ralphbakshi/interview.asp |archivedate=June 5, 2006 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the film's release, American distributors attempted to cash in on the publicity garnered from the rating by rushing out dubbed versions of two other [[adult animation|adult animated]] films from Japan, both of which featured an X rating in their advertising material: ''Senya ichiya monogatari'' and ''Kureopatora'', re-titled ''[[One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (film)|One Thousand and One Arabian Nights]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra (1970 film)|Cleopatra: Queen of Sex]]''. However, neither film was actually submitted to the MPAA, and it is not likely that either feature would have received an X rating.&lt;ref name="Barrier-1"/&gt; The film ''[[Down and Dirty Duck]]'' was promoted with an X rating, but had not been submitted to the MPAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Charles Swenson's ''Dirty Duck'' |pages=89–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French-Belgian animated film ''[[Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle]]'' was initially released with an X rating in a subtitled version, but a dubbed version released in 1979 received an R rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=Importing foreign productions |page=91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the DVD release, MGM Home Entertainment has surrendered the X rating for an unrated video release, although the tagline "He's X-Rated and Animated!" is still used on the cover. Also, the MPAA "This film has been rated X" screen is seen just before the MGM logo at the end of the film on the DVD.

==Reception==

In Michael Barrier's 1972 article on its production, Bakshi gives accounts of two screenings of the film. Of the reactions to the film by audiences at a preview screening in Los Angeles, Bakshi stated, "They forget it's animation. They treat it like a film.&amp;nbsp; ... This is the real thing, to get people to take animation seriously." Bakshi was also present at a showing of the film at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and remembers, "Some guy asked me why I was against the revolution. The point is, animation was making people get up off their asses and get mad."&lt;ref name="Barrier-1"/&gt;

The film also sparked negative reactions because of its content. "A lot of people got freaked out", says Bakshi. "The people in charge of the power structure, the people in charge of magazines and the people going to work in the morning who loved Disney and [[Norman Rockwell]], thought I was a pornographer, and they made things very difficult for me. The younger people, the people who could take new ideas, were the people I was addressing. I wasn't addressing the whole world. To those people who loved it, it was a huge hit, and everyone else wanted to kill me."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1841791,00.html |title=Who flamed Roger Rabbit? |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |date=August 11, 2006 |work=The Guardian |pages= |language= |quote= | location=London | first=Steve | last=Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Critical reaction was mixed, but generally positive. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film is "constantly funny&amp;nbsp; ... [There's] something to offend just about everyone."&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt;  ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine film critic [[Judith Crist]] reviewed the film as "a gloriously funny, brilliantly pointed, and superbly executed entertainment&amp;nbsp; ... [whose] target is&amp;nbsp; ... the muddle-headed radical chicks and slicks of the sixties", and that it "should change the face of the animated cartoon forever".{{sfn|Crist|1972|p=80}}   Paul Sargent Clark in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "powerful and audacious",&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt; while ''[[Newsweek]]'' called it "a harmless, mindless, pro-youth saga calculated to shake up only the box office".&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''Cue'' both gave the film mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="Cohen-81"/&gt; Thomas Albright of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' wrote an enthusiastic preview in the December 9, 1971 issue based on seeing thirty minutes of the film, declaring that it was "sure to mark the most important breakthrough in animation since ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]''".&lt;ref name="RS #97"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Albright |first1=Thomas |last2= |first2= |date=December 9, 1971 |title=Crumb's Cat Fritz Comes To Screen |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers, Inc. |volume= |issue=97 |page=14 |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But in a review published after its release, Albright recanted his earlier statement and wrote that the visuals were not enough to save the finished product from being a "qualified disaster" due to a "leaden plot" and a "juvenile" script that relied too heavily on tired gags and tasteless ethnic humor.&lt;ref name="RS #109"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Albright |first1=Thomas |last2= |first2= |date=May 25, 1972 |title=Fritz the Cat |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers, Inc. |volume= |issue=109 |page=74 |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a score of 58%, based on 19 critic reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fritz the Cat (1972) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fritz_the_cat/|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic Andrew Osmond wrote that the epilogue hurt the film's integrity for "giving Fritz cartoon powers of survival that the film had rejected until then".{{sfn|Osmond|2010|p=77}}

Patricia Evans found scenes with Jewish stereotypes "vicious and offensive", and stated, "Only the jaundiced eye of director Ralph Bakshi, which denigrates all of the characters, the hero included, makes one reflect on the nature of the attack."{{sfn|Erens|1984|p=365}}

===Crumb's response===
Crumb first saw the film in February 1972, during a visit to Los Angeles with fellow underground cartoonists [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[S.&amp;nbsp;Clay Wilson]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and [[Rick Griffin]]. According to Bakshi, Crumb was dissatisfied with the film.&lt;!-- according to virtually every source, not just Bakshi—got to do something about this --&gt;&lt;ref name=Arrow/&gt; Among his criticisms, he said that he felt that Skip Hinnant was wrong for the voice of Fritz, and said that Bakshi should have voiced the character instead.&lt;ref name=Arrow/&gt; Crumb later said in an interview that he felt that the film was "really a reflection of Ralph Bakshi's confusion, you know. There's something real repressed about it. In a way, it's more twisted than my stuff. It's really twisted in some kind of weird, unfunny way.&amp;nbsp; ... I didn't like that sex attitude in it very much. It's like real repressed horniness; he's kind of letting it out compulsively."&lt;ref name="Barrier-5"/&gt; Crumb also criticized the film's condemnation of the radical [[left-wing|left]],&lt;ref name="Barrier-3"/&gt; denouncing Fritz's dialogue in the final sequences of the film, which includes a quote from [[The Beatles]] song "[[The End (The Beatles song)|The End]]", as "red-neck and fascistic"&lt;ref name="Maremaa"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maremaa |first1=Thomas |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first=D.

Press of Mississippi |isbn=1-57806-637-9 |page=28 |chapter=Who Is This Crumb?|laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated, "They put words into his mouth that I never would have had him say."&lt;ref name="Maremaa"/&gt;

Reportedly, Crumb filed a lawsuit to have his name removed from the film's credits.&lt;ref name="Umphlett"&gt;{{cite book |last=Umphlett |first=Wiley Lee |title=From Television to the Internet: Postmodern Visions of American Media Culture in the Twentieth Century |year=2006 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8386-4080-7|page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco copyright attorney Albert L. Morse said that no suit was filed, but an agreement was reached to remove Crumb's name from the credits.&lt;ref name="Funnyworld-Crumb"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/FritzPartTwo/Crumb.htm |title=The Filming of ''Fritz the Cat'': Feedback from R.

The last time I saw it was when I was making an appearance at a German art school in the mid-1980s, and I was forced to watch it with the students. It was an excruciating ordeal, a humiliating embarrassment. I recall [[Victor Moscoso]] was the only one who warned me, 'if you don't stop this film from being made, you are going to regret it for the rest of your life'—and he was right."&lt;ref name="Crumbhandbook"&gt;{{cite book | title = The R. Crumb Handbook | first = Robert | last = Crumb|author2=Poplaski, Peter | publisher = M Q Publications | isbn = 978-1-84072-716-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 interview, Bakshi referred to Crumb as a "hustler" and stated, "He goes in so many directions that he's hard to pin down. I spoke to him on the phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that château of his in France.&amp;nbsp; ... I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, if you want to do the same thing over and over. He should have been my best friend for what I did with ''Fritz the Cat''. I drew a good picture, and we both made out fine."&lt;ref name="BlackBook"/&gt; Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Heater |first=Brian |title=Interview: Ralph Bakshi Pt. 4 |url=http://thedailycrosshatch.com/2008/07/15/interview-ralph-bakshi-pt-4-of-4/ |date=July 15, 2008 |work=The Daily Cross Hatch |accessdate=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In addition to other animated films aimed at adult audiences, the film's success led to the production of a [[sequel]], ''[[The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat]]''. Although producer Krantz and voice actor Hinnant returned for the follow-up, Bakshi did not. Instead, ''Nine Lives'' was directed by animator Robert Taylor, who co-wrote the film with Fred Halliday and [[Eric Monte]]. ''Nine Lives'' was distributed by [[American International Pictures]], and was considered to be inferior to its predecessor.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Both films have been released on DVD in the United States, Canada and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Fritz-Cat-Widescreen-Skip-Hinnant/dp/B00003CWQI |title=ASIN: B00003CWQI |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |work= |publisher=[[Amazon.ca]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104072421/http://www.amazon.ca/Fritz-Cat-Widescreen-Skip-Hinnant/dp/B00003CWQI |archivedate=January 4, 2007 |dead-url=yes |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fritz-Cat-Nine-Lives/dp/B000EMTJP6/ |title=ASIN: B000EMTJP6 |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |work= |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315000056/http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fritz-Cat-Nine-Lives/dp/B000EMTJP6/ |archivedate=March 15, 2007 |dead-url=yes |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakshi states that he felt constricted using anthropomorphic characters in ''Fritz'', and focused solely on non-anthropomorphic characters in ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'' and ''Hey Good Lookin&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', but later used anthropomorphic characters in ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]''.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

While review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which compiles contemporary reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 56%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fritz_the_cat/ |title=Fritz the Cat |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |work= |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the film is widely noted in its innovation for featuring content that had not been portrayed in animation before, such as sexuality and violence, and was also, as John Grant writes in his book ''Masters of Animation'', "the breakthrough movie that opened brand new vistas to the commercial animator in the United States",&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=John |title=Masters of Animation |year=2001 |publisher=Watson-Guptill |isbn=0-8230-3041-5 |pages=19–20 |chapter=Ralph Bakshi }}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting an "almost disturbingly accurate" portrayal "of a particular stratum of Western society during a particular era,&amp;nbsp; ... as such it has dated very well."&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; The film's subject matter and its satirical approach offered an alternative to the kinds of films that had previously been presented by major animation studios.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Michael Barrier described ''Fritz the Cat'' and ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'' as "not merely provocative, but highly ambitious". Barrier described the films as an effort "to push beyond what was done in the old cartoons, even while building on their strengths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barrier |first1=Michael |title=Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=0-19-516729-5 |page=572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these innovations, ''Fritz'' was selected by ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine as the 42nd greatest animated film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Adams, Derek |author2=Calhoun, Dave |author3=Davies, Adam Lee |author4=Fairclough, Paul |author5=Huddleston, Tom |author6=Jenkins, David |author7=Ward, Ossian |year=2009 |title=Time Out's 50 greatest animated films, with added commentary by Terry Gilliam |journal=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/8835/time-outs-50-greatest-animated-films-curated-by-terry-gilliam.html |accessdate=November 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206232303/http://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/8835/time-outs-50-greatest-animated-films-curated-by-terry-gilliam.html |archivedate=December 6, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ranked at number 51 on the [[Online Film Critics Society]]'s list of the top 100 greatest animated films of all time,&lt;ref name="OFCS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ofcs.rottentomatoes.com/pages/pr/top100animated |title=Top 100 Animated Features of All Time |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |work= |publisher=[[Online Film Critics Society]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ADt9yaLh?url=http://ofcs.rottentomatoes.com/pages/pr/top100animated |archivedate=August 27, 2012 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was placed at number 56 on [[Channel 4]]'s list of the ''100 Greatest Cartoons''.&lt;ref name="Channel4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/cartoons/results.html |title=Top 100 Cartoons |accessdate=January 28, 2008 |work= |publisher=Channel 4 |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage from the film was edited into the music video for [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]]'s 2007 song "State of Clarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/gurux05x06x07 |title=Guru, feat Common, State of Clarity, Video |accessdate=October 6, 2007 |work= |publisher=Contact Music |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gnomedex'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnomedex.com/ |title=Gnomedex |publisher=Gnomedex |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a single-track technology conference hosted by [[Chris Pirillo]], the owner of [[Lockergnome]], LLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnomedex.com/ |title=Gnomedex |publisher=Gnomedex |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is produced by Chris Pirillo and his staff at Lockergnome.  Pirillo was the co-host of the show [[Call For Help]] on the former cable television channel [[TechTV]].  Gnomedex started as an outgrowth of Pirillo's technology newsletters, IRC channel and web site.  The conference name is a satirical [[portmanteau]] of Pirillo's Lockergnome and the now-defunct [[Comdex]] technology trade show, which was a massive and influential annual event at the time of the first Gnomedex conference.

Gnomedex has grown into a conference exploring new and emerging [[technology|technologies]] with influencers, [[entrepreneurs]] and tech enthusiasts as the primary audience.  It bills itself as the crossroads between producers and observers, between users and developers.  The conference format is meant to serve the needs of the attendees, many of whom are prolific [[blog]]gers and [[podcaster]]s.

The first Gnomedex took place in October 2001 in [[Des Moines]], [[Iowa]], while the tenth Gnomedex took place in August 2010 in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].  Gnomedex organizer Chris Pirillo announced that due to the difficulites in operating such events, that the tenth was likely to be the last Gnomedex unless additional backing and resources were brought forward to help spread the administrative and organizational overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chris.pirillo.com/the-future-of-gnomedex/ |title=The Future of Gnomedex ~ Chris Pirillo |publisher=Chris.pirillo.com |date=2001-09-13 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/08/qa_chris_pirillo_on_social_media_geek_week_and_the_last_gnomedex.html |title=Q&amp;A: Chris Pirillo on the possible end of Gnomedex as we know it |publisher=Techflash.com |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Gnomedex stage was included in the first Seattle Interactive Conference in November 2011 after [[Jake Ludington]] reportedly convinced Chris Pirillo to continue the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geekwire.com/2011/gnomedex-returns-part-seattle-interactive-conference Gnomedex back from another near-death experience]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Chris Pirillo announced that Gnomedex will be making a return sometime in 2015.&lt;ref name="2015-03-25 Soper Geekwire.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2015/chris-pirillo-bringing-back-gnomedex-tech-festival-to-seattle/ |title=Chris Pirillo is bringing Gnomedex back in Seattle — but don't call it a conference |newspaper=Geekwire.com |date=2015-03-25 |first=Taylor |last=Soper |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was first broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC1]] in the United Kingdom on 2 November 1989, shortly before [[Armistice Day]]. Apart from the one-off short film ''[[Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth]]'' made a decade later, it was the last episode of ''Blackadder'' to be produced and transmitted.

The episode depicts its main characters' final hours before a British offensive on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of the [[First World War]], and [[Captain Blackadder]]'s attempts to escape his fate by feigning madness; after he fails to convince [[General Melchett]], and [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Field Marshal Haig]]'s advice proves useless, he resigns himself to taking part in the push. ''Goodbyeee'' has a darker tone than other episodes in the series, culminating in its acclaimed ending in which the main characters are assumed to die in [[Machine gun|machine-gun]] fire. The episode's theme of death ties in with the series' use of [[gallows humour]], its criticism and satire of war, and its depiction of authority figures contentedly sending their subordinates to face the enemy, while unwilling to do so themselves.

[[Richard Curtis]] and [[Ben Elton]] wrote the episode, and further material was provided by cast members. Its final sequence, which shows the main characters going "over the top", uses slow motion, as the programme's creators were unhappy with the result of the scripted ending. The enhanced scene has been described as bold and highly poignant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackaddergoesforth/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Background===
[[File:RowanAtkinsonMar07.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rowan Atkinson]] played Captain Blackadder in the series.]]
Each series of ''Blackadder'' depicts its protagonist, always a scheming and (except in the [[The Black Adder|first series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Adder|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theblackadder/|work=Comedy|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) witty man named [[Edmund Blackadder]], in different periods throughout history. In ''Blackadder Goes Forth'', he is [[Captain Blackadder]] ([[Rowan Atkinson]]), an officer in the [[British Army]] on the Western Front during the First World War.

Joined by his colleagues—the [[Poverty|poor]], stupid and unhygienic [[Baldrick#Blackadder Goes Forth|Private Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]), and the overly optimistic, [[Upper class|upper-class]] and equally idiotic [[George (Blackadder)|Lieutenant George St Barleigh]] ([[Hugh Laurie]])—Blackadder tries constantly to escape his position and avoid the "big push", which he fears will result in his death. His efforts are hindered by the loud and intimidating [[General Melchett]] ([[Stephen Fry]]) and Melchett's strict, [[Sardonicism|sardonic]], and [[jobsworth]] [[staff officer]], [[Darling (Blackadder)|Captain Darling]] ([[Tim McInnerny]]).

===Events===
Captain Blackadder's trench receives a phone call from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to [[Desertion|escape]] by [[Feigned madness|pretending to be mad]]: he puts underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.

Melchett leaves after George declines his offer not to participate in the push, and Baldrick suggests that Blackadder ask Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] to get them out; remembering that Haig owes him a favour, Blackadder decides to call in the morning. George, Baldrick and Blackadder discuss the War and the friends they have lost—George mentions the [[Christmas truce]] of 1914 (in which the belligerents stopped fighting to play [[association football|football]]) and realises he is the only "[[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] [[Tiddlywinks|Tiddlers]]" member still alive; this is paralleled in Baldrick's pets, who have all died. Back at HQ, Melchett surprises Captain Darling with a front-line [[Commissioned officer|commission]]. Darling's pleas to reconsider are misinterpreted, and Melchett insists that he go.

The following morning, Blackadder calls Field Marshal Haig and reminds him of his debt; Haig reluctantly advises using the underpants method, and abruptly hangs up, sealing Blackadder's fate. Darling arrives, and his animosity with Blackadder dissolves as they are both put in the same situation. George tries to cheer everybody up, but finds himself as scared as the others. Darling states that he had hoped to live through the War, return to England and marry his fiancée.

The men are called to the trench to prepare for the big push. There is a moment of hope when the British [[Barrage (artillery)|barrage]] lifts, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that they have stopped only to avoid hitting their own men. Baldrick tells Blackadder that he has a plan to escape certain death, but for the first time in any series, does not call it a "cunning plan". Blackadder replies Baldrick's idea will have to wait, but admits it couldn't fail to improve over his own plan to feign insanity because "who would have noticed another madman round here?"  The series concludes with Blackadder earnestly wishing his comrades good luck, and they charge over the top into thunderous [[Machine gun|machine-gun]] fire. The sequence enters [[slow motion]] as a slow piano version of the [[Blackadder#Theme tune|''Blackadder'' theme]] is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of [[no man's land]] fades into a tranquil field of [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]], with only birdsong to be heard.

The episode's title is a reference to the popular First World War song "[[Good-bye-ee!]]",{{sfn|Roberts|2012|p=312}} which was based on a catchphrase of the comedian [[Harry Tate]].&lt;ref name=bmh&gt;{{citation |page=146 |title=British Music Hall: An Illustrated History |author=Richard Anthony Baker |publisher=Pen and Sword |year=2014 |isbn=9781473837188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is also heard in an earlier episode — "[[Major Star]]". The title is a departure from those of previous ''Blackadder Goes Forth'' episodes, which are [[pun]]s on military ranks.{{sfn|Roberts|2012|p=313}}

During the filming of the episode, which took place before a [[studio audience]] at [[BBC Television Centre]],&lt;ref name="britainsbestsitcom" /&gt; Rowan Atkinson described sharing his character's dread of impending death and feeling a "knot in the pit of my stomach",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Fagin goes forth in the West End|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/dec/28/rowan-atkinson-profile-oliver-blackadder|accessdate=22 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=28 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dvd-atkinson"&gt;Atkinson, Rowan.

The slow motion and fade effects at the end of the episode were not scripted,&lt;ref name="uktvs4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackadder Goes Forth|url=http://gold.uktv.co.uk/blackadder/article/blackadder-goes-forth/|publisher=UKTV|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the decision to use them was made in editing after the final scene was hastily filmed on an unconvincing [[polystyrene]] set, ruining the poignancy of the sequence; the episode's director [[Richard Boden]] added the poppy field image.&lt;ref name="wrs" /&gt; The piano version of the theme tune was performed by [[Howard Goodall]] and recorded in a [[gym]]nasium, giving it what Lloyd described as a "liquid, lonely sound".{{sfn|Roberts|2012|p=320}} The episode's [[Closing credits|end credits]] were omitted.&lt;ref name="britainsbestsitcom" /&gt; Tim McInnerny did not know about these changes before the episode aired, and has said that he found the ending particularly emotional.&lt;ref name="britainsbestsitcom" /&gt;

==Themes==
In the episode, Field Marshal Haig is shown casually sweeping away [[toy soldiers]] with a [[dustpan]] and brush; ''BBC News Magazine''{{'}}s Finlo Rohrer called this a "visual allusion to his callousness", but quoted the historian [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]] as saying "The real Field Marshal Haig was certainly not a callous man. He was commanding the largest British army ever. Whatever he did you ended up with lots and lots of casualties." Sheffield also noted that "Melchett is an amalgam of Haig and [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] and the other generals", so Haig effectively "appears twice".&lt;ref name="Rohrer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rohrer|first=Finlo|title=How accurately does Blackadder reflect history?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22887110|work=BBC News Magazine|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=15 June 2013|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series, and the storyline of "Goodbyeee" especially, often depicts the "[[lions led by donkeys]]" perception of the War, an element of ''Blackadder Goes Forth'' that has been criticised by historians.&lt;ref name="newhistories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="badsey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Badsey|first1=Stephen|year=2002|title=The Great War Since ''The Great War'' |journal= Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television|publisher=Routledge|volume=22|issue=1|page=41|doi=10.1080/01439680220120273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Great War'', Ian F. W. Beckett also cited Sheffield: the latter commented that ''Blackadder Goes Forth'' was successful because "the characters and situations needed no explanation, so familiar was the audience with the received version of the war". Beckett noted the popularity of the episode's final scene, and compared it to a similarly popular one from ''[[Dad's Army]]''. He said that this comparison demonstrates the historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]]'s observation that the Second World War has been regarded as a "good war" in comparison to the first; he opined that "television producers ... have much to answer for in the perpetuation of the image of the Great War as one in which a generation of 'lions' were needlessly sacrificed by the 'donkeys'".&lt;ref name="Beckett2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beckett|first=Ian F. W.|title=The Great War, 1914–1918|year=2007|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-1-4058-1252-8|pages=642–643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blackadder Goodbyeee poppies.jpg|thumb|The ending shows a field of poppies to reflect on the deaths of soldiers; it was inspired by [[John McCrae]]'s poem "[[In Flanders Fields]]".&lt;ref name="sfaustin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker |first=Sara |title=Blackadder Goes Forth |url=http://clioseye.sfasu.edu/Archives/Student%20Reviews%20Archives/BlackadderGoesForth.htm |work=Clio's Eye |publisher=[[Stephen F.

The producer John Lloyd cited the episode's lack of another major character as the reason they had time to "explore the relationships of the five principal people".&lt;ref name="dvd-lloyd" /&gt; Rowan Atkinson said that the scene involving Darling's "ghastly realisation" of his commission was "very sad";&lt;ref name="dvd-atkinson" /&gt; Lloyd commented "I love the fact that Captain Darling does have some compassion; he's not just a [[bureaucrat]]".&lt;ref name="dvd-lloyd" /&gt; They noted that "all the comedy just goes away" upon Darling's arrival in the trench,&lt;ref name="dvd-lloyd" /&gt; and that "there are still funny moments, but dramatically there's no comic content, it's just leading inexorably to the end."&lt;ref name="dvd-atkinson" /&gt;

Comparing the ending scene to those of previous series of ''Blackadder'' in which the main characters were also killed, the writer Richard Curtis commented that "I think it was by chance that [previous series] ended with Blackadder being killed ... but series four, we did do it very much on purpose." He said that he and Elton felt they could use the First World War as a setting if the characters died, considering "if we did do that ... it would not be too disrespectful, and would actually represent some of the tragedy of the First World War".&lt;ref name="sfaustin" /&gt;

==Reception==
Following its original broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC1]] at 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm on Thursday, 2 November 1989,&lt;ref name="Lewisohn" /&gt; the episode was praised for its powerful and memorable ending.&lt;ref name="bbccomedy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackadder Goes Forth|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackaddergoesforth/|work=Comedy|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803103331/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackaddergoesforth/|archivedate=3 August 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; One journalist called the scene "a classy ending to a TV classic"{{sfn|Hanna|2009|pp=133–134}} and the ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' said that it was "brave" and "properly responsible" of the writers to end the series poignantly, especially when the episode aired close to [[Remembrance Day]].{{sfn|Hanna|2009|pp=133–134}}

The episode has also been the subject of more recent reviews: Rob Cromwell of ''[[The Guardian]]'' listed the final scene among six "perfect [[Series finale|end-of-show finales]]", saying of ''Blackadder'': "It was brilliantly funny throughout, right up until the last 60 seconds", and praising the writers and producer John Lloyd for "deliver[ing] a perfectly pitched, poignant ending".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cromwell|first=Rob|title=Six to watch: perfect end-of-show finales|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/oct/06/six-to-watch-show-finales|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing ''Blackadder Goes Forth'' to the 2012 war serial ''[[Birdsong (TV serial)|Birdsong]]'', Alison Graham of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' commented that "Nothing ... evokes the terror of those unspeakable battlefields or leaves such an overwhelming sense of loss as [its characters] going over the top to their certain death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Alison|title=Blackadder Goes Forth was more powerful than Birdsong|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2012-02-05/blackadder-goes-forth-was-more-powerful-than-birdsong|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=5 February 2012|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Den of Geek's Carley Tauchert placed the episode second on her list of "top 10 TV show endings", calling it "one of the greatest interpretations of the madness of war that has ever been put on film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tauchert|first=Carley|title=The top 10 TV show endings|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/20750/the-top-10-tv-show-endings|publisher=Den of Geek|accessdate=4 October 2012|date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the episode for [[The A.V. Club]], Kate Kulzick described it as "...a masterpiece, a hilarious and painful crystallization of everything Blackadder does well. It is without a doubt the best episode of the series and more than that, it’s one of the best series finales in television history". She particularly praised it for "...its masterful balancing of comedy and tragedy. Both are interspersed throughout, with each character given moments of laugh out loud brilliance and poignant reflection", concluding that "...there is no such thing as a perfect television show or episode, but “Goodbyeee” comes dang close".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/blackadder-general-hospitalback-forthgoodbyeee-208910 |title=Blackadder: "General Hospital"/"Back &amp; Forth"/"Goodbyeee" |last=Kulzick |first=Kate |date=5 September 2014 |website=[[The A.V. Club]]  |access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic and theatre director Mary Luckhurst contrasted the regular British comedic treatment of the Second World War with the absence of comedies set in the First World War, until the ''Blackadder'' series, which she considered "an important British dramatic treatment" of the War. Of the final episode Luckhurst wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Goodbyeee" went a good deal further than any other sitcom or comedy, by terminally sending pretty much the entire cast over the top in 1917, into a silence that has ... endured ever since. Many millions of viewers were shocked, and almost all taken aback by the abrupt realization of tragedy amid much-loved national television and after riotous laughter to that sudden and bitter end ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luckhurst|first=Mary|title=A Companion to Modern British and Irish Drama: 1880–2005|editor=Mary Luckhurst|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2006|pages=313|chapter=A wounded stage: drama and World War I|isbn=978-1-4051-2228-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a poll conducted by [[Channel 4]] and ''[[The Observer]]'' to determine television's one hundred most memorable moments, the final scene of "Goodbyeee" came ninth; it was one of only two entries in the top ten that was not news coverage (the other being a scene from ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'').{{sfn|Hanna|2009|pp=133–134}} The ''Radio Times'' in 2001 asked a panel of comedians, writers and producers to pick their "50 favourite sitcom moments"; "Goodbyeee" was the only ''Blackadder'' episode included, and was ranked eleventh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Divine Comedy|last=Courtis|first=Brian|date=7 June 2001|work=The Age|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]] called the episode's ending "unexpectedly moving", and noted that, unusually for a comedy programme, it was repeated as part of a serious commemoration of Armistice Day:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooke|first=Michael|title=Blackadder|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/500473/|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its 80th anniversary in 1998.{{sfn|Hanna|2009|pp=23}} The series' overview from the website of [[UKTV]]'s channel [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]], which airs repeats of ''Blackadder'', calls the final episode "a seamless blend of gallows humour and rich poignancy", and "a fitting end to an iconic series".&lt;ref name="uktvs4" /&gt; In his segment advocating for ''Blackadder'' to be voted ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]'', the broadcaster and journalist [[John Sergeant (journalist)|John Sergeant]] called the final sequence "the one sitcom moment with claims to immortality".&lt;ref name="britainsbestsitcom" /&gt;

Some historians of the First World War have taken a different view. William Philpott referred to the series, by name, as "[[wikt:bathetic|bathetic]]" and felt it part of a "post-facto generalisation of the nature of their war" that "sucked in" even veterans of the conflict. In other words, the First World War soldier had become a "victim" in the public consciousness, a circumstance at odds with the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philpott|first=William|title=Bloody Victory: The Sacrifice on the Somme|editor= |publisher=Abacus Press|year=2009|pages=613|chapter=Memory Fades|isbn=978-0-349-12004-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of Blackadder on the public consciousness was so pervasive that [[Gordon Corrigan]] referenced it in his book cover copy when he published his book ''Mud, Blood, and Poppycock'', which was an attempt to "dispel various myths" about the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Mud_Blood_and_Poppycock.html?id=SykBHAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y google books website] The copy noted that "Gordon Corrigan's brilliant, witty history reveals how out of touch we have become with the soldiers of 1914-18. They simply would not recognize the way their generation is depicted on TV..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''Graccident'''" (accidental Grexit) was coined for the case that Greece exited the EU and the euro without intention.{{cn|date=May 2018}} These terms first came into use in 2012 and have been revitalised at each of the [[bailout]]s made available to Greece since then.

Proponents of the proposal argue that leaving the [[euro]] and reintroducing the [[Greek drachma|drachma]] would dramatically boost exports and tourism and while discouraging expensive imports and thereby give the Greek economy the possibility to recover and stand on its own feet.

Opponents argue that the proposal would impose excessive hardship on the Greek people, as the short-term effects would be a significant  consumption and wealth reduction for the Greek population. This may cause civil unrest in Greece and harm the reputation of the eurozone. Additionally, it could cause Greece to align more with non-EU states.

== Detailed Events ==

The term 'Grexit' was coined by the [[Citigroup]] economist Ebrahim Rahbari and was introduced by Rahbari and Citigroup's Global Chief Economist [[Willem Buiter|Willem H. Buiter]] on 6 February 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

On 27 January 2015, two days after an [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|early election]] of the Greek parliament, [[Alexis Tsipras]], leader of the new [[Syriza|Syriza ("Coalition of the Radical Left") party]], formed [[First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|a new government]]. He appointed [[Yanis Varoufakis]] as [[Minister of Finance]], a particularly important post in view of the government debt crisis. During 2015 and 2016, the chance of a Grexit or even a 'Graccident' (accidental Grexit) in the near future was widely discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Figaro|lefigaro.fr]] 18.

After the announcement of the [[Greek bailout referendum, 2015|bailout referendum]] on 27 June 2015 speculation rose.  That day [[BBC News]] reported that "default appears inevitable",&lt;ref name="Inevitable"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32332221|title=Greek debt crisis: Is Grexit inevitable?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|author=Paul Kirby|date=27 June 2015|accessdate=29 June 2015|quote=Default appears inevitable and there is a growing risk of Greece lurching out of the single currency - which has come to be known as Grexit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it later removed the online statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32332221|title=Greek debt crisis: Is Grexit inevitable?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|author=Paul Kirby|date=27 June 2015|accessdate=1 July 2015|quote=The European Central Bank (ECB) has said it won't extend emergency funding for the banks and there is a growing risk of Greece lurching out of the single currency - which has come to be known as Grexit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 June 2015 it was announced that Greek banks would remain closed all week, cash withdrawals from banks would be limited to €60 per day, and international money transfers would be limited to urgent pre-approved commercial transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33307263|title=Greek debt crisis: Banks to remain shut all week|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=29 June 2015|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== IMF's projection ===
The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) admitted that its forecast about Greek economy was too optimistic: in 2010 it described Greece's first bailout programme as a holding operation that gave the eurozone time to build a firewall to protect other vulnerable members, but in 2012 the unemployment rate of Greece became about 25 percent, compared to IMF's projection of about 15 percent.&lt;ref name=bbc5jun2013IP&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22791248 IMF admits mistakes on Greece bailout] BBC News, Business, 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; IMF conceded that it underestimated the damage that austerity programmes would do to the Greek economy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324299104578527202781667088 IMF concedes it made mistakes on Greece] M. Steves and I. Talley, The Wall Street Journal, Europe, 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; adding that, in terms of Greece's debt, IMF should have considered a debt restructuring earlier.&lt;ref name=bbc5jun2013IP /&gt;&lt;ref name=imfG2010SBA&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2010/cr10110.pdf Greece:Staff report on request for stand-by arrangement] IMF, Country report No. 10/110 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

As can be seen from the Figure A, IMF's forecast in the 2010 standby agreement said that the Southern European country would start to grow in real terms after 2011.&lt;ref name=imfG2010SBA /&gt; But in fact the economy continued to shrink, and Greek real GDP in 2013 was about 76 percent of that in 2008.&lt;ref name=PRKCL25jun2015AG&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/breaking-greece/?_r=0 Breaking Greece] P.

Economists who favour this approach to solve the Greek debt crisis argue that a [[Default (finance)|default]] is unavoidable for Greece in the long term, and that a delay in organising an orderly default (by lending Greece more money throughout a few more years) would just wind up hurting EU lenders and neighbouring European countries even more.&lt;ref name="telegraph-head-in-sand"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8594698/EU-accused-of-head-in-sand-attitude-to-Greek-debt-crisis.html|author=Louise Armitstead|title=EU accused of 'head in sand' attitude to Greek debt crisis|work=The Telegraph|date=23 June 2011|accessdate=24 September 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal austerity or a euro exit is the alternative to accepting differentiated government bond yields within the Euro Area. If Greece remains in the euro while accepting higher bond yields, reflecting its high government deficit, then high interest rates would dampen demand, raise savings and slow the economy. An improved trade performance and less reliance on foreign capital would be the result.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The implementation of Grexit would have to occur "within days or even hours of the decision being made"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Birth of new Greek drachma would be pained, rushed |author=Apps, Peter |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/20/us-greece-newdrachma-idUSBRE84J03Q20120520 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/682bAoMgf?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/20/us-greece-newdrachma-idUSBRE84J03Q20120520 |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|title=War-Gaming Greek Euro Exit Shows Hazards in 46-Hour Weekend |author1=Randow, Jana |author2=Thesing, Gabi |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-22/war-gaming-greek-euro-exit-highlights-hazards-in-46-hour-weekend.html |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/682b2UcmN?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-22/war-gaming-greek-euro-exit-highlights-hazards-in-46-hour-weekend.html |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the high volatility that would result.

=== International law dynamics ===
One US economist{{who|date=October 2018}} has argued that the legal grounds upon which the "troika," composed by the [[EU Commission]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[IMF]], has pursued the harsh macroeconomic adjustment plans imposed on Greece are shaky, claiming they infringe upon Greece's [[sovereignty]] and interfere in the internal affairs of an independent EU [[nation-state]]: "the overt infringements on Greek sovereignty we're witnessing today, with EU policy makers now double-checking all national data and carefully 'monitoring' the work of the Greek government sets a dangerous precedent."&lt;ref name="Firzli, M. Nicolas"&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece and the EU Debt Crisis |author=Firzli, M. Nicolas |url=https://www.academia.edu/10410975/Greece_and_the_EU_Debt_Crisis |newspaper=[[The Vienna Review]] |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=30 Jan 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/684n3fIxI?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9298195/De-La-Rue-silent-on-deal-to-print-Drachma.html |archivedate=31 May 2012 |deadurl=no |location=Vienna |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He argues that a withdrawal from the Eurozone would give the Greek government more room for maneuver to conduct public policies propitious for long-term growth and social equity.&lt;ref name="Firzli, M. Nicolas" /&gt;

== 2012 Plan Z==
"Plan Z" is the name given to a 2012 plan to enable Greece to withdraw from the eurozone in the event of Greek bank collapse.&lt;ref name="FTGREXIT"&gt;Peter Spiegel, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0ac1306e-d508-11e3-9187-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz34GEE8FUj "Inside Europe's Plan Z"], ''Financial Times'', 14 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was drawn up in absolute secrecy by small teams totalling approximately two dozen officials at the EU Commission (Brussels), the European Central Bank (Frankfurt) and the IMF (Washington).&lt;ref name="FTGREXIT" /&gt; Those officials were headed by [[Jörg Asmussen]] (ECB), Thomas Wieser (Euro working group), Poul Thomsen (IMF) and Marco Buti (European Commission).&lt;ref name="FTGREXIT" /&gt; To prevent premature disclosure no single document was created, no emails were exchanged, and no Greek officials were informed.&lt;ref name="FTGREXIT" /&gt; The plan was based on the 2003 introduction of [[Iraqi dinar|new dinars]] into Iraq by the Americans and would have required rebuilding the Greek economy and banking system ''[[ab initio]]'', including isolating Greek banks by disconnecting them from the [[TARGET2]] system, closing ATMs, and imposing capital and currency controls.&lt;ref name="FTGREXIT" /&gt;

== Implementation ==
The prospect of Greece leaving the euro and dealing with a devalued drachma prompted many people to start withdrawing their euros from the country's banks.&lt;ref name=TheSpec&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece's euro exit a recipe for hardship |author=Hadjicostis, Menelaos |url=http://www.thespec.com/news/business/article/731488--greece-s-euro-exit-a-recipe-for-hardship |newspaper=[[The Hamilton Spectator]] |date=25 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/682f7B1PV?url=http://www.thespec.com/news/business/article/731488--greece-s-euro-exit-a-recipe-for-hardship |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nine months to March 2012 deposits in Greek banks had already fallen 13% to {{currency|160 billion|EURO}}.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt;

A victory for anti-bailout lawmakers in the [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|17 June 2012 election]] would likely trigger an even bigger [[bank run]], said Dimitris Mardas, associate professor of economics at the University of Thessaloniiki. Greek authorities, Mardas predicted, would respond by [[capital controls|imposing controls on the movement of money]] for as long as it takes for the panic to subside.&lt;ref name=TheSpec /&gt;

Against this plan, a political initiative, the so-called [[Menoume Europi]] was founded in 2012 by students in [[Oxford University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grreporter.info/en/greek_youths_are_getting_ready_cry_out_we_stay_europe/7066|title=Greek youths are getting ready to cry out,|work=grreporter.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it spread among Greek students in other European universities. The first demonstration took place in Athens, Syntagma Square in June 2012 in between two major elections that brought to the country political instability and financial insecurity.

A Grexit, assuming that it coincided with adoption of a new currency, would require preparation, for example with capacity for banknote stamping or printing a stock of new banknotes. However, information leaking out on such preparations might lead to negative dynamic effects, like bank runs.   Conversely, leaving the Eurozone, but retaining the Euro as de facto currency, would avoid the practical issues and relieve the country of the burden of its Eurozone responsibilities.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In the event of a new currency being introduced, all banks would close for several days to allow old (Euro) banknotes to be stamped to denote that they were now drachmas, and/or a newly printed currency to be distributed to bank branches for distribution to the public when banks reopened. The British money printing company [[De La Rue]] was, according to rumours on 18 May 2012, preparing to print new drachma notes based on old moulds, which De La Rue refused to comment.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt; The typical time between an order for a new currency being placed and the delivery of the banknotes is about six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De La Rue silent on deal to print Drachma |author=Wallop, Harry |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9298195/De-La-Rue-silent-on-deal-to-print-Drachma.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=31 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/684n3fIxI?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9298195/De-La-Rue-silent-on-deal-to-print-Drachma.html |archivedate=31 May 2012 |deadurl=no |location=London |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wolfson Economics Prize ===
In July 2012, the [[Wolfson Economics Prize]], a prize for the "best proposal for a country to leave the European Monetary Union", was awarded to a [[Capital Economics]] team led by [[Roger Bootle]], for their submission titled "Leaving the Euro: A Practical Guide."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/WolfsonPrize/wolfson%20economics%20prize%20winning%20entry.pdf "Leaving the Euro: A Practical Guide"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118203115/http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/WolfsonPrize/wolfson%20economics%20prize%20winning%20entry.pdf |date=18 January 2013 }} full text&lt;/ref&gt; The winning proposal argued that a member wishing to exit should introduce a new currency and default on a large part of its debts. The net effect, the proposal claimed, would be positive for growth and prosperity. It also called for keeping the euro for small transactions and for a short period of time after the exit from the eurozone, along with a strict regime of inflation-targeting and tough fiscal rules monitored by "independent experts".

The Roger Bootle/Capital Economics plan also suggested that "key officials" should meet "in secret" one month before the exit is publicly announced, and that eurozone partners and international organisations should be informed "three days before". The judges of the Wolfson Economics Prize found that the winning plan was the "most credible solution" to the question of a member state leaving the eurozone.

== Immediate economic fallout inside Greece ==

On 29 May 2012 the [[National Bank of Greece]] (not to be confused with the central bank, the [[Bank of Greece]]) warned that "[a]n exit from the euro would lead to a significant decline in the living standards of Greek citizens." According to the announcement, [[per capita income]] would fall by 55%, the new national currency would depreciate by 65% vis-à-vis the euro, and the recession would deepen to 22%. Furthermore, unemployment would rise from its current 22% to 34% of the work force, and inflation, which was then at 2%, would soar to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biggest Greek bank warns of dire euro exit fallout |author=Tagaris, Karolina |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/29/greece-euro-idUSL5E8GTI5320120529 |agency=Reuters |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/683XQVtva?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/29/greece-euro-idUSL5E8GTI5320120529 |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Greek think-tank Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE), a new drachma would lose half or more of its value relative to the euro.&lt;ref name=TheSpec /&gt; This would drive up inflation, and reduce the [[purchasing power]] of the average Greek. At the same time, the country's economic output would drop, putting more people out of work where one in five is already unemployed. The prices of imported goods would skyrocket, putting them out of reach for many.&lt;ref name=TheSpec /&gt;

Analyst Vangelis Agapitos estimated that inflation under the new drachma would quickly reach 40 to 50 per cent to catch up with the fall in the new currency's value.&lt;ref name=TheSpec /&gt; To stop the falling value of the drachma, interest rates would have to be increased to as high as 30 to 40 per cent, according to Agapitos.&lt;ref name=TheSpec /&gt; People would then be unable to pay off their loans and mortgages and the country's banks would have to be nationalised to stop them from going under, he predicted.&lt;ref name=TheSpec /&gt;

IOBE head of research Aggelos Tsakanikas foresaw an increase in crime as a consequence of a Grexit, as people struggled to pay bills. "We won’t see tanks in the streets and violence, we won’t see people starving in the streets, but crime could very well rise".&lt;ref name=TheSpec /&gt;

== Political opinion ==
The centre-right [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party has accused the leftist [[SYRIZA]] of supporting withdrawal from the euro. However, SYRIZA's leader, [[Alexis Tsipras]], has stated that Greece should not leave the eurozone and return to the drachma because "...we will have poor people, who have drachmas, and rich people, who will buy everything with euros."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9Oi6vzI0HU|title=Ο Alexis Tsipras στο CNN|date=17 May 2012|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past opinion polling had shown that generally most Greeks favored keeping the euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phantis.com/news/clear-lead-syriza-public-issue-poll-support-euro-71|title=Clear lead for SYRIZA in Public Issue poll; support for euro at 71%|work=phantis.com|accessdate=13 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706023837/http://www.phantis.com/news/clear-lead-syriza-public-issue-poll-support-euro-71|archivedate=6 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the political parties which won seats in the parliamentary election in May 2012, the [[Communist]] [[Communist Party of Greece|KKE]] expressed support for leaving both the euro and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18455465][[BBC News]]&lt;span&gt; report 15 June 2012&lt;/span&gt; – "Greek election is euro versus drachma, Samaras says"&lt;/ref&gt; However, its General Secretary, [[Dimitris Koutsoumpas]], pondered: "The exit from the EU and the euro will be hazardous, a blind alley unless it is combined with a concrete plan, a programme for the economy and society, with a new organization of society, i.e. a socialist society with the socialization of the concentrated means of production, unilateral cancelation of the debt, working class and people's power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://inter.kke.gr/en/articles/The-day-after-the-elections-the-KKE-will-be-at-the-forefront-of-the-struggles/ | title=The day after the elections the KKE will be at the forefront of the struggles | date=10 January 2015 | publisher=Communist Party of Greece | accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] is also staunchly [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]], opposing Greece's participation in the [[European Union]] and the [[eurozone]].&lt;ref name=eurosceptic&gt;{{cite web|script-title=el:Πολιτικές Θέσεις|url=http://xryshaygh.com/index.php/kinima/thesis|publisher=Golden Dawn|accessdate=3 November 2013|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="euroscepticism"&gt;{{cite web |title=In crisis-ridden Europe, euroscepticism is the new cultural trend

On 21 August 2015, 25 MPs from SYRIZA split from the party and formed [[Popular Unity (Greece)|Popular Unity]], which fully supports leaving the euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34014083|title=Greece crisis: Syriza rebels form new party|date=21 August 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|September 2015 Greek legislative election]], the party won 2.8% of the popular vote, winning no seats.

Both the Greek government and the EU favour Greece staying within the Euro and believe this to be possible. However, some commentators believe an exit is likely. In February 2015, the former head of the [[US Federal Reserve]], [[Alan Greenspan]], said "it is just a matter of time" for Greece to withdraw from the eurozone,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31249907 "Greece: Greenspan predicts exit from euro inevitable"], BBC News, 8 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and former [[United Kingdom]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Kenneth Clarke]] described it as inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Stone, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-grandee-ken-clarke-warns-euro-exit-is-inevitable-as-greeces-supporters-rally-in-london-10047424.html "Tory grandee Ken Clarke warns euro exit is 'inevitable' as Greece's supporters rally in London"], ''The Independent'', 15 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A leaked document revealed that, during informal discussions with one of the European leaders, then UK Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] suggested that Greece might be better off if it exited the eurozone. British officials declined to make their comments on the leaked document.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/26/cameron-told-eu-leader-greek-exit-from-euro-may-be-best-option Cameron told EU leader Greek exit from euro may be best option] A. Nardelli and N. Watt, The Guardian, Politics, 26 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic criticism ==
[[Richard Koo]], chief economist for [[Nomura Research Institute]], accused IMF and EU of basing their negotiation position on unrealistic assumptions. As Koo pointed out, IMF's argument was that if the austerity programme had been implemented as assumed, no further debt relief would have been needed under 2012's framework.&lt;ref name=bs15jul2015RKC&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/nomura-imf-eu-highly-unrealistic-greek-bailout-2015-7?r=US&amp;IR=T Nomura slams the IMF: The Greek bailout is highly unrealistic] O. Williams-Grut, Business Insider, Finance, 15 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's argument was that Greece encountered a difficult situation in 2015 because it delayed implementation of structural reforms. Koo said that the argument was highly unrealistic because structural reforms do not work in a short run, adding that the US did not benefit from the [[Reaganomics]] structural reforms during Reagan's era.&lt;ref name=bs15jul2015RKC /&gt; After publishing documents which admit that the southern European country needs debt relief and a moratorium on debt repayment for 30 years,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11739985/IMF-stuns-Europe-with-call-for-massive-Greek-debt-relief.html IMF stuns Europe with call for massive Greek debt relief] A. Evans-Pritchard, The Daily Telegraph, 14 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; the IMF was only "slowly beginning to understand" the Greek economy, said Koo.&lt;ref name=bs15jul2015RKC /&gt;

== 2015 Grexit speculation ==
In January 2015, speculation about a Greek exit from the eurozone was revived when {{ill2|Michael Fuchs (politician)|de|Michael Fuchs (Politiker, Februar 1949)|lt=Michael Fuchs}}, deputy leader of the center-right [[CDU/CSU]] faction in the [[German Bundestag]], was quoted on 31 December 2014: "The time when we had to rescue Greece is over. There is no more blackmail potential. Greece is not systemically relevant for the euro." A following article in the weekly [[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]] citing sources from [[Wolfgang Schäuble]]'s [[German Ministry of Finance|ministry of finance]] further spurred these speculations. Both German and international media widely interpreted this as the [[Second Merkel cabinet|Merkel government]] tacitly warning Greek voters from voting for [[Coalition of the Radical Left|SYRIZA]] in the upcoming [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|legislative election]] of 25 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-01-05/germany-does-care-about-a-greek-exit |title=Germany Does Care About a Greek Exit |date=2015-01-05 |accessdate=2015-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's largest selling tabloid, the [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] [[Bild]], raised further anger when it compared Greece to an unfair footballer: "What happens to a footballer who breaks the rules and does a crude foul?&amp;nbsp;– He leaves the pitch. He is sent off as a punishment. No question."&lt;ref name=ft15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/760f0694-9500-11e4-b32c-00144feabdc0.html|title=Angela Merkel faces growing dilemma over Greece|last=Wagstyl|first=Stefan|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=2015-01-05|accessdate=2015-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German government's interference in the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|January 2015 elections in Greece]] was strongly criticized by leaders of [[Political groups of the European Parliament|European Parliament groups]] including [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists &amp; Democrats]] (S&amp;D), the liberal [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|ALDE]] and the [[The Greens–European Free Alliance|Greens/EFA]] group, when S&amp;D president [[Gianni Pittella]] said, "German right-wing forces trying to act like a sheriff in Greece or any other member states is not only unacceptable but above all wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/meps-criticise-german-interference-greek-elections|title=MEPs criticise German 'interference' in Greek elections|last=O'Brien|first=James|work=[[The Parliament Magazine]]|date=2015-01-05|accessdate=2015-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been criticized by the German opposition party [[Alliance '90/The Greens|The Greens]]', with its speaker [[Simone Peter]] calling the debate over a Grexit "highly irresponsible".&lt;ref name=ft15 /&gt;

Economists of German [[Commerzbank]] said that preventing a Greek exit was still desirable for Germany, since a Greek exit would wipe out billions of euros in European taxpayer money, and "it would be much easier politically to renegotiate a compromise with Greece, albeit a lame one, and thus maintain the fiction that Greece will pay back its loans at some point in time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/world/europe/greeces-relationship-with-eurozone-is-tested-by-election.html?_r=0 |title=Euro Countries Take Tough Line Toward Greece |last=Alderman |first=Liz |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2015-01-05 |accessdate=2015-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FTSE Group|FTSE]] "considers Grexit following the election to be highly unlikely...".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ftse.com/products/indices/grexit&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 February, UK Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] chaired a meeting to discuss any possible ramifications in the event of an exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31297809|title=UK plans for possible Greek euro exit|publisher=BBC News | date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] report [[George Osborne]] said at the meeting of the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] finance ministers in Istanbul: "A Greek exit from the euro would be very difficult for the world economy and potentially very damaging for the European economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-10/osborne-sees-growing-danger-of-very-bad-outcome-in-greek-crisis|title=G-20 Finance Ministers Urge Greek Aid Deal to Avoid Euro Region Splinter|author=Svenja O'Donnell|publisher=Bloomberg.com|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the [[Russian government]] stated that it would offer Greece aid but would only provide it in [[Russian ruble|rubles]].&lt;ref&gt;Dow Jones Newswires [http://www.nasdaq.com/article/russia-fin-min-could-only-provide-greece-with-rubles-if-athens-asks-20150210-00797 Russia Fin Min: Could Only Provide Greece With Rubles If Athens Asks] 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kathimerini]] reported that after 16 February [[Eurogroup]] talks [[Commerzbank]] AG increased the risk of Greece exiting the euro to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_17/02/2015_547346|title=Greek euro exit risk raised by Commerzbank as talks break down&amp;nbsp;— Business&amp;nbsp;— ekathimerini.com|work=ekathimerini.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression used by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] for these talks is "Greece and the Euro Zone dance on the precipice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3711400/greece-eurozone-bailout/|title=Greece and Eurozone Dance on the Precipice|author=Geoffrey Smith / Fortune|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers (20 February 2015), European leaders agreed to extend Greece's bailout for further four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/business/international/greece-debt-eurozone-finance-ministers.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0|title=Eurozone Officials Reach Accord With Greece to Extend Bailout|date=20 February 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-06-23|first1=Liz|last1=Alderman|first2=James|last2=Kanter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late June 2015 negotiations on a deal had collapsed, and Prime Minister [[Alexis Tsipras]] called a [[Greek bailout referendum, 2015|referendum]] for 5 July on the revised proposals from the IMF and the EU, which he said that his government would campaign against. The referendum was defeated by a margin of 61% to 39%. Eurozone finance ministers have refused to extend the bailout.

Questioned on whether the referendum would be a euro-drachma dilemma, Greece's finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said that European Treaties make provisions for an exit from the EU but do not make any provisions for an exit from the Eurozone. A referendum as a choice involving exit from the Eurozone would violate EU Treaties and EU Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/06/28/as-it-happened-yanis-varoufakis-intervention-during-the-27th-june-2015-eurogroup-meeting/|title=As it happened&amp;nbsp;– Yanis Varoufakis’ intervention during the 27th June 2015 Eurogroup Meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theorized effects on world economies ==

=== Effect upon the European economy ===
[[File:When Greece falls.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon of the "[[domino effect]]" view of a Grexit.]]
Claudia Panseri, head of equity strategy at [[Société Générale]], speculated in late May 2012 that eurozone stocks could plummet up to 50 percent in value if Greece makes a disorderly exit from the eurozone.&lt;ref name=CNBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek Exit Could Trigger 50% Fall in Euro Stocks: Analyst |author=Barnato, Katy |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/47566743 |publisher=[[CNBC]] |date=25 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/682h2Yiz8?url=http://m.cnbc.com/id/47566743 |archivedate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bond market|Bond yields]] in other European nations could widen 1 [[Percentage point|percent point]] to 2 percent points, negatively affecting their ability to service their own sovereign debts.&lt;ref name=CNBC /&gt;

=== Effect upon the world economy ===
Europe in 2010 accounted for 25 percent of [[International trade|world trade]], according to [[Deutsche Bank]].&lt;ref name=CNBC /&gt; Economic depression within the European economy would ripple worldwide and slow global growth.&lt;ref name=CNBC /&gt; However, Greece represents just [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (PPP)|a small fraction]]—less than 2 per cent—of European [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).

== Legality ==
A [[working paper]] published by the [[European Central Bank]] concluded:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Withdrawal and Expulsion from the EU and EMU: Some Reflections |last=Athanassiou |first=Phoebus |date=December 2009 |page=4 |url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp10.pdf |publisher=European Central Bank |ssrn=1517760 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|… that negotiated withdrawal from the EU would not be legally impossible even prior to the ratification of the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], and that unilateral withdrawal would undoubtedly be legally controversial; that, while permissible, a recently enacted exit clause is, prima facie, not in harmony with the rationale of the European unification project and is otherwise problematic, mainly from a legal perspective; that a Member State's exit from [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]], without a parallel withdrawal from the EU, would be legally inconceivable; and that, while perhaps feasible through indirect means, a Member State's expulsion from the EU or EMU, would be legally next to impossible.}}

In the absence of any ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]], the question of whether a country can unilaterally leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU is unclear. The Williams Stamps Farish Professor in Law at the [[University of Texas]] School of Law has suggested that under certain conditions, it is possible for a Member State to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Dammann: [http://www.tilj.org/content/journal/48/num2/Dammann125.pdf "The Right to Leave the Eurozone"] ''Texas International Law Journal'', Volume 48 Issue 2 pp. 126–155, (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Mourning and in Rage''''' was a work of [[performance art]] and activism by [[Suzanne Lacy]] and [[Leslie Labowitz-Starus|Leslie Labowitz]]. The performance took place in [[Los Angeles]], California in 1977 as a response to the rapes and murders covered by the media in the "[[Hillside Strangler]]" case.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Labowitz-Starus|first=Leslie|last2=Lacy|first2=Suzanne|date=1978-01-01|title="In Mourning and in Rage ..."|jstor=3345993|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=52–55|doi=10.2307/3345993}}&lt;/ref&gt;"As if the horror of these crimes wasn't enough, the press coverage of the events sensationalized the sexual nature of the crimes.  For feminist activists in Los Angeles involved in the movement to end violence against women, this analysis was unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moravec|first1=Michelle|title=In Mourning and In Rage|url=http://historyinthecity.blogspot.com/2011/09/in-mourning-and-in-rage.html|website=History of the City|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A continuation of ''Three Weeks in May,'' Lacy and Labowitz designed ''In Mourning and in Rage'' as a personal response to the sensationalized media coverage of violence against women as well as an expression of grief and rage towards the loss of life. The performance was a collaboration between Lacy, Labowitz, Bia Lowe, [[Holly Near]], City Councilwoman Pat Russel, the [[Woman's Building]], Women Against Violence Against Women, and Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. The event was staged for mass media coverage at the [[Los Angeles City Hall]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suzannelacy.com/in-mourning-and-in-rage-1977/|title=In Mourning and In Rage (1977)|website=SUZANNE LACY|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/women-art-and-society/oclc/930389708&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Women, art, and society|last=Chadwick|first=Whitney|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500204054|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance consisted of a large funeral motorcade of black-clad women lead by a hearse from the [[Woman's Building]] to the Los Angeles City Hall. Once there, nine seven-feet-tall women draped in black emerged from the hearse along with a women dressed in red. The mourners then climbed the steps of city hall where each of the nine women gave a statement into a microphone expressing their solidarity with the murdered women, emphasized by a chorus of "In memory of our sisters, we fight back!" from the rest of the motorcade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By making this performance public as well as highly crafted for media coverage, Lacy and Labowitz looked to highlight not only the deaths of the ten women killed by the [[Hillside Strangler]], but the significantly larger population of women victims whose stories went uncovered by mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801307168|title=Pacific standard time : Los Angeles art 1945-1980|last=Rebecca.|first=Peabody,|last2=Calif.)|first2=J.

The piece concluded with direct statements to the press explaining the rationale for the piece as well as a speech demanding resources for women's self defense. Singer-songwriter [[Holly Near]] performed her song "Fight Back"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Near|first1=Holly|title=Fight Back|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBE4Au5myko|website=Youtube|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written specifically for this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irish|first1=Sharon|title=Suzanne Lacy: Spaces Between|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0fCKMCOdO0C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=fight+back+holly+near+composed+lacy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q4DGhJL3eI&amp;sig=kM9wgfqVxJWggucbF-__So5cXqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHro--i_zSAhXmsFQKHdNmDVsQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=fight%20back%20holly%20near%20composed%20lacy&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Univ Of Minnesota Press (February 12, 2010)|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
''In Mourning and in Rage'' was highly covered by the press and resulted in increased support from Los Angeles City Council members and a pledge from the Rape Hotline Alliance to provide self defense classes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To further the conversation about social action and art, Lacy and Labowitz produced a video documenting ''In Mourning and in Rage'' as well as a pamphlet entitled ''What is Social Art?.''

'''Korean New Year''' ({{ko-hhrm|hangul=설날|rr=Seollal|mr=Sŏllal}}) is the first day of the [[Korean calendar|Korean lunar calendar]]. It is one of the most important traditional Korean holidays.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsR3BgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Korean Seasonal Customs|last=|first=|publisher=The National Folk Museum of Korea (South Korea)|year=2014|isbn=8992128924|location=|pages=30-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt; The celebration usually lasts three days: the day before Korean New Year, Korean New Year itself, and the day after Korean New Year. During this time, many Koreans visit family, perform [[Jesa|ancestral rites]], wear ''[[hanbok]]'' ([[Hangul]]: 한복; [[Hanja]]: 韓服), eat traditional food, and play folk games. Additionally, children often receive money from their elders after performing a formal [[Bowing|bow]].&lt;ref name="visitkorea.or.kr" /&gt;

Korean New Year generally occurs in January or February on the second [[new moon]] after the [[winter solstice]], unless there is a [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] eleventh or twelfth month in the lead-up to the New Year. In such a case, the New Year falls on the third new moon after the solstice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujTfCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of New Year’s Holidays Worldwide|last=Crump|first=William D.|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=1476607486|location=|pages=134-135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean New Year typically falls on the same day as [[Chinese New Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtvMDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Statesman's Yearbook 2015: The Politics, Cultures and Economies of the World|last=|first=|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=1349672785|editor-last=Turner|editor-first=Barry|location=|pages=756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The earliest references to Korean New Year are believed to be found in the 3rd century Chinese historical work, ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]], Book of Wei, Volume 30.''&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E5%9C%8B%E5%BF%97/%E5%8D%B730|title=三國志/卷30|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikisource|language=zh|trans-title=Book of Wei, Volume 30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records of 7th century Korean New Year celebrations are included in the Chinese historical works, the ''[[Book of Sui]]'' and the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]''.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0028997|title=|last=Kim|first=Myeong-ja|date=2010|work=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture|publisher=Academy of Korean Studies|language=Korean|script-title=ko:설|trans-title=Lunar New Year|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century, Korean New Year was one of the nine major Korean festivals that included ancestral rites, according to the Korean historical work, the ''[[Goryeosa]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Customs ==
[[File:Hanbok (한복) (4261102177).jpg|thumb|246x246px|'''Hanbok''']]
Korean New Year is typically a family holiday.&lt;ref name="visitkorea.or.kr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=941952|title=Celebrating Seollal in Korea: Glimpse of Local New Year’s Customs|last=|first=|date=2018-02-02|website=Visit Korea|publisher=Korea Tourism Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-day holiday is used by many to return to their hometowns to visit their parents and other relatives, where they perform an ancestral ritual called ''[[charye]]''. The three days are the day of, the day before, and the after.&lt;ref name="visitkorea.or.kr"/&gt; In 2016, 36 million South Koreans reportedly would be traveling to visit their families during the Korean New Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bi.galegroup.com/essentials/article/GALE%7CA442021001/d10a7c8299881284e692c10fe613c675|title=Redirect Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koreans not only travel within the country, but around the world, as well. Many Koreans travel from overseas to visit their families for this annual holiday. Since it is one of the few times families may be able to get together and catch up on one another's lives, it is considered respectful and important to attend the holiday. Often, the family members first visit the elders, and this includes the grandparents and the parents. It is also considered respectful for people to visit their mothers- and fathers-in-law during the Korean New Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2013/08/135_130229.html|title=Daughters-in-law vs. mothers-in-law|date=8 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including travel expense, preparation for this holiday is very costly. Gifts are usually given to family members and new clothes are worn during the holiday. Traditional food is prepared for many family members coming to visit for the holiday. Fruits are especially expensive. Due to the increased demand, food prices are inflated during the month of Seollal. As a result, some people have chosen to forgo some traditions because they have become too expensive.  These families prepare a modest ancestral rite only with necessary foods for Seollal. The government has started taking certain measures to help stabilize and support ordinary people's livelihood for Seollal holiday period. They have raised the supply of agricultural, fishery, and livestock products. The government used the rice reserves and pork imports to lower inflation. The government is also putting money into small and medium-sized companies to help with cash flow.

Many preparations go into celebrating the Korean New Year. During the first morning, Koreans pay their respect towards their ancestors. Traditional foods are placed on a table as an offering to the ancestors, and a rite begins with deep bows from all family members. This is a sign of respect and a very important practice on the first day of the New Year in Korea. It is also where they pray for the well-being of all the family members.&lt;ref name="visitkorea.or.kr"/&gt; Many Koreans dress up in colorful traditional Korean clothing called ''[[hanbok]]''. Hanbok are usually worn for special occasions such as weddings, Korean New Year, child's first birthday, etc.&lt;ref name="visitkorea.or.kr"/&gt; However, with modernization and evolving mores in the culture, more people tend to prefer westernized, modern clothing to the hanbok. After the rite, the members have a big feast.

Additionally, Koreans follow a zodiac similar to the Chinese zodiac. Twelve (12) animals represent the 12 years in sequential order with the rat/mouse representing the first year.  Buddha is believed to have invited animals from all over the world to visit, to which only 12 visited. In return, he honored them by naming the years in the order that they arrived.&lt;ref name="theseoultimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=12639&amp;PHPSESSID=57bceeea8a5a2fafc46566ff1f589a56|title=The Seoul Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koreans believe that specific zodiac animals bring specific resources and qualities. For example, the year 2014 was the year of the horse, and it was considered a good year in the money and career aspect of life. It is said that a person born in a specific zodiacal year will carry that zodiac animal's characteristics. As a result, Koreans plan their year and activities around it to have a good, prosperous year. Parents may have even planned the birth year of their child, so the child may have a specific characteristic. It is fair to say that the Korean zodiac is an important part of Korea's culture.&lt;ref name="theseoultimes.com"/&gt;

Another custom observed is the lighting of a "moon house" built from burnable firewood and branches. This symbolizes the warding off of bad/evil spirits for the new year. Many also choose to add wishes they want come true in the next year to the moon house.

== Sebae ==
[[File:Korean Tradition Bow.jpg|thumb|Korean traditional bow]]
Sebae (세배, 歲拜, ''worship elders'') is a ritual of filial piety that is traditionally observed on Seollal. Dressed in [[Hanbok|traditional clothing]], children wish their elders (grandparents, parents and aunts and uncles) a happy new year by performing a deep traditional bow (rites with more than one bow involved are usually for the deceased) and the words ''saehae bok mani badeuseyo'' ([[Hangul]]: 새해 복 많이 받으세요), or "Please receive a lot of good fortune for the New Year". Elders typically reward this gesture by giving children new year's money, or "pocket money" (usually in the form of crisp paper money) in silk bags made with beautiful traditional designs, as well as offering words of wisdom (dŏkdam). Historically, parents gave out rice cakes ''([[ddeok]])'' and fruit to their children.

== New Year food ==

=== Tteokguk ===
{{main article|Tteokguk}}
''Tteokguk'' (soup with sliced rice cakes) is a traditional Korean food that is customarily eaten for the New Year. According to [[Korean age reckoning]], the Korean New Year is similar to a birthday for Koreans, and eating ''tteokguk'' is part of the birthday celebration. Once you finish eating your ''tteokguk'', you are one year older.

On Korean New Year day, people prepare a lot of food and spend much of the day with family.

=== Jeon ===
{{Main article|Jeon (food)}}
''Jeon'', sometimes called ''buchimgae'', is a traditional Korean dish especially eaten on the Korean New Year's Day. A savory pancake, one would expect it to be sliced with a knife. However, the ''jeon'' is ripped apart with chopsticks in the belief of making it taste better.

== Folk games ==
{{see also|Traditional games of Korea}}
Many traditional games are associated with the Korean New Year. The traditional family board game ''[[yut|yutnori]]'' remains a popular game, especially during Korean New Year. It is played using a set of specially designed sticks and is considered appropriate for all ages and genders.  Men and boys traditionally would also fly rectangle [[kite]]s called ''Yeon'' ([[Hangul]]: 연, see ''[[yeonnalligi]]''), and also play ''[[jegichagi]]'', a game in which a light object is wrapped in paper or cloth, and then kicked in a [[footbag]] like manner. Korean women and girls would have traditionally played ''[[neolttwigi]]'', a game of jumping on a seesaw ([[Hangul]]: 시소), and ''[[gongginori]]'', a game played with five little ''[[gonggi]]'' (originally a little stone, but today many buy manufactured ''gongi'' in toy shops&gt;).  Top (''paengi'' (([[Hangul]]: 팽이) in Korean) spinning is also a traditional game played by children. Recently, a few adults play [[Go-Stop]] instead of traditional [[hwatu]].

The crew scuttled the ship during the operation.&lt;ref name="tg1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tumgazeteler.com/?a=1345912 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717113237/http://www.tumgazeteler.com/?a=1345912 |title=''Kısmetim 1'' Davasında Yeni Karar |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 18, 2009 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MV ''Kısmetim-1'' was owned by [[Osman Ayanoğlu]].
The morphine base on the ship, worth millions of dollars, belonged to a consortium of himself and his partners including [[Şeyhmus Daş]] and [[Hüseyin Baybaşin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2425825.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Keeping tabs on the Turkish connection |date=November 14, 2002 |accessdate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; all Turkish [[drug lord]]s.&lt;ref name="aks"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/detay.php?id=10021 |publisher=Aksiyon |title=Nejat Daş Olayının Perde Arkası |author=Akyol, Fuat |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=January 18, 2009 |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223171051/http://www.aksiyon.com.tr/detay.php?id=10021 |archivedate=February 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voyage ==

MV ''Kısmetim-1'' departed on October 7, 1991 from the Port of Yarımca in [[İzmit]], [[Turkey]], carrying dyestuff to [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. As the ship docked at the destination port, Celal Kambur, the ship's purser started a conversation with the port policeman Yousuf Chacha. The Pakistani policeman asked the Turkish crew member to deliver a package to [[Ajman]], a port in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). The package contained {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[heroin]] at a price of US$1.00 per gram.&lt;ref name="sab"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2001/01/13/g07.html |publisher=Sabah |title=Yükümüzü Atom Sanıyordum |author=Fıratlı, Nurhan |date=January 13, 2001 |language=Turkish |accessdate=January 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after leaving the [[Port of Karachi]], the captain received a radio message saying that the ship's owner Osman Ayanoğlu was ambushed and murdered. On the way to [[United Arab Emirates#Ports and harbours|Port of Ajman]] before dawn, the captain ordered to pickup goods from a motorboat on high sea, which docked the ship. More than 100 sacks were pulled up into the ship in the darkness. The captain told the crew that the sacks contained [[nuclear material]] for the [[Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation (Turkey)|MKE]]&lt;ref name="sab" /&gt;

The ship arrived in Ajman to unload fertilizer. Celal Kambur met the Pakistani drug dealer and received the money in a restaurant. The delivery of the drug package took place at 23:00 local time the same day by throwing to a boat, which pulled alongside the ship.&lt;ref name="sab" /&gt;

The next morning, police raid the ship and found the money of US$10,000 from the drug trade on Celal Kambur. He was tried and found guilty for the drug crime. The ship moored at the port for six months during the trial and was only allowed to leave as the trial ended, and Celal Kambur was put into prison.&lt;ref name="sab" /&gt;

Celal Kambur served his heavy prison sentence and was pardoned after nine years by the emir of Ajman, one of the seven emirates of the UAE federation.&lt;ref name="sab" /&gt;

== Operation ==

Since its departure from Karachi, the ship was under close surveillance by the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], which was forwarding all the relevant information to the Turkish Police. The incident in Ajman was very disappointing for the US and Turkish law enforcement services since they feared the main smuggle would have been revealed.

Finally, the ship passed through the [[Suez Canal]] and sailed into the Mediterranean Sea. Three Turkish Navy warships, the frigate [[List of major surface ships of the Turkish Navy#Yavuz class|TCG ''Yıldırım'' (F 243)]], the destroyer [[TCG Savaştepe (D 348)|TCG ''Savaştepe'' (D 348)]], the submarine rescue ship [[TCG Akın (A 585)|TCG ''Akın'' (A 585)]] and the US destroyer [[USS Briscoe (DD-977)|USS ''Briscoe'' (DD-977)]] carrying Turkish and US narcotic policemen as well as maritime patrol aircraft of type [[P-3 Orion]] deployed from [[Sicily]] intercepted the ship&lt;ref name="esh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ensonhaber.com/comment_view.php?id=178261&amp;type=1 |publisher=EnSonHaber |title=ETÖ'nün uluslararası eroin işi.. |author=Nayır, Cemil Nabi |date=January 9, 2009 |accessdate=February 1, 2009 |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117031059/http://www.ensonhaber.com/comment_view.php?id=178261&amp;type=1 |archivedate=January 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in high sea before she tried to escape to [[Cyprus]], a country, which Turkey has no good international relations with. Following the four days lasting joint operation, the ship went down with all its load, the nine crew were rescued.&lt;ref name="mil" /&gt;

The US and Turkish officials claimed that the crew deliberately sank the ship in order to prevent the capture of the drug load. The ship's crew denied this allegation before the court declaring that the ship sank due to rough sea.&lt;ref name="mil" /&gt;

The operation was led on site by [[Necdet Menzir]], director of Istanbul Police Department and [[Mestan Şener]], head of the narcotics bureau. [[Mehmet Ağar]], director general of the Turkish Police and [[Ismet Sezgin]], minister of interior, were in command of the operation.&lt;ref name="esh"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==

Şeyhmus Daş was shot to death on December 25, 1992 in Istanbul in his car when he was on the way to a wedding ceremony along with his wife and two daughters. The killing occurred ten days after the Kısmetim-1 incident and two weeks before the [[Lucky-S incident]], another drug smuggling operation on the sea.&lt;ref name="mil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2002/06/20/guncel/agun.html |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nDDLnZ7tLVcJ:www.milliyet.com.tr/2002/06/20/guncel/agun.html+lucky+s&amp;hl=tr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=tr |title=''Lucky-S''’in Sırları Daş’la Mezara Girdi |archivedate=December 9, 2008 |accessdate=January 18, 2009 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nejat Daş]], son of Şeyhmus Daş, who had carried out the drug trade negotiations in Karachi on behalf of his father, was tried at the 2nd State Security Court (DGM) in [[Istanbul]] and found guilty of [[drug trafficking]]. He was charged with 5 years and 10 months of heavy prison sentence. He escaped the prison on November 8, 1994, as he was brought from [[Sinop Fortress Prison]] to the 1st DGM in Istanbul for trial due to his involvement in the [[Lucky-S incident]].&lt;ref name="tg1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48266">[[File:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Pierre de Coubertin|Under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach, [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]] won a gold medal in the literature category at the [[Art competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Summer Olympics]].]]

There were '''146 medalists''' in [[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|the art competitions]] that were part of the [[Olympic Games]] from [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]] until [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]]. These art competitions were considered an integral part of the movement by [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]] and necessary to recapture the complete essence of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. Their absence before the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], according to journalism professor Richard Stanton, stems from Coubertin "not wanting to fragment the focus of his new and fragile movement".&lt;ref name="Stanton3"&gt;{{cite book|last = Stanton|first = Richard|title = The Forgotten Olympic Art Competitions|publisher = [[Trafford Publishing]]|edition = 1st|date = 2000|location = [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]|page = 3|isbn = 1552126064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art competitions were originally planned for inclusion in the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] but were delayed after that edition's change in venue from Rome to London following the 1906 eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].&lt;ref name="Stanton18"&gt;Stanton, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] they had grown to be considered internationally relevant and potentially "a milestone in advancing public awareness of art as a whole".&lt;ref name="Stanton69"&gt;Stanton, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During their first three appearances, the art competitions were grouped into five broad categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. The Dutch Organizing Committee for the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] split these into subcategories in the hopes of increasing participation.&lt;ref name="Stanton95"&gt;Stanton, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was a successful strategy, the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] eliminated several of these subcategories, which led to fewer entries in the broader categories.&lt;ref name="Stanton146"&gt;Stanton, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], the German government proposed the addition of a film contest to the program, which was rejected.&lt;ref name="Stanton158"&gt;Stanton, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a final appearance at the [[1948 Summer Olympics]], art competitions were removed from the Olympic program. Planners of the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee.&lt;ref name="Stanton210"&gt;Stanton, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments,&lt;ref name="Stanton211"&gt;Stanton, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions during the course of the Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer [[Olympic games|Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Stanton213"&gt;Stanton, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC does not track medalists in Olympic art competitions in its database and thus the prize winners are only officially recorded in the original Olympic reports. Judges were not required to distribute first, second, and third place awards for every category, and thus certain events lack medalists in these placements. Since participants were allowed multiple submissions, it was also possible for artists to win more than one in a single event, as [[Alex Diggelmann]] of Switzerland did in the graphic arts category of the 1948 edition.&lt;ref name="1948 Report"&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Official Report of the Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad London 1948|page = 536|publisher = The Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad|location = [[London]]|date = 1951|url = http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948part2.pdf|format = PDF|accessdate = 2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diggelmann is tied with Denmark's [[Josef Petersen]], who won second prize three times in literature, for the amount of medals captured in the art competitions. Luxembourg's [[Jean Jacoby]] is the only individual to win two gold medals, doing so in painting in 1924 and 1928. Of the 146 medalists, 11 were women and only Finnish author [[Aale Tynni]] was awarded gold. Germany was the most successful nation, with eight gold, seven silver, and nine bronze medals,&lt;ref name="SRArt"&gt;{{cite web|last = Gjerde|first = Arild|author2 = Jeroen Heijmans|author3 = Bill Mallon|author4 = Hilary Evans|title = Art Competitions|work = Olympics|publisher = Sports Reference.com|year = 2011|url = https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/ART/|accessdate = 2012-03-07|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/66VSjSXMP?url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/ART/|archivedate = 2012-03-28|deadurl = no|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; although one was won by Coubertin himself, a Frenchman. He submitted his poem ''Ode to Sport'' under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach, as if it were a joint-entry, and won first prize in the 1912 literature category. The original report credits this medal to Germany.&lt;ref name="Coubertin"&gt;{{cite web|last = Gjerde|first = Arild|author2 = Jeroen Heijmans|author3 = Bill Mallon|author4 = Hilary Evans|title = Pierre, Baron de Coubertin Biography and Olympic Results|work = Olympics|publisher = Sports Reference.com|year = 2011|url = https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/pierre-baron-de-coubertin-1.html|accessdate = 2012-03-07|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/66VT2aWgB?url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/pierre-baron-de-coubertin-1.html|archivedate = 2012-03-28|deadurl = no|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two individuals, [[Walter W.

==Reception==
Holly Ellingwood, writing for Active Anime, enjoyed how You Higuri brought historical facts into her story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ellingwood |first=Holly |url=http://activeanime.com/html/2009/07/06/ludwig-ii-vol-1/ |title=Ludwig II Vol. 1 |work=activeAnime |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=October 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Casey Brienza, writing for Graphic Novel Reporter, described ''Ludwig II'' as being "an updated ''[[Rose of Versailles]]''", due to its "bold lines, asymmetrical layouts" and European setting, describing it as being less about the history than about the personalities in that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123094858/http://graphicnovelreporter.com/content/ludwig-ii-vol-1-review |title=Ludwig II, Vol. 1 |publisher= Graphic Novel Reporter | url=http://www.graphicnovelreporter.com/content/ludwig-ii-vol-1-review | archivedate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katherine Dacey enjoyed Higuri's "sensual artwork — her languid character designs, sumptuous interiors, and Wagnerian imagery", but disliked the sexual torture of the king's lover, Richard Hornig.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mangacritic.com/?p=1274#ludwig2 Short Takes: Black Bird, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, and Ludwig II&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Leroy Douresseaux, writing for Comic Book Bin, felt "You Higuri’s use of romantic entanglements, sex, and political machinations makes for an excellent, engaging read." and also enjoyed the artwork,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookbin.com/ludwig201.html Ludwig II: Volume 1 (Yaoi)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; noting Higuri's use of toning and sparkling techniques around Ludwig to symbolise the "enchanted fantasy world he wants to inhabit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookbin.com/ludwig202.html Ludwig II.: Volume 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Melinda Beasi, writing for PopCultureShock, felt that the plot could have been closer to real life, but noted that the "palpable loneliness" of the real Ludwig II does not fit well into the boys love genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/manga/index.php/reviews/manga-reviews/ludwig-ii-vols-1-2/ |title=Ludwig II, Vols. 1-2 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qvhBygJK?url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/manga/index.php/reviews/manga-reviews/ludwig-ii-vols-1-2/ |archivedate=2 July 2010 |author=Beasi, Melinda |date=2 January 2010 |publisher=Pop Culture Shock |accessdate=April 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malagan''' (also spelled '''malangan''' or '''malanggan''') ceremonies are large, intricate traditional cultural events that take place in parts of [[New Ireland Province|New Ireland]] province in [[Papua New Guinea]].  The word '''malagan''' refers to wooden carvings prepared for ceremonies and to an entire system of traditional culture. 
==Malagan ceremonies==

''Malagan'' [[ceremonies]] are the most large-scale and famous of the many events that take place within the ''malagan'' culture.  They take place irregularly, and are typically large and complex events, taking several days, and requiring months or years of preparation. {{Citation needed|reason=Needs sources to back up claims|date=December 2018}}

While a ''malagan'' ceremony is always held in the name of one or more people who have died in recent years, it is not at all merely a mortuary rite.  Many other interactions take place within the overall event, including announcements, repayment of debts, recognition of obligations, resolution of disputes, and many other customary activities.

==Malagan carvings and carvers==
[[Image:Malagan carvings.jpg|thumb|Malagan carvings]]

''Malagan'' [[Wood carving|carvings]], now world-famous, are the wooden carvings which are created for use in ''malagan'' ceremonies.  Traditionally these were burnt  or placed in a cave to rot at the conclusion of the event; in modern times most are now retained, as the carving tradition is now only known by a few. Contemporary masters of ''malagan'' form include Michael Homerang of Madina Village, Ben Sisia of  Libba Village (northern New Ireland) and Edward and Mathew Salle of Lava Village (Tatau, Tabar Islands, New Ireland).  Many ''malagan'' carvings are held in European and other [[museum]]s.

==Malagan culture==

''Malagan'' culture is the general term for the traditional culture in the area where ''malagan'' ceremonies take place, covering much of Northern New Ireland province.  There are many other ceremonies and customary practices within this large and complex cultural system.

The word ''malagan'' comes from the [[Nalik language]] of northern [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]].  Alternative spellings include ''malangan'' and ''malanggan''.

A '''meeting''' is when two or more [[Homo sapiens|people]] come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal or business setting, but meetings also occur in a variety of other environments. Many various types of meetings exist.

== Definition ==
[[File:2screensystem.jpg|thumb|A modern [[videoconferencing]] system]]

A meeting is a gathering of two or more people that has been convened for the purpose of achieving a common goal through verbal interaction, such as sharing information or reaching agreement.&lt;ref name="pi"/&gt; Meetings may occur face-to-face or virtually, as mediated by communications technology, such as a [[conference call|telephone conference call]], a [[Skype|skyped conference call]] or a [[videoconferencing|videoconference]]. One Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a meeting as "an act or process of coming together" - for example "as [...] an assembly for a common purpose [...]".&lt;ref name="pu"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meeting Meeting – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. (n.d.). Dictionary and Thesaurus – Merriam-Webster Online. Retrieved 2016-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meeting planner]]s and other meeting [[professional]]s may use the term "meeting" to denote an event booked at a hotel, [[convention center]] or any other venue dedicated to such gatherings.&lt;ref name="pi"&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos298.htm Meeting and Convention Planners]. (2009, December 17). [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]]. Retrieved April 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

* Investigative meeting, generally when conducting a pre-interview, exit interview or a meeting among the investigator and representative
* [[Kickoff meeting]], the first meeting with a [[project]] team and the client of the project to discuss the role of each team-member&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sullivant | first=J. | title=Strategies for Protecting National Critical Infrastructure Assets: A Focus on Problem-Solving | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-470-22836-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_6t1nRPDi4C&amp;pg=PA89 | access-date=October 1, 2018 | page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Town hall meeting]], an informal public gathering.

:* Management meeting, a meeting among [[manager]]s
:* Staff meeting, typically a meeting between a manager and those that report to that manager
:* [[Team meeting]], in project contexts - a meeting among colleagues working on various aspects of a [[team]] project.

Other varieties include breakfast meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chaney | first=L.H. | last2=Martin | first2=J.S. | title=The Essential Guide to Business Etiquette | publisher=[[Praeger Publishing|Praeger]] | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-275-99714-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xIFsS1IVGUC&amp;pg=PA114 | access-date=October 1, 2018 | page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; off-site meetings (or [[Awayday]] meetings in the UK), and "stand-up meetings" where participants stand up to encourage brevity.

Since a meeting can be held once or often, the meeting organizer has to determine the repetition and frequency of occurrence of the meeting: one-time， recurring meeting， or a series meeting such as a monthly "lunch and learn" event at a company, church, club or organization in which the placeholder is the same, but the agenda and topics to be covered vary.{{cn|date=November 2018}} In Russian, a "flying meeting" ({{lang-ru | летучий митинг | translit = letuchij miting }}) is a hastily-called brief meeting.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Catherine Anne "Cathy" Cesnik''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[School Sisters of Notre Dame|SSND]]}} (born November 17, 1942; disappeared November 7, 1969) was a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[religious sister]] who taught English and drama at the formerly all-girls [[Archbishop Keough High School]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland.

Cesnik's murder is the basis for the [[Netflix]] documentary web series ''[[The Keepers]]'' in 2017.

== Biography ==
Catherine Anne Cesnik was born on November 17, 1942, in the [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania neighborhood of [[Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh)|Lawrenceville]], located in the city's east end. She was the eldest child of Joseph and Anna Omulac Cesnik (died 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill |first=Brian |date=May 13, 2017 |title=Justice for Sister Cathy is Long Overdue |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/brian-oneill/2017/05/14/Sister-Cathy-Catherine-Cesnik-murder-Baltimore-1969/stories/201705140086 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |publisher=PG Publishing Co. |access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her paternal grandparents, John (Jan) and Johanna Tomec Česnik, were Slovenians who emigrated from [[Yugoslavia]] to Pittsburgh,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Cesnik in 1930 Census; Census Place: Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania; 1930 United States Federal Census; National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; while her maternal grandfather, Joseph Omulac, came from Yugoslavia and maternal grandmother, Martha Hudok, was born in [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania, Marriages, 1852–1968&lt;/ref&gt; Cesnick had three siblings.

Cesnik attended St. Mary's School on 57th Street and St. Augustine High School, both in Lawrenceville. She was [[valedictorian]] of her [[Catholic school|Catholic high school]] class in 1960, where she had also been the [[May Queen]] and the president of the senior class and [[student council]].

== Disappearance and death ==
At the time she disappeared, Cesnik was teaching at [[Western High School (Baltimore)|Western High School]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun2"/&gt; On November 7, 1969, she left the apartment she shared with Sister Helen Russell Phillips at the Carriage House Apartments, at 131 North Bend Road in [[Catonsville, Maryland|Catonsville]], en route to the [[Edmondson, Baltimore|Edmondson Village Shopping Center]] to purchase a gift at [[Hecht's]] for her sister's engagement.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun1"&gt;{{cite news |date=January 8, 1970 |title=Sister Catherine Cesnik Case: Missing Nun's Body Found in Lansdowne |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/retro-baltimore/catherine-cesnik/bal-missing-nun-s-body-found-in-lansdowne-20170516-story.html |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records indicate Cesnik cashed a paycheck at [[FNB Corporation|First National Bank]] in Catonsville that night and possibly made a purchase at Muhly's Bakery in Edmondson Village, since a box of bakery buns was found in the front seat of Cesnik's car.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun2"&gt;{{cite news |date=May 19, 2017 |title=Timeline: The Sister Catherine Cesnik Case|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/retro-baltimore/catherine-cesnik/bal-timeline-the-sister-catherine-cesnik-case-20170518-story.html |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car, in muddy condition, was found illegally parked across from her apartment complex at 4:40 the next morning by Russell's friends, the priests Peter McKeon and Gerard J. Koob.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun2"/&gt; Residents of Carriage House Apartments spotted Cesnik in her car at approximately 8:30 that night, and others spotted her car at the illegally parked location across the street around two hours later.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun2"/&gt;

Police searched the area immediately following Cesnik's disappearance but did not find her. On January 3, 1970, her body was found by a hunter and his son, in an informal landfill located on the 2100 block of Monumental Road, in a remote area of [[Lansdowne, Maryland|Lansdowne]].&lt;ref name="baltimoresun1"/&gt; An [[autopsy]] performed by Deputy Medical Examiner [[Werner Spitz]] revealed that Cesnik died from an [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] following a fracture to her skull from a blow to her left temple by a blunt instrument.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The  case remains unsolved .

==Background==
During Cesnik's tenure at [[Seton Keough High School|Archbishop Keough High School]], it is alleged that two of the priests, Fathers [[Joseph Maskell]] and E. Neil Magnus, were [[Catholic sex abuse cases in the United States|sexually abusing the girls at the school]] in addition to [[sex trafficking|trafficking]] them to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koch |first=Denise |date=February 27, 2017 |title=Baltimore Priest Victim: Police Were in on Sexual Abuse |url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2017/02/27/victim-of-notorious-baltimore-priest-says-police-were-in-on-sexual-abuse/ |work=CBS Baltimore |access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1995, Teresa Lancaster and Jean Wehner (née Hargadon), former students at Keough who claim to have been sexually abused by Maskell, filed a lawsuit against the school which was dismissed under the [[statute of limitations]] (''Jane Doe et al. v. A. Joseph Maskell et al.''). Wehner said that Cesnik once came to her and said gently, "Are the priests hurting you?" Both women have said that she is the only one who helped them and other girls abused by Maskell, ''et al.'', and have said that she was murdered prior to discussing the matter with the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]], although there is no evidence for this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Jennifer |date=April 20, 2017 |title=The Next Making a Murderer: Netflix Releases Trailer for True Crime Docu-series about Baltimore Nun's Unsolved 1969 Killing and How the Church 'Covered It Up' |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4430080/Netflix-releases-trailer-new-crime-series-Killers.html |work=Mail Online |access-date=April 20, 2017}}{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost" /&gt;

There is currently no physical evidence linking Maskell to the crime. It was revealed in late 2016 that the Archdiocese had paid off numerous settlements to Maskell's alleged victims since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Knezevich |first=Alison |date=November 15, 2016 |title=Baltimore Archdiocese Pays Settlements to a Dozen People Alleging Abuse by Late Priest |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-maskell-settlements-20161115-story.html |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wehner alleges that, two months before Cesnik's body was discovered, and only a day or two after Cesnik disappeared on November 7, Maskell drove her to a wooded site near [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Fort Meade]] and showed her the body. Wehner claims to remember trying repeatedly to brush off the [[maggot]]s crawling on Cesnik's face while frantically repeating the words, "Help me, help me." Wehner's account was brought into question by scientific evidence showing that it would have been impossible for maggots to be alive at the relevant time of year. However, pathologist [[Werner Spitz]], who worked on the case, later confirmed that there had been maggots in both the victim's mouth and trachea when found. Meteorological records also disclose that the temperature the week in question was high enough for maggots to hatch.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} It is alleged that Maskell reportedly told Wehner, "You see what happens when you say bad things about people?"&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost" /&gt;

Several days later, on November 13, the body of [[Murder of Joyce Malecki|Joyce Malecki]], a 20-year-old woman who looked like Wehner, was discovered by "two hunters" in the same wooded location where Maskell had driven Wehner to see Cesnik's body. Cesnik's body was not found until January 3, 1970, and its discovery by "two hunters" was not in the wooded location near Fort Meade but on the open hill trash dump of a small business property in Lansdowne.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 2016, the [[Baltimore County Police Department]] (BCPD) reassigned the case due to retiring officers, prompting new interviews and further investigation into the alleged sexual abuse at Keough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |year=2017 |title=About the BCoPD Cold Case Unit and the Sister Catherine Ann Cesnik Homicide |url=http://www.archbalt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sistercesnikreleasetimeline.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Baltimore County Police Department |access-date=June 14, 2017 |via=Archdiocese of Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attaining permission from the [[State's attorney]]'s office, the BCPD exhumed the body of Maskell, who died of a major stroke in 2001, but did not find a DNA match to evidence from the crime scene.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun3"&gt;{{cite news |last=Knezevich |first=Alison |date=May 17, 2017 |title=Police: Exhumed Priest's DNA Does Not Match Evidence from Crime Scene Killing of Sister Cathy |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-co-dna-maskell-20170517-story.html |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |access-date=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Knezevich |first=Alison |date=May 4, 2017 |title=Priest's Body Exhumed from Randallstown Cemetery in Investigation of Baltimore Nun's Decades-Old Killing |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-county/bs-md-co-priest-exhumed-20170504-story.html |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police spokeswoman Elise Armacost announced that this discovery does not exclude Maskell from being a suspect in the case.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun3" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Netflix]] produced a seven-part documentary series about the case called ''[[The Keepers]]'', which debuted on May 19, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Liebman |first=Lisa |date=May 19, 2017 |title=The Dead Nun, the School Sex Scandal, and the Amateur Detectives Fighting for Justice |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/the-keepers-netflix-who-killed-sister-cathy-true-crime |work=Vanity Fair |access-date=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series features interviews with women who were Cesnik's students, and with some of those who were sexually abused by Maskell and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McDonell-Parry |first=Amelia |date=May 19, 2017 |title='The Keepers': Inside Netflix's Compelling New True-Crime Docuseries |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/the-keepers-inside-compelling-new-true-crime-docuseries-w483230 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=December 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Victory Celebration''' was held in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, on June 8, 1991, to celebrate the conclusion of [[Gulf War]]. It was the biggest [[military parade]] since [[World War II]]. 8,000 Desert Storm troops marched in the national parade. A small group of Vietnam veterans also took part in the parade. General [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]], the commander of the Desert Storm forces, led the parade.{{sfn|Cohen|Gatti|1991|pp=312–313}} The parade, took place on [[Constitution Avenue]], [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] and across the [[Arlington Memorial Bridge|Memorial Bridge]]. The elaborate parade, which cost $12 million, was criticized by opponents because they claimed it to be militaristic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/how-cbs-news-reported-the-last-national-military-parade-in-1991/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/06/09/Desert-Storm-Victory-Celebration/9997676440000/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-09/news/mn-986_1_victory-celebration&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/06/10/on-the-mall-the-celebration-lingers/89f330fe-462e-457f-b8c4-c8162d82c6d5/&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebration helped to set a single day Metrorail record of 786,358 trips, breaking the record of 604,089 trips set during the [[Inauguration of George H. W. Bush]] set in 1989. The record would last until the [[First inauguration of Bill Clinton]] in 1993. It also set the weekend record which would last 17 years until it was broken by the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]].

'''Oneonta Theatre''' is a historic [[theatre]] building located at [[Oneonta, New York|Oneonta]] in [[Otsego County, New York]]. The original structure was built about 1897 and expanded in several stages.  The original three story structure was a generally rectangular block with storefronts and theater entrance on the first floor and apartments above.  A theater wing projected from the rear was set at a 45-degree angle.  In 1922, the theater was expanded and the entrance relocated to the center of the building.  The 1922 marquee was removed in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=8527|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Oneonta Theatre|date=August 2001|accessdate=2010-01-14 |author=Kathleen LaFrank|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}} ''See also:'' {{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=8528|title=Accompanying five photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Military of the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}

The '''Ottoman wars in Europe''' were a series of military conflicts between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and various European states dating from the [[Late Middle Ages]] up through the early 20th century. The earliest conflicts began during the [[Byzantine–Ottoman wars]], waged in [[Anatolia]] in the late 13th century before entering Europe in the mid 14th century, followed by the [[Bulgarian–Ottoman wars]] and the [[Serbian–Ottoman wars]] waged beginning in the mid 14th century. Much of this period was characterized by [[Rumelia|Ottoman expansion into the Balkans]]. The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe.&lt;ref&gt; Alexander Lyon Macfie, ''The Eastern Question 1774-1923'' (2nd ed 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.S. Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Ottoman–Venetian Wars]] spanned four centuries, starting in 1423 and lasting until 1718. This period witnessed the [[Siege of Negroponte (1470)|fall of Negroponte]] in 1470, the [[Siege of Famagusta|fall of Famagusta]] ([[Cyprus]]) in 1571, the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571 (at that time the [[largest naval battle in history]]), the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)#Fall of Candia|fall of Candia]] ([[Kingdom of Candia|Crete]]) in 1669, the Venetian [[Morean War|reconquest of Morea]] ([[Peloponnese]]) in the 1680s and [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–1718)#The Ottoman conquest of the Morea|its loss again]] in 1715. The island of [[Ionian Islands under Venetian rule|Corfu under Venetian rule]] remained the only Greek island not conquered by the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Kakissis, Joanna, ''Athens &amp; the Islands'', (National Geographic Society, 2011), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late seventeenth century, European powers began to consolidate against the Ottomans and formed the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]], reversing a number of Ottoman land gains during the [[Great Turkish War]] of 1683–99. Nevertheless, Ottoman armies were able to hold their own against their European rivals until the second half of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aksan |first=Virginia |title=Ottoman Wars, 1700–1860: An Empire Besieged |publisher=Pearson Education Ltd. |date=2007 |pages=130-5 |isbn=978-0-582-30807-7 }}

This occurred in tandem with the [[Russo-Turkish wars]], which further destabilized the empire. The final retreat of Ottoman rule came with the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–1913), followed by the signing of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] at the close of World War I.

== Rise of the Ottomans (1299–1453) ==
{{See also|Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Socioeconomics of the Ottoman enlargement era}}

===Byzantine Empire===
{{main|Byzantine–Ottoman wars}}
[[File:Zonaro GatesofConst.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Fall of Constantinople |Conquest of Constantinople]] by Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] in 1453]]
After [[Fall of Gallipoli|striking a blow]] to the weakened [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1356 (or in 1358 -  disputable due to a change in the Byzantine calendar), (see [[Süleyman Pasha (son of Orhan)|Süleyman Pasha]]) which provided it with Gallipoli as a basis for operations in Europe, the Ottoman Empire started its westward expansion into the European continent in the middle of the 14th century.

[[Constantinople]] fell in 1453 after the [[Battle of Varna]] (1444) and the [[Second Battle of Kosovo]] (1448).

The remaining [[Byzantine Greeks|Greek]] states fell in 1461 ([[Despotate of the Morea]] and [[Empire of Trebizond]]) (see: [[Ottoman Greece]]).

===Bulgarian Empire===
{{main|Bulgarian–Ottoman wars}}
In the latter half of the 14th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] proceeded to advance north and west in the Balkans, completely subordinating [[Thrace]] and much of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] after the [[Battle of Maritsa]] in 1371. [[Sofia]] fell in 1382, followed by the capital of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovgrad]] in 1393, and the northwest remnants of the state after the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396.

===Serbian Empire===
{{main|Serbian–Ottoman wars}}

A significant opponent of the Ottomans, the young [[Serbian Empire]], was worn down by a series of campaigns, notably in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, in which the leaders of both armies were killed, and which gained a central role in Serbian folklore as an epic battle and as the beginning of the end for medieval Serbia. Much of [[Serbia]] fell to the Ottomans by 1459, the Kingdom of Hungary made a partial reconquest in 1480, but it fell again by 1499. Territories of Serbian Empire were divided between [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and [[Royal Hungary]], with remaining territories being in some sort of a vassal status towards Hungary, until its own conquest.

== Growth (1453–1683) ==
{{See also|Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire}}

The defeat in 1456 at the [[Siege of Nándorfehérvár]] (Belgrade) held up Ottoman expansion into Catholic Europe for 70 years, though for one year (1480–1481) the Italian port of [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto|Otranto was taken]], and in 1493 the Ottoman army successfully raided [[Croatia in union with Hungary|Croatia]] and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/FRAMES/ottoframe.html |title=The End of Europe's Middle Ages - Ottoman Turks |access-date=2017-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903101308/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/FRAMES/ottoframe.html |archive-date=2013-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wars in Albania===
{{Main|History of the Albanian–Turkish wars}}
[[File:Assault on Turkish encampment.jpg|thumb|Albanian assault on a Turkish encampment in 1457]]
{{unreferenced-section|date=November 2016}}
The Ottomans took much of Albania in the 1385 [[Battle of Savra]]. The 1444 [[League of Lezhë]] briefly restored one part of Albania, until Ottomans captured complete territory of Albania after [[Siege of Shkodra|capture of Shkodër]] in 1479 and Durrës in 1501.

The Ottomans faced the fiercest resistance from Albanians who gathered around their leader, [[Skanderbeg|George Castriot]], son of a feudal nobleman, and managed to fend off Ottoman attacks for more than 25 years, culminating at the [[siege of Shkodra]] in 1478–79. It has been argued that Albanian resilience halted the Ottoman advance along the Eastern flank of the Western Civilization, saving the Italian peninsula from Ottoman conquest. Sultan [[Mehmet II]] died in 1481, merely two years after the collapse of the Albanian resistance and one year after he launched an [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto|Italian campaign]].

===Conquest of Bosnia===
{{main|Ottoman conquest of Bosnia}}
{{unreferenced-section|date=November 2016}}
The Ottoman Empire first reached Bosnia in 1388 where they were defeated by Bosnian forces in the [[Battle of Bileća]] and then was forced to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, Caroline, ''Osman's Dream'', (Basic Books, 2004), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of Serbia in 1389 [[Battle of Kosovo]], where the Bosnians participated through [[Vlatko Vuković]], the Turks began various offensives against the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]]. The Bosnians defended themselves but without much success. The Bosnians resisted strongly in the Bosnian Royal castle of [[Jajce]] (the [[siege of Jajce]]), where the last Bosnian king [[Stjepan Tomašević]] tried to repel the Turks. The Ottoman army conquered Jajce after a few months in 1463 and executed the last King of Bosnia, ending [[Medieval Bosnia]].

The [[House of Kosača]] held [[Herzegovina]] until 1482.

===Croatia===
{{Main|Croatian–Ottoman wars}}
[[File:Clissa.jpg|right|thumb|[[Croats|Croatian]] captain [[Petar Kružić]] led the defense of the [[Klis Fortress]] against a Turkish invasion and siege that lasted for more than two and a half decades. During this defense, an elite Croatian military faction of [[Uskoci]] was formed.]]
{{unreferenced-section|date=November 2016}}
After the fall of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] into Ottoman hands in 1463, the southern and central parts of the [[Croatia in union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]] remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. The Ottomans meanwhile reached the river [[Neretva]] and, having conquered [[Herzegovina]] ([[Rama, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Rama]]) in 1482, they encroached upon Croatia, skillfully avoiding the fortified border towns. A decisive Ottoman victory at the [[Battle of Krbava Field]] shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the superior Ottoman forces. After almost two hundred years of Croatian resistance against the Ottoman Empire, victory in the [[Battle of Sisak]] marked the end of Ottoman rule and the [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War]]. The Viceroy's army, chasing the fleeing remnants at [[Petrinja]] in 1595, sealed the victory.

===Conquest of central parts of Hungarian Kingdom===
{{Main|Ottoman–Hungarian wars}}
{{unreferenced-section|date=November 2016}}
[[File:1526-Suleiman the Magnificent and the Battle of Mohacs-Hunername-large.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, Ottoman miniature]]
The [[Kingdom of Hungary]], which at the time spanned the area from Croatia in the west to [[Transylvania]] in the east, was also gravely threatened by Ottoman advances. The origins of such a deterioration can be traced back to the fall of the [[Árpád dynasty|Árpád]] ruling dynasty and their subsequent replacement with the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] and [[Jagiellonian]] kings. After a series of inconclusive wars over the course of 176 years, the kingdom finally crumbled in the [[Battle of Mohács]] of 1526, after which most of it was either conquered or brought under Ottoman suzerainty. (The ''150-year Turkish Occupation'', as it is called in Hungary, lasted until the late 17th century but parts of the Hungarian Kingdom were under Ottoman rule from 1421 and until 1718.)

===Conquest of Serbia===
{{Main|List of Serbian–Ottoman conflicts}}
{{unreferenced-section|date=November 2016}}
As a result of heavy losses inflicted by the Ottomans in the [[Battle of Maritsa]] in 1371, the [[Serbian Empire]] had dissolved into several principalities. In the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, Serbian forces were again annihilated. Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, constant struggles took place between various Serbian kingdoms and the Ottoman Empire. The turning point was the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the Turks. In 1459, following the siege, the temporary Serbian capital of [[Smederevo]] fell. [[Zeta under the Crnojevići|Zeta]] was overrun by 1499. [[Belgrade]] was the last major Balkan city to endure Ottoman forces. Serbs, [[Hungarians]], and European [[Crusades|crusaders]] defeated the Turkish army in the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]] in 1456. After repelling Ottoman attacks for over 70 years, Belgrade finally fell in 1521, along with the greater part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The [[Jovan Nenad|Vojvodina rebellion]] between 1526 and 1528 led to the proclamation of the Second Serbian Empire in [[Vojvodina]], which was among the last Serbian territories to resist the Ottomans. The [[Serbian Despotate]] fell in 1459, thus marking the two-century-long Ottoman conquest of Serbian principalities.

=== 1463–1503: Wars with Venice ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
[[File:360Niklas Stör Entführung in die Sklaverei.jpg|thumb|200px|Ottoman advances resulted in some of the captive Christians being carried deep into Turkish territory]]

The wars with the [[Republic of Venice]] began in 1463. A favorable peace treaty was signed in 1479 after the lengthy [[siege of Shkodra]] (1478–79). In 1480, now no longer hampered by the Venetian fleet, the Ottomans [[Siege of Rhodes (1480)|besieged Rhodes]] and [[Battle of Otranto|captured Otranto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/christian/blchron_xian_crusades12.htm Ottoman Empire on the Offensive, 1300 - 1600]&lt;/ref&gt; War with Venice [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1499–1503)|resumed from 1499 to 1503]]. In 1500, a Spanish–Venetian army commanded by [[Gonzalo de Córdoba]] [[Siege of Kefalonia|took Kefalonia]], temporarily stopping the Ottoman offensive on eastern Venetian territories. The offensive resumed after the Ottoman victory of Preveza, fought between an Ottoman fleet and that of a Christian alliance assembled by Pope Paul III in 1538.

=== 1462–1483: Wallachian and Moldavian campaigns ===
{{unreferenced-section|date=November 2016}}
In 1462, Mehmed II was driven back by [[Wallachia]]n prince [[Vlad III Dracula]] in the [[Night Attack at Târgovişte]]. However, the latter was imprisoned by Hungarian king [[Matthias Corvinus]]. This caused outrage among many influential Hungarian figures and Western admirers of Vlad's success in the battle against the Ottoman Empire (and his early recognition of the threat it posed), including high-ranking members of the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]]. Because of this, Matthias granted him the status of distinguished prisoner. Eventually, Dracula was freed in late 1475 and was sent with an army of Hungarian and Serbian soldiers to recover [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Bosnia]] from the Ottomans. There he defeated Ottoman forces for the first time. Upon this victory, Ottoman forces entered Wallachia in 1476 under the command of Mehmed II.{{Clarify|date=March 2008}} Vlad was killed and, according to some sources, his head was sent to [[Constantinople]] to discourage the other rebellions. (Bosnia was completely added to Ottoman lands in 1482.)

The Turkish advance was temporarily halted after [[Stephen the Great]] of [[Moldavia]] defeated the armies of the Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed II]] at the [[Battle of Vaslui]] in 1475, one of the greatest defeats of the Ottoman Empire until that time. Stephen was defeated the next year at [[Războieni, Neamț|Războieni]] ([[Battle of Valea Albă]]), but the Ottomans had to retreat after they failed to take any significant castle (see [[Siege of Neamț Citadel]]) as a plague started to spread in the Ottoman army. Stephen's search for European assistance against the Turks met with little success, even though he had "cut off the pagan's right-hand", as he put it in a letter.

=== 1526–1566: Conquest of the Kingdom of Hungary ===
{{See also|List of campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent}}
[[File:Portyázó törökök.jpg|thumb|200px|Ottoman soldiers in the territory of present-day Hungary]]
[[File:Szigetvar 1566.jpg|thumb|200px|The Ottoman campaign in Hungary in 1566, Crimean Tatars as vanguard]]

After the Ottoman victory in the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, only the southwestern part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was actually conquered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/16cen/mohacs1526.html The Battle of Mohacs, 1526]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman campaign continued between 1526 and 1556 with small campaigns and major summer invasions – troops would return south of the [[Balkan Mountains]] before winter. In 1529, they mounted their first major attack on the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Habsburg Monarchy|Monarchy]], attempting to conquer the city of [[Vienna]] ([[Siege of Vienna]]). In 1532, another attack on Vienna with 60,000 troops in the main army was held up by the small fort (800 defenders) of ''Kőszeg'' in western Hungary, fighting a suicidal battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gotohungary.com/itineraries/ Castles and History in Northern Transdanubia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016152604/http://www.gotohungary.com/itineraries/ |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invading troops were held up until winter was close and the Habsburg Empire had assembled a force of 80,000 at Vienna. The Ottoman troops returned home through Styria, laying waste to the country.

In the meantime, in 1538, the Ottoman Empire invaded [[Moldavia]]. In 1541, another campaign in Hungary took [[Buda]] and [[Pest (city)|Pest]] (which today together form the Hungarian capital [[Budapest]]) with a largely bloodless trick: after concluding peace talks with an agreement, troops stormed the open gates of Buda in the night. In retaliation for a failed Austrian counter-attack in 1542, the conquest of the western half of central Hungary was finished in the 1543 campaign that took both the most important royal ex-capital, [[Székesfehérvár]], and the ex-seat of the cardinal, [[Esztergom]]. However, the army of 35–40,000 men was not enough for [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] to mount another attack on Vienna. A temporary truce was signed between the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires in 1547, which was soon disregarded by the Habsburgs.

In the major but moderately successful campaign of 1552, two armies took the eastern part of central Hungary, pushing the borders of the Ottoman Empire to the second (inner) line of northern ''végvár''s (border castles), which Hungary originally built as defence against an expected second [[Mongol invasion]]—hence, afterwards, borders on this front changed little. For Hungarians, the 1552 campaign was a series of tragic losses and some heroic (but [[pyrrhic victory|pyrrhic]]) victories, which entered folklore—most notably the fall of ''Drégely'' (a small fort defended to the last man by just 146 men&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1hungary.com/info/dregelypalank/ Hungary - Drégelypalánk]&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[Siege of Eger (1552)|Siege of Eger]]. The latter was a major ''végvár'' with more than 2,000 men, without outside help. They faced two Ottoman armies, which were surprisingly unable to take the castle within five weeks. (The fort was later taken in 1596.) Finally, the 1556 campaign secured Ottoman influence over Transylvania (which had fallen under Habsburg control for a time), while failing to gain any ground on the western front, being tied down in the second (after 1555) unsuccessful siege of the southwestern Hungarian border castle of [[Szigetvár]].

The Ottoman Empire conducted another major war against the Habsburgs and their Hungarian territories between 1566 and 1568. The 1566 [[Siege of Szigetvár]], the third siege in which the fort was finally taken, but the aged Sultan died, deterring that year's push for Vienna.

=== 1522–1573: Rhodes, Malta and the Holy League ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
[[File:Siege of malta 1.jpg|thumb|left|''The siege of Malta – Arrival of the Turkish Fleet'' by [[Matteo Perez d'Aleccio]]]]

Ottoman forces invaded and captured the island of [[Rhodes]] in 1522, after two previous failed attempts (see [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|Siege of Rhodes]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsmitha.com/time16.htm Timeline: 1501 to 1600] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526053630/http://www.fsmitha.com/time16.htm |date=2008-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Knights of Rhodes]] were banished to [[Malta]], which was in turn besieged in 1565.

After a siege of three months, the Ottoman army failed to control all of the Maltese forts. Delaying the Ottomans until bad weather conditions and the arrival of Sicilian reinforcements, made Ottoman commander Kızılahmedli Mustafa Pasha quit the siege. Around 22,000 to 48,000 Ottoman troops against 6,000 to 8,500 Maltese troops, the Ottomans failed to conquer Malta, sustaining about 10,000 losses, including one of the greatest Muslim corsair generals of the time, [[Dragut]], and were repulsed. Had Malta fallen, Sicily and mainland Italy could have fallen under the threat of an Ottoman invasion. The victory of Malta during this event, which is nowadays known as the [[Great Siege of Malta]], turned the tide and gave Europe hopes and motivation. It also marked the importance of the [[Knights of Saint John]] and their relevant presence in Malta to aid Christendom in its defence against the Muslim conquest.

The Ottoman naval victories of this period were in the [[Battle of Preveza]] (1538) and the [[Battle of Djerba]] (1560).
[[File:Lepanto f1.jpg|thumb|190px|Battle of Lepanto on 7 October 1571]]
The [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573)|Mediterranean campaign]], which lasted from 1570 to 1573, resulted in the Ottoman conquest of [[Cyprus]]. A [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]] of Venice, the [[Papal States]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], the Knights of Saint John in Malta and initially [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] was formed against the Ottoman Empire during this period. The League's victory in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]] briefly ended Ottoman predominance at sea.

{{Main|Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573)}}
{{unreferenced-section|date=November 2016}}
In the summer of 1570, the Turks struck again, but this time with a full-scale invasion rather than a raid. About 60,000 troops, including cavalry and artillery, under the command of Lala Mustafa Pasha landed unopposed near [[Limassol]] on July 2, 1570, and laid siege to [[Nicosia]]. In an orgy of victory on the day that the city fell—September 9, every public building and palace was looted. Word of the superior Ottoman numbers spread, and a few days later Mustafa took Kyrenia without having to fire a shot. Famagusta, however, resisted and put up a defense that lasted from September 1570 until August 1571.

The fall of Famagusta marked the beginning of the Ottoman period in Cyprus. Two months later, the naval forces of the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]], composed mainly of Venetian, Spanish, and Papal ships under the command of [[Don John of Austria]], defeated the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in one of the decisive battles of world history. The victory over the Turks, however, came too late to help Cyprus, and the island remained under Ottoman rule for the next three centuries.

In 1570, the [[Ottoman Empire]] first conquered [[Cyprus]], and [[Lala Mustafa Pasha]] became the first Ottoman governor of Cyprus, challenging the claims of Venice. Simultaneously, the [[Pope]] formed a coalition between the [[Papal States]], [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|Malta]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and several other Italian states, with no real result. In 1573 the Venetians left, removing the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

=== 1657–1683 Conclusion of wars with Habsburgs ===

Transylvania, the Eastern part of the former Hungarian Kingdom, gained semi-independence in 1526, while paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire. In 1657, Transylvania felt strong enough to attack the [[Tatars]] to the East (then the Empire's vassals), and later the Ottoman Empire itself, which had come to the Tatars' defence. The war lasted until 1662, ending in defeat for the Hungarians. The Western part of the Hungarian Kingdom (''Partium'') was annexed and placed under direct Ottoman control. At the same time, there was another campaign against Austria between 1663 and 1664. Despite being defeated in the [[Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)|Battle of Saint Gotthard]] on 1 August 1664 by [[Raimondo Montecuccoli]], the Ottomans secured recognition of their conquest of [[Nové Zámky]] in the [[Peace of Vasvár]] with Austria, marking the greatest territorial extent of Ottoman rule in the former Hungarian Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allcrusades.com/CHRONOLOGICAL/chrono-1300.html The years 1300 and later] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021084318/http://allcrusades.com/CHRONOLOGICAL/chrono-1300.html |date=2007-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Great Turkish War}}
[[File:Casteels Battle of Vienna.png|thumb|Battle of Vienna on 12 September 1683]]

The [[Great Turkish War]] started in 1683, with a grand [[invasion]] force of 140,000 men&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rateitall.com/i-839965-1683-seige-of-vienna.aspx 1683 Siege of Vienna] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022225952/http://www.rateitall.com/i-839965-1683-seige-of-vienna.aspx |date=October 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; marching on Vienna, supported by [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Hungarian noblemen rebelling against Habsburg rule. To stop the invasion, another [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] was formed, composed of Austria and Poland (notably in the [[Battle of Vienna]]), Venetians and the [[Russian Empire]]. After winning the Battle of Vienna, the Holy League gained the upper hand and reconquered Hungary (Buda and Pest were retaken in 1686, the former under the command of a Swiss-born convert to Islam). At the same time, the Venetians launched an [[Morean War|expedition into Greece]], which conquered the [[Peloponnese]]. During the 1687 Venetian attack on the city of [[Athens]] (conquered by the Ottomans), the Ottomans turned the ancient [[Parthenon]] into an ammunitions storehouse. A Venetian mortar hit the Parthenon, detonating the Ottoman gunpowder stored inside and partially destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;The Decline and Fall of the Ottoman Empire - Alan Palmer&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete citation|date=November 2016}}

The war ended with the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699. [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] first distinguished himself in 1683 and remained the most important Austrian commander until 1718.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/17cen/habsbott16831699.html Habsburg-Ottoman War, 1683–1699]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h21-ot.html Decline of Islamaic and Ottoman Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second [[Russo-Turkish War (1710–1711)|Russo-Turkish War]] took place 1710–1711 near [[Prut]]. It was instigated by [[Charles XII of Sweden]] after the defeat at the [[Battle of Poltava]], in order to tie down Russia with the Ottoman Empire and gain some breathing space in the increasingly unsuccessful [[Great Northern War]]. The Russians were severely beaten but not annihilated, and after the [[Treaty of Prut]] was signed the Ottoman Empire disengaged, allowing Russia to refocus its energies on the defeat of Sweden.

The [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–1718)|Ottoman–Venetian War]] started in 1714. It overlapped with the [[Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718)]], in which Austria conquered the remaining areas of the former Hungarian Kingdom, ending with the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718.

[[Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739)|Another war with Russia]] started in 1735. The Austrians joined in 1737; the war ended in 1739 with the [[Treaty of Belgrade]] (with Austria) and the [[Treaty of Niš (1739)|Treaty of Niš]] (with Russia).

The fourth Russo-Turkish War started in 1768 and ended in 1774 with the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarcai]].

[[Russo-Turkish_War_(1787–1792)|Another war with Russia]] started in 1787 and [[Austro-Turkish War (1788–91)|a concurrent war with Austria]] followed in 1788; the Austrian war ended with the 1791 [[Treaty of Sistova]], and the Russian war ended with the 1792 [[Treaty of Jassy]].

An [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt and Syria]] by [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] of [[French First Republic|France]] took place in 1798–99, but ended due to British intervention.

Napoleon's capture of Malta on his way to Egypt resulted in the unusual alliance of Russia and the Ottomans resulting in a joint naval expedition to the [[Ionian Islands]]. Their successful capture of these islands led to the setting up of the [[Septinsular Republic]].

Romania then declared its independence and waged war on Turkey, joined by Serbians and Bulgarians and finally the Russians (see also [[History of Russia (1855–92)]]). Austria occupied Bosnia in 1878. The Russians and the Ottomans signed the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] in early 1878. After deliberations at the [[Congress of Berlin]], which was attended by all the Great Powers of the time, the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] recognized several territorial changes.

[[Eastern Rumelia]] was granted some autonomy in 1878, rebelled and joined Bulgaria in 1885. [[Thessaly]] ceded to [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] in 1881, but after [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greece attacked the Ottoman Empire]] to help the Second Cretan Uprising in 1897, Greece was defeated in Thessaly.

Two [[Balkan Wars]], in 1912 and 1913, involved further action against the Ottoman Empire in Europe. The [[Balkan League]] first conquered Macedonia and most of [[Thrace]] from the Ottoman Empire, and then fell out over the division of the spoils.

The '''Paris–Bordeaux–Paris Trail''' of June 1895 is sometimes called the "first motor race" although it did not conform to modern convention whereby the fastest finisher is the winner. It was a triumph for [[Émile Levassor]] who arrived first after completing the 1,178&amp;nbsp;km race in 48 hours, nearly six hours ahead of the runner-up. However, the official winner was [[Koechlin family#Paul Koechlin|Paul Koechlin]], who arrived third in his Peugeot, exactly 11 hours slower than Levassor, but officially the race had been for four-seater cars, whereas Levassor and the runner-up drove two-seater cars.&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;

==First race==
Paris–Bordeaux–Paris is sometimes called the first [[automobile]] race in history or the "first motor race". The 1894 [[Paris–Rouen (motor race)|Paris–Rouen]] had been run over public roads as a contest (''concours'') not a race, and the fastest finisher, a steam powered vehicle, was judged ineligible for the main prize. [[Émile Levassor]] finished first in the 1,178&amp;nbsp;km Paris–Bordeaux–Paris race, taking 48 hours and 48 minutes, nearly six hours before the runner-up [[Louis Rigoulot]], and eleven hours before the official winner, [[Koechlin family#Paul Koechlin|Paul Koechlin]] in his Peugeot. Officially, the race was for four-seater cars, and Levassor and Rigoulot drove two-seater cars. The ensuing outcry caused the ''A.C.F.'' to organise their next event, the [[1896 Paris–Marseille–Paris]], so that the fastest finisher was the winner.&lt;ref name="Harding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Figaro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Team Dan 1895"/&gt;

==Name==
The race is sometimes referred to as the ''I Grand Prix de l'A.C.F''. This results from a retrospective political move that began in the early 1920s when French media represented many races held in France before the 1906 French Grand Prix as being Grands Prix de l'Automobile Club de France, despite their running pre-dating the formation of the Club. Hence, the 1906 race was said to have been the 9th edition of the Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France. The ACF itself adopted this reasoning in 1933, although some members of the Club dismissed it, "concerned the name of the Club was lent to the fiction simply out of a childish desire to establish their Grand Prix as the oldest race in the world."&lt;ref name="Hodges pp. 2-3"&gt;Hodges (1967), pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TD"&gt;[http://www.teamdan.com/archive/gen/upto1903/1895.html 1895 Grand Prix and Paris Races].  Retrieved on 12 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levassor's progress==
Levassor, who drove one of his cars, a 1205 cc (74 ci) [[Panhard|Panhard &amp; Levassor]], started carefully, observing his opponents; he overtook the then leading [[Marquis]] [[Albert de Dion|de Dion]] who stopped to take on water for his [[steam car]]. Levassor led the race since then, stopping regularly to check his car's components. He came to [[Bordeaux]] several hours before any driver was expected to come which resulted in the fact that he had to drive back to Paris as well (the driver who was his change was still asleep in a hotel, and no-one knew which one). Levassor accepted the situation calmly, waking the organisers up to prove his coming and his time, had some sandwiches and champagne, took a brief walk and set off for Paris at 2:30&amp;nbsp;am. When [[Baron]] [[René de Knyff]] met him en route, he was so surprised by Levassor's time that he nearly crashed. Levassor, after spending two days and nights behind the wheel, came triumphantly to Paris, reaching an average speed of 24.5&amp;nbsp;km/h. He said after the race: "Some 50 km before Paris I had a rather luxurious snack in a restaurant which helped me. But I feel a little tired."{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Legacy==
The race proved that both the riders and the cars were capable of driving such distances and it generated public enthusiasm which indicated that such events were commercially viable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

"'''Rain'''" is a song by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Beatles]] that was first released in May 1966 as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of their "[[Paperback Writer]]" single. Both songs were recorded during the sessions for the album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' although neither appears on that album. The song was written by [[John Lennon]] and credited to [[Lennon–McCartney]]. It is noted for its slowed-down rhythm track, an example of the tape-manipulation techniques the band embraced at this time, and backwards vocals over the song's coda. The single's release marked the first time that reversed sounds had appeared in a pop song, although the Beatles used the same technique on the ''Revolver'' track "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]", released in August 1966.{{sfn|Reising|LeBlanc|2009|pp=94, 95}}

Three promotional films were made for the song "Rain".{{sfn|Neaverson|2009}} 

==Music and lyrics==
The inspiration for "Rain" is agreed on by [[Neil Aspinall]], the Beatles' [[Road crew|roadie]], and John Lennon. They both described the band's arrival in [[Sydney]], Australia, marked by rain and poor weather.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=140}} Lennon said, "I've never seen rain as hard as that, except in [[Tahiti]]", and later explained that "Rain" was "about people moaning about the weather all the time".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=212}}   Another interpretation is that the song's "rain" and "sun" are phenomena experienced during a benign LSD trip.{{sfn|Revolution in the Head - MacDonald 2005|p=196-7}}

"Rain" has a simple musical structure. Set in the key of G major (the final mix pitches it about a quarter of a semitone below this, while the backing track was taped in G sharp), it begins with what [[Alan W. Pollack]] calls, "a ra-ta-tat half-measure's fanfare of solo [[snare drum]]s", followed by a guitar intro of the first chord. The verses are nine measures long, and the song is in {{music|time|4|4}} time. Each verse is based on the G, C, and D chords [[Chord progression#Three-chord progressions|(I, IV, and V)]]. The refrain contains only I and IV chords, and is twelve measures long (the repetition of a six-measure pattern). The first two measures are the G chord. The third and fourth measures are the C chord. The third measure has the C chord in the so-called [[Second inversion|{{su|p=6|b=4}} (second) inversion]]. The fifth and sixth measures return to the G chord. Pollack says the [[refrain]] seems slower than the verse, though it is at the same tempo, an illusion achieved by "the change of beat for the first four measures from its erstwhile bounce to something more plodding and regular". After four verses and two refrains, a short solo for guitar and drums is played, with complete silence for one beat. Following this, the music returns accompanied by what Pollack terms "historically significant" reverse lyrics.{{sfn|Pollack|1993}} Musicologist [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] cites this closing section as an example of how the Beatles pioneered the "fade-out–fade-in [[Coda (music)|coda]]", a device used again by them on "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]" and "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]", and by Led Zeppelin on "[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]".{{sfn|Everett|2009|p=154}}

[[Allan Kozinn]] describes McCartney's [[Bass guitar|bass]] as "an ingenious counterpoint that takes him all over the fretboard ...  while Lennon and McCartney harmonize in [[Perfect fourth|fourths]] on a melody with a slightly [[Middle East|Middle Eastern]] tinge, McCartney first points up the song's droning character by hammering on a high G (approached with a quick slide from the F natural just below it), playing it steadily on the beat for twenty successive beats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Allan Kozinn]] |title=The Beatles |year=1995 |location=London |publisher=Phaidon |pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
Recording began on 14 April 1966, in the same session as "Paperback Writer", and concluded on 16 April, with a series of [[Overdubbing|overdubs]] before mixing on the same day.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=74}}{{sfn|Fontenot|2008}} At that time, the Beatles were enthusiastic about experimenting in the studio to achieve new sounds and effects.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=70}} These experiments were showcased in their seventh album, [[Revolver (Beatles album)|''Revolver'']]. [[Geoff Emerick]], who was the engineer for both sessions, described one technique he used to alter the sonic texture of the track by recording the backing track "faster than normal". When played back, slightly slower than the usual speed, "the music had a radically different tonal quality."{{sfn|Emerick|2006|p=117}} The opposite technique was used to alter the tone of Lennon's lead vocal: it was recorded with the tape machine slowed down, making Lennon's voice sound higher when played back.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=83}}

The last verse of "Rain" includes backwards vocals, the first use of this technique on a record.{{sfn|Playboy Magazine|April, 1981|p=194}} (the hit [[novelty song]] "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]
", where side B is side A played backwards, was released later that year of 1966). The backwards vocals are Lennon singing the lyrics of the song: "When the sun shines", "Rain", and "If the rain comes, they run and hide their heads."{{sfn|YouTube: Rain Finale backwards|1995}} Both Lennon and producer [[George Martin]] claimed credit for the idea. Lennon said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After we'd done the session on that particular song – it ended at about four or five in the morning – I went home with a tape to see what else you could do with it. And I was sort of very stoned and tired, you know, not knowing what I was doing, and I just happened to put it on my own tape recorder and it came out backwards. And I liked it better. So that's how it happened.{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|2007}}{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 37, track 4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Emerick confirmed Lennon's creative accident, but Martin remembered it differently:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I was always playing around with tapes and I thought it might be fun to do something extra with John's voice. So I lifted a bit of his main vocal off the four-track, put it on another spool, turned it around and then slid it back and forth until it fitted. John was out at the time but when he came back he was amazed.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=74}}{{sfn|Emerick|2006|p=117}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later, in 1980, Lennon claimed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I got home from the studio and I was stoned out of my mind on [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and, as I usually do, I listened to what I'd recorded that day. Somehow I got it on backwards and I sat there, transfixed, with the earphones on, with a big hash joint. I ran in the next day and said, 'I know what to do with it, I know ... Listen to this!' So I made them all play it backwards. The fade is me actually singing backwards with the guitars going backwards. [Singing backwards] Sharethsmnowthsmeaness ... [Laughter] That one was the gift of God, of [[Jah]], actually, the god of marijuana, right? So Jah gave me that one.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/rain/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Regardless of who is credited for the technique, "from that point on," Emerick wrote, "almost every overdub we did on ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' had to be tried backwards as well as forwards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=88 – 'Rain'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/rain-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Paperback Writer" / "Rain" single was the first release to use a new device invented by the maintenance department at [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] called "ATOC" for "Automatic Transient Overload Control". The new device allowed the record to be cut at a louder volume, louder than any other single up to that time.{{sfn|Emerick|2006|p=117}} On the final mix of the single, Lennon played a 1965 [[Gretsch|Gretsch Nashville]], [[Paul McCartney]] a 1964 [[Rickenbacker 4001S]] bass, Harrison a 1964 [[Gibson SG]], and [[Ringo Starr]] used [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig]] drums.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=196}}{{sfn|Fontenot|2008}}

==Release and reception==
First released as a B-side to "Paperback Writer" in the United States (Capitol 5651) on 30 May 1966 and in the UK on 10 June, the single was later released part of a [[Record Store Day]] reissue in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/Beatles-Paperback-Writer-Rain/release/2335266 Beatles, The – Paperback Writer / Rain (Vinyl) at Discogs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It later appeared on the [[compilation album|compilations]] ''[[Hey Jude (album)|Hey Jude]]'' in the US and ''[[Rarities (1978 The Beatles album)|Rarities]]'' in the UK. It also appeared on the ''[[Past Masters]]'' CD.{{sfn|Fontenot|2008}}

In the United States, the song peaked at number 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on 9 July 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hot 100: July 9th 1966|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1966-07-09|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|billboard.com]]|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in that position the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castleman|first1=Harry|last2=Podrazik|first2=Walter J.|title=All Together Now: The First Complete Beatles Discography 1961–1975|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|year=1976|isbn=0-345-25680-8|p=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Paperback Writer" single reached number 1 in the UK (for two weeks starting on 23 June).{{sfn|Fontenot|2008}} ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranks "Rain" 463rd in its list of "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]".{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2004b}} On a similar list compiled by the New York radio station [[Q104.3]], the song appeared at number 382.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.q1043.com/common/top_songs/2012.html?page=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214135622/http://www.q1043.com/common/top_songs/2012.html?page=2 |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Rain" is notable for [[Ringo Starr]]'s drumming, which Starr rates as his best recorded performance.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=280}} Both [[Ian MacDonald]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described his drumming on the track as "superb",{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=198}}{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2004a}} while [[Richie Unterberger]] of [[AllMusic]] praised his "creative drum breaks".{{sfn|Unterberger|2007}} In 1984, Starr said: "I think it's the best out of all the records I've ever made. 'Rain' blows me away … I know me and I know my playing … and then there's 'Rain'."{{sfn|www.beatleswiki.com/wiki/index.php/Rain}} 

Music critic [[Jim DeRogatis]] describes it as "the Beatles' first great psychedelic rock song".{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=43}} It has been noted for its slowed-down rhythm track and backwards vocals, anticipating the studio experimentation of "Tomorrow Never Knows" and other songs on ''Revolver'', which was released two months later.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=74}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=196}}

==Promotional films==
The Beatles created three promotional films for "Rain"{{sfn|Neaverson|2009}} which are considered among the early precursors of music videos.{{sfn|BBC|2008}} These videos, along with other Beatles videos at the time, sparked [[George Harrison]] to say during the ''[[The Beatles Anthology (film)|Beatles Anthology]]'', "So I suppose, in a way, we invented [[MTV]]."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=214}}

The films were directed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] who worked with them earlier on the pop 1960 television programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''{{sfn|Miles|1998}} One features the Beatles walking and singing in a garden and a [[greenhouse]] (filmed 20 May 1966 at [[Chiswick House]] in London).{{sfn|Neaverson|2009}}{{sfn|Ritchie|2008}} The other two feature the band performing on a [[sound stage]] (filmed 19 May 1966, one in colour for Ed Sullivan and the other in black and white for the UK).{{sfn|Neaverson|2009}}{{sfn|Anthology DVD|2003|loc=Episode 3, "Rain"}} McCartney was injured in a [[moped]] accident on 26 December 1965, six months prior to the filming of "Rain" and closeups in the film reveal a scarred lip and a chipped tooth.{{sfn|Miles|1998}}{{sfn|Anthology DVD|2003|loc=Episode 3, "Rain"}} McCartney's appearance in the film played a role in the "[[Paul is dead]]" rumours from 1969.{{sfn|Fontenot|2008}}

''The Beatles' Anthology'' documentary video includes a re-edit of two of these three clips, full of rhythmic fast cuts and several shots that went unused in the original videos.{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=320}} This creates an impression that the videos were more technically complex, fast-paced, and innovative than was the case. For example, the backwards film effects shown here are 1990s creations. Such effects were actually first deployed in the "Strawberry Fields Forever" promotional film of January 1967.{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=322}}

==Covers, samples, and media references==
[[U2]] has played the song in whole or in part throughout many of their tours, usually during outdoor concerts when it has started to rain.{{sfn|U2gigs.com|2010}} [[Pearl Jam]] improvised the song into their song "[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]" during their 1992 [[Pinkpop Festival]] show and played it in full at the [[Isle of Wight Festival]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/pearl-jam/2012/seaclose-park-newport-england-53df1709.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kula Shaker]] covered the song live at [[Reading Festival]] in 1996 as did [[Fairport Convention]], featuring [[Dan Ar Braz]], at the [[The Cropredy Box|Cropredy Festival]] in 1997. [[Todd Rundgren]] has also covered the song,{{sfn|Fontenot|2008}} as has the late [[Dan Fogelberg]], who reprised it as part of his own cover of "[[Rhythm of the Rain]]". The Grateful Dead played it twenty times throughout the early 1990s.

The Beatles [[tribute act]] [[Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles|Rain]] derives its name from the song.&lt;ref name=isherwood&gt;Isherwood, Charles. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/theater/reviews/27rain.html?_r=0 "Another Long and Winding Detour,"] ''New York Times'' (OCT. 26, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shahid''''' is a 2013 Indian Hindi language [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] film directed by [[Hansal Mehta]]. Jointly produced by [[Anurag Kashyap]], [[UTV Motion Pictures#UTV Spotboy|UTV Spotboy]] and Sunil Bohra, it is based on the life of lawyer and human rights activist [[Shahid Azmi]] who was assassinated in 2010. The film stars [[Rajkummar Rao]] in the titular role; [[Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub]], [[Prabhleen Sandhu]] and [[Baljinder Kaur]] appear in supporting roles.

Mehta took a break after some of his films were box-office failures. When he heard about Azmi's murder, he felt the need to make a film about his life. He began his research for the film nearly three months after Azmi's murder. Mehta met writer Sameer Gautam Singh, who wrote the screenplay after researching Azmi's life and spending months interviewing Azmi's family. [[Apurva Asrani]] did additional work on the screenplay with Mehta. Asrani also served as the film's editor. Anuj Dhawan was the director of photography.

''Shahid'' had its world premiere at the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]]'s City to City programme in 2012. It was screened at several other film festivals including the 14th [[Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image#Film Festival|Mumbai Film Festival]], the [[New York Indian Film Festival]], the Indian Film Festival Stuttgart, the [[Dubai International Film Festival]] and the Chicago South Asian Film Festival. The film was awarded the Silver Gateway Trophy at the Mumbai film festival while Mehta won the Best Director award. Mehta also won the best director award at New York Indian Film Festival and at the Indian Film Festival of Stuttgart. The film was released theatrically in India on 18 October 2013 and met with critical acclaim. Rao received the [[National Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Award]] and Mehta the [[National Film Award for Best Director|Best Director Award]] at the [[61st National Film Awards]] ceremony.

==Plot==
Shahid Azmi and his family are terrorised during the [[Bombay riots]], when hundreds of Muslims died. Later he goes to [[Kashmir]] and spends a brief period at a militant training camp but soon returns after witnessing an execution. He moves back to Mumbai where he is arrested under the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]], for an alleged conspiracy to assassinate some politicians. His brother Arif Azmi tries to [[bail]] him out but fails. Shahid is tortured by police and forced to admit to the crime, after which he spends seven years at [[Tihar Jail]] in New Delhi. During his incarceration Omar Sheikh ([[Prabal Panjabi]]) tries to [[Mind control|brainwash]] him. Another inmate, Ghulam Navi Waar, inspires him to begin his college education, and once he is acquitted of the charges, he studies law in Mumbai.

After receiving his law degree, Shahid works with lawyer Maqbool Memon for a few months, before starting his career as an independent lawyer with the financial support of his elder brother Arif. During this process he meets Mariam, a Muslim divorcee, and marries her. Shahid soon starts picking up cases of Muslims charged under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002|Prevention of Terrorism Act]] (POTA). He fights many cases [[pro bono]] in consultation with [[non-governmental organization]]s. Shahid's first major success as a defence lawyer is winning an acquittal, due to lack of evidence, for Arif Paanwala who was arrested under POTA for the [[2002 Mumbai bus bombing]].

Shahid represents the accused in the [[2006 Mumbai train bombings]], the 2006 Aurangabad arms haul, and the [[2006 Malegaon bombings]] case. He is criticised for supporting terrorists and starts getting threatening calls that disturb his family life. On one occasion, Shahid's face is blackened by assailants outside the court room. While defending [[Faheem Ansari]] in the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] case, he is shot by two gunmen in his office and dies on the spot. Later, Ansari is shown to be acquitted of all charges by the Supreme Court of India due to lack of evidence.

Director [[Hansal Mehta]] said that he needed a break after some of his films proved to be a box-office failures, like ''[[Woodstock Villa]]'' (2007) and ''[[Raakh (2010 film)|Raakh]]'' (2010).&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/10/06/qa-hansal-mehta-on-his-new-film-shahid/|title=Q&amp;A: Hansal Mehta on His New Film ‘Shahid’|last=Pereira|first=Priyanka|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=6 October 2013|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614171404/https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/10/06/qa-hansal-mehta-on-his-new-film-shahid/|archivedate=14 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February 2010, lawyer [[Shahid Azmi]] was shot dead in his office in Mumbai at the age of 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=26/11 accused Fahim Ansari's lawyer Shahid Azmi shot dead|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-02-11/india/28127692_1_fahim-ansari-assailants-shahid-azmi|work=The Times of India|date=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had represented those accused of the 2006 Mumbai local train blasts, the 2006 Malegaon blasts case and while he was defending Faheem Ansari in the 26/11 attacks case that he was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The lawyer who courted death|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ryxborlNOcg3cP0Bh7GSDM/The-lawyer-who-courted-death.html?facet=print|work=Mint|date=13 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925174602/http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ryxborlNOcg3cP0Bh7GSDM/The-lawyer-who-courted-death.html?facet=print|archivedate=25 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested during the communal riots of 1992-1993 in Mumbai and later studied law and began defending people arrested on false charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/hansal-mehta-a-street-should-be-named-after-shahid/|title=Hansal Mehta: A street should be named after ‘Shahid’|work=The Indian Express|date=16 October 2013|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614172310/https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/hansal-mehta-a-street-should-be-named-after-shahid/|archivedate=14 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer secured 17 acquittals in his seven-year career.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Film remembers Indian lawyer Shahid Azmi as symbol of hope|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19595663|accessdate=15 May 2013|publisher=BBC|date=28 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126083611/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19595663|archivedate=26 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehta said that when he heard about Azmi's murder, he had a sense that the tale of his life could pull his "creativity out of the rut".&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; He felt that Azmi lived an "ordinary life, with extraordinary conviction to do what he believed was right" and that his story "had to be told".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Mehta began his research nearly three months after Azmi's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/i-owe-everything-to-my-lack-of-success-hansal-mehta-113101500531_1.html|title=I owe everything to my lack of success: Hansal Mehta|work=Business Standard|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614171454/https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/i-owe-everything-to-my-lack-of-success-hansal-mehta-113101500531_1.html|archivedate=14 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later met writer Sameer Gautam Singh, who approached Mehta with a script. Mehta said he could not make a film with the script and asked him if he was would co-write another script with him. Singh agreed, and Mehta sent him along with his son Jai Mehta to Azmi's hometown to meet his family. To gather facts they interviewed his family members and friends for two months.&lt;ref name=mint&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ryxborlNOcg3cP0Bh7GSDM/The-lawyer-who-courted-death.html|title=The lawyer who courted death|last=Janardhan|first=Arun|work=Mint|date=13 September 2012|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614144254/https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ryxborlNOcg3cP0Bh7GSDM/The-lawyer-who-courted-death.html|archivedate=14 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehta chose not to go with them as he feared that seeing a filmmaker family and friends would "alter the version of Shahid's life they narrated".&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

Both Mehta and Singh read several of Azmi's cases for the story.&lt;ref name=gandhi&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/interview-hansal-mehta-shahid-214032-2013-10-11|title=For me, Shahid is Gandhi: Hansal Mehta|last=Singh|first=Suhani|work=India Today|date=11 October 2013|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614144232/https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/interview-hansal-mehta-shahid-214032-2013-10-11|archivedate=14 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehta noticed that they were written in simple English that could be understood by anyone: "It told me he was a no-nonsense guy. He wanted to fight the battle and not beat around the bush." Mehta and Singh also met his colleagues, attended court sessions, petitions, litigations and learned how to get a client acquitted.&lt;ref name=gandhi/&gt; Mehta went to seek permission to make the film; family members expressed their skepticism about the project. Later, they agreed and talked to him about Azmi.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; The film focused on Azmi's beginnings and two cases he handled: the [[2006 Mumbai train bombings]] and the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]. Mehta combined several of Azmi's petitions into a single case for "clarity and dramatic impact".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Mehta said the Azmi's family was supportive of the film.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

===Casting and filming===

Mehta was looking for "big stars" for the film, but most were not interested because of his earlier failures. At the time, the film's co-producer [[Anurag Kashyap]] suggested he cast [[Rajkummar Rao]] thinking he was perfect for the role of Azmi. Later, casting director [[Mukesh Chhabra]] sent Rao to Mehta's office. Mehta cast him after a screen test. Mehta felt Rao "surrendered himself completely" to the film.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; In preparing for the role, Rao met Azmi's family and spent time with them to understand the man and his personality. He also studied the [[Quran]] and attended courtrooms to understand how lawyers behave.&lt;ref name=superstar/&gt;&lt;ref name=tie/&gt; Rao said he was "emotionally drained" as the character was challenging and complex. In the scenes where he had to cry, Rao said he could not stop himself, thinking about what Azmi had to go through.&lt;ref name=tie/&gt; [[Tigmanshu Dhulia]], [[Prabhleen Sandhu]], [[Kay Kay Menon]] and [[Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub]] played supporting roles in the film.&lt;ref name=tie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/raanjhanaa-actor-zeeshan-ayyub-looking-forward-to-the-release-of-shahid/1141642/|title=Raanjhanaa actor Zeeshan Ayyub looking forward to the release of Shahid|work=The Indian Express|date=14 July 2013|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714085155/http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/raanjhanaa-actor-zeeshan-ayyub-looking-forward-to-the-release-of-shahid/1141642/|archivedate=14 July 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene where Azmi's face is blackened by assailants outside a courtroom was a re-enactment of an incident from Mehta's own life. In 2000,  members of [[Shiv Sena]] who were protesting his film ''[[Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar!!]]'' attacked him and vandalised his office.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

''Shahid'' was made on a production budget of {{INRConvert|86|l}} and filmed in complete secrecy.&lt;ref name=superstar&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/superstars-do-not-guarantee-success-raj-kumar/|title=Superstars do not guarantee success: Raj Kumar|work=The Indian Express|date=26 October 2013|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614172345/https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/superstars-do-not-guarantee-success-raj-kumar/|archivedate=14 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; It was shot in several [[Mumbai]] neighbourhoods Azmi had frequented including [[Kurla]], [[Govandi]] and [[Pydhonie]].&lt;ref name=gandhi/&gt; Mehta chose to shoot in the apartment above Azmi’s ground floor residence in the Taximen's Colony as he wanted to "capture the sense of claustrophobia and unkemptness of his home".&lt;ref name=real&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/others/sunday-read/Keeping-it-real/articleshow/24405378.cms|title=Keeping it real|last=Holla|first=Anand|work=Mumbai Mirror|date=20 October 2013|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614145617/https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/others/sunday-read/Keeping-it-real/articleshow/24405378.cms|archivedate=14 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some portions of the film were shot in Azmi's office and his colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/shahid-makes-shahid-azmis-brother-emotional-635836|title=Shahid makes Shahid Azmi's brother emotional|publisher=NDTV|date=19 October 2013|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614171536/http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/shahid-makes-shahid-azmis-brother-emotional-635836|archivedate=14 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shahid'' was also shot in [[Nagpada]], where Faheem Ansari's wife Yasmin lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 'unlikely' lawyer as an unlikely hero |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-unlikely-lawyer-as-an-unlikely-hero/985769/0 |work=The Indian Express |date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010071725/http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-unlikely-lawyer-as-an-unlikely-hero/985769/0 |archivedate=10 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes in the terrorist training camp were shot in [[Himachal Pradesh]].&lt;ref name=tie/&gt;

Mehta decided to depict realistic court scenes based on his team's observation of real courts.&lt;ref name=gandhi/&gt; They visited the Andheri Court and the Esplanade Court among others, taking photographs to recreate the ambiance for the courtroom scenes.&lt;ref name=tie&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/screen-exclusive-in-conversation-with-shahid-director-and-on-screen-shahid-azmi/|title=Screen Exclusive: In conversation with ‘Shahid’ director and on screen Shahid Azmi|work=The Indian Express|date=18 October 2013|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614171843/https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/screen-exclusive-in-conversation-with-shahid-director-and-on-screen-shahid-azmi/|archivedate=14 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courtroom sets were built because filming in an actual court is not permitted.&lt;ref name=tie/&gt;

The film's unit consisted of about 17 people because of budget and time constraints; it was made on a budget of {{INRConvert|65|l}}.&lt;ref name=gandhi/&gt;&lt;ref name=eerie/&gt; The film was shot linearly on a non-linear draft. Mehta said it was filmed guerilla style using all "available digital formats without really worrying about which lens was available".&lt;ref name=tie/&gt; The filmmaker used only natural or minimal lighting.&lt;ref name=real/&gt; For an interrogation scene, Rao suggested Mehta show him naked as he wanted to "feel the embarrassment, the mental pain of the character."&lt;ref name=nude&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Nude-scene-in-Shahid-was-my-idea-Rajkumar-Yadav/articleshow/24200732.cms|title=Nude scene in 'Shahid' was my idea: Rajkumar Yadav|work=The Times of India|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=14 June 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625160550/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Nude-scene-in-Shahid-was-my-idea-Rajkumar-Yadav/articleshow/24200732.cms|archivedate=25 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's editor, [[Apurva Asrani]], edited the film in a linear order as he felt an earlier version was "not working".

Mehta said that they had a lot of material they did not use as "not all of it could translate into a scene"; he wanted the film to be more accessible.&lt;ref name=real/&gt; Azmi's brother Khalid Azmi said of the film's authenticity that "it is 95 percent accurate."&lt;ref name=mint/&gt;

'''Spring Harvest''' exists to 'equip the Church for action' through a range of events, conferences, books and resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springharvest.org Spring Harvest Web Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The tone is generally [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] with modern worship music, workshops and [[Bible]] study groups. The programme offers different streams for age groups such as children, young people, families, adults, etc. The organisation also runs a number of events, conferences and courses and produces a range of resources.

First held in 1979 as a one-week one-site event at [[Prestatyn]], Spring Harvest rapidly evolved and is now held at Butlins resorts in [[Minehead]] and [[Skegness]] every year - with the addition of one week at Harrogate in 2018.

The format for 2010 changed to five 'event-weeks' each consisting of six days (five nights) - three event-weeks at Minehead and two at Skegness - one week fewer than in 2009. This pattern remained for 2011, with approximately 28,000 people attending over these five event-weeks, including day visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Memralife Group Financial Statements (to 30 November 2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2012 and 2013 whilst the three Minehead weeks were retained there was only one Skegness week. In 2014 three of the four weeks available were reduced by one day. In 2017, the three weeks held in Minehead were reduced to just two, with one being shorter than the other by one day, and one week in Skegness remaining the same.

The Spring Harvest programme will be held in Harrogate again in 2019, alongside both Butlin’s Minehead and Skegness Resorts. This new venue is expected to be continually used for the foreseeable future, and it is thought that the Essentail Christian Brand will be hosting the event in new sites as guest capacity demands increase.

The '''St Nedelya Church assault''' was a terrorist attack on [[St Nedelya Church]] in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]]. It was carried out on 16 April 1925, when a group of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] blew up the church's roof during the funeral service of General Konstantin Georgiev, who had been killed in a previous communist assault on 14 April. 150 people, mainly from the country's political and military elite, were killed in the attack and around 500 were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sofia+Church+Terror+Attack+Vie+for+Bulgaria+Top+Event.-a0218282242|title=Sofia Church Terror Attack Vie for Bulgaria Top Event|publisher=The Free Library|date=2010|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
After the failure of the [[September Uprising]] in 1923 and the prohibition of the BCP by the Bulgarian Supreme Court of Appeal on 2 April 1924, the Communist Party found itself in a difficult situation. The government arrested many activists and the organization's very existence was under threat. A Special Punitive Group was established as part of the Central Committee of the BCP, including Yako Dorosiev, Captain Ivan Minkov and Vulko (or Valko) Chervenkov. The Military Organization (MO) of the BCP, led by Minkov and Major Kosta Yankov, set up small isolated groups ("шесторки", ''"shestorki"'') that carried out individual attacks. This, however, did not prevent the police from discovering and destroying the illegal structures of the BCP with relative ease.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Later, in December 1924, the organization recruited Petar Zadgorski, a [[sexton (office)|sexton]] at the church. Dimitar Hadzhidimitrov and [[Dimitar Zlatarev]], head of the MO armaments section, suggested that Police Director Vladimir Nachev be assassinated and a large-scale assault be carried out during his funeral service. In this way they hoped to eliminate a large number of key figures in the police hierarchy and thus lessen the pressure that the authorities exerted on the BCP. The idea was welcomed by [[Stanke Dimitrov]], Secretary of the Central Committee, who discussed it with [[Georgi Dimitrov]] and [[Vasil Kolarov]], General Secretary of the [[Comintern]], in early 1925. Nevertheless, they did not approve the proposal, as they thought such an action should first be preceded by preparations for a large-scale uprising that would follow the attack.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Meanwhile, the government continued to increase its pressure on the BCP. Following the killing of Valcho Ivanov, an influential functionary, on 11 February 1925, an amendment to the Law for the Protection of the State which increased the power of the authorities was introduced on 10 March. Yako Dorosiev, head of the MO, was then assassinated on 26 March. These events threatened the physical survival of the BCP leaders and angered the MO leadership. They announced that they were ready to put their plan into practice despite the Comintern's disapproval. It has been theorized that the assailants acted with the support of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] services, but there is no documentary evidence to support this hypothesis.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

==Execution of plan==
{{unsourced|section|date=May 2015}}
The MO management assigned one of its groups to the task, led by Petar Abadzhiev, who himself recruited the sexton, Petar Zadgorski. With his help, Abadzhiev and [[Asen Pavlov]] carried in a total of 25&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives to the attic of St Nedelya Church over the course of a couple of weeks. The explosives were mounted in a package above one of the columns of the main dome, situated by the south entrance to the building. The plan was to detonate the bomb by a 15 m-long cord that would allow the assailants a chance to escape.

Due to the strengthened guard at Vladimir Nachev's funeral service, the MO chose another victim whose funeral would be used as bait for the assault. At 8 pm on 14 April General Konstantin Georgiev, a deputy of the ruling [[Democratic Accord]], was assassinated by [[Atanas Todovichin]] in front of a Sofia church while heading there for the evening service with his granddaughter.

The funeral service of General Georgiev was set for 16 April, Holy Thursday. In order to increase the toll, the organizers sent forged invitations on behalf of the Association of Reserve Officers. At 7 am on the 16th, Zadgorski led [[Nikola Petrov (terrorist)|Nikola Petrov]] to the roof, where Petrov would detonate the bomb on Zadgorski's signal. The funeral procession entered the church at 3 pm that afternoon. The service was conducted by Bishop Stefan, the future Bulgarian Exarch. The coffin was initially placed right next to the column that was to be blown up, but then moved forward due to the large number of people that came to attend the ceremony.

[[File:Sign outside Old church in Sofia, Bulgaria September 2005.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A plaque at the church commemorating the victims of the bomb attack]]
In accordance with the MO group's plan, when the congregation had gathered and the service began, Zadgorski gave Nikola Petrov a signal to detonate, after which the two left the building at around 3:20. The explosion demolished the main dome of the church, burying many people inside. The blast indoors caused further damage. 150 people died during the explosion and another 500 were injured. By chance, all government members survived. The monarch, [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar]] [[Boris III]], was not in the church, as he was attending the funerals of those killed in the attempt on his own life in the [[Arabakonak]] pass in [[Stara Planina]]. Among the victims were General Kalin Naydenov (Minister of War during [[World War I]]); [[Stefan Nerezov]], commander of the [[Bulgarian Army]] at [[Dojran]]; General Ivan Popov, General Grigor Kyurkchiev, then-[[Mayor of Sofia]] Paskal Paskalev, as well as another governor, the chief of police, and three deputies. 25 women and children were also killed.

==Direct consequences==
{{unsourced|section|date=May 2015}}
The evening after the assault, [[martial law]] was declared. The attack caused a wave of violent repressions organized by the Military Union with the government's tacit approval. During the following two weeks, approximately 450 people were executed without trial, including poet [[Geo Milev]] and journalist Yosif Herbst. (A mass grave of those killed in 1925 was discovered in the 1950s during the construction of a dam, and Milev's corpse was identified by his glass eye - he had lost an eye in World War I.) Many other communists were heavily judged for taking part in the organization. The MO leaders Kosta Yankov and Ivan Minkov were among those assassinated. A few of the organizers of the attack, such as Zlatarev, Petar Abadzhiev and Nikola Petrov, managed to escape to the Soviet Union through [[Yugoslavia]]. Abandoned by his party, Zadgorski surrendered to the police and made a confession.

The assault trial took place before a military court in Sofia between 1-11 May 1925. Zadgorski, Lieutenant-Colonel Georgi Koev, who unsuccessfully attempted to hide Minkov, and Marko Fridman, an MO section leader, were all [[death sentence|sentenced to death]]. Stanke Dimitrov, Petar Abadzhiev, Dimitar Grancharov, Nikolay Petrini and Hristo Kosovski received capital punishment by default, with the last three of those having already been killed in the previous weeks.
Marko Fridman, the highest-ranked individual of those accused, confessed that the organization was financed and supplied with weaponry from the Soviet Union, but pinned the ultimate responsibility for the attack on Yankov and Minkov, who, according to Fridman, acted without the BCP management's agreement.

[[Alexis Smith]] starred as Miss Mona in the [[National Company]], which toured major cities for more than a year, ending with a seven-month run in [[Los Angeles]].

In what was described as "a return engagement", the show opened on Broadway at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theatre]] on May 31, 1982 and closed on July 24, 1982 after nine previews and 63 performances. The cast featured Glynn and Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/4712/The-Best-Little-Whorehouse-in-Texas |title=The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' 1982 Listing |website=PlayBillVault.com |accessdate=July 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202170123/http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/4712/The-Best-Little-Whorehouse-in-Texas |archive-date=2012-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short-lived sequel entitled ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public]]'' was staged on Broadway in 1994.

"The Aggie Song" was performed on the [[Tony Awards]] broadcast, but was heavily censored because of the nature of the lyrics and choreography.

A U.S. National Tour starring [[Ann-Margret]] opened on February 14, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.

A benefit concert took place on October 16, 2006, to benefit the Actor's Fund. The concert was directed by Mark S. Hoebee and choreographed by [[Denis Jones]]. The cast included [[Terrence Mann]] (as Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd), [[Emily Skinner]], and [[Jennifer Hudson]].&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

'''TidalCycles''' (also known as "Tidal") is a [[live coding]] environment designed for musical improvisation. In particular, it is a [[domain-specific language]] embedded in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], focused on the generation and manipulation of audible or visual patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLean|first1=Alex|title=Tidal – Pattern Language for Live Coding of Music|url=http://smcnetwork.org/node/1371|website=Sound and Music Computing|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally designed for heavily percussive, polyrhythmic grid-based music, but now uses a flexible, functional reactive representation for patterns, using rational time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Making Programming Languages to Dance to: Live Coding with Tidal|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2633638.2633647|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 2Nd ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modeling &amp; Design|date = 2014|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-4503-3039-8|pages = 63–70|series = FARM '14|doi = 10.1145/2633638.2633647|first = Alex|last = McLean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tidal may therefore be applied to a wide range of musical styles, although its cyclic approach to time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Temporal Semantics for a Live Coding Language|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2633638.2633648|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 2Nd ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modeling &amp; Design|date = 2014|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-4503-3039-8|pages = 37–47|series = FARM '14|doi = 10.1145/2633638.2633648|first = Samuel|last = Aaron|first2 = Dominic|last2 = Orchard|first3 = Alan F.|last3 = Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that it affords use in repetitive styles such as [[Algorave]].

The {{nihongo|'''World Popular Song Festival'''|世界歌謡祭|Sekai Kayōsai}}, also known as '''Yamaha Music Festival''' and unofficially as the '''"Oriental Eurovision"''', was an international song contest held from 1970 until 1989. It was organised by the [[Yamaha Music Foundation]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] from 1970 until 1989. The first edition of the World Popular Song Festival (WPSF) took place on 20, 21 and 22 November 1970 with 37 participating countries from all continents. The concert was cancelled in 1988 due to the illness of the [[Shōwa Emperor]]; the final year was a charity concert for [[UNICEF]], after which the contest was formally ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yamaha-mf.or.jp/history/e-history/wpsf/ Official Site by Yamaha Music Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Belgium]] was represented at the 1970 edition by [[Daliah Lavi]], famous for her role in ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (1967), the [[James Bond]] parody featuring [[Woody Allen]] as well with Samantha Gilles in 1987 ending second with the song Hold Me. Lavi performed the [[chanson]] "Prends L'Amour" and ended up 13th in the Grand Final (the contest had two semi-finals and one final). The [[Netherlands]] delegated world-known jazz singer [[Rita Reys]] with the song "Just Be You", a composition by her husband Pim Jacobs. Czech singer [[Helena Vondráčková]] sang "Uncle Charlie" a novelty song inspired by [[Charlie Chaplin]]. Other famous 1970 participants were 1969 Eurovision winner [[Frida Boccara]] for [[France]], Jacques Michel for [[Canada]] and [[Ted Mulry]] for [[Australia]], who scored a national number 1 hit with his entry. Winner of the 1st WPSF was [[Israel]] with the duo Hedva &amp; David. More than 2 million copies of their winning entry "Ani Holem Al Naomi" ("I Dream Of Naomi") were sold worldwide, giving a serious credibility boost to the new Festival.

Well established names as well as new talents tried their fortune at the WPSF: a very young [[ABBA]] under the name [[Björn Ulvaeus|Björn]] &amp; [[Benny Andersson|Benny]] with uncredited backing vocals by their partners [[Agnetha Fältskog|Agnetha]] and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad|Anni-Frid]] performing the track "Santa Rosa" with little success (later relegated to the B-side of their second single "He Is Your Brother"), [[Celine Dion|Céline Dion]] (Best Song Award in 1982), [[Bryan Adams]] (Participating in 1982), [[Bucks Fizz]] (Best Song Award in 1981), [[Tina Charles (singer)|Tina Charles]], [[Eros Ramazzotti]], [[Daniela Romo]], [[Gianna Nannini]], [[Demis Roussos]], [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[B.J. Thomas]], [[La Toya Jackson]], [[Erasure]], [[Cissy Houston]], Italian singer-songwriter [[Alice (Italian singer)|Alice]] and many others.

In the history of the WPSF, the [[United Kingdom]] has been the most successful, winning the "WPSF Grand Prix" 5 times in the seventies (even three times in row). The United Kingdom is followed by the [[United States]] with 4 Grand Prix victories. Smaller countries won as well: [[Jamaica]] in 1972 with [[Ernie Smith (singer)|Ernie Smith]], [[Norway]] in 1974 with [[Ellen Nikolaysen]], [[Cuba]] in 1981 with [[Osvaldo Rodríguez (Cuban)|Osvaldo Rodríguez]] and [[Hungary]] in 1983 with [[Neoton Família]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''World Sports Values Summit for Peace''' is an international conference which is aimed at  pursuing the value of the [[sports]] and discussing and disseminating how supports can be socially contribute to [[peace]] and respect for [[human rights]].

== History ==
The first World Sports Values [[Summit]] for Peace was held in [[London]] under the theme of “Olympic Values: London and Beyond”  from  June 29 through July 1, 2012.  The event highlighted the three overarching themes discussed at the two-day [[symposium]]: the meaning of Olympic values in the twenty-first century; how to realize them more effectively in sport, at the Games and beyond;  and how to leverage them for broader goals, nationally and internationally, including human right and peace. Related to the first Summit, a global essay contest  was also held, in which 265 students from 61 countries shared their ideas about Olympic values and how to realize them through sport, culture, education, and other public initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/olympic-values-london-and-beyond-report-of-the-olympic-values-symposium |title="Olympic Values: London and Beyond" Report of the Olympic Values Symposium |date=July 1, 2012 |website=Berkley Center For Religion, Peace World |publisher=BERKLEY CENTER FOR RELIGION, PEACE &amp; WORLD AFFAIRS AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY |access-date=March 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
