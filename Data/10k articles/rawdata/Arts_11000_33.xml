'''''A Bronx Tale''''' is a 1993 American crime [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]], adapted from [[Chazz Palminteri]]'s 1989 [[A Bronx Tale (play)|play of the same name]]. It tells the [[coming of age]] story of an [[Italian-American]] boy, Calogero Anello, who, after encountering a local [[American Mafia|Mafia]] boss, is torn between the temptations of organized crime and the values of his honest, hardworking father. The Broadway production was converted to film with limited changes, and starred Palminteri and [[Robert De Niro]].

De Niro, who first viewed the play in Los Angeles in 1990, acquired the rights from Palminteri, intent on making the play his directorial debut. The duo then worked heavily together on the screenplay, with Palminteri aiming to retain many of the aspects of the original script, as it was based largely on his own childhood. Production began in 1991, and was funded in collaboration with De Niro's [[TriBeCa Productions]] and [[Savoy Pictures]], as the first film released by each studio.

Upon its release on September 29, ''A Bronx Tale'' achieved limited commercial success, grossing over $17 million domestically. However, it fared much better with critics, who praised the performances of the leads, and launched Palminteri's acting career, while also helping De Niro gain acceptance as a director.

==Plot==
In 1960, Lorenzo Anello lives in [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]], an Italian-American neighborhood in [[The Bronx]], with his wife Rosina and his 9-year-old son Calogero, who is fascinated by the local mobsters led by Sonny LoSpecchio. One day, Calogero witnesses a murder committed by Sonny in defense of an assaulted friend in his neighborhood. When Calogero chooses to keep quiet when questioned by [[NYPD]] detectives, Sonny takes a liking to him and gives him the nickname "C". Sonny's men offer Lorenzo a better paying job, but Lorenzo, preferring a law-abiding life as an [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] bus driver, politely declines. Sonny befriends Calogero and introduces him to his crew. Calogero earns tips amounting to $600 working in the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] bar and throwing dice, and is admonished harshly by Lorenzo when he discovers it. Lorenzo speaks severely to Sonny, returns the money, and angrily warns him to keep away from Calogero.

Eight years later, Calogero has grown into a young man who has been visiting Sonny regularly without his father's knowledge. Calogero is also part of a gang of local Italian-American boys, which concerns Sonny, who warns Calogero to keep away from them and focus more on his schoolwork. Later on, Calogero meets a [[black people|black]] girl, Jane Williams, and is smitten with her. Despite the high level of racial tension and dislike between Italian Americans and African Americans, Calogero arranges a date with Jane. He asks for advice from both his father and Sonny, with the latter lending Calogero his car so he can make a good impression. Later, Calogero's friends beat up some black cyclists who ride through their neighborhood, despite Calogero's attempts to defend them. One of the cyclists turns out to be Jane's brother, Willie. Willie mistakes Calogero for one of the assailants and accuses him of beating him up when Calogero and Jane meet for their date. Calogero loses his temper over the accusation and Willie's lack of gratitude, responding by accidentally addressing him with a racial slur, which he instantly regrets. Jane, disappointed, leaves with Willie.

At home, Calogero is confronted by his father who just saw him driving Sonny's car. An argument ensues and Calogero storms out. Shortly thereafter, Calogero is confronted by Sonny and his crew, who found a bomb in Sonny's car and suspected Calogero of planning to assassinate him. Calogero tearfully proclaims how he has come to view Sonny as a father and would never hurt him, and Sonny recognizes Calogero's innocence and allows him to leave. Lorenzo emerges to defend his son and confront Sonny, but is held back by Sonny's men. The black boys egg the Italian-American boys' usual spot in retaliation for the previous beating, and Calogero's friends make a plan to strike back using [[Molotov cocktail]]s. They pick up Calogero in their car and try to force him to participate, but Sonny stops the car and orders Calogero out, warning them to stay away from Calogero. Calogero catches up with Jane, who tells him that Willie had since admitted that Calogero had tried to help him from the other boys who beat him up. Jane and Calogero make amends, but Calogero suddenly remembers his friends' plans to attack Jane's neighborhood and the two rush to stop them. During the attack, one of the Molotov cocktails is thrown back into the car window, igniting the remaining bottles. The resulting crash and explosion kills everyone inside. Calogero and Jane arrive to find Calogero's friends dead, and Calogero realizes that Sonny had saved his life.

Calogero rushes back to his neighborhood and makes his way through the crowded bar to thank Sonny and inform him of what happened, but an unnamed assailant shoots Sonny in the back of the head before Calogero can warn him. Calogero later learns that the assailant was the son of the man Sonny killed in front of Calogero's house eight years earlier. At Sonny's funeral, countless people come to pay their respects. When the crowd disperses, a lone man, Carmine, visits the funeral, claiming that Sonny once saved his life as well. Calogero does not recognize Carmine until he sees a scar on his forehead and realizes he was the assaulted man whom Sonny had defended eight years ago. Carmine tells Calogero that he will be taking care of the neighborhood for the time being, and promises Calogero help should he ever need anything. Carmine leaves just as Calogero's father unexpectedly arrives to pay his respects to Sonny, thanking him for saving his son's life and admitting that he had never hated Sonny, but merely resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly. Calogero makes peace with his father, and the two walk home together as Calogero narrates the lessons he learned from his two mentors.

==Production==
===Writing===
After acquiring the rights to create the film, with De Niro famously claiming the deal was struck solely with a [[gentlemen's agreement]] with Palminteri, the duo began crafting the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Vlastelica | first=Ryan | title=Chazz Palminteri on A Bronx Tale, Keyser Söze, and Stallone’s career advice | url=http://www.avclub.com/article/chazz-palminteri-bronx-tale-keyser-soze-and-stallo-232137 | work=The A.V. Club | publisher= | date=March 2, 2016 | accessdate=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to partnering with De Niro, Palminteri rejected several offers for the film's rights, including some as high as $1 million, if he was not granted the roles of primary screenwriter and Sonny, the gangster Calogero meets. This was due to the [[A Bronx Tale (play)|original play]], which was performed as a [[one-person show|one-man show]], being largely inspired by or drawn from his own childhood, specifically the shooting Calogero witnesses as a child, as well as the occupation and name of his father.

{{Anchor|Reception|Critics}}

== Reception ==
''A Bronx Tale'' received positive reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film an approval rating of 96% based on 28 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, "''A Bronx Tale'' sets itself apart from other coming-of-age dramas thanks to a solid script, a terrific cast, and director Robert De Niro's sensitive work behind the camera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bronx_tale/ |title=A Bronx Tale |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave it a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating "generally positive reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-bronx-tale |title=A Bronx Tale |website=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars, calling it "very funny [and] very touching. It is filled with life and colorful characters and great lines of dialogue, and De Niro, in his debut as a director, finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears [while] retaining its values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19931001/REVIEWS/310010302|accessdate=January 21, 2010|website=rogerebert.suntimes.com|title=A Bronx Tale|date=1993-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aboriginal sites of Victoria''' form an important record of human occupation for probably more than 40,000 years. They may be identified from archaeological remains, historical and ethnographic information or continuing [[oral traditions]] and encompass places where rituals and ceremonies were performed, occupation sites where people ate, slept and carried out their day to day chores, and ephemeral evidence of people passing through the landscape, such as a discarded axe head or isolated artefact.

Victorian Aboriginal sites include [[Midden|shell middens]], [[scarred trees]], [[Burnt mound|cooking mounds]], [[rock art]], [[burials]], [[Aboriginal sacred site|ceremonial sites]] and innumerable [[Stone tool|stone artefacts]]. These stone flakes represent the tools Aboriginal people used, such as knives, spear points, scrapers and awls, and the waste material left behind when they were made. Commonly referred to as ''stone artefact scatters'' such sites can be found on the surface or exposed by ploughing or erosion, or through careful [[archaeological excavation]].

==Types of sites==

Scarred trees result from removing bark for the manufacture of shields, [[Coolamon (vessel)|coolamons]], shelters and other utensils can be found where appropriate species of tree of sufficient age survive. Some trees were marked with designs and symbols. A large [[river red gum]] with a canoe scar is located at [[Heide Museum of Modern Art|Heide Gallery]] in [[Bulleen]].

There have been more than 60 rock art sites identified in the [[Grampians National Park#Cultural heritage|Grampians National Park]] which contains about 80% of the known Aboriginal [[rock art]] sites in Victoria, with a number of new discoveries after the fires of January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Brochure, ''[http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/about/pubs/national-heritage-grampians.pdf Grampians National Park (Gariwerd), Victoria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123084633/http://environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/about/pubs/national-heritage-grampians.pdf |date=23 November 2011 }}'', Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Accessed 25 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They depict humans, human hands, animal tracks and birds, while some are open to the public and are readily accessible including: Billimina (Glenisla shelter), Jananginj Njani (Camp of the Emu's Foot), Manja (Cave of Hands), Larngibunja (Cave of Fishes), Ngamadjidj (Cave of Ghosts), and Gulgurn Manja (Flat Rock).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grampiansnationalpark.com/grampians/national/park/history.asp#aboriginal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426023101/http://www.grampiansnationalpark.com/grampians/national/park/history.asp |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby [[Bunjil|Bunjil's Shelter]], which illustrates Bunjil, the creator, is in the Black Range near [[Stawell, Victoria|Stawell]]. A painting thought to be of a [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger) is noted from [[Chiltern-Mount Pilot National Park|Mt Pilot]] and the paintings at [[Mudgegonga]] rock shelter in north-eastern Victoria are possibly 3500 years old.

[[File:Wurdi Youang.jpg|thumb|right|A small part of the Wurdi Youang stone arrangement]]

Ceremonial sites are rare, but two large stone arrangements have been found at [[Wurdi Youang]] near [[Mount Rothwell]] and [[Carisbrook]]. others have been identified from Oral tradition, although archaeological remains are no longer evident such as the [[Corroboree|Corroboree Tree]] at [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] oval was a significant gathering place for the Wurundjeri people. A number of earth rings have been identified in [[Sunbury earth rings|Sunbury]],&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, David 1982 Earth rings at Sunbury, Victoria. Archaeology in Oceania 17:83-89&lt;/ref&gt; which, although lacking historical or ethnographic evidence, have been interpreted as ceremonial Bora rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.arts.uwa.edu.au/about/research/bowdler/a_study_of_indigenous_ceremonial_(bora)_sites_in_eastern_australia |title=Bowdler, Sandra, 1999, ''A study of Indigenous ceremonial ("Bora") sites in eastern Australia'', Centre for Archaeology, University of Western Australia, paper delivered at "Heritage Landscapes: Understanding Place &amp;Communities" conference, Southern Cross University, Lismore, November 1999 |access-date=6 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414223443/http://www.archaeology.arts.uwa.edu.au/about/research/bowdler/a_study_of_indigenous_ceremonial_(bora)_sites_in_eastern_australia |archive-date=14 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount William Aboriginal stone axe quarry.jpg|thumb|Mount William Quarry]]

Evidence of stone quarrying is rare, but the [[Mount William stone axe quarry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.iprimus.com.au/foo7/arch2.html Archaeological site at Mount William Lancefield Australia, Romsey Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of a number of stone sources used for making tools which were traded long distances throughout central and western Victoria and into New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Coutts, P.J.F. &amp; Miller, R (1977).

Only a relatively small number of burials have been identified in Victoria, most of which are associated with sand dunes along the coast or in the north west of the state. [[Kow Swamp Archaeological Site|Kow Swamp]] is particularly significant for evidence of 13000 year old burial rituals using a headband of kangaroo incisors similar to those worn by Aboriginal people until recently, and for consistent burial practices over a long period. A burial on the banks of the Werribee river has been dated to about 7300 years ago.

Shell [[midden]]s occur along most of the coastline and some lake-shores and river banks. Most of these were relatively recent (due to the mobile nature of sand) such as [[Apollo Bay|Seal Point]] and [[Moonlight Head]] in the [[Otway Ranges]], although some like [[Mallacoota]] Inlet in eastern Gippsland have been dated to more than 2500 years ago, and [[Wilsons Promontory]] 6500 years ago.

Large earth mounds were built up by deliberate transport of soil and the remains of clay heat retainers in hearths, the collapse of seasonally abandoned turf huts and camp activities. Examples have been found on the [[Hopkins River]] flood plain in central western Victoria, and in the [[Nyah Forest]], the oldest is dated to about 2500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Coutts and Jane Wesson, Victoria Archaeological Survey Summer Schools in Archaeology: An Evaluation, ''Australian Archaeology'' No. 11 (Dec., 1980), pp. 19–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish and eel traps were constructed on many rivers, and while most were probably of organic materials and have left little trace, some, such as at [[Lake Condah]] in western Victoria reveal complex systems of excavated channels and stone weirs, dated to 3000 years ago. Stone artefacts found near the bones of now extinct megafauna at Lancefield in central Victoria have suggested Aboriginal people were living alongside giant marsupials 26,000 years ago.

While rock shelters are often the sites of cave painting and other art, they also provide deeply stratified occupation deposits because they are protected from erosion. [[New Guinea II cave]] on the Snowy River near Buchan has deposits more than 10 000 years old along with delicate cave paintings and engravings. Rock shelters were occupied in the [[Tarragal Caves|Cape Bridgewater]] area about 12,000 years ago. [[Cloggs Cave]] rock shelter near [[Buchan, Victoria]] was occupied about 18,000 years ago, where bone tools and animal remains were found. At the [[Keilor Archaeological Site]] a human hearth excavated in 1971 was radiocarbon-dated to about 31,000 years [[Before Present|BP]], making Keilor one of the earliest sites of human habitation in Australia, while at [[Box Gully archaeological site|Box Gully]] on [[Lake Tyrrell]], emu eggs and other artefacts have been dated to 27,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Flood, Pleistocene Human Occupation and Extinct Fauna in Cloggs Cave, Buchan, South-east Australia

Stone artefact scatters are among the most common site types and provide evidence of tool use and manufacture. These are often extensive surface scatters and deep [[Archaeological stratigraphy|stratified]] deposits of flaked finegrained stone, of [[lithic flake]]s. Much of this material is waste flakes, discarded during the manufacture process. Specific types of artefacts such as blades, scrapers or [[burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s may indicate what the area was used for, for example processing animal skins. Stone artefact material is usually rine grained [[silcrete]], [[chert]], and [[quartz]]. [[Hornfels in Victorian archaeological sites|Hornfels]] is an unusual and rare material, but is highly distinctive.

==Age and chronology==

Archaeological evidence points to people first arriving in [[Australia]] around 50,000 years ago and in Victoria shortly after. Sites over 22,000 years old have been found at [[Kow Swamp Archaeological Site]] and the [[Keilor archaeological site]].&lt;ref name="keilor_presland"&gt;Gary Presland, ''[http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00792b.htm Keilor Archaeological Site]'', eMelbourne website. Accessed 3 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Human cranium|cranium]] found at the site has been dated at between 12,000&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, ''[http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~pbrown3/Keilor.html The Keilor Cranium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217013357/http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~pbrown3/Keilor.html |date=17 December 2004 }}'', Peter Brown's Australian and Asian Palaeoanthropology, Accessed 3 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and 14,700 years [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref name="keilor_presland" /&gt;

The oldest archaeological site in the greater Melbourne area, and one of the most important, is at Keilor on the Maribyrnong River. A human skull discovered there in 1940 was later found to be around 13 000 years old, older than any other human remains found in Australia up to that time, and the find attracted worldwide attention. After small excavations in the 1960s and 1970s, archaeologists from [[La Trobe University]] and the [[Victoria Archaeological Survey]] (VAS) began an excavation that continued for five years finding a sequence of stone tools and butchered animal bone.

==Occupation patterns==

Whilst most evidence of Aboriginal settlement is derived from camp sites where fireplaces, remains of stone tool making and sometimes structures such as mounds and huts can be found, and these sites are almost always located close to reliable water sources, the distribution of Aboriginal archaeological sites demonstrates occupation of all the climatic zones in Victoria, even during the extreme global climatic conditions at the peak of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] when temperatures were colder, vast amounts of surface water were frozen in glaciers and sea levels were lower. Around 18,000 BP sea levels were about 65 metres below present day levels,&lt;ref&gt;John Mulvaney &amp; Johan Kamminga, ''Prehistory of Australia'', Washington, D.C. : Smithsonian Institution Press,1999&lt;/ref&gt; while archaeological evidence has shown that people were present in south‐eastern Australia throughout all of the climatic changes of at least the last 30,000 years ranging from the deep gorges and highlands of [[East Gippsland]] such as at Clogg’s Cave,&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Flood, ''Archaeology of the Dreamtime'', J. B. Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and New Guinea II cave,&lt;ref&gt;'New Guinea II Cave: a Pleistocene site on the Snowy River, Victoria' by Paul Ossa | Papers by Paul co-authored with Brendan Marshal &amp; Cathie Webb, ''Archaeology in Oceania'' (1995) Volume: 30, Issue: 1, Pages: 22-35.&lt;/ref&gt; the riverine plains at Keilor, the inland plains and swamps such as Kow Swamp, and the eastern ranges at the Grampians.

==Protection and management==

All Aboriginal archaeological sites and relics in Victoria are protected under the [[Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 (Victoria)|Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/aha2006164/ Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and are administered by [[Victorian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs|Aboriginal Affairs Victoria]], in some instances through delegation to [[Registered Aboriginal Party|Registered Aboriginal Parties]]. All known sites are recorded on the [[Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Register]] (VAHR), which is maintained by Aboriginal Affairs Victoria. There were approximately 30,000 places and objects included on the register to date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://applications.vic.gov.au/apps/achris/public/home AAV Home - Aboriginal Affairs Victoria - ACHRIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Pre-Romanesque]]''' architecture in [[Asturias]] is framed between the years 711 and 910, the period of the creation and expansion of the [[kingdom of Asturias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Archaeology of Iberia: The Dynamics of Change |author= S. J. Keay, Margarita Díaz-Andreu García |year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-12012-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kq8R9n4M10C&amp;pg=PA236 | page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical introduction==
In the 5th century, the [[Goths]], a Christianized tribe of Eastern Germanic origin, arrived in the [[Iberian peninsula]] after the fall of the [[Roman empire]], and dominated most of the territory,
attempting to continue Roman order by the so-called ''Ordo Gothorum''.

In the year 710, the Visigothic king [[Wittiza]] died, and instead of being succeeded by the eldest of his three sons, [[Agila II|Agila]], the throne was usurped by the duke of [[Baetica]], [[Roderic]]. The young heir sought support to recover the throne, and apart from local backing, he approached the Muslim Kingdom in [[northern Africa]]. [[Tarik]], the caliph of [[Damascus]] governor in Tangier, received permission to offer his army and disembark in [[Spain]], ready to face the Visigothic army of King [[Roderic]].

On July 19, 711, the [[battle of Guadalete]] took place near [[Gibraltar]], where supporters of Witiza's heir, backed by Tarik's Muslim army, killed King Roderic and destroyed the Visigothic army. Tarik and his troops then took advantage of their military superiority, and marched on the Visigothic capital, [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], taking it almost without opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Art |author=Harold W. Osborne|year= 1970|publisher=Clarendon P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the chronicles, [[Asturian people|Asturian]] mercenaries, who had already been recruited by the Romans for their courage and fighting spirit, fought alongside King [[Roderic]]. These warriors, together with the rest of the retreating Gothic army, sought refuge in the mountains of Asturias, where they also tried to safeguard some of the sacred relics from Toledo cathedral, the most important of which was the Holy Ark, containing a large number of relics from [[Jerusalem]].

The kingdom of Asturias arose exactly seven years later, in 718, when the Astur tribes, rallied in assembly, decided to appoint [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelayo]] as their leader, a person of uncertain origin, since for some chroniclers he was a Visigothic [[nobleman]] who fled from the Muslim conquerors and for others he was an indigenous nobleman associated with the Visigothic kingdom. Whatever the case, Pelayo joined the local tribes and the refuged Visigoths under his command, with the intention of progressively restoring Gothic Order, based on the kingdom of Toledo's political model.

The kingdom of Asturias disappeared with King [[Alfonso III of León|Alfonso III]], who died in December of the year 910. In barely two hundred years, the 12 kings of the dynasty founded by Pelayo were to gradually recover territory from the Muslims ([[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]), a process which finally required the court to be moved south, to León, for its strategic position in the struggle that culminated 800 years after it had started (1492) with the taking of [[Granada]] and the expulsion of the last [[Arabic]] king from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The symbol of the [[flag of Asturias]], a golden cross (significantly called "La Victoria"), and a blue background with the Latin motto ''Hoc signo, tvetvr pivs, Hoc signo vincitvr inimicvs'' (With this sign the pious is protected, With this sign you shall defeat the enemy), sums up the unified character that Christianity gave the armed struggle.

==Pre-Romanesque as the Asturian monarchy's artistic expression==
Asturian Pre-Romanesque is a singular feature in all Spain, which, while combining elements from other styles ([[Visigothic]], [[Mozarabic]] and local traditions), created and developed its own personality and characteristics, reaching a considerable level of refinement, not only as regards construction, but also in terms of decoration and [[gold]] ornamentation. This last aspect can be seen in such relevant works as the Cross of the Angels, the Victory Cross, the agate Box (housed in the Holy Chamber of [[Cathedral of San Salvador (Oviedo)|Oviedo Cathedral]]), the Reliquary in [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] Cathedral and the Cross of Santiago.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:caja de las agatas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The agate box]] --&gt;
As [[court]] [[architecture]], the situation of Pre-Romanesque monuments followed in the wake of the various locations of the kingdom's capital; from its original site in [[Cangas de Onís]] (Eastern Asturias), through [[Pravia]] (west of the central coast), to its final location in [[Oviedo]], the region's geographical centre.

As regards its evolution, from its appearance, Asturian Pre-Romanesque followed a ''"stylistic sequence closely associated with the kingdom's political evolution, its stages clearly outlined".''
Five stages are distinguished; a first period (737–791) belonging to the reigns of the kings [[Favila of Asturias|Fáfila]], [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso I]], [[Fruela I]], [[Aurelius of Asturias|Aurelio]], [[Silo]], [[Mauregato]] and [[Bermudo I of Asturias|Vermudo I]]. A second stage comprises the reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] (791–842), entering a stage of stylistic definition, and third comprises the reigns of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] (842–850) and [[Ordoño I of Asturias|Ordoño I]] (850–866); a fourth belongs to the reign of Alfonso III (866–910) and a fifth and last which coincides with the transfer of the court to [[León, Spain|León]], the disappearance of the kingdom of Asturias, and simultaneously, of Asturian Pre-Romanesque.

==Monuments of interest==

===First Period (737 to 791)===
From this period, of the young kingdom's rise and consolidation, the existence of two churches have been registered. The [[Santa Cruz de Cangas de Onís|Church of Santa Cruz]] (737) at the court's original location, Cangas de Onís, of which we only have written references, because it was destroyed in 1936. The present-day one dates from 1950 and, like the original, is built over a barrow covering a [[dolmen]]. The legend goes that the name Santa Cruz ("Holy Cross") comes from the oaken cross carried by King Pelayo in the [[battle of Covadonga]], the first ''"little-big victory"'' against the Arabs, which was later to be covered in gold and [[precious stones]] (reign of Alfonso III), coming to be called ''La Victoria'', and emblem of the Asturian flag. Chronicles state that the Church of Santa Cruz was built in stone masonry, one nave with a barrel vault and a main chapel on one side. 
[[File:Santianes de Pravia.jpg|thumb|250px|Santianes de Pravia]]
The second of these constructions is the [[Church of San Juan Apóstol y Evangelista, Santianes de Pravia]], located in Santianes. Its construction results from the move of the royal court from [[Cangas de Onís]] to [[Pravia]], an old Roman settlement (Flavium Navia) and crossroads. The church, built between the years 774 and 783, already showed a number of elements anticipating Asturian Pre-Romanesque; eastward-facing, [[basilica]] ground plan (central [[nave]] and two side [[aisle]]s), separated by three semicircular [[arch]]es, [[transept]] facing the central nave with the same length as the width of the three [[aisle]]s. It also had a single, semicircular [[apse]], and an external entrance [[Vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]], with a wooden [[ceiling]] over the nave.

Several sculptural decorative elements showing floral and geometric designs (something habitual in what were to be the characteristics of subsequent Pre-Romanesque), are on public display in the [[sacristy]], where there is a [[museum]].

===Second Period (791 to 842)===
Alfonso II, known as ''"the Chaste"'' (maybe for this reason he never had descendants), was a decisive king in the Asturian monarchy. From a military point of view, he definitively established the kingdom against the Muslims (in the famous [[battle of Lutos]] he gained a significant victory), in administration he moved the court to its final site in Oviedo, and in politics he set up cordial, stable relationships with the emperor [[Charlemagne]], as demonstrated by the following quote by Eginardo (Vita caroli): {{cquote|''...the emperor (Charlemagne) was so closely united with Alfonso, king of Asturias and Galicia, that each time he sent a letter or ambassador, he ordered that he be given no treatment other than that of his client.''}}

As regards patronage of art, Alfonso II promoted the largest number of Pre-Romanesque buildings defining what were to be this style's characteristics. With the royal architect, [[Tioda]], he built the churches of [[Church of San Tirso, Oviedo]], [[San Julián de los Prados]], [[Church of Santa María de Bendones|Santa María de Bendones]] and [[Church of San Pedro de Nora|San Pedro de Nora]], in addition to the palace complex in Oviedo, now disappeared, consisting of the churches of San Salvador, Santa María and its adjoining palace and chapel (now the Holy Chamber of Oviedo Cathedral, the only one remaining), containing relies such as the Holy Ark and jewels, like the [[Cross of the Angels]], which he donated himself to the [[Cathedral of Oviedo|Church of San Salvador]]. Outside Asturias, with the legend of the discovery of the apostle [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]' tomb in Galicia, in a place known as ''campus stellae'' ([[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]]), Alfonso II had the first church built in the saints honour (year 892).
[[File:Santullano.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Santullano]]
When the Church of '''[[San Julián de los Prados]], or Santuyano''', was built (approx. between the years  (812 and 842), it formed part of a series of royal buildings. The church had a basilica ground plan [central nave and two side aisles), separated by three semicircular arches on impost capitals and square columns. It is worth noting the existence of a [[transept]] or transversal aisle located between the aisles and the sanctuary, exceeding the central nave in height.

Finally, there was a straight sanctuary, divided into three [[chapel]]s, and over the main one, only accessible from outside, there was a room whose function is still open to conjecture. As for the roof, the church had an interesting oaken ceiling carved with a variety of geometric designs.

As elements outside the ground plan, there was a vestibule (to the east) and two sacristies adjoining the north and south facades, communicating directly with the transept. The Church of [[San Julián de los Prados]] is the largest of the pre-romanesque churches.

From an ornamental point of view, the [[mural]]s covering the walls and ceilings of this church are the best-conserved upper medieval paintings in Spain. the technique used is ''al [[fresco]]'' painting (applied with the [[plaster]] still wet), arranged in three well-defined areas. Decorative designs show clear influence of mural painting from the Roman period, recreating a certain atmosphere typical of the ''"theatrical style"'' (1st century B.C.). Decorative elements are numerous; [[marble]] imitation, rectangles, bands, weaving, squares, imitation channeling and columns, medallions decorated with plant motifs, architectural designs, curtains, though totally lacking in any portrayal of biblical or religious scenes, with the single exception of the [[Anastasis Cross]] (alpha and omega), as a symbol of royal power. This lack of figurative representation is known as [[aniconism]] and was not maintained in later Pre-Romanesque churches.

The '''[[Church of San Tirso, Oviedo|church of San Tirso]]''', located beside the [[Cathedral of Oviedo]], only conserves the end wall of the apse from its original construction, because it was destroyed by fire in the 16th century. The section remaining shows the original construction in stone blocks, and in the centre, there is the characteristic three-point window of Asturian Pre-Romanesque, with semicircular arches made of brick. The central opening, larger than the side ones, is supported by free-standing columns.

The [[Cámara Santa, Oviedo|Holy Chamber]] was built as a palace chapel for Alfonso II and the church of San Salvador (both demolished in the 14th century to build the present Gothic cathedral). The Chamber, adjoining the pre-Romanesque Tower of San Miguel, also had the function of housing
relies brought from Toledo after the fall of the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom. It consists of two overlapping aisles with a barrel vault; the crypt or lower floor has a height of 2.30 metres, and is dedicated to [[St. Leocadia]], containing several tombs of other [[martyr]]s.

The upper floor, dedicated to [[St. Michael]], was extended in the 12th century, elongating the central section to six metres, a reconstruction that also provided it with its current decoration, a masterpiece of Spanish [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]. From an architectural point of view, the Holy Chamber's construction solved one of the greatest problems of Asturian Pre-Romanesque: the vaulting of two overlapping spaces, later used in the buildings of Ramiro I.

As mentioned above, a from acting as royal chapel, the Holy Chamber was built to house the jewels and relies of the cathedral of San Salvador in Oviedo, a function it continues to have 1,200 years later. Some of these jewels were donated by the Kings Alfonso II and Alfonso III, and represent extraordinary gold artefacts of Asturian Pre-Romanesque.

The first of them is the [[Cross of the Angels]], created in 808 in [[Gauzón]] (the left bank of the estuary of [[Avilés]]) on the instructions of [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], who donated the precious stones necessary to make it from his personal treasury. The Cross of the Angels takes its name from the legend that it was made and given to Alfonso II by [[angel]]s, who appeared to him in the form of [[pilgrim]]s. The Greek cross (equal arms) has a core of [[cherry]] wood and in the centre there is a circular disk acting as connection for the four arms. The anverse is covered with a filigreed mesh of gold thread and bands of geometric decoration with a total of 48 precious stones ([[agate]]s, [[sapphire]]s, [[aamethysts]]s, [[ruby|rubies]] and [[opal]]s) of great beauty.The reverse is covered with fine sheet of gold held by silver nails. Decoration on this side shows, mounted on the central disk, a large elliptical agate cameo, and a large stone at the end of each arm.

Exactly one century later, in 908, to commemorate a hundred years of the Asturían kingdom's victories and conquests, Alfonso III donated Pre-Romanesque most important gold artifact to Oviedo Cathedral: the [[Victory Cross]] or Santa Cruz, a Latin cross (unequal arms) of 92&amp;nbsp;cm by 72&amp;nbsp;cm. The core is made of two pieces of oak with circular ends finished in three foils, and joined in the centre by a circular disk. The whole cross is covered with gold leaf and filigree, and richly decorated especially the anverse, covered with coloured [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[pearls]], precious stones and gold thread. The reverse shows an inscription in soldered gold letters, mentioning the donors to the [[Cathedral of Oviedo|Church of San Salvador]], King Alfonso III and Queen Jimena, and the place (Gauzón Castle again) and the year it was made.

The last of the Pre-Romanesque jewels on in the Holy Chamber of the [[Cathedral of Oviedo]] is the [[Agate box]], donated to the church by [[Fruela II of Asturias]] (son of Alfonso II), and his wife Nunilo, in the year 910, when he was still a prince. This extraordinary gold artifact in mozarabic style is a rectangular reliquary made from [[Cupressus|cypress]] with a semi-pyramidal shaped lid. The covered with gold plate, with 99 little arch shaped openings, framed in woven gold thread, containing agates. The most valuable part of this piece is the upper part of the lid, probably re-used from another, smaller reliquary of Carolingian origin, a hundred years older than the rest. This plaque is decorated with panels of enamel, in turn surrounded by 655 encrusted garnets.

Continuing with the architectural works of the second period of Pre-Romanesque art, the last two are the churches of [[Church of Santa María de Bendones|Santa Maria de Bendones]] and [[Church of San Pedro de Nora|San Pedro de Nora]]. The first is located just fíve kilometres from the capital, in a south-east direction, towards the [[Nalón (Asturian comarca)|Nalón]] valley, and was a donation from King Alfonso III and his wife Jimena to San Salvador cathedral, on January 20, 905. Very similar to Santullano, although the ground plan is not the typical basilica of  the Pre-Romanesque churches, but has three enclosures at the western end, the central one as an entrance vestibule and two side areas possibly to house parishioners or ecciesiastics. This entrance leads into a single nave with a wooden ceiling, covered by an interesting roof, the same length as the entrance enclosures. The nave adjoins two rectangular side areas, also with a wooden ceiling, whose use seems to associated with the liturgical rites of the period. this nave joined with the sanctuary by three semicircular brick arches, each of which leads into its corresponding chapel, of which only the main or central one is covered with a brick barrel vault, the other two with wooden ceilings.

Above the main chapel is the "typical" chamber, only accessible from outside, through a trefoil window with the standard Pre-Romanesque features; central arch larger than the side  ones, resting on two free-standing capitals with rope moulding, and the upper rectangle framed by simple moulding.

Independent from the church structure, though close to its southern facade, stands the bell tower, on a rectangular ground plan.

The [[Church of San Pedro de Nora]] is located beside the River Nora, about twelve kilometres from Oviedo. This church has the construction style established in Santullano: facing eastwards, vestibule separate from the main structure, basilica-type ground plan, central nave higher than the side aisles, with intersecting wooden roof and lit by Windows with stone lattice. The straight sanctuary is divided into three apses with barrel vaults. As a differentiating element, the apses were joined to each other through the dividing walls by semicircular-arched doors. Like all the churches from this period, there was a room over the apse, only accessible from outside through a trefoil window. The bell tower, separate from the church like in [[Church of Santa María de Bendones|Santa Maria de Bendones]], does not belong to the original construction, and stems from an initiative in the seventies by the architect and great restorer of Asturian Pre-Romanesque, [[Luis Menéndez Pidal y Alvarez]].

===Third period (842 to 866)===
This period corresponds with the reigns of Ramiro I and Ordoño I. The first, son of Vermudo I, succeeded Alfonso II when he died without descendants, taking charge of a rapidly expanding kingdom. He was described by chroniclers as ''Virga justitiae'' (baton of justice) because he had to face two internal rebellions by noblemen and due to his enthusiasm in hunting down magic and the black arts, very widespread in Asturias at the time. He also fought the [[Normans]] successfully, defeating them in [[Gijón]] and [[A Coruña]]. Paradoxically, he enjoyed a time of peace with his traditional enemies, the Muslims, which from an artistic point of view allowed him to substantially renew Pre-Romanesque's architecture and decorative style, giving rise to the so-called Ramirian style.

Ramiro I was succeeded by his son Ordoño I, who inherited a very solid kingdom from a military perspective, a condition that let him use subjects from the kingdom of Asturias to re-populate abandoned cities on the other side of the mountains, such as [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]], [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] and León. He measured his military might against the Arabs with varying results; in the [[battle of Clavijo]] (year 859) he easily defeated them, though six years later, at Hoz de la Morcuera, his army, led by one of his generals, suffered a defeat, halting the intense re-population work of the first part of his reign.
[[File:Santa Maria del Naranco.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Santa María del Naranco]]
The first of the works from this period, the Palace of '''[[Santa María del Naranco]]''', involved a significant stylistic, morphological, constructive and decorative renovation of Pre-Romanesque, supplementing it with new, innovative resources, representing a leap forward with respect to immediately previous periods. Built as a recreational palace, it is situated on the southern side of Monte Naranco facing the city, and was originally part of a series of royal buildings located in the outskirts. Its character as a civil building changed in the 12th century when it
was converted into a church dedicated to St. Mary.

This palace's innovations amazed chroniclers, who repeatedly mention it over time. A case in point is the [[Crónica Silense]], written around the year 1015, about 300 years after its construction, and which, on describing Ramiro I, states that ''"(...)he built many constructions, two miles away from Oviedo, with sandstone and marble in a vaulted work: (...) He also made (...), a palace without wood, of admirable construction and vaulted below and above,...".''

What marvelled the chroniclers for so many centuries were its proportions and slender shapes, its rich, varied decoration and the introduction ofelongated barrel vaults thanks to the transverse 
arches, allowing support and eliminating wooden ceilings. This solution, timidly advanced in the Holy Chamber, fully matured in Santa Maria del Naranco.

The palace, on a rectangular ground plan, has two floors; the lower level, or [[crypt]], quite low, has a central chamber and another two located on either side. The upper floor is accessed via a double exterior stairway adjoining the facade, leading into an identical layout as the lower floor; a central or noble hall with six blind semicircular arches along the walls, supported by columns built into the wall, and a mirador at each end. These are accessed via three arches, similar to those onto the wall, resting on columns with helicoidal rope moulding, typical of Pre-Romanesque. The barrel vault is made from tufa stone, and is held up by six transverso arches resting on consoles.

Santa Maria del Naranco represented a step forward from a decorative point of view by enriching the habitual standards and modeis with elements from painting, gold work and the textile arts. The rich decoration is concentrated in the hall and miradors of the upper floor, where it is especially worth noting the cubic-prismatic capitals (of [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] influence), decorated with reliefs framed by [[Rope|cord]] decoration (from local tradition) in trapezoid and triangular shapes, inside which there are sculpted forms of animals and humans. This kind of motif is repeated on the disks with central medallions located above the blind arches' intersections. The 32 medallions distributed around the building are similar in size and shape, varying the decorative designs and the interior figures (quadrupeds, birds, bunches of grapes, fantastic animáis), a style inherited from the Visigoth period, in turn descended from Byzantine tradition.

The medallions have decorative bands above them, again framed by rope moulding, inside which four figures are scuipted and arranged symmetrically; the upper two carrying loads on their heads and the lower two representing soldiers on horseback carrying swords. These figures seem to have some kind of symbolic social meaning; the warriors who defend and support the men of prayer (here offeres),or alternatively, the royal and ecclesiastic orders complementing each other.

Santa María del Naranco shows other, equally beautiful and important sculptural elements; for the first time, a Greek cross appears sculpted as emblem of the Asturian monarchy, at the same time protecting the building from all evil, something which was to become habitual in the popular architecture of towns and villages. Other sculptural elements, such as the capitals of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] inspiration on the miradors' triple-arched Windows or the altar stone in the eastern mirador (originally from the neighbouring Church of San Miguel de Liño/Lillo), make this palace the most distinctive building in Pre-Romanesque, a singularity highlighted by being the only palace complex that has lasted until the present day with both Visigothic and [[Carolingian]] court structures.

[[File:San Miguel de Lillo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|San Miguel de Lillo]]
The church of '''[[San Miguel de Lillo]]''' was consecrated by Ramiro I and his wife Paterna in the year 848. It was originally dedicated to [[St. Mary]] until, as mentioned above (and shown by the altar located in the eastern mirador of santa María del Naranco), this worship passed to the nearby palace in the 12th century, leaving this church dedicated to St. Michael.
[[File:San Miguel de Lillo plan.svg|thumb|right|100px|Ground plan]] It originally had a basilica ground plan, three aisles with a barrel vault, although part of the original structure has disappeared as the building fell into decay during the 12th or 13th century. Nowadays, it conserves its western half from that period, together with several elements in the rest of the church such as the fantastic jambs in the vestibule or the extraordinary [[latticework|lattice]] on the window of the southern wall, sculpted from one single piece of stone.

The last of the churches from this period is [[Santa Cristina de Lena]]''' ''', located in the [[Lena, Asturias|Lena]] district, about 25&amp;nbsp;km south of Oviedo, on an old Roman road that joined the lands of the [[plateau]] with Asturias. The church has a different ground plan to Pre-Romanesque´s traditional basilica. It is a single rectangular space with a barrel vault, with four adjoining structures located in the centre of each facade. The first of these annexes is the typical Austrian Pre-Romanesque vestibule, with a royal tribune on the upper part, accessed via a stairway joined to one of the walls. To the east is the enclosure with the [[altar]], with a single apse, foregoing the traditional Asturian pre-romanesque triple apse, and going back to Visigoth influences. To the north and south respectively, there are two other enclosures through semicircular arches and barrel vaults, whose use was associated with the Hispano-Visigothic liturgy practised in Spain up to the 11th century.

One of the most particular elements of Santa Cristina de Lena is the existence of the presbytery elevated above floor level in the last section of the central nave, separated from the area intended for the congregation by three arches on marble columns. This separation,
which appears in other Asturian churches, is not repeated in any other with a similar structure. Both the lattices over the arches and the wall enclosing the central arch were re-used from Visigothic origins in the 7th century.

On the outside of the church, it is worth noting the large number of buttresses (32) which seem in some cases to have a merely aesthetic function. Nearby this church is the Asturian Pre-Romanesque Information Centre, located in the old Norte de la Cobertoria Railway Station.

===Fourth period (866 to 910)===
This comprises the reign of Alfonso III, who came to the throne at the age of 18, on the death of his father, Ordoño I, marking the zenith of the kingdom of Asturias. Expansion against Islam led him to conquer [[Oporto]] and [[Coimbra]] in present-day [[Portugal]], and he pushed the borders of the kingdom as far as the [[Mondego River|Mondego]], repopulating [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]], [[Simancas]], [[Toro, Zamora|Toro]] and the whole area known as [[Campos Góticos]]. The idea of the Asturian kingdom as a 
continuation of the Visigoths in Toledo was fully assumed, involving the obligation to re-conquer all the territory occupied by Muslims. This idea was reflected in the historical chronicles, such as the [[Codex Vigilanus|Crónica Albeldense]], written in Oviedo in the year 881, which tells the history of the Gothic kingdom (Ordo Gentis gothorum), followed by the Asturian monarchy (''Ordo Gothorum Obetensium fíegnum'')T he kingdom's moment of expansion and maturity was also reflected in a cultural revitalisation promoted from the court, involving architectural and artistic renewal.

The kingdom's progressive expansion and increasing power also kindled the ambition of Alfonso III's three sons ([[García I of León|García I]], [[Ordoño II]] and [[Fruela II]]), who, encouraged by a number of noblemen, dispossessed the king and confined him in the town of Boiges (Boides valley, present-day Valdediós). Even so, they allowed him to lead a final campaign against the Muslims in Zamora, where he was victorious once more. He died on his return, in December of the year 910. Described in the chronicles as ''"Great King and Emperor"'' (Magnus Imperatore ImpemtorNoster),the king who had achieved the kingdom's greatest expansion and consolidation since it was founded by Pelayo, could not prevent his since from splitting it into three parts, [[Asturias]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Castile-León]], meaning the disappearance of the kingdom of Asturias.

San Salvador de Valdediós and Santo Adriano de Tuñón are the two churches built by this monarch, in addition to the [[La Foncalada|Foncalada fountain]] (''fonte incalata'') in the centre of Oviedo, and the already-mentioned gold artefacts of the [[Victory Cross]] and the [[Agate box]].
[[File:SanSalvadorValdedios-1.jpg|left|thumb|San Salvador de Valdediós [[monastery]]]]
The [[Church of San Salvador de Valdediós]] stands in the Boides valley ([[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]]), the place where Alfonso III was detained when he was dispossessed by his sons, and where there used to be an old convent governed by the Benedictine Order, substituted in the 13th century by the Cistercians. The church known as the "Bishops' Chapel" was consecrated on September 16, 893, with seven bishops in attendance, and stands on a classic basilica ground plan with a triple sanctuary, separating the central nave from the side aisles with four semicircular arches.
At the western end, there are three enclosures, the central one used as an access vestibule, and two located on the left and right which may have been used to house pilgrims. The vault over the central nave, like the one over the apses, is barrelled with a brick ceiling and decorated with al fresco wall painting, alternating a variety of geometric designs.[[File:San Salvador de Valdediós plan.svg|thumb|right|100px|Valdediós ground plan]]

The royal tribune is located above the vestibule, separate from the area intended for the congregation (''spatium fidelium'') in the central nave, and this from the area devoted to the liturgy by iron grilles, now disappeared. Particular elements of this church include the covered gallery annexed to the southern facade at a later date or Royal Portico, the 50&amp;nbsp;cm square columns on the central naves arches, the triple-arched window open in the central apse, and the room above it, exclusively accessed from the exterior by a window which here has two openings, compared with the habitual three.

The [[Church of Santo Adriano de Tuñón]] is located on the bank of the River Trubia, next to an old Roman road. Founded on January 24, 891, it stands on a classic basilica ground plan, although in the 17th and 18th centuries it was extended with a nave structure at the western end, and a bell gable. The al fresco paintings in this church are the only remains of Mozarabic painters' work in an Asturian art workshop.

Finally, the [[La Foncalada|Foncalada fountain]], the only upper medieval civil construction conserved in Spain, was built on the outside of Oviedo city walls, with stone blocks and an intersecting roof, barrel vault and rectangular ground plan. The intersection of the roof is topped with a triangular pediment, sculpted with the Victory Cross, characteristic of Alfonso III, under which runs the typical inscription of the kingdom of Asturias: 
{{cquote|{{allcaps|Hoc signo tvetvr pivs, hoc signo vincitvr inimicvs}}}}

===Fifth period (910 to 925)===
With Alfonso III dead and the kingdom of Asturias divided among his sons, Asturian Pre-Romanesque entered its last stage with two constructions. The first of them is the [[Church of San Salvador de Priesca]] (a few kilometres from Valdediós), consecrated on September 24, 921, which has the architectural and decorative reference of the model laid down by Santullano, and not subsequent works. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it underwent several reconstructions, altering especially the structures adjoining the vestibule, by communicating them with the side aisles.

The [[Church of Santiago de Gobiendes]], located near [[Colunga]], next to the sea and the [[Sueve mountain range]], is the last of the Pre-Romanesque churches, and like the previous one, follows the Santullano construction model. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it underwent significant reform, altering the entrance, facade, main and side chapels.

{{About|the film crew position|the documentary film|Best Boy (film)}}
In a [[film crew]] there are two kinds of '''best boy''':  '''best boy electric''' and '''best boy grip'''. They are assistants to their department heads, the [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] (in charge of electricals) and the [[key grip]] (lighting and rigging), respectively.&lt;ref name="Taub153"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gaffers, Grips, and Best Boys |last=Taub |first=Eric |year=1994 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-11276-9 |page=153 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the best boy acts as the [[Construction foreman|foreman]] for his department. A woman who performs the duties of a best boy may be called '''best girl'''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Being Human (North American TV series)|Being Human]]'' end credits, for example&lt;/ref&gt;

== Job responsibilities ==
Best boys  are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the lighting or grip department. Their many responsibilities include the hiring, scheduling, and management of crew; the renting, ordering, inventory, and returning of equipment; workplace safety and maintaining discipline within their department; completing timecards and other paperwork; stocking of expendables; loading and unloading production trucks; planning and implementing the lighting or rigging of locations and/or sound stages; coordinating with rigging crews and additional photography units (if applicable); handling relations with the other production departments; overseeing the application of union rules (where relevant); and serving as the day-to-day representative of the department with the [[unit production manager]] and coordinator of their department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeskillset.org/film/jobs/lighting/article_3893_2.asp|title=Film job profiles/best boy|publisher=creativeskillset.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best boy also commonly accompanies or stands in for the key grip or gaffer during technical scouts. During shooting, the best boy may also cover for the key grip or gaffer when he or she is on break or otherwise away from the set.

On films with very small crews, the electric (lighting) department often consists of only a gaffer, a best boy, and a few [[lighting technician#Film lighting technician|electrician]]s. The grip department may include only a key grip, a best boy, and a few [[grip (job)|grip]]s. Large-scale productions such as [[Major film studio|major]] films commonly include full-time rigging and [[second unit]] crews, and in total may hire many dozens of grips or electricians at one time.

== Etymology ==
It's unclear why this term came to be used as a job title on film sets. As OED says, "It has been suggested that it originated as a term for a master's most able apprentice, or alternatively that it was transferred from earlier use for a member of a ship's crew, but confirmatory evidence for either of these theories appears to be lacking."{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The earliest known appearance of the phrase in print is 1931 from the ''Albuquerque Journal'': "Among the electricians .. the department head is the gaffer, his first assistant is the best boy."{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

As the gaffer is sometimes credited as the chief lighting technician, the best boy electric is sometimes credited as the '''assistant chief lighting technician'''.

The title is accepted for use in credits by the BBC.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/production/credit-guidelines.shtml|title=Full Credit Guidance|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end credits of the 1980 comedy film ''[[Airplane!]]'' named the Best Boy, then the next line was "Worst Boy", naming [[Adolf Hitler]] in that position.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/crazycredits.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage outside English ==
Many [[French language]] films made in [[Canada]] use ''Best Boy'' in the credits. The term has been known to appear in the credits of some French films made in [[France]], but it has not been known to appear in [[Belgium|Belgian]] or [[Switzerland|Swiss]] films.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

The [[Germany|German]] film ''Auf der anderen Seite'' (''[[The Edge of Heaven (film)|The Edge of Heaven]]''), which takes place in [[Germany]] and [[Turkey]], uses the term ''Best Boy'' in its German credits. German TV and film crews regularly use the term, because no equivalent phrase exists in German.

Aisha was featured on the August 2010 cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, and in the corresponding article, "Afghan Women and the Return of the Taliban."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Aryn |title=Afghan Women and the Return of the Taliban |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2007238,00.html |accessdate=27 November 2010 |newspaper=''[[Time (magazine)]]'' |date=29 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s2Dybv1t?url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2007238,00.html |archivedate=2010-08-16 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover image generated enormous controversy.&lt;ref name=AOL&gt;{{cite news|title=Disfigured Afghan on Cover of Time Heads to US|url=http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/disfigured-afghan-on-cover-of-time-heads-to-us/19582078|accessdate=27 November 2010|newspaper=[[AOL News]]|date=5 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022124150/http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/disfigured-afghan-on-cover-of-time-heads-to-us/19582078|archivedate=22 October 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image and the accompanying cover title, "What Happens if We Leave Afghanistan," fueled debate about the merits of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nordland |first=Ron |title=Portrait of Pain Ignites Debate Over Afghan War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/world/asia/05afghan.html?src=mv|accessdate=27 November 2010|newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in the United States ==
Shortly after ''Time'''s cover ran in August 2010, Aisha was flown to the United States to receive free [[reconstructive surgery]].&lt;ref name="AOL"/&gt; After arriving in [[California]], she psychologically regressed into performing fake seizures, tantrums, and [[self-harm]] that required hospitalization. Surgeons concluded that she was not "emotionally prepared" to handle the patient responsibilities in the reconstructive surgery process, and her psychologist diagnosed her with [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/05/world/saving.aesha/?hpt=hp_c2 | work=CNN | title=Saving Aesha}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her reconstructive surgery was delayed, she was taken in by the [[Women for Afghan Women]] shelter in [[Queens, New York]], but she caused many problems for the staff and other residents, including roommates hired by the shelter to live with her.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt; Aisha's condition improved with a change in medications, and the seizures stopped.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt;

Later, Aisha's psychological condition improved enough that she was able to cease taking medications to control her behavior. Starting in 2012, preparations to do a multistage facial reconstruction for Aisha began.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt; Her forehead was expanded over the course of several months to provide enough tissue to build a new nose. The structure for her new nose was built using cartilage from her own body and tissue from her left hand was also used for the inner lining.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt; Aisha underwent a total of 12 completed surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRAokVK_R2w Video chronicling her surgery by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (Nov 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[ABC News]] revisited Aisha and revealed her new nose that has altered her appearance. Aisha has been adopted by an Afghan-American couple, and lives in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBeakiLzNY "Meet Aesha, a Symbol of Strength and Triumph" ABC News video (July 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=American Society of Plastic Surgeons ASPS|title=Patients of Courage {{!}} Bibi Aisha|date=2014-11-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRAokVK_R2w|accessdate=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studies English and mathematics and aspires to be a police officer.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt;

[[File:Palazzo Ducale - Venice Art - Etching Collagraph.jpg|thumb|350px|a collagraph printed by re-using materials from the atelier: tarlatan, carborundum, sandpaper, and thread (Noemí Carrau Gual)]]

'''Carborundum Mezzotint''' is a [[printmaking]] technique in which the image is created by adding light passages to a dark field. It is a relatively new process invented in the US during the 1930s by Hubert Mesibov, Michael J. Gallagher, and [[Dox Thrash]], an artist working in Philadelphia with the WPA&lt;ref name="King-Hammond"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King-Hammond|first1=Leslie|title=Black Printmakers and the WPA|url=http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/vpadvance/artgallery/gallery/wpa/essay1.htm|website=Black Printmakers and the WPA|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). "Carborundum Collagraph" [[collagraph]] is a different printmaking technique, invented in 1952 by Henri Goetz, an American abstract artist living in Paris. The carborundum mezzotint uses the grits to create pits below the surface of the metal that then hold ink, like traditional mezzotint. The carborundum collagraph creates the image above the surface of the matrix, which does not have to be metal. In one method, the grits are mixed into a paste using an acrylic base that is painted onto the matrix, creating the image much like painting. Once dried, this holds the ink; the wiping and printing are done the same as etching. The techniques described following and below are alternatives to the paste mixture technique, yet all are creating the image above the surface of the matrix. Carbordundum collagraph allows artists to work on a large scale. Normally, [[Paperboard|cardboard]] or [[wood]] plates are coated in a layer of [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] or [[Screen printing|screen]], and the lights are created by filling in the texture with screen filler or glue. [[Carborundum prints]] may be printed as [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] plates.  

Carborundum was originally used by printmakers to grind down [[lithography]] stones and is now used in collagraph prints to create gradients of tone and a sandy texture. It works because when the carborundum adheres to the plate the ink sits around it. It can be applied in a number of different ways:

*Painting onto the plate with a liquid glue and then sprinkling the carborundum onto it
*Mixing different amounts of glue with it and then painting them on in sections, the more grit used the darker. Example: one spoon of carborundum to five spoons of glue will be much lighter than five spoons of carborundum to five spoons of glue.
*Using [[stencil]]s to apply the glue and sprinkling different amounts of carborundum through the different stencils.

To print a [[carborundum print]], the surface is covered in ink, and then the surface is wiped clean with ''[[tarlatan]]'' cloth or newspaper, leaving ink only in the texture of the screen or [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]].  A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper.  Very large editions are not possible as a small amount of carborundum comes off every time it is wiped down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/decode/pdfs/2.exhibition.pdf| title = Exhibition reviews| accessdate = 2009-06-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Contrast with [[relief print]]ing, and with [[planographic printing]] techniques such as [[lithography]].

'''Castello di Vicarello''' is a medieval [[castle]] in [[Cinigiano]], [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The complex was built in the thirteenth century as part of the [[Republic of Siena]], and became an important defensive structure. It was sold in the middle of the fifteenth century to the lords of [[Castello di Cotone]], who also owned part of nearby [[Castello della Sabatina]]. During the [[Renaissance]] period, redevelopment work was carried out that led to the overlapping of newer stylistic elements with the existing medieval ones. In the mid-sixteenth century, the castle became part of the territory administered by the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], and remained in private ownership. Restorations were completed at the end of the twentieth century.

==Current==
The castle is currently operated as a hotel and farm. One of the two original stone square towers is well-preserved. The buildings that make up the complex are organized around an inner courtyard, which is accessed through an archway; the walls are completely covered in stone. Not far from the castle was an old church, now deconsecrated and used as a private residence, which is recognizable by its bell tower.

'''Cat play and toys''' incorporates predatory games of "play aggression". [[Cat]]s' behaviors when playing are similar to hunting behaviors. These activities allow kittens and younger cats to grow and acquire cognitive and [[motor skills]], and to [[socialize]] with other cats. Cat play behavior can be either solitary (with toys or other objects) or social (with animals and people). They can play with a multitude of toys ranging from strings, to small furry toys resembling what would be prey (e.g. mice), to plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;ASPCA. Animal Behavior Center. "Play aggression".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabor2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Tabor|title=Understanding Cat Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-PDwgJHVS8C&amp;pg=PA67|date=30 April 2003|publisher=David &amp; Charles|isbn=0-7153-1589-7|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining object play ==
Object play for animals (in this case, cats) is the use of inanimate objects by the animal to express play behaviour. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jkiTQ8dIIHsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=cat+play+behaviour+and+toys&amp;ots=08zc2X7z7u&amp;sig=KA3ewyI75AWt7asz0ZdeS9KcGTg#v=onepage&amp;q=cat%20play%20behaviour%20and%20toys&amp;f=false|title=Animal Play: Evolutionary, Comparative and Ecological Perspectives|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|last2=Byers|first2=John A.|date=1998-06-04|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521586566|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of pet domestic cats, humans normally provide them with purchased, human-made toys such as toy mice. When it comes to non-domestic, wild cats, they may use several objects in the wilderness as their toys including sticks, leaves, rocks, feathers, etc. Actions that cats may carry out as this play behaviour include throwing the toy object, chasing, biting, capturing, etc. as they might do with a real source of prey. Engaging in object play helps young cats to practice these skills that they need as they grow into adults.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Nature of play==

=== Play in kittens ===
Play in cats is a behaviour that is brought about during growth from the kitten stage onward. Some important aspects of this play behaviour for the development of kittens in to adult cats include motor development, social behaviour and cognitive development. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendoza|first=Diana, L.|last2=Ramirez|first2=J. Martin|date=1987|title=Play in kittens (felis domesticus) and its association with cohesion and aggression|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2FBF03330067.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|volume=25 (1)|pages=27-30|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are different types of play that develop at different stages during the development and growth of a kitten. The first play behaviours observed in kittens include things like approaching, pawing and holding onto each other. Following this stage in their development, kittens begin to show an interest in inanimate objects and prey behaviour. This is the development of their nonsocial behaviour in which they become more independent and begin to practice predatory/hunting behaviour. Play behaviour in kittens is also important in providing them with physical exercise as they are growing, as well as providing a means of interacting with other members of their litter to keep strong social bonds among them. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Meredith|date=1974|title=Social play in the domestic cat|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/14-1-427.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAiowggImBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggIXMIICEwIBADCCAgwGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMsVDNXzipXXmwpeLNAgEQgIIB3UakpGb4PwGuLER5eb3AfDS8oVddvKgZJcG2SfpEePTxhXQ3rUbDZ_4mn1XQkbZMBD5AAR9qUlujggP7sdJWQrrJ1xMAr7TZSu9_UD-9V_NkCWCQANMywWVlV4I44n7syYvCTtJgZcVkkW2S2578udMGqId88ZeKOFvGTKgmGSzUyVnE-LqdGcxsnem_1mtTL5ZQS9NMHiftNRi81zFwXJ8CG4MiMUxduxvo3sIQel2tSZuZcn_594bNZMkJdp9uGlzDHtxHSsHAdcWhIlkBugB8ozw3LvgxmTRzxU9ZsNrtsnci0_qnpvRSFuUOw5qLBmnSEJlPKH1o6YLf21AtZdfdhCGZv1qPso4CJh6755xEybPFzI2Iu23R2cYwwhGAYwg4vN4U_FDIpz38JzeI8VSMhL7IKFgwnG5gUEMW5DtShUaMbqN05kjRZUvAkBLzjzPHYFi5J82KPMWdvl_XRvzFASEfVTC8RT71YXVxgwEH8NjPoDaW7mupoqrHIEW5yzBV5Bdw4ZMMjbevwN9ghoqG9QcKDzNOPupn3sOKbvHERRhEO81pTNQZ-1AmmoVWtkXsqdEYeO8JXYhxJErocDcOLJutHln06D-tzw5SNPkX0cYrUKJcYLebJIYu0g|journal=American Zoology|volume=14|pages=427-436|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social play is important between litter-mates since this is the main source of play for kittens in early life with little alternative to other means of play. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Kittens are limited in room for exploring for other means of play, so engaging in this social play behaviour is important until they have access to other play objects such as toys. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Predation===
[[File:Predatorycat ubt.jpeg|thumb|Predation]]
Since cats are meat-eating [[Predation|predators]], nearly all cat games are predatory games.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Bradshaw 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Predation|Prey]] are fearful of predators. Predators often encounter prey that attempt to escape predation. Prey that move towards the cat with confidence may be exhibiting an aggressive defensive posture. Cats often play with [[toy]]s that behave more like fearful prey trying to escape than toys that mimic more confrontational prey.

===Success rate===
Success rate is important in play. A cat that catches its prey every time soon gets bored, and a cat that never gets it just loses interest. The ideal hunting success rate is around 1 in 3 to 1 in 6. Capturing prey at this rate generally maximises a cat's interest in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precautions===
Play is about predatory behaviour, and a highly excited cat can cause minor injuries in the excitement of the moment. With most cats, it is wise to keep playthings at least 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8") away from fingers or eyes and avoid encouraging a cat to eat inedible toys. If playing with a human's bare hands, a cat will generally resist using its claws or biting too hard, but a cat that becomes extremely excited may accidentally inflict injuries to its human playmate in the form of light scratches or small puncture wounds from biting too hard. Cats' claws and mouths can contain bacteria that can lead to infection, so it is wise to clean and treat any wounds with an antiseptic solution and seek professional medical services if there is reason to believe that the wound has become infected.

===Food===
Catching and [[eating]] are two closely related but separate activities. Domestic cats often store caught [[food]] for eating later. Eating happens when the game is over, so incorporating food into hunting games tends to end the interest in play. Hidden treats helps engage cat's senses such as sense of smell and can be a form of play which enables them to utilize their searching skills. This idea of treats linked with play helps cats form the association that treats signify happy behaviour.

== Defining motor aspects of play ==
There are several different motor patterns associated with the play behaviour of cats and they have different roles in the social context. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Meredith|date=1974|title=Social play in the domestic cat|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/14-1-427.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAiowggImBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggIXMIICEwIBADCCAgwGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMsVDNXzipXXmwpeLNAgEQgIIB3UakpGb4PwGuLER5eb3AfDS8oVddvKgZJcG2SfpEePTxhXQ3rUbDZ_4mn1XQkbZMBD5AAR9qUlujggP7sdJWQrrJ1xMAr7TZSu9_UD-9V_NkCWCQANMywWVlV4I44n7syYvCTtJgZcVkkW2S2578udMGqId88ZeKOFvGTKgmGSzUyVnE-LqdGcxsnem_1mtTL5ZQS9NMHiftNRi81zFwXJ8CG4MiMUxduxvo3sIQel2tSZuZcn_594bNZMkJdp9uGlzDHtxHSsHAdcWhIlkBugB8ozw3LvgxmTRzxU9ZsNrtsnci0_qnpvRSFuUOw5qLBmnSEJlPKH1o6YLf21AtZdfdhCGZv1qPso4CJh6755xEybPFzI2Iu23R2cYwwhGAYwg4vN4U_FDIpz38JzeI8VSMhL7IKFgwnG5gUEMW5DtShUaMbqN05kjRZUvAkBLzjzPHYFi5J82KPMWdvl_XRvzFASEfVTC8RT71YXVxgwEH8NjPoDaW7mupoqrHIEW5yzBV5Bdw4ZMMjbevwN9ghoqG9QcKDzNOPupn3sOKbvHERRhEO81pTNQZ-1AmmoVWtkXsqdEYeO8JXYhxJErocDcOLJutHln06D-tzw5SNPkX0cYrUKJcYLebJIYu0g|journal=American Zoology|volume=14|pages=427-436|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Pouncing is one of these motor patterns in which it is used to initiate play through physical contact. Chasing and horizontal leaping is an example of a motor pattern that may be used by a cat to end play. The movement of a cat's tail during play and the varying rates at which the cat may move its tail can even be a useful indicator of its level of playfulness. There are patterns of belly-up and stand-up actions that are engaged in by kittens in which seem to show that they prefer to engage in physical contact play in terms of their social role among other kittens.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Influence of hunger on cat behaviour ==
Hunger has been shown to give an increase in intensity in the play behaviour of cats, and a decrease in fear which they show towards larger-sized toys. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/science/article/pii/S0168159197001366|title=Memorial University Libraries - Proxy Login|website=www-sciencedirect-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect that hunger has on play behaviour may be attributed to how experienced of a hunter the cat is. It is not expected that a cat who has a higher level of hunting experience would show this increased intensity of their play behaviour when hungry. Instead, they are more likely to show more predatory behaviour. In the case of cats with a lower level of hunting experience, they show this increased play behaviour since they are not able to engage in actual predatory activities and instead show predatory behaviours towards toys when hungry as an experienced hunter would show towards actual prey when hungry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">'''Chinese pigments''' ({{zh|t=中國國畫傳統顏料}}) are the traditional medium to execute [[Chinese painting|traditional Chinese brush paintings]], besides [[inkstick|ink]]. Chinese pigments is similar to Western [[gouache]] paint in that it contains more glue than [[watercolours]], but more so than gouache. The high glue content makes the pigment bind better to Chinese paper and silk as well as enabling works of art to survive the wet-mounting process of Chinese [[hanging scroll]] mountings without smudging or bleeding.

==Types==
Traditionally, Chinese pigments come in form of chips, cakes or powder made from natural plant and minerals. Some of these require preparation by adding glue (明膠) before they can be used. Traditional pigments require some skill and knowledge to mix as some pigments do not blend well with others (e.g. herbal and stone colours generally do not combine well). Also, layering a different pigment on top of another can create different effects depending on the type and transparency of the upper layer pigment. 

Synthetic versions that already contain glue come in tubes and are more convenient.

==Traditional colours==
Out of the many pigments used for traditional colours, around 12 are basic colours that are widely used. Some of the pigments use natural plant ('herbal') or minerals ('stone') that are poisonous or toxic. Outside of these traditional pigments, other colours are made from synthetic chemicals. 

===Reds===
*[[Cinnabar]] powder (硃砂粉). Basic stone colour. Requires glue. 
*[[Vermilion]] cake (朱膘膏). Basic stone colour.
*Vermilion powder (銀朱粉). Essentially, a synthetic form of [[mercury sulfide]], more brilliant than traditional vermilion made from ground cinnabar. 
*[[Eosin]] red cake (曙紅膏). Basic herbal colour. It is now used in replacement of traditional carmine. 
*[[Carmine]] powder (洋紅粉). Very expensive, it is now replaced with substitutes. 
*[[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge]] (胭脂). Basic herbal colour. Usually comes in cream form. 
*[[Scarlet (color)|Scarlet]] cake (大紅膏). Synthetic colour. 
*[[Dark red]] cake (深紅膏). Synthetic colour.

===Blues===
*[[Azurite]] (石青). Basic stone colour. Comes in four shades, from dark to light: 頭青, 二青, 三青, 四青. Requires glue. 
*[[Indigo]] cake (花青膏). Basic herbal colour. 
*[[Phthalocyanine Blue BN|Phthalocyanine blue]]/[[cyanine]] (酞菁藍). Basic synthetic colour.
*[[Azure (color)|Azure]] cake (天[蘭/藍]膏). Basic synthetic colour. 

===Yellows===
All traditional yellow pigments are toxic. Because of this, modern synthetic substitutes are often used. 

*[[Gamboge]] (藤黃). Basic herbal colour. Comes in flakes or stick form. 
*[[Chrome yellow]] cake (鉻黃膏). Stone colour. 
*[[Realgar]] (雄黃). Stone colour. Requires glue. 
*[[Orpiment]] (雌黃). Stone colour. Requires glue. 
*[[Litharge]]/[[Lead monoxide]] (密陀僧). Synthetic colour. Requires glue.
*[[Gold]] powder (金粉). Requires glue.

===Greens===
*[[Malachite]] (石綠). Basic stone colour. Comes in four shades, from dark to light: 頭綠, 二綠, 三綠, 四綠. Requires glue.
*[[Jadeite]] powder (碧玉粉). Stone colour. Requires glue.

===Browns===
*[[Ochre]]/[[burnt sienna]] cake (赭石膏). Basic stone colour.
*Burnt [[umber]] (焦茶). Herbal colour. Requires glue.

===Whites===
In modern practice, painters tend to use white [[gouache]] paint as a substitute to traditional whites, typically for underpainting.

*[[Clam]] shell cake (蛤白膏). Made of ground white clam shells. 
*[[Calcite]] powder (白方解). Stone colour. Requires glue.
*[[Titanium white]] (鈦白). Modern synthetic colour. Appears in modern sets of tube colours.
*[[Zinc white]] (鋅白). Modern synthetic colour. Sometimes called Chinese white. Appears in old sets of tube colours.
*[[Lead white]] (鉛白). Synthetic colour. Traditionally used in the past. Comes in flakes or powder form. 
*[[Mother of pearl]] powder (雲母粉). Requires glue.
*[[Silver]] powder (銀粉). Requires glue.

===Blacks===
*[[Ink]] (墨). From ground inksticks made of pine, oil, lacquer or charcoal soot.
*[[Obsidian]] (岩黑). Requires glue.
*[[Black]] (黑). Synthetic pigment from tubes.

The '''Church of the Holy Crucifix''' (or ''church of Saint Francis of Paola'') is a [[Catholic church]] in [[Alcamo]], in the [[province of Trapani]].

There is the ''[[Confraternity]] of the Most Holy [[Crucifix]]'', which in 1565 got the benefit of ''[[Fiera Franca]]'' from the [[count of Modica]].&lt;ref name=tra&gt;http://www.trapaniplus.it/schedacosedavedere.php?cosadavedere=146&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjoining the church there was the ''Friary of saint [[Francis of Paola]]''.

==Foundation==
It was founded in 1550 in the name of the Most Holy Crucifix by the nobleman [[Pietro Tabone]], grandfather of the poet [[Sebastiano Bagolino]]’s, who was buried in this Church.&lt;ref name=tra/&gt;
In 1542 Tabone, after his request, had a piece of land by the municipality in order to build a [[Chapel]] dedicated to the Most Holy Crucifix, [[patron saint]] of the town at that time.

==History==
The small chapel was built in 1550, without any consent by the [[Bishop of Mazara del Vallo]]; it was approved only two years after its construction.  Tabone had the right to enlarge, pull down and rebuilt it, besides he could nominate the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] and found a [[Confraternity]] of the Most Holy Crucifix.&lt;ref name=parr&gt;"Parrocchia san Francesco di Paola"&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1575 there was a terrible [[Plague (disease)|plague]]: the population in Alcamo, about 7,700, was cut in half, according to the historian [[Ignazio De Blasi]] and a lot of people were buried in the cemetery [[Sant'Ippolito]], in the western suburb. 
As the old hospitals of ''San Vito'' and ''Santo Spirito'' were not sufficient to receive so many plague victims, they set up a new one in the same street of the Chapel.

Owing to their economic difficulties which did not allow to complete the Church, in 1596 the administrators of the Confraternity decided to assign the Church to the [[Order of Minims]] of Saint Francis of Paola. In 1608 the Minims accepted the donation and built the adjoining [[friary]] which they maintained until 1866;  since 1870 it hosted the Royal [[Gimnasium]], and,  after 1870, the [[Civic Hospital]].
[[File:Interni della chiesa di San Francesco di Paola (Alcamo) 02.jpg|thumb|Interior of the church]]

The Minim Fathers distinguished themselves both for their religious activity and for the [[social engagement]] for the quarter;  in 1780 forty-five priests from Alcamo signed a request to king [[Ferdinand III of Sicily|Ferdinand III]] asking not to suppress the friary, as it had happened to other religious orders some years before. The [[cloister]] was not closed, but after the [[Unification of Italy]], [[Vittorio Emanuele II]], [[king of Italy]], abolished all religious orders and their properties were seized. 
Finally in 1926 the Church became a [[parish]], dedicated to [[saint Francis of Paola]].

==Works==

The [[façade]], dated 1695,  has a convex form, a typical characteristic of [[Rococo Style]].
The church is with one [[nave]] and has five altars; in 1750 it was embellished with [[stucco]]es by [[Nicolò Curti]].

Inside it there the following works:
[[File:Statua di San Francesco di Paola (Alcamo) 01.jpg|thumb|Altar of saint Francis of Paola]]
On the high altar: the [[Crucifix]], a [[wooden]] sculpture made in the 19th century, made by [[Francesco Marino]] from [[Trapani]].

On the left side:
* The [[Holy Trinity]] (by an unknown author), with the two [[San Cosma e Damiano|saints Cosma e Damiano]], [[Saint Rosalia]] and [[Saint Francis of Sales]] (1750), first canvas on the right side of the chapel
* [[Our Lady of Fatima]], a recent [[wooden]] statue 
* [[Saint Blaise]], by an unknown author of the 18th century, coming from the [[Church of the Annunciation (Alcamo)|Church of the Annunciation]] 
* The [[Holy Heart of Jesus]] (Sacro Cuore di Gesù), a wooden statue, placed in 1921

On the right side:
* [[Our Lady of Miracles]] (Madonna dei Miracoli), with Saint Francis of Paola and Saint Francis of Sales (1750), made by an unknown author
* [[Saint Francis of Paola]], a [[wooden]] statue, probable work of [[Filippo Quattrocchi]] from [[Gangi, Sicily|Gangi]] (18th century)
* [[Saint Anne]], a wooden statue (end of the 19th century) which has replaced a ruined painting made in 1618 by [[Giuseppe Carrera]]
* The [[Immaculate]], a recent [[plaster cast]] statue
* [[Saint Vitus]], a wooden statue made in 1848
* A [[holy water stoup]], carved in 1606 by [[Giuseppe Foti]]: at the church entrance.
On the nave walls there are four old paintings, by an unknown author and with stucco frames, representing some episodes of Saint Francis of Paola’s life:
* The miracle happened during the building of the friary at [[Paternò Calabro]] ([[province of Cosenza]]) in 1454: two workers had died owing to a [[landslide]] and were resurrected by the Saint (the first on the right).&lt;ref name=parr/&gt;
* The wonderful miracle of the fish made by saint Francis of Paola (the second painting on the right)
* A nobleman's family presents their baby without eyes and mouth; once again saint Francis makes an extraordinary miracle (first painting on the left wall);
* The conversion of the [[King of Naples]], due to the Saint (second painting on the left).
* The founding of the Hebraic Easter ([[book of Exodus]]), on the right wall of the chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament;
* The banquet given by [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] to two Angels ([[book of Genesis]]), a painting on the left wall in the same chapel;

In the sacristy:
* The [[Crucifix]] made in mistura, by [[Giovanni Matinati]] (1550)
* [[Saint Lucy]], a 17th-century statue by an unknown author;
* [[Saint Expeditus]], a recent statue

{{Denmark culture}}
'''Danish Design''' is a style of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]] design and architecture that was developed in mid-20th century. Influenced by the German [[Bauhaus]] school, many [[Danish people|Danish]] designers used the new industrial technologies, combined with ideas of simplicity and functionalism to design buildings, furniture and household objects, many of which have become iconic and are still in use and  production. Prominent examples are the [[Egg (chair)|Egg chair]], the [[PH lamp]]s and the [[Sydney Opera House]] (Australia).

== Designers ==
Among the most successful designers associated with the concept are [[Børge Mogensen]] (1914–72), [[Finn Juhl]] (1912–89), [[Hans Wegner]] (1914–2007), [[Arne Jacobsen]] (1902–71), [[Poul Kjærholm]] (1929–80), [[Poul Henningsen]] (1894–1967) and [[Verner Panton]] (1926–98).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=About Denmark |url=http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Danish-Design-Architecture/?gclid=CNTh1cyYx5cCFQVMtAod-yYBRw |contribution=Danish Design and Architecture |publisher=Denmark |accessdate=17 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520092331/http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Danish-Design-Architecture/?gclid=CNTh1cyYx5cCFQVMtAod-yYBRw |archivedate=20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other designers of note include [[Kristian Solmer Vedel]] (1923–2003) in the area of industrial design, [[Jens Harald Quistgaard]] (1919–2008) for kitchen furniture and implements, [[Gertrud Vasegaard]] (1913–2007) for ceramics, and [[Ole Wanscher]] (1903–85), who had a classical approach to furniture design.

[[File:AJ 3101 ant.jpg|left|130px|thumb|Arne Jacobsen's Ant Chair, 1951]]
The [[Danish Culture Canon]] credits [[Thorvald Bindesbøll]] (1846–1908) with early contributions to design in the areas of [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[jewellery]], [[bookbinding]], [[silver]] and [[furniture]] although he is known in the rest of the world for creating the [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] logo (1904), still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.skoletjenesten.dk/Grundskolen/~/media/EducationOffers/Designmuseum%20Danmark/Undervisningsmateriale/02_bindesboel.pdf | title = Thorvald Bindesbølls livsværk | publisher = Skoletjensten Kunstindustrimuseet | language = Danish | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 24 January 2013 | place = DK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canon also includes [[Knud V. Engelhardt]] (1882–1931) for a more industrial approach, especially in the rounded contours of his electric [[tram]]car designs which were widely copied.&lt;ref name=skoletj&gt;{{Citation | place = DK | url = http://www.skoletjenesten.dk/Grundskolen/~/media/EducationOffers/Designmuseum%20Danmark/Undervisningsmateriale/03_knud_v_engelhardt.pdf | title = Knud V. Engelhardts livsværk | format = PDF| publisher = Skoletjenesten Kunstindustrimuseet | language = Danish | accessdate = 22 January 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of [[textiles]], [[Marie Gudme Leth]] (1895–1997) brought the [[screen printing]] process to Denmark, opening a factory in 1935 which allowed her colourful patterns to be manufactured on an industrial basis.&lt;ref name =dbl&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Kunstner/Marie_Gudme_Leth | contribution = Marie Gudme Leth | title = Dansk Biografisk Leksikon | place = DK | language = Danish | publisher = Den store danske | accessdate = 23 January 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Sandgren]] introduced functionalism in the design of his masterful bookbindings. 
   
In the late 1940s, shortly after the end of the [[Second World War]], conditions in Denmark were ideally suited to success in design. The emphasis was on furniture but [[architecture]], silver, ceramics, [[glass]] and textiles also benefitted from the trend. Denmark's [[late industrialisation]] combined with a tradition of high-quality [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] formed the basis of gradual progress towards industrial production.  After the end of the war, Europeans were keen to find novel approaches such as the light wood furniture from Denmark.  Last but not least, support in Denmark for freedom of individual expression assisted the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.netpublikationer.dk/UM/8584/pdf/Furniture20and20Indust43D234.pdf | format = PDF | title = Furniture and Industrial Design | publisher = Ministry of Foreign Affairs | place = DK | accessdate = 17 December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly established Furniture School at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Art]] played a considerable part in the development of furniture design. [[Kaare Klint]] taught [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] based on the size and proportions of objects, wielding considerable influence. [[Hans J. Wegner]], who had been trained as a cabinetmaker, contributed with a unique sense of form, especially in designing chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.danish-furniture.com/designers/ | contribution = Designers | title = Danish Furniture | accessdate = 17 December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As head of the cooperative FDB furniture design studio, [[Børge Mogensen]] designed simple and robust objects of furniture for the average Danish family. [[Finn Juhl]] demonstrated an individualistic approach in designing chairs with an appealing but functional look.

In the early 1950s, American design also influenced Danish furniture. The American [[Charles Eames]] designed and manufactured chairs of moulded wood and steel pipes. These encouraged [[Arne Jacobsen]] to design his worldfamous [[Ant (chair)|Ant Chair]], Denmark's first industrially manufactured chair. Furthermore, as [[Shaker furniture]]—and especially its reputation for stripped down chairs—began to be more and more known abroad, it also influenced Danish designers.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, Maggie, "Morphologies and Genealogies; Shaker Furniture and Danish Design," Design and Culture 7:3, 313-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poul Kjærholm]], [[Verner Panton]] and [[Nanna Ditzel]] followed a few years later, continuing the successful story of Danish design. Kjærholm worked mainly in steel and leather, Panton left Denmark during the 1960s to continue designing imaginative but highly unconventional [[plastic chairs]] while Nanna Ditzel, who also had a strongly individualistic approach, was successful in helping to renew Danish furniture design in the 1980s.

== Modern trends ==
[[File:Bernadotte Thermos.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Bernadotte's thermos jug, 2004]]
In the seventies Verner Panton made some of his most important designs. The Pantonova and the 1-2-3 System. They were a rave with the critics, but the consumers at the time found it too spacey. Today however it's true value to the design tradition is obvious. Danish furniture design failed to make any new important contributions in the 1980s. By contrast, industrial designers began to prosper, making use of the basic principles of focus on the user, respect for materials and attention to detail. For example, there are well known Danish designers, like Tobias Jacobsen (the grandson of [[Arne Jacobsen]]), who focused on the single elements of a violin when creating his chair "Vio" or on a boomerang when designing his eponymous sideboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.fashionforhome.de/inspiration/designer/jacobsen | title = Designerprofile Tobias Jacobsen | publisher = Fashion For Home | access-date =2015-09-11| place = D}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Count Sigvard Bernadotte of Wisborg|Bernadotte]] &amp; Bjørn studio, established in 1950, was the first to specialise in industrial design, with an emphasis on office machines, domestic appliances and functional articles such as the thermos jug. The electronics manufacturer [[Bang &amp; Olufsen]], in collaboration with Bernadotte &amp; Bjørn and later with [[Jacob Jensen]] and [[David Lewis (designer)|David Lewis]], went on to excel in modern design work. Around the same time, the [[Stelton (company)|Stelton]] company collaborated with [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[Erik Magnussen]] to produce their iconic vacuum jug, a huge international success.

Another successful design field is medical technology. Danish design companies like [[3PART]], [[Designit]] and [[Christian Bjørn Design|CBD]] have worked in this area with individual designers such as [[Steve McGugan]] and [[Anders Smith]].

In 2002 the Danish Government and the City of Copenhagen launched an effort to establish a world event for design in Copenhagen.  Originally understood as a tool for branding traditional Danish design, the non-profit organization ''INDEX:'' shifted focus after worldwide research and coined the concept of Design to Improve Life, which rapidly became celebrated in Denmark and around the world. The organization now hands out the biggest design award in the world biannual in Copenhagen, tours large scale outdoor exhibition around the world, run educational program as well as design labs and hosts a global network.{{Citation needed | date = February 2013}}

Today, there is strong focus on design in Denmark as industry increasingly appreciates the importance of design in the business environment. In addition, as part of its trade and industry policy, the [[Danish government]] has launched the [[DesignDenmark]] initiative which aims to restore Denmark to the [[international design]] elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.ebst.dk/file/7260/designdenmark.pdf |title=DesignDenmark |publisher=The Danish Government |accessdate=17 December 2008 |place=DK |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530045252/http://www.ebst.dk/file/7260/designdenmark.pdf |archivedate=30 May 2009 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[Image:SydneyOperaHouse.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Utzon's Sydney Opera House, 1973]]
Modern [[Architecture of Denmark|architecture]] has also contributed to the concept of Danish design.

[[Arne Jacobsen]] was not just a furniture designer but one of the leading architects of his times. Among his achievements are the Bellevue Theater and restaurant, Klampenborg (1936), the [[Århus City Hall]] (with [[Erik Møller]]; 1939–42) and the [[Radisson SAS Royal Hotel, Copenhagen|SAS Royal Hotel]] (1958–60).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Danish-Design-Architecture/Architecture/WhoIsWhoInHistoricalDanishArchitecture/?wbc_purpose=basi |contribution=Who is Who in Historical Danish architecture |title=About |publisher=Denmark |place=DK |accessdate=18 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520092105/http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Danish-Design-Architecture/Architecture/WhoIsWhoInHistoricalDanishArchitecture/?wbc_purpose=basi |archivedate=20 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jørn Utzon]] (1918–2008), Denmark's most widely recognized architect, is remembered for his expressionist [[Sydney Opera House]] (1966) and the later [[Bagsværd Church]] (1976) with its wavy concrete roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/copenhagen/bagsvaerd_kirke_utzon.htm |title=Bagsvaerd Kirke, København |website=e-architect |access-date=18 December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henning Larsen]] (b. 1925) is the architect who designed the boldly modern [[Copenhagen Opera House]] on the island of [[Holmen naval base|Holmen]] which was completed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/copenhagen/copenhagen_opera_house.htm |title=Copenhagen Opera House |website=e-architect | access-date=18 December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent achievements ==
Today, the concept of Danish design is thriving in an ever-wider number of fields. Among recent highlights are:
*  The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York has chosen to outfit 95% of its new [[Yoshio Taniguchi]]-designed home with furniture by Danish design company [[GUBI]].
* The Danish [[Zenvo]] ST1 supercar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The phrase “Danish design” brings to mind odd-looking chairs and bright-colored handbags — not (this supercar).

== Museums ==
* The [[Danish Museum of Art &amp; Design]] in [[Copenhagen]] exhibits many of the artifacts associated with Danish design, especially furniture.
* The New York [[Museum of Modern Art]] also has a large Danish design collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = House of Copenhagen | url = http://www.houseofcopenhagen.com/moma_collection/ | title = Danish design at MoMA | accessdate = 18 December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Delta of Venus''''' is a book of fifteen [[short stories]] by [[Anaïs Nin]] published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby, ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 683&lt;/ref&gt; — though largely written in the 1940s as [[erotica]] for a private [[book collector|collector]].&lt;ref&gt;Anaïs Nin, ''Delta of Venus &amp; Little Birds'' (1996), pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 [[Delta of Venus (film)|a film inspired by the book]] was directed by [[Zalman King]].

==Background==
The collection of short stories that makes up this anthology was written during the 1940s for a private client known simply as "Collector". This "Collector" commissioned Nin, along with other now well-known writers (including [[Henry Miller]] and the poet [[George Barker (poet)|George Barker]]), to produce erotic fiction for his private consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Anaïs Nin, ''Delta of Venus &amp; Little Birds'' (1996), pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt; His identity has since been revealed as Roy M. Johnson of Healdton Oil, Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Herron, ''Anaïs Nin:A Book of Mirrors'' (Sky Blue Press, 1996), p.427&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being told to leave poetic language aside and concentrate on graphic, sexually explicit scenarios, Nin was able to give these stories a literary flourish and a layer of images and ideas beyond the pornographic. In her Diary (Oct. 1941), she jokingly referred to herself as "the madam of this snobbish literary house of prostitution, from which vulgarity was excluded".&lt;ref&gt;* Anaïs Nin, ''Delta of Venus &amp; Little Birds'' (1996), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

While using the [[Kama Sutra]] and other writings such as those of [[Krafft-Ebing]] as models, Nin was very conscious that the languages of male and female sexuality were distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Anaïs Nin, ''Delta of Venus &amp; Little Birds'' (1996), pp. 15 &amp; 19&lt;/ref&gt; Although at times she scorned her erotica, and feared for their impact on her literary reputation,&lt;ref&gt;Anne T. Salvatore, ''Anaïs Nin's Narratives'', [[University Press of Florida]] (2001) {{ISBN|0-8130-2113-8}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; they have subsequently been seen by [[Sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminists]] as pioneering work.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Bright, ''Totally Heterotica'' (1995), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short stories==
The short stories which ''Delta of Venus'' anthologizes are these:
# The Hungarian Adventurer
# Mathilde
# The Boarding School
# The Ring
# Mallorca
# Artists and Models
# Lilith
# Marianne
# The Veiled Woman
# Elena
# The Basque and Bijou
# Pierre
# Manuel
# Linda
# Marcel
The book, unlike the later ''[[Little Birds]],'' contains no poetry as such. Its introductory preface contains entries from her [[The Diary of Anaïs Nin|''Diary'']], which expressed her hope that its unexpurgated version would one day be published.

'''Eduardo Zamacois y Zabala''' (2 July 1841 in [[Bilbao]] - 12 January 1871 in [[Madrid]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Academicism|Academic]] painter who specialized in small-scale canvases. He was the father of French writer [[Miguel Zamacoïs]], and brother of the writer [[Niceto de Zamacois]], the singer [[Elisa Zamacois]] and the actor [[Ricardo Zamacois]], and also uncle of the writer [[Eduardo Zamacois]].

== Biography ==
Eduardo María Zamacois y Zabala was born in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]]. Son of Miguel Antonio de Zamacois y Berreteaga, and his second wife, Ruperta María del Pilar de Zabala y Arauco. His father was the founder and director of the Santiago de Vizcaya School of Humanities.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;[http://carmenthyssenmalaga.org/en/artista/78 Brief biography] @ the [[Carmen Thyssen Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; His relatives included numerous artists: writers,  actors and musicians. Of family of Basque ancestry, their surname originated in [[Hasparren]], France, where their surname was spelled "Samacoys" at 18th century.

[[File:EDUARDO ZAMACOIS Y ZABALA - La Visita Inoportuna (Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao, c. 1868. Óleo sobre tabla, 23 x 29.5 cm).jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Inopportune Visit]]
He received a thorough education, which included drawing classes with a local artist named Joaquín Balaca (c.1820-?). Later, when his father's school closed, the family moved to Madrid and, in 1856, he was enrolled at the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]], where he studied with [[Federico de Madrazo]].&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/zamacois-zabala-eduardo/?no_cache=1 Brief biography] @ the [[Museo del Prado]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, on Madrazo's recommendation, he went to Paris and attended the classes of [[Charles Gleyre]] in preparation for applying to the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Ècole des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; His application there was denied, so he turned to the workshops of [[Ernest Meissonier]], where he found a position.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;
[[File:Zamacois y Zabala 001.jpg|thumb|250px|The French Occupation]]
A skillful business negotiator, he strove to gain access to as many European exhibitions as possible. Success came quickly. In 1861, he was commissioned to create decorative paintings in the quarters of the future king, [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] at the [[Palacio Real de Madrid]]. This work won him a grant from the {{ill|Diputación Foral de Vizcaya|es}}, which enabled him to continue his studies.&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; In 1862 and 1864, he was awarded medals at the [[National Exhibition of Fine Arts (Spain)|National Exhibition of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

He was married in Paris in 1865, to Louise Marie Héloise Perrin, whom he had met at the home of his friend, [[Jehan Georges Vibert]]. They had two children: [[Miguel Zamacoïs|Miguel Louis Pascual]], who became a well-known journalist and playwright, and a posthumous daughter, Marie Hélène, (who married the painter, [[Jean Alfred Marioton]]). 

In 1866, he became good friends with the painter, [[Marià Fortuny]],&lt;ref name="C" /&gt; who did a portrait etching of him. During a trip to Rome, Zamacois also posed as a toreador for Fortuny's painting, ''[[The Spanish Wedding]]''. Later, he contacted his friend, {{ill|Adolphe Goupil|fr}}, and put him in touch with Fortuny, which resulted in an exclusive contract with [[Goupil &amp; Cie]]; a turning point in Fortuny's career.

In 1870, he was awarded the Gold Medal at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] for his painting, ''The Education of a Prince''.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; After a showing in London, one of his paintings was purchased by [[Charles Dickens]].

The [[Franco-Prussian War]] created difficulties that eventually forced him to return to Madrid. His arrival there coincided with the official coronation of King [[Amadeus I of Spain|Amadeus I]], and he attended the ceremonies. It was an unusually cold winter and he became ill the following day. He died there suddenly, aged 29, of what was described as "gangrenous angina" (possibly [[Diphtheria]]).&lt;ref name="C" /&gt;

In 1878, he was awarded a posthumous diploma by the Ècole des Beaux-Arts and a major retrospective at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]]. Goupil &amp; Cie also published a large volume of photographs of his major works.

'''Gamul House''' is at 52–58 Lower Bridge Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.

==History==

The date of its original building is not known but it was altered in the 17th, 18th&amp;nbsp;and 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries.&lt;ref name=images/&gt; At the time of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] the house was the home of [[Sir Francis Gamull, 1st Baronet|Sir Francis Gamul]], a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] supporter and colonel of the Town Guard. [[Charles I of England|Charles&amp;nbsp;I]] stayed in the house on 23–24&amp;nbsp;September 1645, when his army was defeated at the [[Battle of Rowton Heath|Battle of Rowton Moor]].&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|pp=69, 71.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Great Fire of London]] the town Assembly ruled in 1671 that all the houses in the main streets should have roofs of slate or tile.  The medieval frontage of Gamul House was replaced by a brick [[façade]], but the hall was retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ward|2009|p=74.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 18th&amp;nbsp;century the stone arches in the undercroft were replaced by brick [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]].  During the following century this area was occupied by shops.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; For a time it housed a boarding school but this closed in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Thacker| first = A.

As of 2009 the building is occupied by a restaurant and shops.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The building is constructed in [[sandstone]] and [[timber framing]], with a brick frontage and has three storeys. The lowest storey (an [[undercroft]]) is occupied by shops.  An external staircase parallel to the street has 15&amp;nbsp;steps leading up to the former [[Chester Rows|row]] level.  Behind the staircase at street level is another shop frontage consisting of a door with a four-light window on each side.  The middle storey has a door with an [[architrave]] and pediment.  There are three windows to the south of the door and two windows to the north, all with 40&amp;nbsp;panes of glass.  Above these is a [[Course (architecture)|string course]].  In the top storey are three oval windows with four panes and two [[sash window]]s with six panes.  The roof is in grey slate with its ridge parallel to the street; it is [[Hip roof|hipped]] at its north end and at the south end is a [[gable]] and a chimney stack.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
The undercroft contains a large oak beam and brick [[barrel vault]]s. At the row level, the [[great hall]] occupies the two storeys.  On the west wall of the hall is an ornate sandstone fireplace with decorated [[pilaster]]s carrying a carved [[frieze]] and [[cornice]].&lt;ref name=images/&gt;  On the fireplace is a painting of the [[coat of arms|arms]] of the Gamul family, which Pevsner considers was executed by [[Randle Holme]].{{sfnp|Hartwell|Hyde|Hubbard|Pevsner|2003|p=168|ps=}}  The barrel-vaulted plaster ceiling has eight richly-carved pendants.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

==Today==

As of 2009 the Row level is occupied by the Brewery Tap Ale House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.the-tap.co.uk/| title = Welcome to the Brewery Tap| accessdate = 7 August 2009| publisher = The Brewery Tap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Habermaaß''' GmbH is a [[Germany|German]] toy manufacturing company (commonly referred to as HABA) based in [[Bad Rodach]], [[Bavaria]]. The company defines itself as an “Inventor for inquisitive minds”, offering a broad selection of products such as wooden and textile toys, home furnishings and accessories for babies and children. Today the company is still a family run company, under the leadership of the managing partner Klaus Habermaaß and the managing director Harald Grosch.

== History ==
In  1938, Eugen Habermaaß and Anton Engel founded “Habermaaß &amp; Co.” as a “factory for fine wooden products”, and a couple of months later  “Wehrfritz &amp; Co." in cooperation with Karl Wehrfritz.
In 1940, only two years after its foundation, when Anton Engel withdrew from the company, Eugen Habermaaß became its sole managing director. When he died, in 1955, his wife Luise Habermaaß took over the management of the company. At the same time, their son, Klaus Habermaaß, later to become the managing director of the company, decided to start an apprenticeship in cabinetmaking. On finishing his engineering studies in 1961, he became actively engaged in the running of the company, which grew and expanded in the following years.

The small [[manufacturer]] of wooden toys sets out to become a market leader in the sector, facing up to the challenge of globalization. The toy manufacturer based in Upper Frankonia expands first in the United States where in 1980 the American company “Skaneateles Handicrafters” becomes part of the Habermaaß Inc., first as a production and later as a sales and distribution site. Renamed in the following years as “T.C. Timber”, in 2002 the company receives the definitive company name of “Habermaaß Corp. Inc.". In the meantime, in 1993, a subsidiary is founded in the [[France|French]] location of [[Evry]] near [[Paris]] under the name of “HABA S.A.R.L" and in 2005 the “HABA UK” site is established in the United Kingdom.

In order to expand their product range even further the corporate family of HABA and Wehrfritz decided back in 1987 to found Jako-o GmbH, a joint mail-order company for children’s fashion, toys and accessories which in 2004 was enlarged with the addition of the sales branches Fit-z and Qiéro.

== Product range ==
Since the company was founded in 1938, [[wood]]en toys have been a trademark of HABA. The company became known in particular for its [[construction blocks]], which up until now have been an integral part of the product range. Over the decades the product range has expanded: first incorporating other wooden toys such as pulling figures, vehicles, clutching toys and a complex upgradeable ball track system, followed later by the first society games. Which is how in 1986 the most famous HABA game “The Orchard” was created. The connections with the closely related Wehrfritz company were also taken advantage of in the upcoming development and production of children’s furniture –all made in a child friendly way using only the finest woods.

Even today the main focus of the company still lies in manufacturing out of wood. However, progressively different materials have been incorporated: with dolls and fabric animals, rugs, furniture for children’s rooms and illumination articles finding their way into the product range which is further complemented by gift articles, accessories and children’s jewelry. All products made by the Habermaaß company, however, have one shared aim, fostering the healthy development of children.

== Company sites and distribution areas ==

Since it was founded in 1938, the company’s production site has been located in the Upper Frankonian town of Bad Rodach, just a few kilometers away from the federal state boundary with [[Thuringia]]. It is from here that all business and the daily activities of the different branch offices are monitored and directed. The company holds distribution branches in the USA, France and the United Kingdom. Today the company is firmly established in both the European and world markets – with distribution areas stretching from Japan, Russia, the [[Near East]] and [[Europe]] to [[North america|North]] and [[South America]].

== Awards ==
Amongst the most prestigious awards that have been conferred on HABA are the Best Children's Game of the Year, the German Children;s Games award, the Toy Innovation Award and the German Educational Game Award.

*Best Children's Game of the Year
**2000 – ''Pete the Pirate''

[[File:La fenaison, Rosa Bonheur.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Rosa Bonheur]], ''Haymaking in the Auvergne''''', 1854]]
'''''Haymaking in the Auvergne''''' (French: ''Fenaison d'Auvergne'' or ''La fenaison en Auvergne'') is an 1854 oil painting by French artist [[Rosa Bonheur]].  It measures {{convert|2.15|x|4.22|m}}.  

After her first great artistic success, ''[[Ploughing in the Nivernais]]'' exhibited in 1849, Bonheur showed studies of two new paintings to French Minister of Fine Arts [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny]].  He rejected one, ''[[The Horse Fair]]'', and commissioned ''Haymaking in the Auvergne'' instead.  Bonheur focussed on completing ''The Horse Fair'' first, and De Morny attempted to change his mind after its good reception at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1853. 

The painting depicts the loading of a [[hay]] onto a cart pulled by four oxen.  The beasts to the right wait patiently, attended by a man in wide-brimmed hat.  Other men are cutting grass with scythes, while women rake up the hay, and other people use [[pitchforks]] to lift the hay onto a large pile on the cart.  

The painting was bought by the French state in 1854 for 20,000 francs.  It won a gold medal when it was exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris in 1855, as a pendant to ''Ploughing in the Nivernais''.  It was also exhibited as part of the retrospective of 18th century French art at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]. 

The painting was held at the [[Musée du Luxembourg]] from 1874 to 1878, and then moved to the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], where it remains. A smaller version, {{convert|71.1|x|129|cm}} is in a private collection.  The print of an engraving by [[William Turner Davey]] was published in London in 1878 by [[Louis Brall]] &amp; Sons.

[[File:Color perception.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The human eye's red-to-green and blue-to-yellow values of each one-wavelength visible color]]

[[Image:Cones SMJ2 E.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Normalized [[spectral sensitivity]] curves of the three kinds of [[cone cell]]s, which define the space of human color [[sensation and perception|sensation]]]]
'''Impossible colors''' or '''forbidden colors''' are supposed colors that cannot be perceived in normal seeing of light that is a combination of various intensities of the various frequencies of visible light, but are reported to be seen in special circumstances.

==Types==
These impossible colors are of two types:
#Colors that would be seen if the output strengths of the human eye [[retina]]'s three types of [[cone cell]] (red, green, blue) could be set to values which cannot be produced by exposing the eye in normal seeing conditions to any possible combination of strengths of the frequencies of visible light.
#Colors that cannot be seen directly from any combination of retina signal output from one place in one eye, but can be generated in the brain's [[visual cortex]] by mixing color signals from the two eyes, or from more than one part of the same eye. Examples of these colors are yellowish-blue and reddish-green.&lt;ref name=Hewitt_1983/&gt; Those colors that appear to be similar to, for example, both red and green, or to both yellow and blue. (This does not mean the result of mixing paints of those two colors in painting, or the result of mixing lights of those two colors on a screen.)

==Opponent process==
{{Main|Opponent process}}
The color opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cone and rod cells in an antagonistic manner. The three types of [[cone cell]]s have some overlap in the wavelengths of light to which they respond, so it is more efficient for the visual system to record differences between the responses of cones, rather than each type of cone's individual response. The opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels:
* Red versus green.
* Blue versus yellow
* Black versus white (this is achromatic and detects light-dark variation, or luminance).
Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those to the other color, and signals output from a place on the retina can contain one or the other but not both, for each opponent pair.

==Real colors==
{{multiple image |align= right |direction= horizontal |total_width= 440 |caption_align= left |image1= CIExy1931.png |width1= 542 |height1= 599 |caption1= The [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931]] color space [[chromaticity]] diagram. The white regions outside the black line correspond to imaginary colors. (Note that the colors in this figure do not reproduce the actual colors in the diagram, due to the [[sRGB color space|limitations of RGB computer displays]]) |image2= CIExy1931 ProPhoto.svg | width2= 476 |height2= 540 |caption2= The [[ProPhoto RGB color space]] uses imaginary green and blue primaries to obtain a larger gamut (space inside the triangle) than would be possible with three real primaries. However, some real colors are still irreproducible.}}
Real colors are colors that can be produced by a physical light source. Any [[additive color|additive mixture]] of two real colors is also a real color. When colors are displayed in the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 XYZ color space]], additive mixture results in a color along the line between the colors being mixed. By mixing any three colors, one can therefore create any color contained in the triangle they describe — this is called the [[gamut]] formed by those three colors, which are called [[primary color]]s. Any colors outside of this triangle cannot be obtained by mixing the chosen primaries.

When defining primaries, the goal is often to leave as many real colors in gamut as possible. Since the region of real colors is not a triangle (see illustration), it is not possible to pick three real colors that span the whole region. The gamut can be increased by selecting more than three real primary colors, but since the region of real colors is not a polygon, there always will be some colors at the edge left out. Therefore, one selects colors outside of the region of real colors as primary colors; in other words, imaginary primary colors. Mathematically, the gamut created in this way contains so-called "imaginary colors".

In computer and television screen color displays, the corners of the gamut triangle are defined by commercially available [[phosphor]]s chosen to be as near as possible to pure red and pure green and pure blue, and thus are within the area of real colors; note that these color space diagrams inevitably display, instead of real colors outside your computer screen's gamut triangle, the nearest color which is inside the gamut triangle. See page [[Gamut]] for more information about the color range available on display devices.

==Imaginary colors==
One type of ''imaginary color'' (also referred to as ''non-physical'' or ''unrealizable color'') is a point in a [[color space]] that corresponds to combinations of [[cone cell]] responses in one eye, that cannot be produced by the eye in normal circumstances seeing any possible light spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html |title=Light and the eye|accessdate=May 5, 2007 |last=MacEvoy |first=Bruce |year=2005 |work=Handprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, no object can have an imaginary color. But such imaginary colors are useful as mathematical abstractions for defining [[color space]]s.

The [[spectral sensitivity]] curve of medium-wavelength ("M") cone cells overlaps those of short-wavelength ("S") and long-wavelength ("L") cone cells. Light of any [[wavelength]] that interacts with M cones also interacts with S or L cones, or both, to some extent. Therefore, no wavelength (except perhaps a bit of the far red), and no non-negative [[spectral power distribution]], excites only one sort of cone. If, for example, M cones could be excited alone, this would make the brain see an imaginary color greener than any physically possible green; producing it by seeing light would need some of the red and blue parts of visible light to have negative power, which is impossible. Such a "hyper-green" color would be in the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram (left image to the right) in the blank area above the colored area and between the ''y''-axis and the line ''x''+''y''=1.

==Chimerical colors==
[[File:chimerical-color-demo.svg|thumb|By staring at a "fatigue template" for 20-60 seconds, then switching to a neutral target, it is possible to view "impossible" colors.]]
A ''chimerical color'' is an imaginary color that can be seen temporarily by looking steadily at a strong color for a while until some of the cone cells become fatigued, temporarily changing their color sensitivities, and then looking at a markedly different color. They are explained by the [[opponent process]] color theory.&lt;ref name=Churchland_2005&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chimerical Colors: Some Phenomenological Predictions from Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2005|last1=Churchland|first1=Paul|journal=Philosophical Psychology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=527–560|doi=10.1080/09515080500264115}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, staring at a saturated primary-color field and then looking at a white object results in an opposing shift in hue, causing an [[afterimage]] of the [[complementary colors]]. Exploration of the color space outside the range of "real colors" by this means is major corroborating evidence for the opponent process theory of color vision. Chimerical colors can be seen while seeing with one eye or with both eyes, and are not observed to reproduce simultaneously qualities of opposing colors (e.g. "yellowish blue").&lt;ref name="Churchland_2005"/&gt; Chimerical colors include:
* Stygian colors: these are simultaneously dark and impossibly saturated. For example, to see "stygian blue": staring at bright yellow causes a dark blue [[afterimage]], then on looking at black, the blue is seen as blue against the black, but due to lack of the usual brightness contrast it seems to be as dark as the black. 
* Self-luminous colors: these mimic the effect of a glowing material, even when viewed on a medium such as paper, which can only reflect and not emit its own light. For example, to see "self-luminous red": staring at green causes a red afterimage, then on looking at white, the red is seen against the white and may seem to be brighter than the white.
* Hyperbolic colors: these are impossibly highly saturated. For example, to see "hyperbolic orange": staring at bright cyan causes an orange afterimage, then on looking at orange, the resulting orange afterimage seen against the orange background may cause an orange color purer than the purest orange color that can be made by any normally-seen light. Or, staring at something pure magenta in bright sunlight for two minutes or more, thus temporarily making the red and blue cones less sensitive, and then looking at green leaves, may result in briefly seeing an unnaturally pure green afterimage.

==Claimed evidence for ability to see colors not in the color space==

[[File:Impossible Colors, Blue and Yellow.gif|thumb|Some people may be able to see the color "Yellow–Blue" in this image by letting their eyes cross so that both + symbols are on top of each other]]

[[File:Impossible Colors, Red and Green.gif|thumb|Some people may be able to see the color "Red–Green" in this image by letting their eyes cross so that both + symbols are on top of each other]]

Under normal circumstances, there is no hue that could be described as a mixture of opponent hues; that is, as a hue looking "redgreen" or "yellowblue".

In 1983, [[Hewitt D. Crane]] and Thomas P. Piantanida performed tests using an [[Eye tracking|eye-tracker]] device that had a field of a vertical red stripe adjacent to a vertical green stripe, or several narrow alternating red and green stripes (or in some cases, yellow and blue instead). The device could track involuntary movements of one eye (there was a patch over the other eye) and adjust mirrors so the image would follow the eye and the boundaries of the stripes were always on the same places on the eye's retina; the field outside the stripes was blanked with occluders. Under such conditions, the edges between the stripes seemed to disappear (perhaps due to edge-detecting [[neuron]]s becoming fatigued) and the colors flowed into each other in the brain's [[visual cortex]], overriding the opponency mechanisms and producing not the color expected from mixing paints or from mixing lights on a screen, but new colors entirely, which are not in the [[CIE 1931 color space]], either in its real part or in its imaginary parts. For red-and-green, some saw an even field of the new color; some saw a regular pattern of just-visible green dots and red dots; some saw islands of one color on a background of the other color. Some of the volunteers for the experiment reported that afterwards, they could still imagine the new colors for a period of time.&lt;ref name=Hewitt_1983&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.221.4615.1078 |jstor=1691544 |title=On Seeing Reddish Green and Yellowish Blue |year=1983 |last1=Crane |first1=Hewitt D. |last2=Piantanida |first2=Thomas P. |journal=Science |volume=221 |issue=4615 |pages=1078–80 |pmid=17736657}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some observers indicated that although they were aware that what they were viewing was a color (that is, the field was not achromatic), they were unable to name or describe the color. One of these observers was an artist with a large color vocabulary. Other observers of the novel hues described the first stimulus as a reddish-green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Suarez J|
title=Reddish Green: A Challenge for Modal Claims About Phenomenal Structure|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00247.x | year=2009 | last2=Suarez | first2=Juan | volume=78 | issue=2 | pages=346–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2001 Vincent A. Billock and Gerald A. Gleason and Brian H. Tsou set up an experiment to test a theory that the 1983 experiment did not control for variations in the perceived [[luminance]] of the colors from subject to subject: two colors are equiluminant for an observer when rapidly alternating between the colors produces the least impression of flickering. The 2001 experiment was similar but controlled for luminance.&lt;ref name="josaa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Billock|first=Vincent A.|author2=Gerald A. Gleason |author3=Brian H. Tsou |year=2001|url=http://aris.ss.uci.edu/~kjameson/BillockEtAlImpossibleColorsJOSA2001.pdf|title=Perception of forbidden colors in retinally stabilized equiluminant images: an indication of softwired cortical color opponency?|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|publisher=Optical Society of America|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2398–2403|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.18.002398|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had these observations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some subjects (4 out of 7) described transparency phenomena—as though the opponent colors originated in two depth planes and could be seen, one through the other. ...

We found that when colors were equiluminant, subjects saw reddish greens, bluish yellows, or a multistable spatial color exchange (an entirely novel perceptual phenomena {{sic}}); when the colors were nonequiluminant, subjects saw spurious pattern formation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This led them to propose a "soft-wired model of cortical color opponency", in which populations of neurons compete to fire and in which the "losing" neurons go completely silent. In this model, eliminating competition by, for instance, inhibiting connections between neural populations can allow mutually exclusive neurons to fire together.&lt;ref name="josaa"/&gt;

Hsieh and Tse in 2006 disputed the existence of colors forbidden by opponency theory and claimed they are, in reality, intermediate colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2005.11.030 |title=Illusory color mixing upon perceptual fading and filling-in does not result in "forbidden colors" |year=2006 |last1=Hsieh |first1=P.-J. |last2=Tse |first2=P.

Born in [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada, Belzberg graduated from [[York University]] in Toronto with a degree in English literature and contemporary drama. She moved to New York City, where she received an MBA from [[Fordham University]] before joining the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] as a non-profit fund-raiser.

After her job required a transfer to Los Angeles, Belzberg was introduced to filmmaking through the documentary [[Genocide (1981 film)|''Genocide'']], on which she was the associate producer. Genocide went on to win the 1981 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

Belzberg was George Folsey assistant during filming ''[[Trading Places]]'', she also was ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' executive music producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117467147/|title=Blues Brothers 2000 - Film Reviews|last=Leydon|first=Joe|date=4 February 2008|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won - along with Landis - CableACE Awards for ''Dream on'' series and appeared in ''The Making of "Blues Brothers 2000"'' as herself.

This is a list of visual artists who are [[Native Americans in the United States]]. The [[Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990]] defines "Native American" as being enrolled in either [[federally recognized tribes]] or [[state recognized tribes]] or "an individual certified as an Indian artisan by an Indian Tribe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html "The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925020543/http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html |date=2006-09-25 }} ''US Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board.'' (retrieved 2 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This does not include non-Native American artists using Native American themes.  Additions to the list need to reference a recognized, documented source and specifically name tribal affiliation according to federal and state lists. Indigenous American artists outside the United States can be found at [[List of indigenous artists of the Americas]].
&lt;!--
[[WP:NLIST|Wikipedia notability standards for lists]] requires a citation, preferably more than one, proving the person is a member of the group and notable enough to warrant a stand-alone article. Being related to a notable person in itself confers no degree of notability upon that person. [[WP:ARTIST|Guidelines for notable artists]] include being widely cited by peers (this could include tribal members), originating a new technique, creating significant works, winning critical attention, or being represented in significant permanent collections. For Native American artists, reviving lost art forms is also highly significant.

'''Léonce Rosenberg''' (12 September 1879 in [[Paris]] – 31 July 1947 in Neuilly-sur Seine) was an art historian, art collector, publisher and one of the most influential [[France|French]] [[art dealer]]s of the 20th century. The son of an antique dealer Alexander Rosenberg and brother of the gallery owner [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]] (21 rue de la Boétie, Paris), Léonce, a prominent gallery owner in [[Paris]] at the end of [[World War I]], would become one of the world's major dealers of [[Modern art]].

Leaving the family-owned gallery in 1910 Léonce opened his own business called ''Haute Epoque'' at 19 rue de La Baume, Paris. As an antiquarian Rosenberg began buying works by [[Cubist]] artists. By 1914 his collection included works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Auguste Herbin]], and [[Juan Gris]]. After serving in World War I (1916-1917) he pursued his interests and represented these and other artists, and by the end of the war opened a new show space, [[:fr:Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/EAD/Rosenbergf Léonce Rosenberg Papers, Correspondence Relating to Cubism in The Museum of Modern Art Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Léonce Rosenberg studied in London and Antwerp visiting galleries and museums in his free time.  After returning to Paris he worked with his brother Paul in the family business. In 1906 Léonce  and his brother inherited the family gallery on [[Avenue de l'Opéra]] which had been in existence for twenty years. His brother Paul was largely engaged in 19th- and early 20th-century art.

Léonce Rosenberg was an early advocate of [[Cubism]], and would remain so throughout the 1920s and 1930s. He discovered the works of [[avant-garde]] artists in 1911 through the [[Salon des Indépendants]], the art dealer [[Wilhelm Uhde]], and in 1912 at the gallery of [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]].

[[File:Jean Metzinger, invitation card, Léonce Rosenberg, Galerie de L'Effort Moderne, January 1919.jpg|thumb|230px|Jean Metzinger, invitation card for the exhibition at Léonce Rosenberg's [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]], January 1919]]
At the outset of [[World War I]] many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state. As a German citizen Kahnweiler took refuge in Switzerland and ran out of funds. With his art collection the hand of the French government he could no longer support his artists. Following the advice of [[Max Jacob]] and André Level (known for his well informed art investments), Léonce Rosenberg began amassing his collection. Just before the outbreak of [[World War I]] Rosenberg purchased 15 Cubist works by Picasso for 12,000 FF. His collection would soon include 20 works by Picasso, 10 by [[Georges Braque]], 5 by [[Juan Gris]] and 20 by [[Auguste Herbin]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme 1"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kb107.html Léonce Rosenberg, Kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franck"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3hYBzRzZ0kcC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=%22André+Level%22,+Léonce+rosenberg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_yT8iKJ_Fs&amp;sig=GKItuWScGloX_J8EFbwl5nLY4es&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4Ym0UejSH-rZ0QWR9IHICw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22André%20Level%22%2C%20Léonce%20rosenberg&amp;f=false Dan Franck, ''Bohemian Paris: Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse, and the Birth of Modern Art'', Grove Press, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Very quickly and despite his lack of experience Rosenberg became the official dealer of the Cubists purchasing works, in addition to those he already owned, by artist such as [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Henry Laurens]], [[Georges Valmier]] and [[:fr:Henri Hayden|Henri Hayden]]. Throughout [[World War I]] Rosenberg served as a moral and financial supporter of these artists. 'Without him' noted Max Jacob, 'a number of painters would be drivers or factory workers'.&lt;ref name="Franck" /&gt;

Picasso eventually switched over to his brother Paul Rosenberg's gallery, who would become his dealer [[Interwar period|Entre Deux Guerres]].

Rosenberg volunteered for military service in 1915. He moved into a house at rue Marthe Édouard in Meudon near the military base, but also retained his Paris apartment at 22 rue Lavoisier and his [[Hôtel particulier]] 19 Rue de la Baume in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]]. During his periods of leave he continued to purchase Cubist works. From May, 1916, Rosenberg worked outside his unit as an English interpreter at the field headquarters of the Allied forces on the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] front. During leave at the end of 1916 Rosenberg, through the intermediary of [[Juan Gris]], went to [[Gino Severini]]'s studio and bought a large painting of Woman Reading; possibly Severini's 1916 ''Femme lisant (Jeanne dans l’atelier; La lecture n. 1)''. The death of [[Umberto Boccioni]] during the month of August 1916 marked Severini's rupture from [[Futurism]] and his move closer to the Cubists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fileadmin/mediatheque/integration_MO/PDF/DP/DP_Severini.pdf ''Gino Severini, Futuriste et néoclassique'', Musée d'Orsay, Musée de l'Orangerie – Jardin des Tuileries, exhibition catalogue, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galerie de L'Effort Moderne==

In March 1917, the second line of defense cleared Rosenberg's unit moved to [[Le Havre]]. In July of the same year Rosenberg returned to his old unit, now stationed at an airport in [[Nanterre]]. Closer to Paris, Rosenberg decided to reopen his gallery.&lt;ref name="Kubisme 1" /&gt;

With the support given by Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism reemerged as a central issue for artists after four years of war. Rosenberg found himself financially ruined but exhibited the works he owned at his newly opened Galerie de L'Effort Moderne (also known as ''Galerie Léonce Rosenberg'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/ressource.action?param.id=FR_R-cc931e156ad49248e214b3533147d3f5&amp;param.idSource=FR_CF-cc931e156ad49248e214b3533147d3f5 Galerie Léonce Rosenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; at 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and fashionable 8th arrondissement of Paris. The gallery was open to all forms of [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[Abstract art]]. What followed would be a series of major [[Solo show (art exhibition)|one-man]] exhibitions—including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&amp;ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

The first solo exhibition was held in March 1918, featuring works by [[Auguste Herbin]].&lt;ref name="The Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/research/leonard-lauder-research-center/programs-and-resources/index-of-cubist-art-collectors/effort-moderne Effort Moderne, Galerie L, Paris], Index of Historic Collectors and Dealers of Cubism, 1918-1941, Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year, Rosenberg launched a series of Cubist exhibitions, beginning with [[Henri Laurens]], followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Fernand Léger]] in February, [[Georges Braque]] in March, [[Juan Gris]] April, [[Gino Severini]] May, and [[Pablo Picasso]] in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive, despite claims by critics to the contrary,&lt;ref name="Gris"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=correspondence+Juan+Gris,+Maurice+Raynal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=omG4wHCpDC&amp;sig=jyC3HCXNGm4X7vTF98ybQOyk3Wc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeprVfHJBMz9Ur-NgLAI&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=correspondence%20Juan%20Gris%2C%20Maurice%20Raynal&amp;f=false Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin von Maur, Whitechapel Art Gallery, ''Juan Gris: Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September -29 November 1992: Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 18 December 1992 - 14 February 1993: Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993'', Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 6, 22-60]&lt;/ref&gt; and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Albert Gleizes]] most obviously. Nonetheless, according to art historian Christopher Green, "this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its "new collective form" marked by "intellectual rigor". In the face of such a display of vigour, it really was difficult to maintain convincingly that Cubism was even close to extinction".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Rosenberg also organized literary and musical events in his gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.metmuseum.org/search~S1/?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=leonce+rosenberg&amp;searchscope=1&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=Xpaul+rosenberg Thomas J. Watson Library, The Catalog of the Libraries of The Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

The art collections of Kahnweiler and Uhde sequestered at the outset of World War I (which included works by Georges Braque, [[Raoul Dufy]], Juan Gris, Auguste Herbin, [[Marie Laurencin]], Fernand Léger, Jean Metzinger, Pablo Picasso, [[Jean Puy]] and [[Henri Rousseau]]) were sold by the government in a series of auctions at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll18/id/5199/rec/6 The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries, ''Vente de biens allemands ayant fait l'objet d'une mesure de Séquestre de Guerre'': Collection Uhde.

From 1924 to 1927, Rosenberg made his activities known through his ''Bulletin de l'Effort moderne'' (Éditions de l'effort moderne), a publication featuring writings and illustrations by contributors such as Léonce Rosenberg, Albert Gleizes, Piet Mondrian, Gino Severini.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Bulletin_de_L_effort_Moderne.html?id=yTtDPgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Bulletin de l'Effort moderne', Léonce Rosenberg, Albert Gleizes, Piet Mondrian, Gino Severini]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 Rosenberg moved his personal collection to his apartment rue de Longchamp, Paris, and commissioned the artists he championed to realize decorative panels. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] painted large panels for his living room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesdiagonalesdutemps.com/article-de-l-homo-erotisme-chez-chirico-83382018.html Salon de Léonce Rosenberg, the gladiator series]&lt;/ref&gt; After 1928 exhibitions became sporadic, featuring solo exhibitions by de Chirico, Metzinger, and Valmier.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

Rosenberg commissioned [[Albert Gleizes]] (replacing [[Gino Severini]]) in 1929 to paint decorative panels for his Parisian residence. They were installed in 1931.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881–1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 and 1932, the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne presented two large exhibitions of works by [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

A veritable center of activity and interest during the rise of [[modern art]], the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne closed permanently in 1941, as a result of anti-Semitic laws and by the threat of the Nazi occupation of France. Eventually, the Nazi authorities looted some of his collection.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt; The gallery was not reopened following the war due primarily to Rosenberg’s death in July 1947.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

'''''Madonna and Child Kissing''''' is a 1520s [[Oil painting|oil on panel]] painting by the Flemish [[renaissance]] artist [[Quentin Matsys]] in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]].&lt;ref name=RM&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/SK-A-247/catalogue-entry Catalog entry] in museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
Mary, holding two cherries with her right hand, sits kissing her child who sits next to her on a pedastal inside a richly decorated throne with a view of a castle on a river beyond. In the foreground grapes (referring to the wine of the [[Eucharist]]) and an apple (symbol of the [[Fall of Man]]) lie on a banister.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; 

There are several known versions of this painting, made popular by a 1628 painting by [[Willem van Haecht]] of the ''Gallery of [[Cornelis van der Geest]]''.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; That ''Madonna of the Cherries'' painting was the subject of an anecdote about it which was published in 1648 by Frans Fickaert (1614-1654) in which he stated that on 23 August 1615 while on a visit, the Archduke attempted to buy it from Van der Geest but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/bran038biog01_01/bran038biog01_01_1382.php Metamorphosis ofte Wonderbaere Veranderingh ende Leven van den vermaerden Mr. Quinten Matsijs, Constigh Grof-smit ende Schilder binnen Antwerpen]'', t' Antwerpen by Franchoys Fickaert, onder onze Lieve Vrouwen Thoren, in den gulden Enghel, teghenover den Bornput van denselven Quintijn ghemaeckt, anno 1648, met portret van Quinten Matsijs.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed it was in the possession of Van der Geest who declined an offer to purchase it by [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert of Austria]]. Recent [[dendrochronology]] has shown that the wood of the panel was felled at the latest in 1502.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; Though this panel could have been ready for use by 1513, a date after 1527 is more likely.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; Fickaert may have been mistaken in the year, or possibly this panel is not the original and was copied by the artist based on the story, or perhaps even because of its featured status in the Haecht painting and the enthusiasm Van der Geest had for Matsys. Van der Geest celebrated the hundredth anniversary of Matsys' death by having his bones re-interred in the Antwerp Cathedral with the inscription ''Connubial bliss turned a blacksmith into Apelles''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.garyschwartzarthistorian.nl/ul/cms/fck-uploaded/documents/LoveInTheKunstkamerTableauSummer1996.pdf Love in the Kunstkamer]'', by [[Gary Schwartz (art historian)|Gary Schwartz]], Fine Arts Magazine Tableau, Summer 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
[[File:Willem van Haecht Władysław Vasa.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Van Haecht painting featuring the ''Madonna of the Cherries'', with Van der Geest pointing to the Madonna and looking at the viewer and Albert and Isabella seated before it]]
This painting was in the collection of [[Countess Albertine Agnes of Nassau|Albertina Agnes (1634-1696), Princess of Oranje-Nassau]], at the [[Stadhouderlijk Hof|Frisian Stadholder’s Court]], [[Leeuwarden]], and a century later was appropriated for the national collection from [[Paleis Het Loo]] to the museum then in [[The Hague]], 18 September 1798. The appropriation of art from the [[stadtholder]]'s collection was a tactical move to prevent the abduction of more national treasure to Paris as had happened with the [[Gallery Prince William V]] in 1795. The painting has been in the national collection owned by the Rijksmuseum ever since. Since 1948 it has been on loan to the [[Mauritshuis]].&lt;ref name=RM/&gt;

'''Marathi cinema''' refers to Indian films produced in [[Marathi Language|Marathi]], the language of the state of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. Based in old [[Mumbai]], it is the oldest and one of the pioneer film industries of India. The first Marathi film to be released in India was ''Shree Pundalik'' by [[Dadasaheb Torne]] on 18 May 1912 at Coronation Cinematograph, Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kadam |first=Kumar |date=24 April 2012 |url=http://author.blogs.maharashtratimes.com/kokan/entry/%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%AC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008190417/http://author.blogs.maharashtratimes.com/kokan/entry/%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%AC |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 October 2013 |title=दादासाहेब तोरणेंचे विस्मरण नको! }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Pioneer"&gt;{{cite web |last = Raghavendara  |first = MK |date = 5 May 2012|url = http://www.dailypioneer.com/home/online-channel/top-story/62942-what-a-journey.html

The first Marathi talkie film, ''[[Ayodhyecha Raja]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prabhatfilm.com/films.htm|title=Films of Prabhat Film Company|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 1932, just one year after ''[[Alam Ara]]'' the first Hindi talkie. Although the industry is much smaller than the large market driven [[Hindi cinema]] based in [[Mumbai]], Marathi cinema is tax free, and is experiencing growth in recent years. ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'', directed by [[Dadasaheb Phalke]], was a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film, now known as India's first full-length feature, released in 1913. The [[Dadasaheb Phalke Award]] is India's highest award in cinema given annually by the [[Government of Maharashtra]] for lifetime contribution to [[Indian cinema]].

==History==

===Silent movies period===

[[File:Raja Harishchandra.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Raja Harishchandra'']]
Marathi cinema is the oldest form of Indian cinema. The first Marathi movie released in India was ''Shree Pundalik'' by [[Dadasaheb Torne]] on 18 May 1912 at Coronation Cinematograph, Mumbai.&lt;ref name="Maharashtratimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kadam |first=Kumar |date=2012-04-24 |url=http://author.blogs.maharashtratimes.com/kokan/entry/%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%AC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008190417/http://author.blogs.maharashtratimes.com/kokan/entry/%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%B9-%E0%A4%AC |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-10-08 |title=दादासाहेब तोरणेंचे विस्मरण नको! }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dadasaheb Phalke]] is known as the first pioneer and founder of cinema in pre-Independence India. He brought the revolution of moving images to India with his first indigenously made film ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' in 1913, which is considered by [[IFFI]] and NIFD as part of Marathi cinema as it was made by a Marathi dialogues while shooting and fully Marathi crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/48/20100209/1251/ten-marathi-cinema-can-surpass-hindi-cin.html |title=Marathi cinema can surpass Hindi cinema |publisher=Yahoo |accessdate=2010-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212155541/http://in.news.yahoo.com/48/20100209/1251/ten-marathi-cinema-can-surpass-hindi-cin.html |archivedate=12 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra was another centre of active film production in the twenties. In 1919 [[Baburao Mistry]]&amp;nbsp;— popularly known as Baburao Painter&amp;nbsp;— formed the [[Maharashtra Film Company]] with the blessings of the Maharaja of Kolhapur and released the first significant historical ''Sairandhari ''(1920) with Balasheb Pawar, Kamala Devi and Zunzarrao Pawar in stellar roles. Because of his special interest in sets, costumes, design and painting, he chose episodes from Maratha history for interpreting in the new medium and specialised in the historical genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemaofmalayalam.net/his_indian_cinema2.html |title=History of Regional cinema |publisher=Cinemaofmalayalam |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baburao Painter made many silent movies till 1930. However, after a few more silent films, the [[Maharashtra Film Company]] pulled down its shutters with the advent of sound. Baburao was not particularly keen on the talkies for he believed that they would destroy the visual culture so painfully evolved over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upperstall.com/people/baburao-painter |title=Baburoa Painter |publisher=[[Upperstall]] |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After advent of sound===
As cinema grew in Union of India, major production houses rose and one of them was again a company owned wholly by [[Maharashtrians]], the [[Prabhat Film Company]]. Prabhat's ''Sant Tukaram'' was the first Indian work to win the Best Film Award at the Venice film festival in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-09-28/mumbai/27162503_1_marathi-cinema-marathi-film-industry-film-makers | work=The Times Of India | first1=Niel | last1=Pate | title=Marathi cinema: Waiting to exhale | date=28 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1954 at the very first edition of the National Awards, ''[[Shyamchi Aai (film)|Shyamchi Aai]]'' another Marathi film, won the first President's Gold Medal for Cinema. It was directed by [[Pralhad Keshav Atre|Acharya P K Atre]], and it was an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Sane Guruji.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-08-29/mumbai/27169092_1_marathi-cinema-marathi-films-shanta-gokhale | work=The Times Of India | first1=Mukta | last1=Rajadhyaksha | title=Marathi cinema gets a shot in the arm | date=29 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Golden era===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:marathifilmyanda.png|thumb|Ankush Chowdhary and Smita Shewale in ''Yanda kartavya aahe'']] --&gt;
Marathi cinema was in its full bloom by this time with the advent of greats like [[V. Shantaram]], [[Master Vinayak]], [[Bhalji Pendharkar]], [[Acharya Atre]], followed by [[Raja Paranjpe]], Jyotiram,sonal and mumtaz, Dinkar D Patil, [[G. D. Madgulkar]], [[Sudhir Phadke]] , [[Raja Thakur]] . The 1960s saw the emergence of directors like Anant Mane who made Marathi films based on the folk art form [[Tamasha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymarathicinema.blogspot.com |title=Marathi cinema database }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then came directors like Datta Dharmadhikari and Raj Dutt who made traditional family dramas. The early 70s saw the advent of [[Dada Kondke]] who captured the audiences with his sense of humour. He went on to create satirical, pun-ridden films often including social and political commentary, many of which became [[cult classics]]. By this time Marathi cinema was caught in either the [[Tamasha]] genre or tragedies revolving around traditional family dramas on one side and the comedies of [[Dada Kondke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kale|first1=Pramod|title=Ideas, Ideals and the Market: A Study of Marathi Films|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=1979|volume=14,|issue=35|pages=1511–1520|jstor=4367902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
The 1980s saw two comedy heroes catapult to stardom, [[Ashok Saraf]] and [[Laxmikant Berde]]. Around the mid-80s two young actors donned the director's mantle: [[Mahesh Kothare]] and [[Sachin (actor)|Sachin Pilgaonkar]]. [[Sachin (actor)|Pilgaonkar]] directed ''Navri Mile Navryala'' and around the same time Mahesh Kothare directed ''Dhumdhadaka''. [[Sachin (actor)|Pilgaonkar]]'s film was a box-office hit while Mahesh Kothare's became a mega hit at the box-office, became a trend-setter, and brought young audiences to Marathi cinema. Mahesh Kothare went on to make comedy films that became major hits. He made the first Marathi film shot on the anamorphic format (Cinemascope)&amp;nbsp;— ''Dhadakebaaz''. He brought a number of innovations in the technical quality of Marathi films and was the first to bring [[Dolby Digital]] sound to Marathi cinema with ''Chimni Pakhara''. He made the first Marathi film with Digital Special Effects, ''[[Pachadlela]]'', in 2004. He also made first Marathi movie in [[3D film|3D]] ''[[Zapatlela 2]]'', in 2013. The 3D of this film was highly appreciated and technically this film was extremely well made. This film also went on to become a blockbuster. Currently Mahesh Kothare is working on Zapatlela 3. This for the first time that a franchise has emerged in Marathi cinema.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Reasons for the decline of Marathi cinema===
While the theatre of [[Maharashtra]] earned recognition at the national level, the cinema failed to make a mark. A major reason was the proximity to the production centre of Hindi cinema ([[Bollywood]]), which encroached on the identity of Marathi cinema. Other reasons include the shortage of cinema halls for distribution due to poor marketing, lack of money magnets, a vibrant theatre scene and the emergence of private television. It also lacked the powerful lobby at the national level unlike Bengali and South Indian cinema because state congress (ruling party over 40 years) encouraged Hindi cinema for profit mainly; the regional film industrial advantage being soaked up by Bollywood.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/&gt;

===Revival: Marathi New Wave===
In past few years, the Marathi cinema industry has produced many films that are not only critically acclaimed but commercially successful as well. It has brought fresh ideas, untouched subjects and deeper human sensitivity on the celluloid.

Acclaimed director Dr [[Jabbar Patel]] explains the reasons behind the change, "The kind of Marathi cinema that is being made today is very fresh and different. This is thanks to directors and writers getting exposed to world cinema via television, film festivals etc. They are coming up with new storylines and innovative concepts."

Actor [[Mrinal Kulkarni]] remarks, "There is a lot of content and variety in Marathi films. A lot of bold subjects have been handled well by them. They carry a lot of substance." But, she adds, "We need to start watching a lot more Marathi films. Until we see the films ourselves, we will never be able to appreciate them when they are sent to the [[Oscars]]."

With outstanding contribution and efforts from different producers and directors of the Mumbai film industry, Marathi cinema relatively outshined other Indian film industries such as [[Bollywood]] in the first quarter of 2010 in box office collections and critical appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?from=bottomrelated&amp;ID=ENTEN20100136669&amp;Keyword=regional Marathi films beat Hindi movies at BO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804070359/http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?from=bottomrelated&amp;ID=ENTEN20100136669&amp;Keyword=regional |date=4 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Marathi cinema received critical acclaim in 2004 with the film ''[[Shwaas]]'' winning the Golden Lotus National Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/National_Film_Awards_India/2004|title=National Film Awards, India: 2004|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was India's official entry to the 77th Academy Awards. It won the President's medal for best film, beating Bollywood's prolific output with quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2004/sep/24shwas.htm |title=Shwaas is India's Official Entry to Oscars|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shwaas'' was the second Marathi film to win the President's Medal after ''[[Shyamchi Aai]]'' (1950).

The [[Maharashtra]] state government has begun to issue grants to Marathi film (between 1.5 million and 3.0 million rupees). After the success of ''Shwaas'', Indian media players like Shringar Films and Zee Telefilms are exhibiting a re-emerging interest in Marathi cinema. The growing popularity of Marathi television (notably [[Zee Marathi]] and [[ETV Marathi]]) has helped to popularize older Marathi cinema and promote the genre. [[Zee Talkies]], a 24-hour channel dedicated to Marathi movies, has been introduced.

In 2009, [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''[[Harishchandrachi Factory]]'' (with a budget of Rs. 6 crore), depicting the struggle of [[Dadasaheb Phalke]] in making ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' in 1913, India's first feature film, directed by theatre-veteran [[Paresh Mokashi]] was selected as India's [[List of Indian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|official entry]] to [[Academy Award]] in the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category, making it the second Marathi film, after ''[[Shwaas]]'', to receive this honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-20/india/28076656_1_marathi-film-paresh-mokashi-foreign-film-category 'Harishchandrachi Factory' India's entry for Oscars] [[Indian Express]], PTI 20 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/harishchandrachi-factory-to-tell-story-behind-making-of-indias-first-feature-film/304892/ Harishchandrachi Factory to tell story behind making of India’s first feature film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930065757/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/harishchandrachi-factory-to-tell-story-behind-making-of-indias-first-feature-film/304892/ |date=30 September 2012 }}, ''[[Indian Express]]'', Express News Service, 3 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptinews.com/news/291828_-Harishchandrachi-factory--India-s-entry-for-Oscars 'Harishchandrachi factory' India's entry for Oscars]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Press Trust of India]], 20 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

2009 saw the blockbuster musical movie ''[[Natarang]]'', which both commercial and critical applause and has served as a path-breaking movie for Marathi cinema.

Since the new decade beginning in 2010, several contemporary Marathi artistic films released including [[Umesh Vinayak Kulkarni]]'s ''[[Vihir]]'' and ''[[Deool]]'', and [[Nagraj Manjule]]'s ''[[Fandry]]''. They have given a new direction to Marathi films.

[[Deool]] became the third movie after Shyaamchi Aai and Shwaas to win the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film]]

[[Sairat]] (2016) musical romantic drama starring Rinku Rajguru and Akash Thosar, directed by Nagraj Manjule and produced by Nagraj Manjule, Nitin Keni, and Nikhil Sane emerged as the biggest weekend opener for a Marathi film breaking record previously held by Natsamrat. Sairat was the first Marathi film to cross ₹50 crore (US$7.8 million) mark. The film has become the first Marathi film to gross over ₹100 crore (US$16 million) worldwide. Also it ran for more than 100 days in many centres of Maharashtra.

The '''National Museum of Ethnology''' ({{lang-pt|Museu Nacional de Etnologia}}) is an [[ethnology]] museum in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. The museum holds in its collections the most relevant ethnographic heritage in Portugal. It is responsible for the safeguarding and management of nearly half a million items. 

The museum's ethnographic collections are divided into two separate groups. There is the collection assembled by the ''National Museum of Ethnology's staff'' dating from the museum's launch in 1962, created by the team who introduced the field of modern [[anthropology]] to Portugal. These collections, totaling 42,000 objects, are representative of 80 countries and 5 continents, with greater emphasis on cultures from Africa, Asia and South America, and traditional [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]].

Many of these collections were exhaustively documented through field research, and are inseparable from the important photographic, film, sound and drawing Archives that constituting a significant part of the nearly half a million items that make the Museum's movable heritage.

The second set of the museum's collection consists of 11.600 objects from the ''Popular'' Art ''Museum'', largely assembled in the 1930s and early 1940s for the propaganda exhibitions promoted by the regime of ''Estado Novo''. They differ significantly from their matching parts of the collections of the ''National Museum of Ethnology'' due to the lesser amount of information available, if any, about their origin.

Following the transfer of the collections of the Museum of Popular Art in 2007 to the building of the National Museum of Ethnology, both museums were merged in 2012 into a single museum – National Museum of Ethnology / Popular Art Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2306">The '''perfume organ''', also called an '''octophone''' (unrelated to the mandola-related [[octophone]]), was an instrument invented by the French chemist Septimus Piesse, in which the keys of a piano activated one of 46 different odors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=Sadakichi|date=1913|title=In Perfume Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bW4oZmW3mBQC&amp;pg=PA217|journal=The Forum|volume=L (50), July 1913 - December 1913|pages=271|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, in his book ''The Art of Perfumery'', Piesse used music to describe how notes and smells can work together: "There is, as it were, an octave of odors like an octave in music; certain odors coincide, like the keys of an instrument."&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Septimus Piesse, ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16378/16378-h/16378-h.htm The Art of Perfumery And Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants]''  Philadelphia: Lindsay and Blakiston, 1857; Ebook: Project Gutenberg, July 28, 2005, [EBook #16378].&lt;/ref&gt;

As Sadakichi Hartmann noted in 1913, the keys of the octophone "are complementary and can be combined to harmonies as sounds to a musical chord. It is a valuable guide on a quasi scientific basis for the manufacturers of perfumery, for it is only necessary to strike a chord on the piano, and to know what odors the respective notes of the chord represent, to arrive at the suggestion for some new bouquet."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hartmann was skeptical of the value of the perfume organ for "asthetical" experiments, as "the affinity between sounds and odors is purely speculative".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1922, the magazine ''Science and Invention'' had an article on a new, silent take on the perfume organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/6/069.html|title=The Dead media Project:Working Notes:06.9|website=Dead Media|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of attempting harmony of music and scent, the keys on the keyboard of the ''Science and Invention'' version played only notes of perfume. There does not appear to be any evidence that this particular smell organ was ever constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/environment/smell-organ-50062|title=The Olfactory Organ|work=Pacific Standard|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Perm Tchaikovsky Opera and Ballet Theatre''' is an [[opera]] and [[ballet]] theatre in the city of [[Perm]] in Russia. It is one of the oldest theatres in the country, and it has remained a major musical centre during its history, in which many significant art events have taken place. Its ballet troupe is one of the most popular in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/stage/why-this-perm-will-never-go-out-of-fashion-1.1263 Why this Perm will never go out of fashion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre is often named "Tchaikovsky's House", and all stage works of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], who was born in the region, are presented in its repertoire: 10 operas and 3 ballets. Festivals of Tchaikovsky's works were notable cultural events of the country.

==History==
[[File:Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre, 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The opera in 2007]]
The theatre was inaugurated on 24 November 1870 with the premiere performance being [[Mikhail Glinka]]'s ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]''. The building was constructed from 1874 to 1879, after which the first performance took place in the winter of 1879/1880. At the time, the general manager was the later famous entrepreneur P.P. Medvedev.

A new epoch in the history of the theatre started in 1896. It received the patronage of the city parliament, which decided to finance the theatre and the opera troupe from the city budget. A board of directors was elected for managing the theatre and inviting the artists.&lt;ref name="history-on-en"&gt;[http://theatre.perm.ru/en/about/history/one/ History of the theatre: The end of the 19th century – The beginning of the 20th century]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Aida]]'' was the first presentation with the assistance of the city.

The first season after the end of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] opened on 20 August 1921. Among the performances were ''[[The Demon (opera)|Demon]]'', ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', ''[[Aida]]'', ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugine Onegin]]'', ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'', ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[The Barber of Seville|Il Barbiere di Sevilla]]''. Perm had become one of the major operatic centers of Russia by the end of the 1920s.

During World War II, when the [[Mariinsky Theatre|Leningrad State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] evacuated its personnel to the city, its performances were given in the Perm theatre. The artists from [[Leningrad]] had worked in Perm for three winters and two summers.&lt;ref name="history-on-en" /&gt;

In 1956, the Perm theatre was renamed in honor of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and given Academy status in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theatre.perm.ru/ru/theatre/history/first-studio/ History of the theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===

The theatre was awarded the National Glinka Award for the performance of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[War and Peace (opera)|War and Peace]]'' in 1984. Also, the artists of the theatre have got the [[Golden Mask (Russian award)|Golden Mask]] Award for many performances:

Many opera premieres in Russia were given in this theatre: [[Edison Denisov]]'s ''[[L'écume des jours (opera)|The Foam of Days]]'', [[Jules Massenet]]'s ''[[Cléopâtre]]'', [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', [[George Frideric Handel]]'s ''[[Alcina]]'', [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s ''[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]'', [[Rodion Shchedrin]]'s ''[[Lolita (opera)|Lolita]]'', [[Anton Rubinstein]]'s ''Christ'', [[Alexander Tchaikovsky]]'s ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich''. Five operas based on [[Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin|Pushkin]]'s works were presented during the 200th anniversary year of the poet.

The theatre held the first festival in the 20th Century of the Russian composer [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s work, where it opened with a two-evening version of the opera ''War and Peace'' and gave stage life to the opera ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]''.

==Ballet==
There is a good tradition of collaboration with directors and choreographers from Germany, United States, Spain, and Switzerland on the Perm stage. Due to long-term projects between Russia and United States in collaboration with The [[George Balanchine]] Foundation and The [[Jerome Robbins]] Foundation, the repertoire of the theatre gets many masterpieces of the most distinguished choreographers of the 20th Century.

For many decades the theatre has been the launch site for many artists who are famous far away from Russia. Many stars of Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]] theatres and other famous theatres of the world have begun their careers in the Perm theatre. Among those artists are: [[Galina Ragozina-Panova]], [[Lubov Kunakova]], [[Nadegda Pavlova]], [[Olga Chenchikova]], [[Marat Daukaev]], [[Yuri Petuhov]], [[Galina Shalyapina]], [[Svetlana Smirnova (actor)|Svetlana Smirnova]], and [[Monica Loughman]].

==Events==
Arabesque is a ballet competition headed by [[Vladimir Vasiliev (ballet dancer)|Vladimir Vasiliev]] which has taken place in Perm since 1990. More than 650 young ballet artists from Russia, former republics of the USSR, Austria, Argentina, Bulgaria, Belarus, China, Croatia, Egypt, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Mongolia, Slovenia, South Korea, Turkey, United States and Venezuela have participated in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabesque.permonline.ru/history0en.html History of Arabesque]&lt;/ref&gt;

International festivals known as the "[[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] Seasons: Perm-Petersburg-Paris" have become some of the most visible events in the cultural life of Russia. The festival has taken place in the theatre every two years since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diaghilevfest.ru/en/ Diaghilev Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgy Isaakyan]] was an art director of the festival until 2010, but the new art director of the theatre [[Teodor Currentzis]] will replace him on this position.

===Concert tours===
The ballet troupe successfully performs abroad under the name of The Tchaikovsky Ballet. Promotion of the opera troupe in the United States began with a performance of ''[[Mazeppa (opera)|Mazeppa]]'' in [[Carnegie Hall]] in January 2008 using the name The Tchaikovsky Theatre.

There were many concert tours in Saint Petersburg and Moscow which always drew a wide response. The artists of the Perm Theatre have participated in many festivals, such as [[White Nights Festival]] on the stage of [[Mariinsky Theatre]], Baltic Seasons in [[Kaliningrad]], Panorama of Musical Theatres in [[Omsk]] and Crescendo on the stage of [[Bolshoi Theatre]].

===Incidents===
The famous pilot [[Valery Chkalov]] visited [[Perm]] in February 1937 and went to a performance of ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''. The singer in the role of Tatyana bent forward towards a candle, and her wig caught fire. Then Chkalov, who was sitting in a side directorial box, jumped out onto the stage, plucked the wig from the actress, and extinguished it. Chkalov wrote in the guest book after the end of the performance: "Wonderful performance. Good voices. Excellent choir… I wish the delightful team of the theatre every success in subsequent work!"

The '''Robert Henri Museum''' is located in [[Cozad, Nebraska]] in a building that was once the home of [[Robert Henri]] (previously Robert Henry Cozad), a prominent figure of the [[Ashcan School|Ashcan School]] of art and one of “The Eight”. The Robert Henri Museum houses works by Robert Henri, including sketches, drawings, and paintings by the artist.

The museum is designated a non-profit educational 501(c)(3) organization and located at 218 East 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Street in Cozad, Nebraska.&amp;nbsp; It also houses items related to the history of Cozad, founded by Robert Henri's father John Jackson Cozad. This includes furnishings and other items owned by the Cozad family.&amp;nbsp; The museum lists its mission as “[T]o preserve the boyhood home of Robert Henri (Robert Henry Cozad) for public education and enjoyment, as well as to increase the general understanding of the appreciation of the arts.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://roberthenrimuseum.org/about-robert-henri/ |title=About Robert Henri - Robert Henri Museum |access-date=2018-10-23 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was founded by a coalition of women of Cozad who saw an opportunity to honor both the history of the area and one of its more prominent former citizens.&amp;nbsp; The coalition purchased the home, then known as the Hendee Hotel. The group was led by Shirley Paulsen. Also included in the purchase was an adjacent historical walkway and original Pony Express Station, an historical church, and schoolhouse.&amp;nbsp; The purchase was made with both local support and donations from the family of Robert Henri and the Cozad family.&amp;nbsp; At that time, additional repairs and improvements were made to the building. Museum quality climate control and security was added in 2014, to safely maintain the art collection.&lt;ref name=Four&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://lexch.com/news/henri-museum-welcomes-four-paintings-home/article_b7ca41cc-2689-11e6-a29c-1f7c4412aed8.html |title=Henri Museum welcomes four paintings home |first=Kevin|last=Zelaya|work=Lexington Clipper-Herald |access-date=2018-10-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing art collection contains art by Robert Henri including “Mariana of Austria, Queen of Spain.” It was donated by Janet LeClair in 1988. &amp;nbsp;Currently, the gallery displays more than 33 drawings, seven paintings, and assorted other items belonging to the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://lexch.com/news/robert-henri-museum-acquires-new-original-henri-painting/article_7aac2b16-1bd9-11e7-9af2-b305f0a50b6d.html |title=Robert Henri Museum acquires new original Henri painting |first=Kevin|last=Zelaya|work=Lexington Clipper-Herald |access-date=2018-10-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2017 addition to the collection was “Normandie Interior”, which was completed in 1897.&amp;nbsp; The painting was part of Henri’s first solo exhibition and bought by Frank Southern, the artist’s brother, and kept in the family for the next 120 years.&lt;ref name=Four/&gt;

== History ==
The original house was built by John Jackson Cozad, the father of Robert Henri and the founder of the city of Cozad, Nebraska.  The house was occupied by the Cozad family between 1873 and 1883.  It has what some have called a checkered history, because in 1883, John Cozad shot a local rancher named Alfred Pearson.  This dispute is said to have originated when Mr. Pearson’s cattle herd strayed onto John J. Cozard’s fields, ruining the crops. John J. Cozad attempted to bring the matter before the courts and was awaiting a court date to resolve the incident. However, the dispute erupted into violence when the two encountered one another at Julia Gatewood’s general store, a local gathering place for card players where Mr. Cozad was known to frequent to play faro, a card game of the period.  The two became involved in a shouting match, with Mr. Cozad insisting that Mr. Pearson not speak that way in front of Mr. Gatewood.  Mr. Pearson attempted to leave and continue the dispute, but insults were exchanged and a fist fight occurred.  Mr. Cozad took the matter a bit further and pulled a gun and shot Mr. Person, who died a month later.  

John Cozad returned home and fled to Denver that night, and his wife and sons were left to sell the home and reunite in Denver.  His parents took the names Richard and Tessa Lee, and his brother the name Frank Southern to escape the notoriety of the resulting murder charge.  Robert Henry Cozad, remained in Denver for a time, but eventually went on the New York to study art.  After a trip to Paris, he took the name Robert Henri.  The story is recounted in “Son of a Gambling Man” by [[Mari Sandoz]].

Another infamous artist also lived in the home.  This was also the home of Miles Maryott, a near contemporary of Henri’s, described by the Omaha World Herald as “a well-known hunting guide, outdoorsman and landscape painter — there was talk he would become the first-ever Nebraska state naturalist — before he pulled a gun on his best friend and changed his own life.”  His fame thereafter was as a jailhouse artist of some talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.omaha.com/living/the-better-half/art-made-them-famous-murder-shaped-their-lives-a-hotel/article_78c604a3-b304-50a4-b4fb-10d1c17bbcc2.html |title=Art made them famous. Murder shaped their lives. A hotel in Nebraska links their pasts|first=Matthew|last=Hansen|work=Omaha World-Herald access-date=2018-10-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Cozad Family ==
John Jackson Cozad, the original owner of the house and the father of Robert Henri, was born in 1830. When his mother died and his father remarried, he found living in the family home difficult and left it at the age of 12.&amp;nbsp; While working on steamboats for the next few years, he learned a card game popular that the time called faro.&amp;nbsp; He eventually joined the ranks of professional gamblers working the Mississippi and Ohio riverboats and other gambling establishments.&amp;nbsp; 

He met and married Theresa Gatewood.&amp;nbsp; She was a daughter of a hotel owner from Malden, Virginia.&amp;nbsp; Once they married, they settled in Cincinnati where they had six children, only two of which survived into adulthood. While working his way around the gambling circuit in 1872, John Cozad won $50,000, a huge sum at the time.&amp;nbsp; 

John J. had the dream of founding a town that would carry his name.&amp;nbsp; First founding the town of [[Cozaddale, Ohio]] in 1871, and then the town of Cozad, Nebraska in 1872.&amp;nbsp; He placed advertising in several eastern newspapers encouraging people to move to this new town.&amp;nbsp; When people accepted his offer and moved west, he often found ways to employ them when the town hit hard times. Two such projects were a bridge building company and a haying operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Son of a Gambling Man:  The Youth of an Artist |last=Sandoz |first=Mari |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-8032-5833-4 |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artist in Residence Program ==
The museum sponsors an artist-in-residence program. As of June of 2016, the artist-in-residence was Fred Cowie.  Dr. Cowie, a self-trained artist, received a doctorate in history.  He counts among his influences the art of Paul Cezanne, Rembrandt van Rijn and Claude Monet.  Both a painter and a jewelry artist, he practices his art on a daily basis by creating small paintings.&lt;ref name=Four/&gt;

'''Sanguinet &amp; Staats''' was an architectural firm based in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], with as many as five branch offices in Texas. The firm specialized in steel-frame construction and built many skyscrapers in Texas. The firm also accepted commissions for residential buildings, and 
designed many buildings listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Partnerships==
Sanguinet &amp; Staats was an architecture firm formed in 1903 by Marshall R. Sanguinet, who had practiced in Fort Worth since 1883, and Carl G. Staats, a draftsman who had worked for [[James Riely Gordon]].&lt;ref name="THO"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|author=Christopher Long|title=Sanguinet and Staats|access-date=13 October 2017|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/cms01|date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay C. Henry|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|year=1993|title=Architecture in Texas, 1895-1945|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm established its original office in Fort Worth and later expanded with offices in five Texas cities: [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], and [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]]. Sanguinet &amp; Staats also took on various partners over time.&lt;ref name = "THO"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, the Dallas office sprung from a new partnership called '''Sanguinet, Staats and Hill''', which operated for two years under that name until Charles D. Hill left the firm.&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utaaa/00005/aaa-00005.html|title=Sanguinet, Staats, and Hedrick: An Inventory of their Drawings, Photographs, and Records, 1907-1969, 1991|series=Texas Archival Resources Online|access-date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, architect [[Wyatt C. Hedrick]] joined and it became '''Sanguinet, Staats, and Hedrick'''. In turn, this firm added R.D. Gottlieb as a limited partner for just the Houston office, forming '''Sanguinet, Staats, Hedrick, and Gottlieb'''. Sanguinet and Staats retired in 1926 after selling their shares to Hedrick.&lt;ref name = "THO"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shilin (Shihlin) Night Market''' ({{zh|c=士林夜市|p=Shìlín Yèshì}}) is a [[night market]] in [[Shilin District]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], and is often considered to be the largest and most famous night market in the city.

==Overview==
The night market encompasses two distinct sections sharing a symbiotic relationship: a section formerly housed in the old Shilin Market building, containing mostly food vendors and small restaurants; and the surrounding businesses and shops selling other nonfood items. The food court holds 539 stalls, and the second floor serves as a parking lot for 400 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2002/10/14/175632|title=Shihlin vendors smell something fishy|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2002-10-14|accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the food court, side streets and alleys are lined with storefronts and roadside stands. Cinemas, video arcades, and [[karaoke]] bars are also prevalent in the area. Like most night markets in Taiwan, the local businesses and vendors begin opening around 16:00. As students begin returning home from school, crowds reach their peak between 20:00 and 23:00. Businesses continue operating well past [[midnight]], closing around 01:00 or 02:00.

Tourist traffic has increased in recent years due to the opening of the [[Taipei Metro]] system. The night market is closest to [[Jiantan Station]] on [[Tamsui–Xinyi line]] (Tamsui/Red Line), and can be seen from the station platform.

==Historical development==
The night market is located near the former location of a [[wharf]] on the [[Keelung River]]. Agricultural produce from farms in Shilin being shipped to other ports such as [[Wanhua District|Banka]] and [[Dadaocheng]] would typically be sold in this area. The daytime Shilin Market was formally established in this area in 1909, and the market was inaugurated in 1913.&lt;ref name="reopen" /&gt; With the influx of customers, many new businesses and food vendors began to establish themselves in the area and the Shilin Night Market was born.

Shilin Night Market has since become the largest and most well-known night market in Taiwan, especially with regards to food, and is a favorite focal point for Taipei's [[nightlife (activity)|night life]] among residents and visitors alike.

Due to safety, sanitation and fire hazard concerns, the old Shilin Market structure was demolished in October 2002 by the Taipei City Government; the food vendors formerly based within the old structure were relocated to a newer temporary structure a few hundred meters away, next to the [[Taipei Metro|metro]] [[Jiantan Station]].&lt;ref name="ohmynews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?article_class=5&amp;no=331023&amp;rel_no=1|title=	
'Temporary' Shilin Market a Permanent Hit|publisher=Oh My News|date=2006-11-27|accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for the renovated site began in 1999 work began in 2006 after the relocation of the vendors to the temporary site. The renovated site re-opened in 2011.&lt;ref name="reopen"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20111208000096&amp;cid=1801 | title=Shilin Night Market to reopen at renovated site Christmas Day | newspaper=Central News Agency | date=2011-12-07 | access-date=2015-10-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004224752/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20111208000096&amp;cid=1801 | archivedate=2015-10-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Shilin Night Market is accessible via the Tamsui–Xinyi line (Taipei Metro) at Jiantan Station. A number of [[Taipei Joint Bus System|bus routes]] also serve the area with stops at Jiantan Station, nearby [[Ming Chuan University]], and Xiao Bei (Hsiao Pei) Street.

The '''Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture''' is an [[Artist residency|artists residency]] located in [[Skowhegan, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skowheganart.org/index.php?page=mission "Mission"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222150356/http://www.skowheganart.org/index.php?page=mission |date=2014-12-22 }}, Skowhegan Art, Retrieved 22 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, the program accepts online applications from emerging artists from November through January, and selects 65 to participate in the nine-week intensive summer program. Admissions decisions are announced in April. The School provides participants with housing, food, and studio space, and the campus offers a library, media lab, and sculpture shop, among other amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.resartis.org/en/residencies/list_of_residencies/?id_content=5402|title=List of Residencies {{!}} ResArtis|website=www.resartis.org|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tuition for the program is $6,000, however aid is available, ensuring that everyone accepted into the program can attend, regardless of financial need.

While on campus, the participants interact with five or six resident faculty artists for the duration of the program, as well as five to seven visiting faculty artists, both of whom are selected by Skowhegan’s Board of Governors. Participants are not allowed to bring family or friends with them to Skowhegan, nor are visitors allowed on campus. Lectures by faculty artists, which are generally held on Fridays, are open to the public.

==History==
During [[World War II]], New England portrait painter Willard C. Cummings was stationed in Alaska in the [[Army Art Unit]]. There, he shared his idea for an educational model “where young artists could study with leading artists of the time” with [[Sidney Simon]], a sculptor also in the Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Willard W. Cummings: the Artist|last=Gourley|first=Hugh J.|publisher=Colby College Museum of Art|year=1990|isbn=|location=Waterville|pages=Introduction|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning from the War in 1946, with the help of Simon, [[Henry Varnum Poor (designer)|Henry Varnum Poor]], already an established presence in American Art, and [[Charles Cutler]], a New England stone sculptor, Cummings turned his family farm into a functional alternative school run by artists for artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://commonstreetarts.com/event/skowhegan-at-70/#_ftn2|title=Skowhegan at 70!  {{!}}  Common Street Arts|website=commonstreetarts.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School, as the name indicates, was originally focused on the traditional art forms of painting and sculpture, but gradually, the program began accepting artists of all practices, even being the alleged site of the first contemporary [[Land art|Land Art]] piece in 1968 by [[Douglas Leichter]] and [[Richard Saba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Wholes|last=Glueck|first=Grace|date=October 15, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, while The School originally offered classes such as [[life drawing]] or [[En plein air|plein air painting]], the school eventually forewent traditional forms of instruction save for weekly faculty lectures, and all classes on campus are now self-directed by participants. [[Fresco]] instruction, however, has always been a part of the program. Today, The School is unique in that it is one of the few institutions in the [[United States]] that teaches this technique. Since 2010, [[N. Sean Glover]] has been the fresco instructor.

Since 1952, The School has recorded the lectures given on campus by resident and visiting faculty artists. They now comprise an archive of over 700 lectures and are accessible to artists and researchers in select repositories including The [[Colby College Museum of Art]], The [[Archives of American Art]], The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], The [[Getty Research Institute]], and The [[Museum of Modern Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The  '''Society of Graphic Designers of Canada''' (GDC®) is Canadaʼs national certification body for graphic and communication design and since 1956 has established standards for design professionals, educators, and leaders. Through our certification program, GDC licenses the unique CGD™ certification mark to members whose services meet rigorous, standardized criteria. The CGD™ certification mark is recognized across Canada as the mark of professional services and ethical business conduct.

GDC is a member-based organization of design professionals, educators, administrators, students, and affiliates in communications, marketing, media and design-related fields. Our members come together via nine chapters across Canada to advocate for the advancement of the design profession.

GDC was Canada’s first distinct group to professionalize graphic design as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modern-canada.blogspot.ca/2011/12/graphic-art-and-design-robert-stacey.html |title=Graphic Art and Design / Robert Stacey |type=Weblog post |author=Duncan |website=Modern Canada |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1956 a visionary group of designers [Frank Davies, John Gibson, Frank Newfeld, and Leslie (Sam) Smart] met in Toronto to form the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC).

Due to the rapid evolution of the profession, in 1968 the organization changed its name to the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada (GDC). Thanks to the efforts of a number of dedicated designers and design educators, negotiations between members of the original society, the federal government, and designers from every region of the country culminated in the granting of a Federal Charter in 1976, unifying the country under one national association.

In 1996 GDC’s five Ontario Chapters amalgamated to form the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario and received provincial legislation granting them authority to use the title of Registered Graphic Designer and the R.G.D. designation within the province of Ontario.

GDC celebrated its 50th Anniversary in 2006 with a commemorative stamp from Canada Post.&lt;ref&gt;https://gdc.design/about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadianpostagestamps.ca/stamps/17670/50-years-of-canadian-graphic-design&lt;/ref&gt;

Today GDC has chapters throughout Canada and proudly boasts representation in every province and territory as well as many international members.

=== Friends and Affiliates of GDC ===
GDC is well-respected internationally. Our organization is a member of the International Council of Design (ico-D), the worldwide non-governmental body representing graphic and communication designers. This allows our members to attain international recognition, professional development, and a global perspective on graphic design. GDC is one of the ten largest association members in ico-D and has been a member since 1974.

GDC is also allied with the Societe des Designers Graphiques du Quebec (SDGQ), representing graphic designers in Quebec, the University and College Designers Association (UCDA), the Canadian Association of Professional Image Creators (CAPIC)and the Australian Graphic Design Association (AGDA).

In September 2010 the GDC adopted membership changes to replace the MGDC and LGDC certifications&lt;ref name="Roodenburg2010"&gt;{{cite mailing list |title=GDC Adopts New Designation for its Professional Members: CGD |url=http://lists.gdc.net/pipermail/gdc/2010-September/011674.html |mailing-list=gdc |date=September 17, 2010 |first=Rod |last=Roodenburg |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gdc-adopts-new-mark-cgd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |title=GDC Certification |url=http://gdc.net/join/index/articles99.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705084611/http://gdc.net/join/index/articles99.php |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new CGD™ certification&lt;ref name="gdc-adopts-new-mark-cgd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/article/2010/09/17/gdc-adopts-new-mark-cgd |title=GDC Adopts New Mark: CGD |date=September 17, 2010 |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/article/2010/10/19/gdc-adopts-membership-changes-in-historic-meeting |title=GDC Adopts Membership Changes in Historic Meeting |date=October 19, 2010 |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to reduce confusion over the meaning of the MGDC designation.&lt;ref name="Roodenburg2010" /&gt;

==Activities==
The GDC has been an advocate and resource for Canada's graphic and communication design profession since 1956. The GDC maintains a national certified body of graphic and communication designers and promotes high standards of graphic design and ethical business practices for the benefit of Canadian industry, commerce, public service and education.

Through the media, publications, seminars, events, conferences and exhibits, the GDC builds awareness of graphic and communication design and its essential role in business and society.

Since 1960, the GDC has been recognizing as Fellows those designers who make major contributions to Canadian graphic design. Designers who have received the honour include [[Allan Fleming]] (1960), [[Burton Kramer]] (1975), [[Chris Yaneff]] (1983), [[Paul Arthur]] (1996), [[Jim Rimmer]] (2007), and [[Mark Busse]] (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/inspiration/fellows |title=GDC Fellows |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
This coming of age story of courage and inspiring perseverance opens in 1960s [[Vienna]], where [[Shlomo Carlebach]] is giving a concert, having returned to the city for the first time in decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rabbi With a Beat and Tie-Dyed Prayers |publisher=The New York Times |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Charles Isherwood |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/theater/reviews/soul-doctor-a-musical-about-rabbi-shlomo-carlebach.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then transitions back in time to Nazi-occupied [[Austria]] when Shlomo, as a child, witnessed the murder of a Jewish man singing in the streets. This experience causes Shlomo to make a pledge to always stand up for freedom of expression through music. To escape persecution, the Carlebach family moves to the [[Upper West Side]] in New York City where Shlomo is a [[Yeshiva]] student studying the [[Talmud]] and memorizing the [[Torah]], following his father's footsteps to become a [[Rabbi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Soul Doctor: Shalom, Love, and Understanding |publisher=The Village Voice |date= August 21, 2013 |author=Tom Sellar |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-08-21/theater/soul-doctor/full/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shlomo's path soon changes when he meets the legendary jazz singer [[Nina Simone]] in a [[Greenwich Village]] night club. She not only teaches him about her [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[jazz]] musical roots, but also confesses how her people, like Jews in Europe at the time, were being persecuted in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Love, Prayer, LSD and Nina Simone: Get to Know Soul Doctor’s Rock Star Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach  |publisher=Broadway.com |date=July 31, 2013 |author=Josh Ferri |url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/170898/love-prayer-lsd-and-nina-simone-get-to-know-soul-doctors-rock-star-rabbi-shlomo-carlebach/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the music of Simone, Shlomo begins to break [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] tradition by obtaining a guitar. He is soon writing songs and playing his music for women and non-Jews in clubs around [[New York City]]. Shlomo embraces [[pop music]] and [[hippiedom]] over established scholasticism despite ramifications within his family. In the late '60s he moved to [[Haight-Ashbury]] in [[San Francisco]] where a "[[House of Love and Prayer]]" becomes his home with a following that keeps growing. During this period he played concerts alongside acts such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Grateful Dead|the Grateful Dead]], [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Jefferson Airplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Soul Doctor |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Keith Staskiewicz |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20364394_20726248,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and Nina Simone end the show back in Vienna, performing a concert in memory of the Jewish singer he saw gunned down in the street by [[Nazism|Nazis]].

Shlomo's inspired life was driven by his talent, heart and optimism. His [[inspirational message]] is clearly heard through his own songs throughout Soul Doctor, an uplifting musical for people of all ages, religions and backgrounds. His personal pledge to stand up for [[freedom of expression]] through the power of music soars with the spirit instilled in him from lessons learned throughout his unique and interesting life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Broadway Review: ‘Soul Doctor’ |publisher=Variety |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Marilyn Stasio |url=https://variety.com/2013/legit/reviews/broadway-review-soul-doctor-1200579212/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The Soul Doctor musical was reviewed by many publications following its openings in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://souldoctorbroadway.com/press.php/ Official Press Notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224062348/http://souldoctorbroadway.com/press.php |date=2013-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Siegel in Theatre Mania wrote in her review: "The story is going to be compared to ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', but the engaging and often moving new musical has a good deal more thematic depth that its predecessor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Siegel | first=Barbara | url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/reviews/08-2012/soul-doctor_60461.html | title=Soul Doctor, review | publisher=Theater Mania | date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Klug's review in Jewlicious.com concluded: "With plenty of good Jewish perspectives on the comedy of life, it had me laughing, singing and clapping ... it's so good ... [and] is only going to get better and better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Klug | first= Lisa | url= http://www.jewlicious.com/2012/08/a-spoon-full-of-shlomo/ | title='' A Spoon Full of Shlomo'' | publisher= Jewlicious.com | date=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Scheck]], in ''[[The New York Post]]'', praised [[Eric Anderson (actor)|Eric Anderson]]'s performance, writing: "Eric Anderson beautifully suggests Carlebach's soft-spoken, gentle appeal, as well as the charisma that jolted him to stardom. Erica Ash is equally superb as Simone, whether quietly conveying the singer's fierce dignity or delivering stunning versions of signature classics such as "[[Sinnerman]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Scheck | first=Frank | url= http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/theater/rocking_tale_of_star_sung_in_shlomo_VuZTYpHuLXm5N2LzepDsuK | title=SA rocking tale of '60s star sung in Shlomo | publisher=[[The New York Post]] | date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jason Zinoman also praised Anderson's performance in ''[[The New York Times]]'', writing: "Transforming from a mild-mannered rabbi into a kinetic dynamo, [[Eric Anderson (actor)|Anderson]] imbues his numbers with their own arc, often starting in a meditative mood before slowly building to a joyous, leaping roar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Zinoman | first= Jason | url= http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/theater/reviews/soul-doctor-shlomo-carlebach-new-york-theater-workshop.html | title=T''Religious Roots Tangle With the Groovy '60s'' | publisher= [[The New York Times]] | date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its 2013 opening on Broadway, the Soul Doctor show was reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Associated Press]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', and ''[[Newsday]]'', all of whom applauded Anderson's performance as [[Shlomo Carlebach|Carlebach]] while comparing the show to ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' and ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', and giving overall mixed to positive reviews of the musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review Roundup: SOUL DOCTOR Opens on Broadway - All the Reviews! |publisher=Broadway world |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Review Roundups |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Review-Roundup-SOUL-DOCTOR-Opens-on-Broadway-Updating-LIVE-20130815}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rabbi With a Beat and Tie-Dyed Prayers |publisher=The New York Times |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Charles Isherwood |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/theater/reviews/soul-doctor-a-musical-about-rabbi-shlomo-carlebach.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Soul Doctor' review: Rock-Star Rabbi |publisher=Newsday |date=August 14, 2013 |author=Steve Parks |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/theater/soul-doctor-review-rock-star-rabbi-1.5890458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Expulsion of the Déisi''''' is a medieval [[Ireland|Irish]] narrative of the [[Cycles of the Kings]]. It dates approximately to the 8th century, but survives only in manuscripts of a much later date. It describes the fictional history of the [[Déisi]], a group that had gained political power in parts of Ireland during the Early Middle Ages. Part of the text's purpose is to provide the kings of the Déisi – historically the descendants of unlanded [[vassal]]s to other tribes – with a mythical noble origin as the heirs to a dynasty expelled from [[Hill of Tara|Tara]].

The story survives in two different [[Old Irish]] versions, which contain essentially the same narrative supplemented by singular additions, including tangential episodes, lists of names, and poetry. After violently recovering his niece from the depredations of the king's son of Tara, [[Óengus Gaíbúaibthech]] and his followers are dispossessed by the king and sent to wander Ireland. They tarry in [[Leinster]] for a period, but are eventually expelled from that kingdom as well.  When military prowess fails them, they are able to forge a home for themselves through cunning and magic in [[Munster]] against the [[Kingdom of Ossory|Osraige]]. As with much early Irish literature, the digressive [[onomastics|onomastic]] and genealogical material is of great value. In particular, one passage describes a Déisi branch settling in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and founding the [[Kingdom of Dyfed]], a matter of some interest in the context of early Irish migrations to Britain.

==Versions and manuscripts==
The story survives in an earlier and a later version, which [[Kuno Meyer]] dubbed "A" and "B".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; The A version dates to the 8th century, but exists only in manuscripts of a significantly later date.&lt;ref name=Meyer102&gt;Meyer, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; It survives complete in Laud MS 610 and [[Rawlinson B 502|Rawlinson MS 502]], and in fragmentary form in the [[Book of Uí Maine]] and the Liber Flavus Fergusiorum.&lt;ref name=Meyer102/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1954, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the complete copies, Meyer notes that the Rawlinson text contains fewer errors, but that Laud preserves more archaic spelling.&lt;ref name=Meyer102/&gt; The B version survives in some form in three manuscripts. The oldest of these is a fragment contained in the [[Book of the Dun Cow]]; this copy is complemented by the later two, found in H. 3. 17 and H. 2. 5, allowing for reconstruction of the text.&lt;ref name=Meyer103&gt;Meyer, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The H. 2. 5 copy further contains several poems absent from the other manuscripts.

The title is recorded variously in the manuscripts. Rawlinson contains ''Tairired na n'Déssi'', or ''The Journeying of the Déisi.''&lt;ref name=Meyernote&gt;Meyer, p. 102 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; Laud records it as ''De causis torche n'Déssi''/''acuis toirge na n'Déssi''. The word ''torche/toirge'' is obscure, but Meyer associates it with "expedition".&lt;ref name=Meyernote/&gt; The B manuscripts all contain some reference to the injury visited upon [[Cormac mac Airt]], one of the characters: the Book of the Dun Cow has ''Tucait innarba na n'Dési im Mumain &amp; aided Cormaic'', H. 3. 17 has ''Cóechad Cormaic i Temraig'', and H. 2. 5 has ''Tucaid cháetcha Cormaic do Aengus Gaibuaibtheach &amp; aigeag Ceallaig &amp; fotha indarbtha na nDeissi do Muig Breag''.&lt;ref name=Meyer103/&gt; [[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville]]'s ''Catalogue'' further lists two possibly related titles: ''Longes Eithne Uathaige'' and ''Tochomlad na nDési a Temraig''.&lt;ref&gt;d'Arbois de Jubainville, p. 171, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unknown to which version, if either, these refer.&lt;ref name=Meyer103/&gt;

==Background==
{{main article|Déisi}}
The term ''[[Déisi]]'' initially designated various subject peoples owing tribute to landowning tribes. It derives from the [[Old Irish]] ''déis'', meaning "client(s)" or "vassalry"; this distinguishes it from other Irish ethonyms that derive from ancestors' personal names.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Expulsion of the Déisi'' concerns one such group, the [[Déisi Muman]] of [[Kingdom of Munster|Munster]], who lived primarily in the present-day counties of [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] and were subject to the [[Eóganachta]] dynasty. Over time, the Déisi Muman grew in power, and were prominent enough to found their own local kingdom at a fairly early date. The various groups designated ''Déisi'' were not originally closely related, but by the mid-8th century, following the rise of the Déisi Muman, they came to be seen as a genealogically linked whole, descended from the same noble ancestors. ''The Explulsion of the Déisi'' gives a mythical origin narrative for the then powerful Déisi Muman and associated groups.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, pp. 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Expulsion of the Déisi'' was long considered a more or less historically accurate account of a mass displacement of the Déisi and their subsequent settlement on the southwestern coast of Ireland and elsewhere. This was later disputed by scholars such as [[Eoin MacNeill|John MacNeill]], [[Patrick C. Power]], [[T. F. O'Rahilly]], and Séamus Pender, who regard it as late fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1959, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
Both versions describe the adventures of the Déisi forefathers in the time of [[Cormac mac Airt]], [[King of Tara]]. They follow the same narrative track, but both contain sections that break from the main narrative and tell individual, largely unrelated stories about the Déisi and their contemporaries. A contains episodes not in B, and vice versa.

===A version===
In the A version, the Déisi are led by the four sons of Artchorp: Brecc, [[Óengus Gaíbúaibthech]] (Óengus of the Dread Spear), Eochaid Allmuir (Eochaid the Foreigner), and Forad. Forad's daughter Forach is raped and kidnapped by Conn (elsewhere Cellach), the "wanton son" of Cormac maic Airt. Óengus, who leads a band of fifty men, goes to [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] to rescue her. When Conn refuses to release the girl, Óengus runs him through with his "dread spear", which blinds Cormac in one eye in the process. Because the law forbids a high king to have a physical blemish, Cormac must retire to a [[ráth]] outside Tara, and defer the kingship to his son [[Cairbre Lifechair]]. Undeterred, Cormac raises his forces against the Déisi and expels them from Tara. Óengus, together with his brother Brecc's sons Russ and Eogan, engages the king in seven battles. After forty days Óengus succeeds Brecc as king of the Déisi, but steps down due to "murmurs" about his consolidation of the power of both champion and king. Cormac will not give the Déisi a fair fight, and pushes them into [[Leinster]], where the local ruler Fiachu Bacceda drives the [[Uí Bairrche]] from their land and gives it to the Déisi. They remain there for three decades.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 104–109 (sect. 1–6).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the Uí Bairrche warrior Eochu Guinech ejects the Déisi and they are compelled to move further south into Ard Ladrann, thereafter known as the "Land of the Wandering Host". Section 8 tells the story of Ethne the Dread, daughter of then King of Leinster [[Crimthann mac Énnai]] (d. 483) and an eventual fosterling of the Déisi. At her birth a [[druid]] prophesies that under Ethne her mother's kindred will seize what will be their homeland; hearing this her parents feed her the flesh of young boys to accelerate her growth. Meanwhile, Cormac continues to harass Óengus and the Déisi, stirring up discord among their warriors and leaders. He sends a peace offer to Russ and Eogan, the sons of Brecc, offering them absolution and land if they return to his service. Óengus promises them yet more land and preeminence over his children for them to remain.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 108–115 (sect. 7–12).&lt;/ref&gt;

When Crimthann mac Énnai dies, his sons turn on the Déisi, driving them out of Leinster altogether. They settle briefly in [[Kingdom of Osraige|Osraige]], but the king burns down their houses, leaving them homeless and forced to wander west into [[Munster]]. They receive some relief when [[Óengus mac Nad Froích]] (d. 489), King of Munster, proposes to marry Ethne the Dread, who has been traveling with the Déisi. He offers to grant her any three demands as the dowry. Ethne requests land for her mother's kindred, fulfilling her prophecy; she also requests that Osraige be cleared of its inhabitants and given to the Déisi, and that her people be as free as the "three [[Eóganachta|Eoganacht]] of Munster". Óengus grants her wishes, but the Déisi are unable to oust the residents of Osraige. With the help of Lugaid Laigde Cosc, the seer-judge of the [[Corcu Loígde]] and [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]], they devise a trick: learning of a prophecy that whichever side draws first blood the next day will be routed, the Déisi druids transform one of their men into a red cow. The men of Osraige kill the cow, thereby sealing their fate; they are pushed across the Lingaun River, which thereafter serves as the border between the Déisi and Osraige. The Déisi divide up their land, and most of the remainder of the text lists names of individual Déisi and [[sept]]s descended from them.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 114–131 (sect. 13–23).&lt;/ref&gt;

===B version===

The B version contains the same basic narrative, with significant additions and subtractions. It was edited (Irish only) by Meyer in ''Anecdd.'' I,&lt;ref&gt;Kuno Meyer, ed., ''Tucait indarba na nD&amp;eacute;ssi'' (Expulsion of the Déssi), in ''Anecdota from Irish Manuscripts'', vol. i. (1907), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdUfAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15 pp.15-24]&lt;/ref&gt; with TCD MS 1316 (olim H. 2.15a), pp.&amp;nbsp;67a-68b (''H'' text) as base, with footnoted readings from MS 1336 (olim H. 3.17), col. 720b-723a (''h'' text).

It likewise begins with the kidnapping of Forach by Cormac's son (here Cellach), but in this version Óengus is initially too busy avenging family insults with his famous spear to save her. It is only after he is rebuked for his dithering by a woman – whom he kills – that he rescues Forach, killing Cellach and blinding Cormac in the process. The story continues with the Déisi's expulsion from Tara, their sojourn in Leinster, and their patriation in Munster following the marriage arrangement between Ethne the Dread and Óengus mac Nad Froích. Here, however, aid in exploiting the prophecy that ultimately allows them to displace the men of Osraige comes not from a seer-judge, but from the "haughty daughter" of the Osraige druid who delivers the prognostication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/dessi2.html ''This Is The Cause Of The Expulsion Of The Déssi To Munster And The Violent Death Of Cormac'', sect. 1–15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the material not in the A version, by far the most substantial is in a lengthy tangential episode dealing with the birth and childhood of Óengus' foster son Corc Duibne, progenitor of the [[Corcu Duibne]], whose name is merely mentioned in A. Corc and his brother are born of incest to Coirpre Múse and Duihind, children of the king of Munster [[Conaire Cóem]], and their nativity brings famine to the land. The people want them immolated, but Corc is saved by a druid and his wife who take him to an offshore island so that his curse is removed from Ireland. The druid's wife, Boí, performs purification rituals that ultimately transfer Corc's curse to an otherworldy white cow, allowing him to return to his family. Eventually he serves as hostage in Cormac mac Airt's court, where he is fostered by Óengus; he accompanies his foster father when he is expelled from Tara. He tries to convince the wandering Déisi to settle on the island of his rearing, and stays there when the Déisi opt to move on to Cashel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/dessi2.html ''This Is The Cause Of The Expulsion Of The Déssi To Munster And The Violent Death Of Cormac'', sect. 1–12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The variant text MS 1336 (olim H. 3.17) occurs with the different title, ''Cóecad Cormaic i Temraig'' (Blinding of Cormac at Tara); and this text is also postscripted by a tract which alleges that the Crimall, the spear in the age of Cormac, was also the same weapon as the [[Lúin of Celtchar]] and the spear of [[Lugh]].&lt;ref&gt;Arbois de Jubainville, ''Essai d'un catalogue'', p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dyfed==
Section 11 of A describes Eochaid son of Artchorp traveling oversea with his descendants and settling in ''Demed'' ([[Demetia]], later known as [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]] in [[Wales]]). From Eochaid and his descendants springs the line of kings of Dyfed, whose descent is given down to "Tualodor mac Rígin" (Tudor map Regin).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; This genealogy has much correspondence with pedigrees in Welsh sources, namely the [[Harleian genealogies]] and the later [[genealogies from Jesus College MS 20]]. The Harleian records show the same names from Tudor back to the figure Triphun, given in ''Expulsion'' as Eochaid's great-grandson. However, Harleian gives an entirely different pedigree for Triphun himself, tracing his descent back to the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmatthews.org.uk/history/harleian_genealogies/2.html Harleian genealogy 2].&lt;/ref&gt; This could be an attempt by later genealogists to give a more illustrious pedigree to Dyfed's kingly line, or possibly to obscure its Irish origins. However, it could be that Harleian preserves the older and more accurate version, and that the ''Expulsion'' version is a later textual corruption.

Regardless, there is indeed evidence of early Irish presence in Dyfed and elsewhere in Britain. [[Ogham]] inscriptions in an early form of [[Irish language|Irish]] have been found in [[Pembrokeshire]] and [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref name=TCW163&gt;Charles-Williams, p. 163 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, later literary sources from both sides of the [[Irish Sea]] discuss the presence of southern Irish peoples in Britain. The 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', for instance, refers to the [[Uí Liatháin]] being active in Dyfed until they were pushed out by [[Cunedda]] and his sons (fl. mid-5th century).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:History of the Britons#1:14|''Historia Brittonum'', ch. 14]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cormac's Glossary]]'' also mentions the oversea exploits of the Uí Liatháin, but locates their fortress in [[Cornwall]] rather than Dyfed.&lt;ref name=TCW163/&gt; However, only ''The Expulsion of the Déisi'' attests a specifically Déisi presence. [[Eoin MacNeill]], who treats the literary accounts as largely historical, suggests that a Déisi settlement in Dyfed could have existed as a subordinate unit to a larger Uí Liatháin-led colony until the latter was expelled under Cunedda.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, pp. 128–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caricature gillray plumpudding.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Plumb-pudding in danger; - or - State Epicures taking un Petit Souper'']]

'''''The Plumb-pudding in danger, or, State Epicures taking un Petit Souper''''', is an 1805 [[editorial cartoon]] by the English artist [[James Gillray]].  The [[popular print]] depicts caricatures of the [[British Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt the Younger]] and the newly-crowned [[Emperor of France]] [[Napoleon]], both wearing military uniforms, carving up a [[terrestrial globe]] into [[spheres of influence]].  It was published as a hand-coloured print and has been described by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] as "probably Gillray's most famous print" and by the [[British Library]] as "one of Gillray’s most famous satires dealing with the Napoleonic wars".

==Background==
Gillray's print is a satire on the overtures made by Napoleon in January 1805 for a reconciliation with Britain during the [[War of the Third Coalition]].  The short-lived [[Peace of Amiens]], a treaty between Britain and France, had ended in 1803, and Napoleon was [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|threatening to invade Britain]] with his [[Grande Armée]] based at Boulogne.  

The peace overtures came to naught: before the end of the year, a combined Franco-Spanish fleet would be decisively defeated by the [[Royal Navy]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], giving Britain unrivalled control of the seas, but Napoleon would establish a dominant position in Europe by first defeating an Austrian army through manoeuvre in the [[Ulm Campaign]], and then winning a great victory over a combined Russian-Austrian army at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], ending the Third Coalition with the 1805 [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]].

==Description==
Pitt and Napoleon are seated on opposite sides of a [[dining table]], each using a [[carving knife]] and [[carving fork]] to cut pieces from a large spherical [[plum pudding]] bearing a [[world map|map of the world]], with the [[British Isles]] at the centre between them.  The scene is replete with iconography referring to the contemporary political situation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].
 
Pitt, sitting to the left, is depicted tall and emaciated.  He wears a [[red coat (military uniform)|red regimental uniform]] of the [[British Army]] - perhaps the [[Cinque Port Volunteer Corps]] that he had raised in Kent - with powdered hair in a [[queue (hairstyle)|queue]], and a cocked [[tricorn]] hat.  His fork resembles a three-pronged trident, referring to Britain's naval might, and he is carving a slice of sea to the west of the British Isles marked "ocean" and "[[West Indies]]".  

Napoleon, to the right, the "little corporal", is much smaller in height and stockier in build, with a prominent hooked nose.  He wears the blue coat of the [[Imperial French Army]], and his large fore-and-aft [[bicorn]] hat has an extravagant feather plume reminiscent of a [[Gallic rooster|French cock]].  His large knife resembles a military sword, and his two-pronged fork is embedded over a region marked "[[Hanover]]", home of the ruling British monarchs of the [[House of Hanover]].  He is cutting away a slice of land to the east of the British Isles marked "Europe", but his piece of land is much smaller than Pitt's portion of sea.  

The pudding rests on a large gold platter at the centre of the table, which is covered by a white tablecloth.  Pitt and Napoleon each have a smaller gold plate ready for their slices, Pitt's bearing the [[British Royal Coat of Arms]] and Napoleon's an [[imperial crown]].  The back of Pitt's chair is decorated with the image of lion carrying a [[cross of St George]] (sometimes a [[Union Flag]]) and Napoleon's has an [[French Imperial Eagle|Imperial eagle]] clutching a [[Phrygian cap|''bonnet rouge'']].  

The printing plate measures {{convert|10.25|x|14.25|in}} and was typically impressed on paper measuring around {{convert|10.5|x|15|in}}.  The print includes at top left the title "The Plumb-pudding in danger; - or - State Epicures taking un Petit Souper" the latter half in French, meaning 'state [[gourmet]]s taking a little [[supper]]' - "Epicures" refers to the Greek [[hedonist]] philosopher [[Epicurus]].  Below this is a quotation attributed to [[William Windham]] in the ''[[Political Register]]'' newspaper, but actually taken from Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', Act 4, Scene 1, lines 153-4:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"The great Globe itself and all which it inherit", is too small to satisfy such insatiable appetites.
                                                         - - Vide Mr W-d-m's eccentricities, in ye Political Register.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An inscription also records that the print was designed and made by James Gillray, but it was not numbered or signed.

==Reception==
The print was published by [[Hannah Humphrey]], of 27 [[St James's Street]] in London, on 26 February 1805, and was originally sold for about five shillings.  There are examples in many museum and private collections.  It has been described by [[Martin Rowson]] as "probably the most famous political cartoon of all time … stolen over and over and over again by cartoonists ever since".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Rowson]], speaking on ''The Secret of Drawing'', presented by [[Andrew Graham Dixon]], [[BBC Television]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Way of the Sufi''''' was the best-selling follow-up introduction to [[Sufism]] by the writer [[Idries Shah]] after the publication of his first book on the subject, ''[[The Sufis]]''. Whereas ''The Sufis'' eschewed academic norms such as footnotes and an index, ''The Way of the Sufi'' provided a full section of notes and a bibliography at the end of its first chapter, entitled "The Study of Sufism in the West".

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''The Way of the Sufi'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Summary==
As in ''[[The Sufis]]'', Shah gave potted biographies of some of the best known Sufis of the ages, while adding brief descriptions of four of the major Sufi orders, or Tariqas: the [[Chishti Order|Chisti]] Order, [[Qadiriyyah|Qadiri]] Order, [[Suhrawardiyya|Suhrawardi]] Order and [[Naqshbandi]] Order. In addition there were a number of Sufi [[teaching stories]] as well as question-and-answer sessions with Sufi teachers. Continuing a theme from the previous book, Shah argued that Sufism had greatly influenced Western civilisation over the centuries, but that this had largely gone unrecognised, citing examples such as [[Chaucer]], [[Shakespeare]], the [[William Tell]] legend, the former [[United Nations]] secretary-general [[Dag Hammarskjoeld]] and the works of [[Sir Richard Burton]] amongst others. In the East, he also said that Sufism had influenced certain aspects of [[Hinduism]] as well as [[Zen Buddhism]].

==Reception==
The book was well received on publication, with the [[BBC]]'s ''The Critics'' programme declaring it an "outstanding book of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Théâtre de l'Athénée''' is a theatre at 7 rue Boudreau, in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]]. Renovated in 1996 and classified a historical monument, it is among the most beautiful{{Who|date=August 2011}} buildings in [[Paris]].  In addition to its architectural treasures, the Athénée inherits an artistic tradition marked by the figure of [[Louis Jouvet]] who directed the theatre from 1934 to 1951. During the period when he was director, it became known as the '''Athenée Théâtre Louis-Jouvet'''.

== History ==

The current Théâtre de l'Athénée was constructed from a foyer (part of the former [[Éden-Théâtre]]), which was converted into an intimate theatre in 1893 by the architect Stanislas Loison with further modifications carried out by the architect Paul Fouquiau in 1894.&lt;ref name=ANNUAIRE/&gt; It opened on 31 December 1894 under the name '''Théâtre de la Comédie-Parisienne'''.&lt;ref name=Lecomte21/&gt;

Oscar Wilde's play ''[[Salomé (play)|Salomé]]'' (originally written in French) was premiered there on 11 February 1896 in a staging by [[Lugné-Poe]]'s theatre group, the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2009, pp. 98, 106, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The location had become rather unsafe, as demolition work on the Éden-Théâtre was in progress all around it. The police considered banning the performances due to the risk of fire or accident. Their concerns were somewhat reduced by the construction of a temporary 12-meter-long passageway from the theatre to the rue Boudreau.&lt;ref&gt;Tydeman &amp; Price 1996, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year the construction work on the site of the former Éden theatre was finally completed by Fouquiau, and the theatre was reconstituted as the Athénée-Comique,&lt;ref name=ANNUAIRE/&gt; "from the name of a notoriously frivolous, perhaps immoral, establishment nearby that had to close ten years earlier" [see [[Théâtre de l'Athénée (rue Scribe)]]].&lt;ref name=Hartnoll&gt;Hartnoll 1983, "Athénée, Théâtre d l'", p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was renamed Athénée in 1899.&lt;ref name=ANNUAIRE/&gt; For the first 40 years it was the home of [[Comédie en vaudevilles|''vaudevilles'']], comedies, and melodramas.&lt;ref name=Hartnoll/&gt;

In 1934 [[Louis Jouvet]] took control of the theatre and made it famous. He continued to produce and perform there (not exclusively, however), until his death in 1951.&lt;ref name=Hartnoll/&gt; Among the premieres under Jouvet were several plays by [[Jean Giraudoux]], including ''[[Tessa (play)|Tessa]]'' (14 November 1934), ''[[La guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu]]'' (''The Trojan War Will Not Take Place''; 21 November 1935), ''[[Supplément au voyage de Cook]]'' (''The Virtuous Island''; 21 November 1935), ''[[Electra (Giraudoux)|Electre]]'' (13 May 1937), ''[[L'impromptu de Paris]]'' (3 December 1937), ''[[Ondine (play)|Ondine]]'' (3 May 1939), and ''[[La folle de Chaillot]]'' (''The Madwoman of Chaillot''; 22 December 1945),&lt;ref&gt;Garreau 1984b, p. 324,&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Marcel Achard]]'s ''Le corsaire'' (25 March 1938)&lt;ref&gt;Liebowitz Knapp 1957, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[Les bonnes]]'' (''The Maids''; 19 April 1947).&lt;ref&gt;Garreau 1984a, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Jouvet's most successful revivals was [[Molière]]'s ''[[L'école des femmes]]'' (''The School for Wives''; 9 May 1936; 446 performances, plus another 229 on tour), in which Jouvet performed the role of Arnolphe.&lt;ref&gt;Liebowitz Knapp 1957, p. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Renoir]], who had been an actor in Jouvet's troupe, was artistic director, briefly, from 1951 until his death the following year.

In the 2000s the Théâtre Athénée presented revivals of operetta and musical comedy, among which the Brigands company produced ''[[Le docteur Ox]]'' (2003), ''Ta Bouche'' (2004), ''Toi c'est moi'' (2005) and ''Arsène Lupin Banquier'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://comedie-musicale.jgana.fr/theatres.htm L'encyclopédie multimedia de la comédie musicale théâtrale en France (1918-1940)], accessed 9 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Typesetters Sorting Case.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century type case, with various tools for typesetting]]
A '''type case''' is a compartmentalized wooden box used to store [[movable type]] used in [[letterpress printing]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, Fred (1992). "Origin of the California Job Case". ''Type &amp; Press'', fall 1992. http://www.apa-letterpress.com/T%20&amp;%20P%20ARTICLES/Type/California%20Job%20Case.html Accessed online 2 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern, factory-produced movable type was available in the late nineteenth century. It was held in the printing shop in a ''job case'', a drawer about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high, three feet wide, and about two feet deep, with many small compartments for the "[[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]]" (various letters and ligatures). The most popular and commonly used job case design in America was the [[California Job Case]], which took its name from the Pacific Coast location of the foundries that made the case popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amateurpress.org/bundle/camp194.htm National Amateur Press Association], Monthly Bundle Sample, Campane 194, ''The California Typecase'', Lewis A. Pryor, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; These cases allowed type to be compactly transported.

Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate drawer, or case, placed above the case holding the other letters (this is why the capital letters are called "uppercase" characters, and the minuscules are "lower case").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewSglB2f7qYC|title=Glossary of Typesetting Terms|last=Eckersley|first=Richard|last2=Angstadt|first2=Richard|last3=Ellertson|first3=Charles M.|last4=Hendel|first4=Richard|date=2008-04-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226183732|page=18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a great variety of cases, and also variations in the "lay", or the assignment of the sorts into the compartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Type case lay selection|url=http://www.alembicpress.co.uk/Alembicprs/SELCASE.HTM|publisher=The Alembic Press|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different printers had different house layouts even for the same design of case.

'''Used bookstores''' buy and sell [[used book]]s and [[out-of-print book]]s. A range of titles is available in used bookstores, including in print and out-of-print books. Book collectors tend to frequent used book stores. Large online bookstores offer used books for sale, too. Individuals wishing to sell their used books using online bookstores agree to terms outlined by the bookstore(s): for example, paying the online bookstore(s) a predetermined commission once the books have sold.

Used bookstores can range in size offering from several hundred to several hundred thousands of titles. They may be [[brick and mortar store|brick-and-mortar store]]s, [[Online shopping|internet-only stores]], or a combination of both. A [[book town]] is a locale where numerous bookstores are located and serve as the town's main attraction to [[tourist]]s.

==Bookstore tourism==

[[Bookstore tourism]] is a type of [[cultural tourism]] that promotes [[independent bookstore]]s as a group travel destination.  It started as a [[grassroots]] effort to support locally owned and operated bookshops, many of which have struggled to compete with large bookstore chains and online retailers. The project was initiated by Larry Portzline, a writer and college instructor in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] who led "bookstore road trips" to other cities and recognized its potential as a group travel niche and marketing tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishingbasics.com/newsletter/march2005/lportzline.html Larry Portzline]&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous bookstore tourism destination is [[Hay-on-Wye]] in [[Wales]].

In 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued that the [[Pioneer Valley]] in [[Western Massachusetts]], is the "most author-saturated, book-cherishing, literature-celebrating place in" the [[United States]]. &lt;ref name=valleyoftheliterate&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/travel/escapes/16North.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin In the Valley of the Literate]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it discussed three bookshops in the region, ''[[Amherst Books]]'' in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], ''[[Broadside Bookshop]]'' in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], and ''[[The Odyssey Bookshop]]'' in [[South Hadley]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=valleyoftheliterate/&gt;

In 2008, ''[[USA Today]]'' listed nine top bookstore travel destinations in the [[United States]] as: ''[[Books &amp; Books]]'' in [[Coral Gables, Florida]]; ''[[City Lights Books]]'' in [[San Francisco]]; ''[[The Elliott Bay Book Company]]'' in [[Seattle]]; ''[[Politics and Prose]]'' in [[Washington, DC]]; ''[[Powell's Bookstore|Powell's Books]]'' in [[Portland, Oregon]]; ''[[Prairie Lights]]'' in [[Iowa City, Iowa]]; ''[[Tattered Cover]]'' in [[Denver, Colorado]]; ''[[That Bookstore in Blytheville]]'' in  [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]; and the ''[[Strand Book Store]]'' in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2008-01-09-nine-bookstore-destinations_N.htm Nine destination bookstores worth putting on a tourist's itinerary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookstore tourism is encouraged by organizations such as the Massachusetts and Rhode Island Antiquarian Booksellers (MARIAB).  Founded in 1976, the organization has 125 business members {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, publicizes its member bookstores with a website and a free annual directory booklet, and sponsors an annual "Pioneer Valley Book &amp; Ephemera Fair".&lt;ref name=MARIAB&gt;{{cite web|title=[Homepage]|url=http://www.mariab.org|work=Massachusetts and Rhode Island Antiquarian Booksellers (MARIAB)|publisher=Massachusetts and Rhode Island Antiquarian Booksellers, Inc.
