      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26248">[[Julia Kristeva|Julia Kristeva’s]] theory of [[abjection]] produces many implications that cause us to think about how we position ourselves between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Kristeva posits that women are abjected as they represent a “suffocating return to the archaic maternal body”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy and the Maternal Body|last=Boulous Walker|first=Michelle|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1998|isbn=|location=London|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or more specifically, the return to immanence (death). In [[modernity]], the use of the abjected maternal or feminine body is utilised in popular culture to elicit horror from audiences. This, sometimes inadvertently, subverts the [[patriarchy]]’s grip on society and brings to light the oppression of women.{{REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE WHEN CLOSING THIS AfD}}

=== Lady Gaga ===
During the course of her ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' album cycle, [[Lady Gaga]] harnessed the abject in order to bring the repressed maternal to the forefront of her performances. In her ''[[Born This Way Ball]]'' world tour, Gaga commenced the concert by being birthed out of a large inflatable vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/lady-gaga-enters-through-giant-1547850|title=Lady Gaga shocks fans by climbing out of a giant inflatable vagina for her Born This Way Ball|last=Robertson|first=James|date=January 21, 2013|website=Mirror|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was met by considerable audience disgust, as it threatened the breakdown of our reality, and our distinction between subject and object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Theory: The Key Concepts|last=Felluga|first=Dino|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her infamous [[Born This Way (song)|''Born This Way'' video]], Gaga created a new religious scripture in which the mother is the almighty god. In this video, Gaga discusses the birth of a new race under ‘Mother Monster’, as the “wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began”, she exclaims that this moment of birth is not temporal, but eternal. Upon its release, this video was scalded for relying on shock tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/31300/1/a-look-back-at-lady-gaga-s-misunderstood-masterpiece|title=A look back at Lady Gaga's misunderstood masterpiece|last=Hall|first=Jake|date=May 30, 2016|website=Dazed|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction is perhaps unsurprising due to the way Gaga used the abjected site of the maternal in order to challenge our evolutionary instinct to reject death. Gaga consistently uses the abject to shock audiences and bring attention to the oppression of women in modernity. In 2014, Gaga performed at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] (South by Southwest) and included in this performance her song titled [[Swine (song)|Swine]], a song about sexual assault against women. For this performance Gaga brought performance artist [[Millie Brown (performance artist)|Millie Brown]] to the stage, whom of which began to vomit green paint over Gaga’s body while she played the drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-stages-dramatic-performance-art-spectacle-at-sxsw-197152/.|title=Lady Gaga Stages Dramatic Performance-Art Spectacle at SXSW|last=Edwards|first=Gavin|date=March 14, 2014|website=Rolling Stone|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Using the abject materials of oral disgust and waste&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Body in Western Culture: Contemporary Perspectives|last=Kristeva|first=Julia|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; , Gaga attempted to emphasise the way in which women are objectified and abused by men. It is a cunning juxtaposition as Gaga sings about her experience with sexual assault and vomit is hurled onto her body. A similar sentiment lies in her infamous ‘meat dress’. Using the abject material of blood and flesh that draped over her body, Gaga left people speechless and in a state of utter disgust. It was only later that Gaga revealed she had worn the dress as a statement against the “[[Don't ask, don't tell|Don’t Ask Don’t Tell]]” policy which silenced gay soldiers in the United States military. On the Ellen Show, Gaga exclaimed “if we don't stand up for what we believe in, if we don't fight for our rights, pretty soon we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/956399/lady-gaga-explains-her-meat-dress-its-no-disrespect|title=Lady Gaga Explains Her Meat Dress: It's No Disrespect|last=Mapes|first=Jillian|date=September 13, 2010|website=Billboard|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;This makes clear the potential of Julia Kristeva’s theory of abjection to create social change.

=== Björk ===
Icelandic artist [[Björk]] is well known for her outlandish style and eccentric performances. Her latest album, ''[[Utopia (Björk album)|Utopia]]'' is accompanied by a plethora of abject imagery that run parallel with the feminist lyricism of the album. The album cover depicts a creature-like Björk with a bird fetus nestled in her neck, and a vagina growing from her forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rocknyc.live/bjork-announces-utopia-with-a-vagina-inspired-album-cover.html|title=Björk Announces 'Utopia' With A Vagina-Inspired Album Cover|last=Camus|first=Alyson|date=November 3, 2017|website=Rock NYC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively uses the abject in order to bring the maternal to the public sphere, forcing us to come to terms with our origin, and consequently, our imminent death. In her music video for ''[[The Gate (song)|The Gate]],'' Björk constructs a utopia of her own, rife with the symbolism of female genitalia which is played alongside birdsongs and a flute arrangement. This is another instance in which Björk has celebrated the maternal, and thus emphasised the silencing of such through our reaction to the “matriarchal tapestry” she weaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/11/23/bjork-utopia-review-sex-feminism|title=The pro-women vision of Björk's Utopia|last=Myers|first=Owen|date=November 23, 2017|website=Fader|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ariana Grande ===
It is only in recent times that American pop artist [[Ariana Grande]] has reinforced the notion of abjection within her own works. While she hinted towards a more female oriented approach on songs and videos such as ''[[Dangerous Woman (song)|Dangerous Woman]]'', it is one of her latest releases, off her 2018 album ''[[Sweetener (album)|Sweetener]]'', that has proven to manifest as Kristeva proposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection|last=Kristeva|first=Julia|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=Manhattan, NY|pages=i.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[God Is a Woman|God is a woman]]'' has quickly become a cornerstone of powerful female sexuality both in and outside of the [[private sphere]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/13/ariana-grande-god-is-a-woman-new-music-video-watch-female-lord-history|title=God is a Woman: Ariana Grande taps into a long herstory of a female lord|last=Mahdawi|first=Arwa|date=July 18, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themuse.jezebel.com/ariana-grande-makes-us-pray-to-a-feminist-woman-god-1827475713|title=Ariana Grande Makes Us Pray to a Feminist Woman God|last=Hope|first=Clover|last2=Finger|first2=Bobby|date=July 13, 2018|website=The Muse|publisher=Jezebel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018|last3=Sherman|first3=Maria|last4=Garza|first4=Frida|last5=Shaffer|first5=Claire}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with rewritings of both history and mythology from a female (and symbiotically [[Feminism|feminist]]) perspective. The overarching message is one of women’s sexual empowerment, and while that is heavily reflected in the lyricism, the accompanying music video leaves audiences with additional images and symbols of the [[Goddess|divine feminine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHLHSlExFis|title=God is a woman|last=Grande|first=Ariana|date=July 13, 2018|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolism and commentary in the form of a variety of depictions of the [[vagina]] are evident&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ariana-grandes-god-is-a-woman-vagina-references|title=Ariana Grande’s ‘God Is a Woman’ Music Video Is Full of Vagina References|last=Rearick|first=Lauren|date=July 13, 2018|website=Teen Vogue|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; through various poses and hand gestures especially. The rewriting of spirituality with the phrase “God is a woman” repeated throughout, and the final image of Grande as God in a reimagining of ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'' reaffirms this call for female uprising, and challenges our society’s preconceived notions of what is and is not kept private; is a direct confrontation of the patriarchy and what women should “keep” of themselves solely for the pleasure or wants of the men that own them. However, the retaliation from religious sects especially reinstates the notion of abjection, as people of dogmatic faith claim Grande committed blasphemy in her lyrics and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://readbloomjoy.com/2018/07/21/ariana-grandes-new-song-god-is-a-woman-has-christians-triggered/|title=Ariana Grande's New Song 'God is a woman' Has Christians Triggered|last=Gabrielle|first=Lex|date=July 2018|website=BloomJoyCollective|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grande’s use of this supremely maternal narrative, the notion that God is a woman because of their (or his or her, depending on perspective) divinity, sexual liberation and power of creation drives the message of abjection in modernity home.

== Film ==

=== Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 ===
Defined as a film in the ‘splatter’ subgenre of horror films, ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2|Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'' harnesses the abject in a peculiar way. Horror is often defined as a misogynistic or heteronormative genre, but as [[Jack Halberstam]] makes clear, these ‘splatter’ films often use the abject to present queerness, or the unrecognisable human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters|last=Halberstam|first=Judith|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=North Carolina|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,'' bodies are brutalised by the chainsaw, and what we are left with is the excess flesh that survives the chainsaw, forming a queer and gender indifferent identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and The Technology of Monsters|last=Halberstam|first=Judith|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=North Carolina|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;According to Jack Halberstam, in this film we are subjected to the abject in the form of blood, flesh, etc., which change the bodily terrain of ‘man’ and ‘woman’. A ‘splattered’ or bloody body is queer, as it subverts the connotations of masculinity and femininity through an unrecognisable sea of tarnished flesh. 

=== Teeth ===
In the film [[Teeth (film)|Teeth]] (2007), the theories of Julia Kristeva’s on abjection and Barbara Creed’s monstrous-feminine can be explored.

Teeth is a [[Comedy horror|horror comedy]] film and [[Coming-of-age story]] written and directed by [[Mitchell Lichtenstein]] and stars [[Jess Weixler]] as Dawn, an outspoken activist of an abstinence-only group at her high school, while trying to suppress her own budding sexual desires.

The story follows Dawns’ journey of sexual discovery, however, takes a dark turn after Dawn and her new boyfriend Toby take a swim together at a local swimming hole. Toby forces himself onto Dawn, and when she tries to resist he assaults her and knocks her unconscious and proceeds to rape her. Toby is swiftly punished for sexually debasing Dawn with the masculine weapon of rape, as Dawn’s body savagely fights back, and severs Toby’s penis with her vagina. 

Through the violent act of rape and subsequent removal of Toby’s penis, Dawn discovers she is the living embodiment of the myth of the [[Vagina dentata|Vagina Dentata]] or “the toothed vagina” – the vagina that castrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=Penguin|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this act, Dawn is immediately rendered unnatural to the viewer and abject. &amp;nbsp;

Freud wrote that “Probably no male human being is spared the terrifying shock of threatened castration at the sight of the female genitals,”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fetishism', On Sexuality|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Penguin|year=1981|isbn=|series=Pelican Freud Library|volume=7|location=Harmondsworth|pages=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creed expands on this thought and states that “[[Castration anxiety]] is a central concern of the horror film - particularly the slasher sub-genre. Woman's body is slashed and mutilated, not only to signify her own castrated state, but also the possibility of castration for the male.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creed|first=Barbara|date=1986|title=Horror and the Monstrous-Feminine - an Imaginary Abjection|url=|journal=Screen|volume=27 (1)|pages=52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creed describes how the sight of the female genitals is monstrous-feminine as the role of ‘the archaic mother’, as the absence of a penis is proof that castration can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creed|first=Barbara|date=1986|title=Horror and the Monstrous-Feminine - an Imaginary Abjection|url=|journal=Screen|volume=27 (1)|pages=63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Dawn is the physical manifestation of [[Castration anxiety]] for males with her vagina dentata, she is made monstrous-feminine. 

Through the film Dawn learns she has evolved to have this power and learns to control it through other sexual encounters. During her initial research of her vagina dentata, she discovers that to be ‘cured’ a male hero is to conquer vagina dentata through sexual intercourse, and thus restoring the woman to her ‘proper place’ in the ‘natural’ (patriarchal) order of the world. 

What makes this film different from the usual misogynistic and patriarchal themes and tropes found in a majority of the horror genre, is that it transforms the view of monstrous-feminine to that of a heroine. The director, Mitchell Lichtenstein, explicitly wanted to change the narrative of the myth of vagina dentata to be not about women, but men, and the fear men have of women and desire for control over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/sundance-interview-with-teeth-director-mitchell-lichtenstein/|title=Sundance Interview with Teeth Director Mitchell Lichtenstein|last=Billington|first=Alex|date=January 15, 2008|website=Firstshowing.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://demonista.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/never-conquered-teeth/|title=“She would never be conquered:” Feminist Resistance in Teeth|last=|first=|date=July 16, 2010|website=Demonista|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchel Lichtenstein is quoted in interviews that he didn’t want to perpetuate gynophobia and wanted to turn the myth ‘on its head’. &amp;nbsp;The vagina dentata myth always has the masculine hero conquering the woman, the monstrous-feminine, and destroying the teeth to free her. In his film, Lichtenstein wanted Dawn to be the heroine, with a power so she could never be conquered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifc.com/2008/01/mitchell-lichtenstein-on-teeth|title=Mitchell Lichtenstein on “Teeth“|last=Hillis|first=Aaron|date=January 14, 2008|website=IFC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein made a concerted effort to both not show Dawn’s toothed vulva or to have the action of the teeth snapping shut to be very audible. This was to ensure that Dawn and her ‘teeth’ were not the monster, the monstrous-feminine, but were an evolved adaption to protect her from violent sexual predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://demonista.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/never-conquered-teeth/|title=“She would never be conquered:” Feminist Resistance in Teeth|last=|first=|date=July 16, 2010|website=Demonista|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, Dawn evolved her vaginal dentata into a biological [[Anti-rape device]], developed to deter and prevent rape by causing pain and disfigurement to sexual violence perpetrators.

Reviews of the film have been mixed with praise from feminists for empowerment and from psychoanalysts for its exploration of the subject matter, while the anti-women [[Men's rights movement]] predictably claim the film is grossly misandrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/teeth|title=Teeth|last=|first=|date=|website=Metacritic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the history of the horror genre and its misogynistic and patriarchal themes, it is refreshing to see a film challenge these outdated ideas.

== Television ==

=== American Horror Story ===
Throughout its eight seasons, ''[[American Horror Story]]'' has continuously shocked viewers with its intense themes. The anthology series is no stranger to depicting its female characters as antagonists, with some of these including brutal criminals, murderers, a nun subjected to demonic possession, cult members and witches. Having such grim and vicious depictions of women has often been one of the focal points for the show, drawing viewers in with the complexities of the powerful, [[violent feminine]]. The construction and use of these characters is disconcerting: horror has quite a narrow scope in relation to the presence of predatory women, and this is evident in the impact female heavy seasons of ''[[American Horror Story]]'' (such as ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum|Asylum]]'', ''[[American Horror Story: Coven|Coven]]'', ''[[American Horror Story: Cult|Cult]]'' and more recently ''[[American Horror Story: Apocalypse|Apocalypse]]'') have on ratings, viewers and themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/why-female-violence-against-men-is-societys-last-great-taboo/|title=Why female violence against men is society's last greatest taboo|last=Daubney|first=Martin|date=March 15, 2016|website=The Telegraph|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While female antagonists are commonplace, female victims are (unsurprisingly) also a factor. It is interesting then to explore the almost exclusively female horrors of the first three seasons (''[[American Horror Story: Murder House|Murder House]]'', ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum|Asylum]]'' and ''[[American Horror Story: Coven|Coven]]'') , with tropes such as closeted queerness, fetishisation, rape, birth and abortions (failed, forced and traumatic), suicide, mental illness, institutionalisation, race and the ''[[Salem witch trials|Salem Witch Trials]]'' all confirming and playing out many women’s worst nightmares. Such explicit depictions of this, then, bring [[Julia Kristeva|Kristeva]]’s theory into full effect; the notion of abjection being carried out with the blood, gore, violence, nudity, bodies, maternity and spaces ''[[American Horror Story]]'' creates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kitschmag.com/2014/09/03/american-horror-story-as-the-female-horror-story/|title=American Horror Story as the Female Horror Story|last=Berdie, Alyssa. &amp; Tiffany, Kaitlyn.|first=|date=September 2014|website=kitsch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly in later seasons where female empowerment and justice is served, however, there is always a prevalent and sinister underlying tension when a woman is violated at any point throughout the various ideas explored in the show’s entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimejusticejournal.com/article/view/101|title=Girls, Crime and Violence: Toward a Feminist Theory of Female Violence|last=Carrington|first=Kerry|date=September 11, 2013|website=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a final draw to [[Julia Kristeva|Kristeva’s]] theories, the relevance of distorted, disabled, or otherwise abnormal bodies in the show’s fourth season, ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show|Freakshow]]'', is another theme to bring abjection to the forefront. Having differing bodies or abilities outside of the [[realm of possibility]] (including a [[Ethel Darling|bearded woman]], a [[List of American Horror Story: Freak Show characters|strong man]], several dwarves, a [[List of American Horror Story: Freak Show characters|three breasted woman]] and [[Bette and Dot Tattler|conjoined twins]] to name a few) for the season’s 1950s time setting is projected as unsettling and grotesque to not only regular society within the show but also the intended audience. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

=== Orange is the New Black ===
Another depiction of abjection in modernity is within television series ''[[Orange Is the New Black|Orange is the New Black]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01490400.2016.1203848?journalCode=ulsc20|title=Women's Leisure as Political Practice: A Feminist Analysis of Orange Is the New Black|last=McKeown, Janet K. L. &amp; Parry, Diana C.|first=|date=August 5, 2016|website=Taylor and Francis Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fictional television show, which centralises around the women within a low security prison, uses its scope of women as criminals to fight alongside movements within society (such as [[LGBT|LGBT+]] and [[Black Lives Matter]]). Using the idea of incarcerated females directly correlates with the abject, as it challenges the ideas of the [[violent and/or deviant feminine]], and the links to maternity are pellucid (both literally and symbolically when considering the pregnant female inmates in the show). By highlighting racial divides between the cell blocks and mainstreaming and normalising lesbian identity and sex, the show also calls for women to celebrate and enjoy themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/17/orange-is-the-new-black-this-show-will-change-the-fabric-of-our-culture|title=Orange is the New Black: This show will change the fabric of our culture|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|date=June 2016|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidenced from the initial audience shock at the themes, vulgarity and sexual prowess of the program, this notion of [[abjection]] is extremely relevant when assessing the disruption of what a woman should be in our society, using the distasteful material as fuel to reroute criminality and women in that situation.

=== The Boulet Brothers' Dragula ===
Following in the footsteps of the immensely popular [[RuPaul's Drag Race|Rupaul’s Drag Race]], [[The Boulet Brothers' Dragula|The Boulet Brothers’ Dragula]] adapt their own drag reality show that is filled to the brim with abject imagery and references to the monstrous feminine. Horror, and consequently forms of abjection, are often considered to unveil the deepest fears within the culture it is situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thegeekanthropologist.com/2015/10/16/damsels-demons-women-in-horror-part-i/|title=Damsels &amp; Demons: Women in Horror Part I|last=Backe|first=Emma Louise|date=October 16, 2015|website=The Geek Anthropologist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The fears that the [[Boulet Brothers]] attempt to challenge in Dragula are fears of gender indifference, fears of the homosexual body and the fear of the breakdown of heteronormativity in which our culture operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbyjm3/dragula-is-loud-weird-and-pisses-on-heteronormativity|title=Dragula Is Loud, Weird, And Pisses on Heteronormativity|last=Leavell|first=Jeff|date=January 18, 2018|website=Vice|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The premise of the reality show is to find the ‘Next Drag Supermonster’ that upholds three main traits; filth, horror, and glamour.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2014}}
An '''interpretation''' in [[philosophy of art]], is an [[explanation]] of the meaning of some [[work of art]]. An '''aesthetic interpretation''' expresses a particular emotional or experiential [[understanding]] most often used in reference to a poem, or piece of literature, and may also apply to a work of visual art, or performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://generaleducation.fas.harvard.edu/aesthetic-interpretive-understanding|title=Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims of interpretation==
Readers may approach reading a text from different starting points. A student assigned to interpret a poem for class comes at reading differently from someone on the beach reading a novel for escapist pleasure. "Interpretation" implies the conscious task of making sense out of a piece of writing that may not be clear at first glance or that may reward deeper reading even if it at first appears perfectly clear. The beach reader will probably not need to interpret what she or he reads, but the student will.  Professor [[Louise Rosenblatt]], a specialist in the study of the reading process, distinguished between two reading ''stances'' that occupy opposite ends of a spectrum. ''Aesthetic reading'' differs from ''efferent reading'' in that the former describes a reader coming to the text expecting to devote attention to the words themselves, to take pleasure in their sounds, images, connotations, etc. ''Efferent reading'', on the other hand, describes someone, "reading for knowledge, for information, or for the conclusion to an argument, or maybe for directions as to action, as in a recipe..., reading for what [one is] going to carry away afterwards. I term this efferent reading."(L. Rosenblat) That is what ''efferent'' means, leading or conducting away from something, in this case information from a text. On this view, poems and stories do not offer the reader a message to carry away, but a pleasure in which to participate actively—aesthetically.

== One or many ==
There are many different theories of interpretation. On the one hand, there may be innumerable interpretations for any given piece of art, any one of which may be considered valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/If-art-can-be-interpreted-in-any-way-that-you-want-doesnt-that-make-art-meaningless?ref=rss#!n=36|title=Art can be interpreted in any way that you want|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may also be claimed that there really is only one valid interpretation for any given piece of art. The aesthetic theory that says people may approach art with different but equally valid aims is called "pluralism." But the aim of some of interpretations is such that they claim to be true or false. 

A "relativistic" kind of claim - between "All readings are equally good" and "Only one reading is correct" - holds that readings that tie together more details of the text and that gain approval of practiced readers are better than ones that do not. One kind of relativistic interpretation is called "formal," referring to the "form" or shape of patterns in the words of a text, especially a poem or song. Pointing to the rhymes at the ends of lines is an objective set of resemblances in a poem. A reader of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=The Raven}}&lt;/ref&gt; cannot help but hear the repetition of "nevermore" as a formal element of Poe's poem. Less obvious and a bit subjective would be an interpreter's pointing to the resemblance tying together all the mentions of weariness, napping, dreaming, and the drug [[nepenthe]].

In the early 20th Century the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] explored questions of formal philosophical analysis verses personal interpretations of aesthetic experience, preferencing the direct subjective experience of a work of art as essential to an individual's aesthetic interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger-aesthetics/#SymSub|title=Heideggar Aesthetics|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary theory informed by awareness that an ever-expanding exposure to ideas made possible by the internet has changed both the act of creation, and the experience of perception, is known as ''Multi Factorial Apperception'' (MFA). This approach seeks to integrate a wide range of cultural variables to expand the contextual frame for viewing the creation, and perception, of aesthetic experience. Emphasis is on a dynamic mulit-layerd cultural framing of the act of creation at a particular moment in time, and admits that the meaning of a particular work will be in flux from that moment onward.[citation needed]

== Intended interpretation ==
Some students of the reading process advocate that a reader should attempt to identify what the artist is trying to accomplish and interpret the art in terms of whether or not the artist has succeeded. Professor [[E. D. Hirsch]] wrote two books arguing that "the author's intention must be the ultimate determiner of meaning." (E. D. Hirsch) In this controversial view, there is a single correct interpretation consistent with the artist's intention for any given art work.

'''Apaurusheya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अपौरुषेय, {{IAST|Apauruṣeya}}), literally means "not of a man" and "superhuman".&lt;ref&gt;Vaman Shivaram Apte, [http://www.aa.tufs.ac.jp/~tjun/sktdic/ ''The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary''], see apauruSeya&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to describe the [[Vedas]], the earliest [[Hindu scripture|scripture]] in the [[Historical Vedic religion|World]].&lt;ref name=ds&gt;D Sharma, Classical Indian Philosophy: A Reader, Columbia University Press, ISBN , pages 196-197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Westerhoff (2009), Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195384963}}, page 290&lt;/ref&gt;

''Apaurusheya'' is a central concept in the [[Vedanta]] and [[Mimamsa]] schools of [[philosophy]]. These schools accept the ''[[Vedas]]'' as ''svatah pramana'' ("self-evident [[pramana|means of knowledge]]"). The Mimamsa school asserts that since the Vedas are composed of words ([[shabda]]) and the words  are composed of [[varna (phoneme)|phonemes]], the phonemes being [[Brahman|eternal]], the Vedas are also eternal.{{cn|date=January 2015}} To this, if asked whether all words and sentences are eternal, the Mimamsa philosophers reply that the rules behind combination of phonemes are fixed and pre-determined for the Vedas, unlike other words and sentences. The Vedanta school also accepts this line of argument.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

'''Ashoka's Hell''' was, according to legend, an elaborate [[torture chamber]] disguised as a beautiful palace full of amenities such as exclusive baths and decorated with flowers,  fruit trees and  ornaments. It was built by Emperor [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) in [[Pataliputra]] (modern [[Patna]], [[India]]), the capital city of the [[Maurya Empire]]. The legend of the torture palace is detailed in the ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', the text that describes Emperor Ashoka's life through both legendary and historical accounts.

According to legend, the palatial torture chamber was artfully designed to make its exterior visually pleasing and was referred to as the "beautiful gaol". Beneath the veneer of beauty, however, deep inside the  exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed  which were full of sadistic and cruel instruments of [[torture]] including furnaces producing molten metal for pouring on prisoners.

The narrative mentions that the architect of the chamber was inspired by descriptions of the five tortures of the [[Buddhist hell]] for the design of the torture chamber and of the torture methods he inflicted upon his victims. The text of the ''Ashokavadana'', describes how the torture chamber was so terrifying, it caused people to believe that Ashoka had visited hell itself in his quest to perfect its evil design. Through a pact made between Ashoka and the official executioner of the torture chamber anyone entering the palace, even by chance as a visitor, was not allowed to come out alive.

==Background==
According to the narrations of ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', Emperor [[Ashoka]], prior to his conversion to Buddhism, was a fierce and sadistic ruler, known as ''Ashoka the Fierce'', or Chandashoka (Ashoka the Cruel),&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yllblMkRgMMC&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23243-3|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sent his minions on a quest to find a vicious man to work as his official executioner.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

After some searching, Ashoka's men found a suitable candidate by the name of Girika who was so vicious that he killed his own parents because they did not want him to become Ashoka's executioner. Girika was introduced to Ashoka who soon appointed him as the official executioner of  his Empire.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

==Design==
According to legend, Girika persuaded Ashoka to design the torture chamber based on the suffering endured by people reborn in [[Buddhist hell]].&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein|title=Amoral Politics: The Persistent Truth of Machiavellism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibkxwtmP7_UC&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1886-5|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ashokavadana'' documents a long list of torture acts Girika designed and planned to force upon his prisoners including "prying  open their mouths with an iron and pouring boiling copper down their throats".&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt; Innocent persons were not exempt from such treatment.&lt;ref name="Alahakōn1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hekṭar Alahakōn|title=The Later Mauryas: 232 BC to 180 BC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gR4dAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2013|year=1980|publisher=Munshiram Manoharla|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative of ''Ashokavadana'', Ashoka asked Girika to disguise the torture chamber as a beautiful and "enticing" palace full of amenities such as exclusive baths and to decorate it with flowers, fruit trees and many ornaments. The palatial torture chamber was artfully designed to make people long to just look at it, and even attract them to enter, and was  referred to as the "beautiful gaol".&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurugé1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ananda W.

According to the mythology, beneath the veneer of beauty, inside the exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed  which were full of the most sadistic and cruel instruments of torture including furnaces producing molten metal for pouring on the prisoners.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SaranMishi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mishi Saran|author2=Mishi|title=Chasing the Monk's Shadow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hkOBNbnOGYC&amp;pg=PA274|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 July 2012|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306439-8|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thapar1973"/&gt;

In the narrative, Ashoka made a pact with Girika that he would never allow anyone who entered the palace to exit alive, including Ashoka himself.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SaranMishi2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durant2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt; The torture chamber was so terrifying, that Emperor Ashoka was thought to have visited [[hell]] so that he could perfect its evil design.&lt;ref name="Vittachi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nury Vittachi|title=The Kama Sutra of Business: Management Principles from Indian Classics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK5CBu0UBygC&amp;pg=PT162|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=13 April 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-82223-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Biographical Sutra of Emperor Ashoka'' the palace is described by the sentence: 'Emperor Ashoka constructed a hell'.&lt;ref name="Brazier2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Brazier|title=The New Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-zNSbmOjVIC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-29518-9|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ashokavadana'' refers to Girika as Chandagirika or Girika the Cruel. It appears that Girika overheard a Buddhist monk recite the ''Balapanditasutta'' which contains vivid descriptions of the five tortures of hell, such as:&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"/&gt; {{quotation|Finally, there are beings who are reborn in hell whom the hell-guardians grab, and stretch out on their backs on a fiery floor of red-hot iron that is but a mass of flames. Then they carry out the torture of the five-fold tether; they drive two iron stakes through their hands; they drive  two iron stakes through their feet; and  they drive one iron stake through their heart. Truly, O monks, hell is a place of great suffering}} and got his ideas of how to torture prisoners from there. The text describes Girika's attitude toward punishment as follows: "Such are the five great agonies, Girika reflected, and he began to inflict these same tortures on people in his prison". In addition the ''Balapanditasutta'' compares the King's torture methods to the tortures of hell.&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"/&gt;

==Miracles in the chamber==
The ''Ashokavadana'' further mentions that sometime later a Buddhist monk by the name of [[Samudra]] happened to visit the palace and upon entering he was informed by Girika that he would be tortured to death,&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of King Ashoka: A Study and Translation of the Ashokavadana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp9uaQTQ8h8C&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0616-0|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConferenceSharma2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Indian Society for Buddhist Studies.

His torturers however failed to injure him and he appeared able to neutralise their torture methods by realising that the suffering of the other prisoners is part of the  Buddhist dogma of suffering and attaining [[arhatship]].&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;

A particular narration detailed how Samudra, while tortured in a cauldron full of boiling water, human blood, [[bone marrow]] and excrement, caused the contents of the cauldron to cool down and then sat meditating cross-legged on a [[Nelumbo|lotus]] sprouting from the fluid.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;

The narrative further describes that when Ashoka heard of these miracles, he was overcome with curiosity and decided to enter the chamber to verify for himself the veracity of the stories. After arriving there he witnessed Samudra levitating with half his body on fire and the other half raining water.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;  Intrigued he asked Samudra to identify himself.&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;

Samudra replied that he was a disciple of Buddha and adherent to the [[Dharma]]. Samudra then chastised Ashoka for having built the torture chamber and further instructed him to build eighty four thousand [[stupas]] according to Buddha's prophecy, and to guarantee the security of all beings. To those demands, Ashoka acquiesced. Further he confessed to his crimes and accepted Buddha and the [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name="The Legend of King Ashoka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DockettDudley-Grant2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathleen H.

==Demolition==
The ''Ashokavadana'' describes the events leading to the demolition of Ashoka's torture chamber. According to the text, the torture chamber had become the site and the reason of his conversion to Buddhism. Girika, as the resident executioner of the chamber, however, reminded Ashoka of his pledge to kill anyone entering the chamber including Ashoka himself.&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

Ashoka then questioned Girika as to who entered the torture palace first during their visit to see Samudra's miracles. Girika was then forced to admit that it was he who entered first. Upon the executioner's  confession, Ashoka ordered him burnt alive and also ordered the demolition of the torture palace. According to the ''Ashokavadana'', "the beautiful jail was then torn down and a guarantee of security was extended to all beings".&lt;ref name="Rich2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

In the [[behaviorism]] approach to psychology, '''behavioral scripts''' are a sequence of expected behaviors for a given situation.&lt;ref name="Barnett06"&gt;Barnett, D.W. et al. (2006). [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-170157273.html Preschool Intervention Scripts: Lessons from 20 years of Research and Practice]. ''Journal of Speech Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis'', 2(2), 158–181 {{issn|1932-4731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scripts include default standards for the actors, props, setting, and sequence of events that are expected to occur in a particular situation. The classic script example involves an individual dining at a restaurant.  This script has several components: props including tables, menus, food, and money, as well as roles including customers, servers, chefs, and a cashier.  The sequence of expected events for this script begins with a hungry customer entering the restaurant, ordering, eating, paying and then ends with the customer exiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-133-31-391-5|pages=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; People continually follow scripts which are acquired through habit, practice and simple [[Schedule|routine]]. Following a script can be useful because it could help to save the time and mental effort of deciding on appropriate behavior each time a situation is encountered.

==Psychology==
There have been many empirical research studies conducted in order to test the validity of the script theory.  One such study, conducted by Bower, Black, and Turner in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bower|first=G.H|author2=Black, J.B.|author3=Turner, T. J|title=Scripts in memory for texts|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1979|volume=11|pages=177–220|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(79)90009-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  asked participants to read 18 different scenarios, all of which represented a doctor’s office script.  The participants were later asked to complete either a recall task or a recognition task.  In the recall task, the participants were asked to remember as much as they could about each scenario.  Here, the participants tended to recall certain parts of the stories that were not actually present, but that were parts of the scripts that the stories represented.  In the recognition task, participants were asked to rate various sentences on a 7-point scale regarding their personal confidence that they had seen each sentence in the scenario.  Some sentences shown to participants were from the stories and some were not.   Of the sentences that were not from the stories, some were relevant to the doctor’s office script and others were not relevant to the script at all.  Here, participants tended to recognize certain non-story sentences as having come from the story if the non-story sentence was relevant to the script.  Ultimately, Bower, Black, and Turner’s study suggested that scripts serve as a guide for a person’s recall and recognition for certain things that they already know.

Some people may have a tendency to [[habituate]] behavioral scripts in a manner that can act to limit consciousness in a subliminal way.  This can negatively influence the [[subconscious]] mind and, subsequently, can negatively affect perceptions, judgments, values, beliefs, [[cognition]] and [[behavior]]. For example, over-reliance upon behavioral scripts combined with [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] that encourage an individual to use these behavioral scripts may influence one to [[stereotype]] and develop a [[prejudiced]] attitude toward others based on [[socioeconomic status]], ethnicity, race, etc.

Some applied behavior analysts even use scripts to train new skills&lt;ref name="Barnett06"/&gt; and 20 years of research supports script use as an effective way to build new language, social, and activity routines for adults and children with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref name="Barnett06"/&gt; With language scripts fading, efforts are being made in an attempt to help the scripts recombine in order to approximate more natural language.

'''Brithenig''' is an invented language, or [[constructed language]] ("conlang"). It was created as a hobby in 1996 by Andrew Smith from [[New Zealand]], who also invented the [[alternate history]] of [[Ill Bethisad]] to "explain" it.

Brithenig was not developed to be used in the real world, like [[Esperanto]] or [[Interlingua]], nor to provide detail to a work of fiction, like [[Klingon language|Klingon]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' scenarios. Rather, Brithenig started as a thought experiment to create a [[Romance languages|Romance]] language that might have evolved if [[Latin]] had displaced the native [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language as the spoken language of the people in [[Great Britain]].

The result is an artificial sister language to [[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] which differs from them by having sound-changes similar to those that affected the [[Welsh language]], and words that are borrowed from the [[Brittonic languages]] and from [[English language|English]] throughout its pseudo-history. One important distinction between Brithenig and Welsh is that while Welsh is [[Gallo-Brittonic languages|P-Celtic]], Latin was a [[Osco-Umbrian_languages#Differences_from_Latin|Q-Italic language]] (as opposed to [[Osco-Umbrian_languages#Differences_from_Latin|P-Italic]], like [[Oscan language|Oscan]]), and this trait was passed onto Brithenig.

Similar efforts to extrapolate Romance languages are ''Breathanach'' (influenced by the other branch of Celtic), ''Judajca'' (influenced by Hebrew), ''Þrjótrunn'' (a non-Ill Bethisad language influenced by Icelandic), ''[[Wenedyk]]'' (influenced by Polish), and ''Xliponian'' (which experienced a [[Grimm's law]]-like sound shift). It has also inspired ''Wessisc'', a hypothetical Germanic language influenced by contact with Old Celtic.

Brithenig was granted the code BZT as part of [[ISO 639:b#bzt|ISO 639-3]].

Andrew Smith was one of the conlangers featured in the exhibit "Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond: The World of Constructed Languages" displayed at the [[Cleveland Public Library]] from May through August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/26418663@N05/2478687117/ |title=Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond |website=[[Flickr]] |access-date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's creation of Brithenig was cited as the reason for his inclusion in the exhibit (which also included the Babel Text&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.langmaker.com/babelintro.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514232430/http://www.langmaker.com/babelintro.htm |title=Babel Text Introduction |archive-date=2011-05-14 |website=Langmarker |access-date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Smith's language).

==Vocabulary==
Most of Brithenig's vocabulary is distinctively Romance, even though it is disguised as Welsh. The following list of 30 words gives an impression of what Brithenig looks like in comparison to nine other Romance languages including Wenedyk, and to Welsh. The similarity of about one-quarter of the Welsh words to Brithenig words (indicated by not being bracketed) is due to their common [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] background, although a few others, such as ''ysgol'', were borrowings from Latin into Welsh.

The '''CATH Protein Structure Classification database''' is a free, publicly available online resource that provides information on the evolutionary relationships of [[protein domain]]s. It was created in the mid-1990s by Professor [[Christine Orengo]] and colleagues including [[Janet Thornton]] and [[David Tudor Jones|David Jones]],&lt;ref name=Orengo1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orengo|first1=CA|last2=Michie|first2=AD|last3=Jones|first3=S|last4=Jones|first4=DT|authorlink4=David Tudor Jones|last5=Swindells|first5=MB|last6=Thornton|first6=JM|authorlink6=Janet Thornton|title=CATH – a hierarchic classification of protein domain structures|journal=Structure|volume=5|issue=8|year=1997|pages=1093–1109|issn=0969-2126|doi=10.1016/S0969-2126(97)00260-8|pmid=9309224}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be developed by the Orengo group at [[University College London]]. CATH shares many broad features with the [[Structural Classification of Proteins|SCOP]] resource, however there are also many areas in which the detailed classification differs greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathdb.info |title=CATH: Protein Structure Classification Database at UCL |website=Cathdb.info |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathdb.info/wiki/doku/?id=tutorials:index |title=CATH |website=Cathdb.info |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CATHDatabase |title=CATH Database (@CATHDatabase) |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Pearl2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearl|first1=F.

==Hierarchical organization==
Experimentally-determined protein three-dimensional structures are obtained from the Protein Data Bank and split into their consecutive polypeptide chains, where applicable. Protein domains are identified within these chains using a mixture of automatic methods and manual curation.

The domains are then classified within the CATH structural hierarchy: at the Class (C) level, domains are assigned according to their secondary structure content, i.e. all alpha, all beta, a mixture of alpha and beta, or little secondary structure; at the Architecture (A) level, information on the secondary structure arrangement in three-dimensional space is used for assignment; at the Topology/fold (T) level, information on how the secondary structure elements are connected and arranged is used; assignments are made to the Homologous superfamily (H) level if there is good evidence that the domains are related by evolution &lt;ref name=Orengo1997/&gt; i.e. they are homologous.

{| class="wikitable"
|+The four main levels of the CATH hierarchy:
!#
!Level
!Description
|-
|1 || '''C'''lass || the overall secondary-structure content of the domain. (Equivalent to the [[Structural Classification of Proteins database|SCOP]] [[Protein fold class|Class]])
|-
|2 || '''A'''rchitecture || high structural similarity but no evidence of [[homology (biology)|homology]]. (Equivalent to the 'fold' level in SCOP)
|-
|3 || '''T'''opology/fold || a large-scale grouping of topologies which share particular structural features
|-
|4 || '''H'''omologous superfamily || indicative of a demonstrable evolutionary relationship. (Equivalent to SCOP [[protein superfamily|superfamily]]) 
|}

Additional sequence data for domains with no experimentally determined structures are provided by CATH's sister resource, Gene3D, which are used to populate the homologous superfamilies. Protein sequences from UniProtKB and Ensembl are scanned against CATH HMMs to predict domain sequence boundaries and make homologous superfamily assignments.

==Releases==
The CATH team aim to provide official releases of the CATH classification every 12 months. This release process is important because is allows for the provision of internal validation, extra annotations and analysis. However, it can mean that there is a time delay between new structures appearing in the PDB and the latest official CATH release,

In order to address this issue: CATH-B provides a limited amount of information to the very latest domain annotations (e.g. domain boundaries and superfamily classifications).

The latest release of CATH-Gene3D (v4.1) was released in July 2016 and consists of:

* 308,999 structural protein domain entries &lt;ref name=Cathv4.1/&gt;
* 53,479,436 non-structural protein domain entries &lt;ref name=Cathv4.1/&gt;
* 2,737 homologous superfamily entries &lt;ref name=Cathv4.1/&gt;
* 92,882 functional family entries &lt;ref name=Cathv4.1/&gt;

==Open source software==
CATH is an [[open source software]] project, with developers developing and maintaining a number of open source tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathdb.info/wiki/doku/?id=cath_tools|title=Tools|last=|first=|date=|website=cathdb.info|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; CATH maintains a todo list on [[GitHub]] to allow external users to create and keep track of issues relating to the CATH protein structure classification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1669">In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Cantor–Dedekind axiom''' is the thesis that the [[Real number#Axiomatic approach|real number]]s are order-[[isomorphic]] to the [[linear continuum]] of [[geometry]]. In other words, the axiom states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between real numbers and points on a line.

This axiom is the cornerstone of [[analytic geometry]]. The [[Cartesian coordinate system]] developed by [[René Descartes]] implicitly assumes this axiom by blending the distinct concepts of real number system with the geometric line or plane into a [[conceptual metaphor]]. This is sometimes referred to as the ''real number line'' blend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = George Lakoff and Rafael E. Núñez | title = Where Mathematics Comes From: How the embodied mind brings mathematics into being | publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn= 0-465-03770-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consequence of this axiom is that [[Alfred Tarski|Alfred Tarski's]] proof of the [[decidability (logic)|decidability]] of the ordered real field could be seen as an [[algorithm]] to solve any problem in [[Euclidean geometry]].

'''Communal violence''' is a form of violence that is perpetrated across [[ethnic group|ethnic]] or communal lines, the violent parties feel solidarity for their respective groups, and victims are chosen based upon group membership.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D.L. (2000) ''The Deadly Ethnic Riot''. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA&lt;/ref&gt; The term includes conflicts, riots and other forms of violence between communities of different religious faith or ethnic origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/communal Communal] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime includes any conflict and form of violence between communities of different religious group, different sects or tribes of same religious group, clans, ethnic origins or national origin as communal violence.&lt;ref name=unodc&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/Chapter_4.pdf Homicide, Violence and Conflict] UNODC, United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; However, this excludes conflict between two individuals or two families.

;Europe
Human history has experienced numerous episodes of communal violence.&lt;ref&gt;David Nirenberg, Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages, Princeton University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medieval Europe, Protestants clashed with Catholics, Christians clashed with Muslims while both perpetuated violence against Jews and [[Romani people|Roma]] minorities. In 1561, [[Huguenot]]s in Toulouse took out in a procession through the streets to express their solidarity for Protestant ideas. A few days later, the Catholics hunted down some of the leaders of the procession, beat them and burned them at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Jean Souriac]], "Du corps à corps au combat fictif. Quand les catholiques toulousains affrontaient leurs homologues protestants," in Les affrontements: Usages, discours et rituels, Editor: Frédérique Pitou and Jacqueline Sainclivier, Presses Universitaires de Rennes (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In the French town of Pamiers, communal clashes were routine between Protestants and Catholics, such as during holy celebrations where the Catholics took out a procession with a statue of St. Anthony, sang and danced while they carried the statue around town. Local Protestants would year after year disrupt the festivities by throwing stones at the Catholics. In 1566, when the Catholic procession reached a Protestant neighborhood, the Protestants chanted "kill, kill, kill !!" and days of communal violence with numerous fatalities followed.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Ruff, Violence in Early Modern Europe 1500–1800, Cambridge University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 1572, thousands of Protestants were killed by Catholics during communal violence in each of the following cities – Paris, Aix, Bordeaux, Bourges, Lyon, Meaux, Orleans, Rouen, Toulouse, and Troyes.&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Partner, P. 1999"/&gt; In Switzerland, communal violence between the Reformation movement and Catholics marked the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Gordon (2002), The Swiss Reformation, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|978-0719051180}}, pp. 90–99&lt;/ref&gt;

;Africa
The Horn of Africa as well as West African regions have similar history of communal violence. Nigeria has seen centuries of communal violence between different ethnic groups particularly between Christian south and Islamic north.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Huntington, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20045621 The Clash of Civilizations?], Foreign Affairs, Vol. 72, No. 3 (Summer, 1993), pp. 22–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desplat &amp; Ostebo (2013), Muslim Ethiopia: The Christian Legacy, Identity Politics, and Islamic Reformism, {{ISBN|978-1137325297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, after receiving independence from the British colonial rule, there were widespread communal violence in the ethnically diverse state of [[Zanzibar]]. The violent groups were Arabs and Africans, that expanded along religious lines, and the communal violence ultimately led to the overthrow of the Sultan of Zanzibar.&lt;ref name="nyt14jan"&gt;{{Citation | last = Conley | first = Robert | title = Regime Banishes Sultan | newspaper=New York Times | pages = 4 | date = 14 January 1964  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/14/archives/regime-banishes-sultan.html| accessdate = 16 November 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Parsons|first=Timothy|title=The 1964 Army Mutinies and the Making of Modern East Africa|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoLbjlIYLzwC|isbn=0-325-07068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local radio announced the death of tens of thousands of "stooges", but later estimates for deaths from Zanzibar communal violence have varied from hundreds to 2,000-4,000 to as many as 20,000.&lt;ref name="nyt19jan"&gt;{{Citation | last = Conley | first = Robert | title = Nationalism Is Viewed as Camouflage for Reds | newspaper=New York Times | pages = 1 | date = 19 January 1964  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/19/nationalism-is-viewed-as-camouflage-for-redstoll-2000-to-4000.html| accessdate = 16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{Citation | last = Los Angeles Times | title = Slaughter in Zanzibar of Asians, Arabs Told | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | pages = 4 | date = 20 January 1964 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/465909962.html?dids=465909962:465909962&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jan+20%2C+1964&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=4&amp;desc=Slaughter+in+Zanzibar+of+Asians%2C+Arabs+Told | accessdate = 16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1960s and early 1970s, there were widespread communal violence against Kenyans and Asians in [[Uganda]] with waves of theft, physical and sexual violence, followed by expulsions by [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref&gt;Kasozi, Abdu Basajabaka Kawalya; Musisi, Nakanyike; Sejjengo, James Mukooza (1994).

;Asia
[[File:Communal trouble also erupts in Ahmedabad, between Muslims and Jains.jpg|thumb|Arson and communal violence of 1946 between Muslims and Jains, in [[Ahmedabad]], Gujarat.]]
East, South and Southeast Asia have recorded numerous instances of communal violence. For example, Singapore suffered a wave of communal violence in 20th century between Malays and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Leifer, Michael (1964), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2642213 Communal violence in Singapore], Asian Survey, Vol. 4, No. 10 (Oct., 1964), 1115–1121&lt;/ref&gt; In Indian subcontinent, numerous 18th through 20th century records of the British colonial era mention communal violence between Hindus and Muslims, as well as Sunni and Shia sects of Islam, particularly during processions related to respective religious celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Bayly, C. A. (1985), The Pre-history of Communalism? Religious Conflict in India  1700–1860, Modern Asian Studies, 19 (02), pp. 177–203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baber, Z. (2004), Race, Religion and Riots: The ‘Racialization’ of Communal Identity and Conflict in India, Sociology, 38(4), pp. 701–718&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency of communal violence in South Asia increased after the first partition of Bengal in 1905, where segregation, unequal political and economic rights were imposed on Hindus and Muslims by Lord Curzon, based on religion. The colonial rule was viewed by each side as favoring the other side, resulting in a wave of communal riots and 1911 reversal of Bengal partition and its re-unification.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Cronin (1977), British Policy and Administration in Bengal, 1905–1912: Partition and the New Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, {{ISBN|978-0836400007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, after British General Dyer ordered his soldiers to fire on unarmed protestors inside a compound in Amritsar, killing 380 civilians, communal violence followed in India against British settlements.&lt;ref&gt;DRAPER, A. (1981), Amritsar – The Massacre that Ended the Raj, Littlehampton, {{ISBN|978-0304304813}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were hundreds of incidents of communal violence between 1905 and 1947, many related to religious, political sovereignty questions including partition of India along religious lines into East Pakistan, West Pakistan and India.&lt;ref&gt;PANDEY, G. (1983),␣in Editor: GUHA, R., 1983, Subaltern Studies II: Writings on South Asian History and Society, Delhi, Oxford University Press, pp. 60–129, {{ISBN|978-0195633658}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1946 to 1947 period saw some of the worst communal violence of 20th century, where waves of riots and violence killed between 100,000 and a million people, from Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Jain religions, particularly in cities and towns near the modern borders of India-Pakistan and India-Bangladesh. Examples of these communal violence include the so-called [[Direct Action Day]], [[Noakhali riots]] and the [[Partition riots in Rawalpindi]].&lt;ref&gt;BRISTOW, R.C.B.

The Indian law defines communal violence as, "any act or series of acts, whether spontaneous or planned, resulting in injury or harm to the person and or property, knowingly directed against any person by virtue of his or her membership of any religious or linguistic minority, in any State in the Union of India, or Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes within the meaning of clauses (24) and (25) of Article 366 of the Constitution of India".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nac.nic.in/pdf/pctvb.pdf PREVENTION OF COMMUNAL AND TARGETED VIOLENCE (ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND REPARATIONS) BILL, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814185325/http://nac.nic.in/pdf/pctvb.pdf |date=2014-08-14 }} Government of India&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, communal violence is defined as that is driven by a sense of religious, ethnic or tribal solidarity. The equivalence of tribalism to ethnicity was referred locally as ''kesukuan''.&lt;ref name=gvk&gt;Gerry van Klinken, [http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICS%20AND%20GOVERNMENT%20Communal%20violence%20democratization%20in%20Indonesia%20%20small%20town%20wars.pdf Communal Violence and Democratization in Indonesia – Small Town Wars], {{ISBN|978-0-415-41713-6}}, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Communal violence in Indonesia includes numerous localized conflicts between various social groups found on its islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/02/03/social-violence-indonesia-localized.html Social violence in Indonesia is localized] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104117/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/02/03/social-violence-indonesia-localized.html |date=2016-03-04 }} Jakarta Post&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
In Kenya, communal violence is defined as that violence that occurs between different community who identify themselves based on religion, tribes, language, sect, race and others. Typically this sense of community identity comes from birth and is inherited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acleddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ACLED-Country-Report_Kenya_December-2013.pdf COUNTRY REPORT: KENYA – 2013] ACLED, Africa (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar definition has been applied for 47 African countries, where during 1990–2010, about 7,200 instances of communal violence and inter-ethnic conflicts has been seen.&lt;ref&gt;Idean Salehyan et al, Social Conflict in Africa: A New Database, International Interactions: Empirical and Theoretical Research in International Relations, Volume 38, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

Colm Campbell has proposed, after studying the empirical data and sequence of events during communal violence in South Africa, Palestinian Territories and Northern Ireland, that communal violence typically follows when there is degradation of rule of law, the state fails to or is widely seen as unable to provide order, security and equal justice, which then leads to mass mobilization, followed by radicalization of anger among one or more communities, and ultimately violent mobilization. Targeted mass violence by a few from one community against innocent members of other community, suppression of complaints, refusal to prosecute, killing peaceful demonstrators, imprisonment of people of a single community while refusal to arrest members of other community in conflict, perceived or actual prisoner abuse by the state are often the greatest mobilizers of communal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Colm Campbell (2011), 'Beyond Radicalization: Towards an Integrated Anti-Violence Rule of Law Strategy', Transitional Justice Institute Research Paper No. 11-05, in Salinas de Friás, KLH Samuel and ND White (eds), Counter-Terrorism: International Law and Practice (Oxford University Press, Oxford 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frances Stewart, Horizontal Inequalities and Conflict: Understanding Group Violence in Multiethnic Societies, {{ISBN|978-0230245501}}, Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that ethnic segregation may also cause communal violence. Empirically estimating the effect of segregation on the incidence of violence across 700 localities in Rift Valley Province of [[Kenya]] after the contested 2007–2008 general election, Kimuli Kahara finds that local ethnic segregation increases communal violence by decreasing interethnic trust rather than by making it easier to organize violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=June 2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence?: Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if a small minority of individuals prefer to live in ethnically homogenous settings due to fear of other ethnic groups or otherwise, it can result in high degrees of ethnic segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schelling|first=Thomas|date=1971|title=Dynamic Models of Segregation|url=|journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology|volume=1|issue=2|pages=143–186|doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahara argues that such ethnic segregation decreases the possibility of positive contact across ethnic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence? Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration and the resultant positive interethnic contact reduces prejudice by allowing individuals to correct false beliefs about members of other ethnic groups, improving intergroup relations consequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Thomas|date=1998|title=Intergroup Contact Theory.|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=49|pages=65–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, segregation is correlated with low levels of interethnic trust. This widespread mistrust along ethnic lines explains the severity of communal violence by implying that when underlying mistrust is high, it is easier for extremists and elites to mobilize support for violence, and that where violence against members of other ethnic groups is supported by the public, perpetrators of such violence are less likely to face social sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasara|first=Kimuli|date=June 2016|title=Does Local Ethnic Segregation Lead to Violence?: Evidence from Kenya|url=|journal=Working Paper|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], '''discrete choice''' models, or '''qualitative choice models''', describe, explain, and predict choices between two or more [[discrete variable|discrete]] alternatives, such as entering or not entering the [[labor market]], or choosing between modes of [[transport]]. Such choices contrast with standard consumption models in which the quantity of each good consumed is assumed to be a [[continuous variable]]. In the continuous case, calculus methods (e.g. first-order conditions) can be used to determine the optimum amount chosen, and demand can be modeled empirically using [[regression analysis]]. On the other hand, discrete choice analysis examines situations in which the potential outcomes are discrete, such that the optimum is not characterized by standard first-order conditions. Thus, instead of examining “how much” as in problems with continuous choice variables, discrete choice analysis examines “which one.” However, discrete choice analysis can also be used to examine the chosen quantity when only a few distinct quantities must be chosen from, such as the number of vehicles a household chooses to own &lt;ref name="cars"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Kenneth E. Train |last=Train |first=K. |year=1986 |title=Qualitative Choice Analysis: Theory, Econometrics, and an Application to Automobile Demand |location= |publisher=MIT Press }} [http://emlab.berkeley.edu/books/choice.html Chapter 8].&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of minutes of telecommunications service a customer decides to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. |last=Train |year=1987 |last2=McFadden |first2=D. |last3=Ben-Akiva |first3=M. |title=The Demand for Local Telephone Service: A Fully Discrete Model of Residential Call Patterns and Service Choice |journal=Rand Journal of Economics |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=109–123 |jstor=2555538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques such as [[logistic regression]] and [[probit regression]] can be used for empirical analysis of discrete choice.

Estimation of such models is usually done via parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric maximum likelihood methods.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947316302596 | doi=10.1016/j.csda.2016.10.024 | volume=108 | title=Nonparametric estimation of dynamic discrete choice models for time series data | year=2017 | journal=Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis | pages=97–120 | last1 = Park | first1 = Byeong U. | last2 = Simar | first2 = Léopold | last3 = Zelenyuk | first3 = Valentin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrete choice models theoretically or empirically model choices made by people among a finite set of alternatives. The models have been used to examine, e.g., the choice of which car to buy,&lt;ref name="cars" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Train |first=K. |last2=Winston |first2=C. |year=2007 |title=Vehicle Choice Behavior and the Declining Market Share of US Automakers |journal=[[International Economic Review]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1469–1496 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2007.00471.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; where to go to college,&lt;ref name="college"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fuller |first=W.

Discrete choice models are also used to examine choices by organizations, such as firms or government agencies. In the discussion below, the decision-making unit is assumed to be a person, though the concepts are applicable more generally. [[Daniel McFadden]] won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel prize]] in 2000 for his pioneering work in developing the theoretical basis for discrete choice.

Discrete choice models statistically relate the choice made by each person to the attributes of the person and the attributes of the alternatives available to the person. For example, the choice of which car a person buys is statistically related to the person’s income and age as well as to price, fuel efficiency, size, and other attributes of each available car. The models estimate the probability that a person chooses a particular alternative. The models are often used to forecast how people’s choices will change under changes in demographics and/or attributes of the alternatives.

Discrete choice models specify the probability that an individual chooses an option among a set of alternatives. The probabilistic description of discrete choice behavior is used not to reflect individual behavior that is viewed as intrinsically probabilistic. Rather, it is the lack of information that leads us to describe choice in a probabilistic fashion. In practice, we cannot know all factors affecting individual choice decisions as their determinants are partially observed or imperfectly measured. Therefore, discrete choice models rely on stochastic assumptions and specifications to account for unobserved factors related to a) choice alternatives, b) taste variation over people (interpersonal heterogeneity) and over time (intra-individual choice dynamics), and c) heterogeneous choice sets. The different formulations have been summarized and classified into groups of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baltas|first1=George|last2=Doyle|first2=Peter|title=Random utility models in marketing research: a survey|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=51|issue=2|pages=115–125|doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(99)00058-2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common features of discrete choice models ==

Discrete choice models take many forms, including: Binary Logit, Binary Probit, Multinomial Logit, Conditional Logit, Multinomial Probit, Nested Logit, Generalized Extreme Value Models, Mixed Logit, and Exploded Logit. All of these models have the features described below in common.

=== Choice set ===

The choice set is the set of alternatives that are available to the person. For a discrete choice model, the choice set must meet three requirements:

# The set of alternatives must be [[Collectively exhaustive events|collectively exhaustive]], meaning that the set includes all possible alternatives. This requirement implies that the person necessarily does choose an alternative from the set.
# The alternatives must be [[Mutual exclusivity|mutually exclusive]], meaning that choosing one alternative means not choosing any other alternatives. This requirement implies that the person chooses only one alternative from the set.
# The set must contain a ''finite'' number of alternatives. This third requirement distinguishes discrete choice analysis from forms of regression analysis in which the dependent variable can (theoretically) take an infinite number of values.

As an example, the choice set for a person deciding which mode of [[transport]] to take to work includes driving alone, carpooling, taking bus, etc. The choice set is complicated by the fact that a person can use multiple modes for a given trip, such as driving a car to a train station and then taking train to work. In this case, the choice set can include each possible combination of modes. Alternatively, the choice can be defined as the choice of “primary” mode, with the set consisting of car, bus, rail, and other (e.g. walking, bicycles, etc.). Note that the alternative “other” is included in order to make the choice set exhaustive.

Different people may have different choice sets, depending on their circumstances. For instance, the [[Scion (automobile)|Scion]] automobile was not sold in Canada as of 2009, so new car buyers in Canada faced different choice sets from those of American consumers. Such considerations are taken into account in the formulation of discrete choice models.

=== Defining choice probabilities ===

A discrete choice model specifies the probability that a person chooses a particular alternative, with the probability expressed as a function of observed variables that relate to the alternatives and the person. In its general form, the probability that person ''n'' chooses alternative ''i'' is expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt; P_{ni} \equiv  \Pr( \text{Person } n \text{ chooses alternative } i)  = G(x_{ni}, \;x_{nj, j \neq i}, \; s_n, \;\beta), &lt;/math&gt;
where

: &lt;math&gt;x_{ni} &lt;/math&gt; is a vector of attributes of alternative ''i'' faced by person ''n'',

: &lt;math&gt;x_{nj, j \neq i} &lt;/math&gt; is a vector of attributes of the other alternatives (other than ''i'') faced by person ''n'',

: &lt;math&gt; s_n &lt;/math&gt; is a vector of characteristics of person ''n'', and

: &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a set of parameters giving the effects of variables on probabilities, which are estimated statistically.

In the mode of [[transport]] example above, the attributes of modes (''x&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;''), such as travel time and cost, and the characteristics of consumer (''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), such as annual income, age, and gender, can be used to calculate choice probabilities. The attributes of the alternatives can differ over people; e.g., cost and time for travel to work by car, bus, and rail are different for each person depending on the location of home and work of that person.

'''Properties:'''
* ''P&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' is between 0 and 1
* &lt;math&gt;\forall n:\; \sum_{j=1}^J  P_{nj} = 1, &lt;/math&gt;  where ''J'' is the total number of alternatives.
* (Expected fraction of people choosing ''i'' ) &lt;math&gt;  = {1 \over N} {\sum_{n=1}^N P_{ni}}, &lt;/math&gt; where N is the number of people making the choice.

Different models (i.e., models using a different function G) have different properties. Prominent models are introduced below.

=== Consumer utility ===
Discrete choice models can be derived from [[utility theory]]. This derivation is useful for three reasons:

# It gives a precise meaning to the probabilities ''P&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;''
# It motivates and distinguishes alternative model specifications, e.g., the choice of a functional form for ''G''.
# It provides the theoretical basis for calculation of changes in consumer surplus (compensating variation) from changes in the attributes of the alternatives.

''U&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the utility (or net benefit or well-being) that person ''n'' obtains from choosing alternative ''i''. The behavior of the person is utility-maximizing: person n chooses the alternative that provides the highest utility. The choice of the person is designated by dummy variables, ''y&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'', for each alternative:

: &lt;math&gt; y_{ni} = \begin{cases}
1 &amp;  U_{ni} &gt; U_{nj} \quad  \forall j \neq i\\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Consider now the researcher who is examining the choice. The person’s choice depends on many factors, some of which the researcher observes and some of which the researcher does not. The utility that the person obtains from choosing an alternative is decomposed into a part that depends on variables that the researcher observes and a part that depends on variables that the researcher does not observe. In a linear form, this decomposition is expressed as
: &lt;math&gt; U_{ni}= \beta z_{ni} + \varepsilon_{ni} &lt;/math&gt;

where

*&lt;math&gt;z_{ni} &lt;/math&gt;  is a vector of observed variables relating to alternative ''i'' for person ''n'' that depends on attributes of the alternative, ''x&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'',  interacted perhaps with attributes of the person, ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', such that it can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;z_{ni}=z(x_{ni}, s_n) &lt;/math&gt;  for some numerical function ''z'',
*&lt;math&gt;\beta &lt;/math&gt; is a corresponding vector of coefficients of the observed variables, and
*&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ni} &lt;/math&gt; captures the impact of all unobserved factors that affect the person’s choice.

The choice probability is then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P_{ni}&amp; = \Pr(y_{ni} = 1) \\
       &amp;= \Pr \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i}U_{ni} &gt; U_{nj}, \right )  \\
      &amp; = \Pr  \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i} \beta z_{ni} + \varepsilon_{ni} &gt;  \beta z_{nj} + \varepsilon_{nj}, \right ) \\
      &amp; = \Pr  \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i} \varepsilon_{nj}- \varepsilon_{ni} &lt; \beta z_{ni}- \beta z_{nj}, \right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Given ''β'', the choice probability is the probability that the random terms, {{nowrap|''ε&lt;sub&gt;nj&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (which are random from the researcher’s perspective, since the researcher does not observe them) are below the respective quantities &lt;math&gt;\forall j \neq i: \beta z_{ni} - \beta z_{nj}.&lt;/math&gt; Different choice models (i.e. different specifications of G) arise from different distributions of ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''i'' and different treatments of ''β''.

=== Properties of discrete choice models implied by utility theory ===

==== Only differences matter ====

The probability that a person chooses a particular alternative is determined by comparing the utility of choosing that alternative to the utility of choosing other alternatives:

:&lt;math&gt; P_{ni}= \Pr(y_{ni} = 1) = \Pr \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i} U_{ni} &gt; U_{nj} \right )  = \Pr  \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i} U_{ni} - U_{nj} &gt; 0 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

As the last term indicates, the choice probability depends only on the difference in utilities between alternatives, not on the absolute level of utilities. Equivalently, adding a constant to the utilities of all the alternatives does not change the choice probabilities.

==== Scale must be normalized ====

Since utility has no units, it is necessary to normalize the scale of utilities. The scale of utility is often defined by the variance of the error term in discrete choice models. This variance may differ depending on the characteristics of the dataset, such as when or where the data are collected. Normalization of the variance therefore affects the interpretation of parameters estimated across diverse datasets.

== Prominent types of discrete choice models ==
Discrete choice models can first be classified according to the number of available alternatives.
: * Binomial choice models (dichotomous): 2 available alternatives
: * Multinomial choice models ([[polytomous choice|polytomous]]): 3 or more available alternatives

Multinomial choice models can further be classified according to the model specification:
: * Models, such as standard logit, that assume no correlation in unobserved factors over alternatives
: * Models that allow correlation in unobserved factors among alternatives

In addition, specific forms of the models are available for examining rankings of alternatives (i.e., first choice, second choice, third choice, etc.) and for ratings data.

Details for each model are provided in the following sections.

=== Binary choice ===

==== {{anchor|basic logit}} A. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives ====

{{main article|Logistic regression}}

''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the utility (or net benefit) that person n obtains from taking an action (as opposed to not taking the action). The utility the person obtains from taking the action depends on the characteristics of the person, some of which are observed by the researcher and some are not. The person takes the action, {{nowrap|''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1}}, if ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0. The unobserved term, ''ε&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',  is assumed to have a [[logistic distribution]]. The specification is written succinctly as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}  U_n = \beta s_n + \varepsilon_n  \\ y_n = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; U_n &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; U_n \leqslant 0 \end{cases} \\ \varepsilon \sim \text{Logistic} \end{cases} \quad \Rightarrow \quad  P_{n1} = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-\beta s_n)} &lt;/math&gt;

==== {{anchor|basic probit}} B. Probit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives ====
{{Main article|Probit model}}

The description of the model is the same as [[#A. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives|model '''A''']], except the unobserved terms are distributed [[Normal distribution|standard normal]] instead of [[Logistic distribution|logistic]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} U_n = \beta s_n + \varepsilon_n  \\  y_n = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; U_n &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; U_n \leqslant 0 \end{cases} \\ \varepsilon \sim \text{Standard normal} \end{cases} \quad \Rightarrow \quad P_{n1}  = \Phi(\beta s_n),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is [[Cumulative normal|cumulative distribution function of standard normal]].

==== {{anchor|logit varying over alternatives}} C. Logit with variables that vary over alternatives ====

''U&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the utility person ''n'' obtains from choosing alternative ''i''. The utility of each alternative depends on the attributes of the alternatives interacted perhaps with the attributes of the person. The unobserved terms are assumed to have an [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]] distribution.&lt;ref group ="nb" name="ev" &gt;The density and cumulative distribution function of the extreme value distribution are given by &lt;math&gt;f(\varepsilon_{nj}) = \exp (-\varepsilon_{nj}) \exp (-\exp (-\varepsilon_{nj}))&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;F(\varepsilon_{nj}) = \exp (-\exp (-\varepsilon_{nj})).&lt;/math&gt; This distribution is also called the [[Gumbel distribution|Gumbel]] or type I extreme value distribution, a special type of [[Extreme value distribution|generalized extreme value distribution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases} U_{n1} = \beta z_{n1} + \varepsilon_{n1} \\ U_{n2} = \beta z_{n2} + \varepsilon_{n2} \\ \varepsilon_{n1}, \varepsilon_{n2} \sim \text{iid extreme value} \end{cases} \quad \Rightarrow  \quad P_{n1}= \frac{\exp(\beta z_{n1})} {\exp(\beta z_{n1})+\exp(\beta z_{n2})} &lt;/math&gt;

We can relate this specification to [[#A. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives|model ''' A ''']] above, which is also binary logit. In particular, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''1&lt;/sub&gt; can also be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;P_{n1} =\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\beta (z_{n1}-z_{n2}))}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if two error terms are [[iid]] [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]],&lt;ref group ="nb" name="ev" /&gt; their difference is distributed [[Logistic function|logistic]], which is the basis for the equivalence of the two specifications.

==== {{anchor|probit varying over alternatives}} D. Probit with variables that vary over alternatives ====
The description of the model is the same as [[#C. Logit with variables that vary over alternatives|model '''C''']], except the difference of the two unobserved terms are distributed [[Normal distribution|standard normal]] instead of [[Logistic function|logistic]].

Then the probability of taking the action is
:&lt;math&gt;P_{n1} = \Phi(\beta (z_{n1}-z_{n2})),&lt;/math&gt; 
where Φ is the [[Cumulative normal|cumulative distribution function of standard normal]].

Estimation of such models is usually done via parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric maximum likelihood methods.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

=== Multinomial choice without correlation among alternatives ===

==== {{anchor|multinomial logit}} E. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives ====
{{Main article|Multinomial logit}}

The utility for all alternatives depends on the same variables, ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', but the coefficients are different for different alternatives:

*{{nowrap|''U&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''β&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'', }}
*Since only differences in utility matter, it is necessary to normalize &lt;math&gt;\beta_i =0 &lt;/math&gt; for one alternative. Assuming &lt;math&gt; \beta_1=0 &lt;/math&gt;,
*{{nowrap|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are  [[iid]]  [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]]&lt;ref group ="nb" name="ev" /&gt;
The choice probability takes the form
: &lt;math&gt;P_{ni}= {\exp(\beta_i s_n) \over \sum_{j=1}^J \exp(\beta_j s_n)},&lt;/math&gt;
where J is the total number of alternatives.

==== {{anchor|multinomial logit varying over alternatives|conditional logit}} F. Logit with variables that vary over alternatives (also called conditional logit) ====

The utility for each alternative depends on attributes of that alternative, interacted perhaps with attributes of the person:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} U_{ni} = \beta z_{ni} + \varepsilon_{ni} \\ \varepsilon_{ni} \sim \text{iid extreme value} \end{cases} \quad \Rightarrow \quad P_{ni} = {\exp(\beta z_{ni}) \over \sum_{j=1}^J \exp(\beta z_{nj})},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' is the total number of alternatives.

Note that [[#E. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives|model '''E''']] can be expressed in the same form as model '''F''' by appropriate respecification of variables. Define &lt;math&gt;w_{nj}^k=s_n \delta_{jk} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] and ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''  are from [[#E. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives|model '''E''']]. Then, model '''F''' is obtained by using

:&lt;math&gt;z_{nj}  = \left \{ w^1_{nj}, \cdots, w^J_{nj} \right \}  \quad \text{and} \quad \beta = \left \{ \beta_1, \cdots,\beta_J \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' is the total number of alternatives.

=== {{anchor|multinomial correlated alternatives}} Multinomial choice with correlation among alternatives ===

A standard logit model is not always suitable, since it assumes that there is no correlation in unobserved factors over alternatives. This lack of correlation translates into a particular pattern of substitution among alternatives that might not always be realistic in a given situation. This pattern of substitution is often called the  [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives|Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property]] of standard logit models. See the [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives#Criticisms of the IIA assumption|Red Bus/Blue Bus]] example in which this pattern does not hold,&lt;ref name=benakiva-lerman-1985&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben-Akiva |first=M. |last2=Lerman |first2=S. |year=1985 |title=Discrete Choice Analysis: Theory and Application to Travel Demand |series=Transportation Studies |location=Massachusetts |publisher=MIT Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the path choice example.&lt;ref name=benakiva-bierlaire-1999&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Ben-Akiva |first2=M. |last2=Bierlaire |year=1999 |chapterurl=http://roso.epfl.ch/mbi/handbook-final.pdf |chapter=Discrete Choice Methods and Their Applications to Short Term Travel Decisions |editor-first=R.

The following sections describe Nested Logit, GEV, Probit, and Mixed Logit models in detail.

==== {{anchor|nested logit}} G. Nested Logit and  Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models ====

The model is the same as [[#F. Logit with variables that vary over alternatives (also called conditional logit)|model '''F''']] except that the unobserved component of utility is correlated over alternatives rather than being independent over alternatives.

*{{nowrap|''U&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''βz&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'', }}
* The marginal distribution of each ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]],&lt;ref group ="nb" name="ev" /&gt; but their joint distribution allows correlation among them.
*The probability takes many forms depending on the pattern of correlation that is specified. See  [[Generalized extreme value distribution|Generalized Extreme Value]].

==== {{anchor|multinomial probit}} H. Multinomial probit ====
{{Main article|Multinomial probit}}

The model is the same as [[#G. Nested Logit and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV models)|model '''G''']] except that the unobserved terms are distributed jointly [[Normal distribution|normal]], which allows any pattern of correlation and [[heteroscedasticity]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} U_{ni} = \beta z_{ni} +\varepsilon_{ni} \\ \varepsilon_n \equiv (\varepsilon_{n1},\cdots,\varepsilon_{nJ}) \sim N(0,\Omega)  \end{cases} \quad \Rightarrow \quad P_{ni} = \Pr \left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i}\beta z_{ni}+\varepsilon_{ni} &gt; \beta z_{nj} + \varepsilon_{nj} \right )  = \int I\left ( \bigcap_{j \neq i}\beta z_{ni}+\varepsilon_{ni} &gt; \beta z_{nj} + \varepsilon_{nj} \right ) \phi(\varepsilon_n | \Omega) \;d \varepsilon_n,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \phi(\varepsilon_n | \Omega) &lt;/math&gt; is the joint normal density with mean zero and covariance &lt;math&gt;\Omega &lt;/math&gt;.

The integral for this choice probability does not have a closed form, and so the probability is approximated by quadrature or [http://elsa.berkeley.edu/choice2/ch5.pdf simulation].

When &lt;math&gt;\Omega &lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix (such that there is no correlation or [[heteroscedasticity]]), the model is called independent probit.

==== {{anchor|mixed logit}} I. Mixed logit ====
{{Main article|Mixed logit}}

Mixed Logit models have become increasingly popular  in recent years for several reasons. First, the model allows ''β''  to be random in addition to ''ε''.  The randomness in ''β'' accommodates random taste variation over people and correlation across alternatives that generates flexible substitution patterns.  Second, the advent in simulation has made approximation of the model fairly easy. In addition, [[Daniel McFadden|McFadden]] and [[Kenneth E. Train|Train]] have shown that any true choice model can be approximated, to any degree of accuracy by a mixed logit with appropriate specification of explanatory variables and distribution of coefficients.&lt;ref name="mt-mnl" /&gt;

*{{nowrap|''U&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''βz&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'', }}
*&lt;math&gt;\beta \sim f(\beta | \theta) &lt;/math&gt; for any distribution &lt;math&gt; \it f &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the set of distribution parameters (e.g. mean and variance) to be estimated,
*{{nowrap|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∼ }} [[iid]] [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]],&lt;ref group ="nb" name="ev" /&gt;
The choice probability is
:&lt;math&gt;P_{ni}= \int_\beta L_{ni} (\beta)  f(\beta | \theta) \, d\beta,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; L_{ni} (\beta) = {\exp(\beta z_{ni}) \over {\sum_{j=1}^J \exp(\beta z_{nj})}}&lt;/math&gt; 
is logit probability evaluated at &lt;math&gt; \beta, &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; the total number of alternatives.

The integral for this choice probability does not have a closed form, so the probability is approximated by simulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elsa.berkeley.edu/choice2/ch6.pdf]. Also see [[Mixed logit]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model applications ===

The models described above are adapted to accommodate rankings and ratings data.

==== Ranking of alternatives ====
In many situations, a person's ranking of alternatives is observed, rather than just their chosen alternative. For example, a person who has bought a new car might be asked what he/she would have bought if that car was not offered, which provides information on the person's second choice in addition to their first choice. Or, in a survey, a respondent might be asked:

::&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;: Rank the following cell phone calling plans from your most preferred to your least preferred.
:: * $60 per month for unlimited anytime minutes, two-year contract with $100 early termination fee
:: * $30 per month for 400 anytime minutes, 3 cents per minute after 400 minutes, one-year contract with $125 early termination fee
:: * $35 per month for 500 anytime minutes, 3 cents per minute after 500 minutes, no contract or early termination fee
:: * $50 per month for 1000 anytime minutes, 5 cents per minute after 1000 minutes, two-year contract with $75 early termination fee

The models described above can be adapted to account for rankings beyond the first choice. The most prominent model for rankings data is the exploded logit and its mixed version.

===== {{anchor|exploded logit}} J. Exploded logit =====

Under the same assumptions as for a standard logit ([[#F. Logit with variables that vary over alternatives (also called conditional logit)|model '''F''']]), the probability for a ranking of the alternatives is a product of standard logits. The model is called  "exploded logit" because the choice situation that is usually represented as one logit formula for the chosen alternative is expanded ("exploded") to have a separate logit formula for each ranked alternative. The exploded logit model is the product of standard logit models with the choice set decreasing as each alternative is ranked and leaves the set of available choices in the subsequent choice.

Without loss of generality, the alternatives can be relabeled to represent the person's ranking, such that alternative 1 is the first choice, 2 the second choice, etc. The choice probability of ranking J alternatives as 1, 2, …, J is then

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(\text{ranking } 1, 2, \ldots , J) = {\exp(\beta z_1) \over \sum_{j=1}^J \exp(\beta z_{nj})} {\exp(\beta z_2) \over \sum_{j=2}^J \exp(\beta z_{nj})} \ldots {\exp(\beta z_{J-1}) \over \sum_{j=J-1}^J \exp(\beta z_{nj})}&lt;/math&gt;

As with standard logit, the exploded logit model assumes no correlation in unobserved factors over alternatives. The exploded logit can be generalized, in the same way as the standard logit is generalized, to accommodate correlations among alternatives and random taste variation. The "mixed exploded logit" model is obtained by probability of the ranking, given above, for ''L&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the mixed logit model ([[#I. Mixed Logit|model '''I''']]).

This model is also known in econometrics as the ''rank ordered logit model'' and it was introduced in that field by Beggs, Cardell and [[Jerry Hausman|Hausman]] in 1981.&lt;ref name = "bch"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beggs |first=S. |last2=Cardell |first2=S. |last3=Hausman |first3=J. |year=1981 |title=Assessing the Potential Demand for Electric Cars |journal=[[Journal of Econometrics]] |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1016/0304-4076(81)90056-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "combes" /&gt; One application is the Combes et al. paper explaining the ranking of candidates to become professor.&lt;ref name = "combes"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Pierre-Philippe |last=Combes |first2=Laurent |last2=Linnemer |first3=Michael |last3=Visser |title=Publish or Peer-Rich?

==== Ratings data ====

In surveys, respondents are often asked to give ratings, such as:

::&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;: Please give your rating of how well the President is doing.
:: 1: Very badly

Or,
::&lt;u&gt;Example&lt;/u&gt;: On a 1-5 scale where 1 means disagree completely and 5 means agree completely, how much do you agree with the following statement. "The Federal government should do more to help people facing foreclosure on their homes."

A multinomial discrete-choice model can examine the responses to these questions ([[#G. Nested Logit and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models|model '''G''']], [[#H. Multinomial Probit|model '''H''']], [[#I. Mixed Logit|model '''I''']]). However, these models are derived under the concept that the respondent obtains some utility for each possible answer and gives the answer that provides the greatest utility. It might be more natural to think that the respondent has some latent measure or index associated with the question and answers in response to how high this measure is. Ordered logit and ordered probit models are derived under this concept.

===== {{anchor|ordered logit}} K. Ordered logit =====
{{Main article|Ordered logit}}

Let ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' represent the strength of survey respondent ''n''’s feelings or opinion on the survey subject. Assume that there are cutoffs of the level of the opinion in choosing particular response. For instance, in the example of the helping people facing foreclosure, the person chooses
* 1, if ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; a
*  2, if a &lt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; b
*  3, if b &lt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; c
*  4, if c &lt; ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; d
*  5, if ''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; d,
for some real numbers ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''.

Defining &lt;math&gt; U_n = \beta z_n + \varepsilon, \; \varepsilon \sim&lt;/math&gt; [[Logistic function|Logistic]], then the probability of each possible response is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Pr(\text{choosing }  1) &amp; = \Pr(U_n &lt;a) = \Pr(\varepsilon &lt; a - \beta z_n) = {1 \over 1+\exp(-(a - \beta z_n))} \\
\Pr(\text{choosing }  2) &amp; = \Pr(a &lt; U_n &lt; b) =\Pr(a- \beta z_n &lt; \varepsilon  &lt; b - \beta z_n) = {1 \over 1+\exp(-(b - \beta z_n))} - {1 \over 1+\exp(-(a - \beta z_n))} \\
&amp; \cdots \\
\Pr(\text{choosing } 5) &amp; = \Pr(U_n  &gt;  d) = \Pr(\varepsilon  &gt;  d - \beta z_n) = 1 - {1 \over 1+\exp(-(d - \beta z_n))}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The parameters of the model are the coefficients ''β'' and the cut-off points {{nowrap|''a − d''}}, one of which must be normalized for identification. When there are only two possible responses, the ordered logit is the same a binary logit ([[#A. Logit with attributes of the person but no attributes of the alternatives|model '''A''']]), with one cut-off point normalized to zero.

===== {{anchor|ordered probit}} L. Ordered probit =====
{{Main article|Ordered probit}}

The description of the model is the same as [[#K. Ordered Logit|model '''K''']], except the unobserved terms have [[normal distribution]] instead of [[Logistic function|logistic]].

The choice probabilities are (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Pr(\text{choosing } 1) &amp;= \Phi (a - \beta z_n)  \\
\Pr(\text{choosing } 2) &amp;= \Phi (b - \beta z_n) -  \Phi (a - \beta z_n) \\
&amp;\cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== {{anchor|dynamic discrete choice}} Dynamic discrete choice models ==
Discrete choice models of [[Dynamic programming|dynamic programming]], more commonly called ''dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models'', generalize [[Utility theory|utility theory]] upon which discrete choice models are based. Rather than assuming observed choices are the result of static utility maximization, observed choices in DDC models are assumed to result from an agent's maximization of the [[Present value|present value]] of utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| date       = 2009
| doi 	     = 10.1016/j.red.2008.07.001
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of DDC models is to estimate the [[Structural estimation|structural parameters]] of the agent's decision process. Once these parameters are known, the researcher can then use the estimates to simulate how the agent would behave in a [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] state of the world. (For example, how a prospective college student's enrollment decision would change in response to a tuition increase.)

=== {{anchor|mathematical representation}} Mathematical representation ===
Agent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'s [[Bellman_equation#A_dynamic_decision_problem|maximization problem]] can be written mathematically as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
V\left(x_{n0}\right)=\max_{\left\{d_{nt}\right\}_{t=1}^{T}}\mathbb{E}\left(\sum_{t^{\prime}=t}^{T}\sum_{i=1}^{J}\beta^{t^{\prime}-t}\left(d_{nt}=i\right)U_{nit}\left(x_{nt},\varepsilon_{nit}\right)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;,

where 
* &lt;math&gt;x_{nt}&lt;/math&gt; are [[State variable|state variables]], with &lt;math&gt;x_{n0}&lt;/math&gt; the agent's [[Initial condition|initial condition]]
* &lt;math&gt;d_{nt}&lt;/math&gt; represents &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'s decision from among &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; discrete alternatives
* &lt;math&gt;\beta \in \left(0,1\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Discounting#Discount_factor|discount factor]]
* &lt;math&gt;U_{nit}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Utility theory|flow utility]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; receives from choosing alternative &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and depends on both the state &lt;math&gt;x_{nt}&lt;/math&gt; and unobserved factors &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{nit}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Time horizon|time horizon]]
* The expectation &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}\left(\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; is taken over both the &lt;math&gt;x_{nt}&lt;/math&gt;'s and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{nit}&lt;/math&gt;'s in &lt;math&gt;U_{nit}&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the agent is uncertain about future transitions in the states, and is also uncertain about future realizations of unobserved factors.

==== {{anchor|simplifying assumptions}} Simplifying assumptions and Notation ====
It is standard to impose the following simplifying assumptions and notation of the dynamic decision problem:

'''1. Flow utility is additively separable and linear in parameters'''

The flow utility can be written as an additive sum, consisting of deterministic and stochastic elements. The deterministic component can be written as a linear function of the [[Structural estimation|structural parameters]].

&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{5}
U_{nit}\left(x_{nt},\varepsilon_{nit}\right) &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; u_{nit}          &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; \varepsilon_{nit} &amp; \\
                                             &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; X_{nt}\alpha_{i} &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; \varepsilon_{nit} &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. The optimization problem can be written as a [[Bellman equation]]'''

Define by &lt;math&gt;V_{nt}\left(x_{nt}\right)&lt;/math&gt; the ''ex ante'' value function for individual &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; just before &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{nt}&lt;/math&gt; is revealed:

&lt;math&gt;
V_{nt}\left(x_{nt}\right) = \mathbb{E} \max_{i} \left\{ u_{nit}\left(x_{nt}\right) + \varepsilon_{nit} + \beta \int_{x_{t+1}} V_{nt+1}\left(x_{nt+1}\right) dF\left(x_{t+1} \vert x_{t} \right) \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the expectation operator &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; is over the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;'s, and where &lt;math&gt;dF\left(x_{t+1} \vert x_{t} \right)&lt;/math&gt; represents the probability distribution over &lt;math&gt;x_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt; conditional on &lt;math&gt;x_{t}&lt;/math&gt;. The expectation over state transitions is accomplished by taking the integral over this probability distribution.

It is possible to decompose &lt;math&gt;V_{nt}\left(x_{nt}\right)&lt;/math&gt; into deterministic and stochastic components:

&lt;math&gt;
V_{nt}\left(x_{nt}\right) = \mathbb{E} \max_{i} \left\{ v_{nit}\left(x_{nt}\right) + \varepsilon_{nit} \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_{nit}&lt;/math&gt; is the value to choosing alternative &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and is written as

&lt;math&gt;
v_{nit}\left(x_{nt}\right) = u_{nit}\left(x_{nt}\right) + \beta \int_{x_{t+1}} \mathbb{E} \max_{j} \left\{ v_{njt+1}\left(x_{nt+1}\right) + \varepsilon_{njt+1} \right\} dF\left(x_{t+1} \vert x_{t} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where now the expectation &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}&lt;/math&gt; is taken over the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{njt+1}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''3. The optimization problem follows a [[Markov decision process]]'''

The states &lt;math&gt;x_{t}&lt;/math&gt; follow a [[Markov chain]]. That is, attainment of state &lt;math&gt;x_{t}&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the state &lt;math&gt;x_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; and not &lt;math&gt;x_{t-2}&lt;/math&gt; or any prior state.


==== {{anchor|conditional value function}} Conditional value functions and choice probabilities ====
The value function in the previous section is called the '''conditional value function''', because it is the value function conditional on choosing alternative &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Writing the conditional value function in this way is useful in constructing formulas for the choice probabilities.

To write down the choice probabilities, the researcher must make an assumption about the distribution of the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{nit}&lt;/math&gt;'s. As in static discrete choice models, this distribution can be assumed to be [[iid]]  [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value]], [[Generalized extreme value distribution|Generalized Extreme Value]], [[Multinomial probit]], or [[Mixed logit]].

For the case where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{nit}&lt;/math&gt; is multinomial logit (i.e. drawn [[iid]] from the [[Extreme value distribution|extreme value distribution]]), the formulas for the choice probabilities would be:

&lt;math&gt;P_{nit}= {\exp\left(v_{nit}\right) \over \sum_{j=1}^J \exp\left(v_{njt}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Estimation ===
Estimation of dynamic discrete choice models is particularly challenging, due to the fact that the researcher must solve the backwards recursion problem for each guess of the structural parameters.

The most common methods used to estimate the structural parameters are [[Maximum likelihood estimation]] and [[Method of simulated moments]]. 

Aside from estimation methods, there are also solution methods. Different solution methods can be employed due to complexity of the problem. These can be divided into '''full-solution methods''' and '''non-solution methods'''.


==== {{anchor|full solution}} Full-solution methods ====

The foremost example of a full-solution method is the [[John_Rust#The_Nested_Fixed_Point_(NFXP)_algorithm|Nested Fixed Point (NFXP) algorithm]] developed by [[John Rust]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The NFXP algorithm is described in great detail in its documentation manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent work by Che-Lin Su and [[Kenneth Judd]] in 2012&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; implements another approach (dismissed as intractable by Rust in 1987), which uses [[Constrained optimization|constrained optimization]] of the likelihood function, and is referred to as mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC).
Specifically, the likelihood function is maximized subject to the constrains imposed by the model, and expressed in terms of the additional variables that describe the model's structure. This approach requires powerful optimization software such as [[Artelys_Knitro|Artelys Knitro]] because of high dimensionality of the optimization problem.
Once it is solved, both the structural parameters that maximize the likelihood, and the solution of the model are found. 

In the later article&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| last1      = Iskhakov
| first1     = Fedor
| last2      = Lee
| first2     = Jinhyuk

| url 	     = https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA12605
| doi        = 10.3982/ECTA12605 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Rust and coauthors show that the speed advantage of the MPEC compared to NFXP is not significant. Yet, because the computations required by MPEC do not rely on the structure of the model, its implementation is much less labor intensive.

==== {{anchor|non solution}} Non-solution methods ====

An alternative to full-solution methods is non-solution methods. In this case, the researcher can estimate the structural parameters without having to fully solve the backwards recursion problem for each parameter guess. Non-solution methods require more assumptions, but the additional assumptions are in many cases realistic and at the very least can save the researcher's time by not having to solve the model. 

The leading non-solution method is conditional choice probabilities, developed by V. Joseph Hotz and Robert A. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[dynamical systems]], an '''exponential dichotomy''' is a property of an [[equilibrium point]] that extends the idea of [[hyperbolic equilibrium point|hyperbolicity]] to non-[[autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous system]]s.

==Definition==
If

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}} = A(t)\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[linear system|linear]] non-autonomous dynamical system in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with [[fundamental solution matrix]] Φ(''t''), Φ(0) = ''I'', then the equilibrium point '''0''' is said to have an ''exponential dichotomy'' if there exists a (constant) [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''P'' such that ''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''P'' and positive constants ''K'', ''L'', α, and β such that

:&lt;math&gt;|| \Phi(t) P \Phi^{-1}(s) || \le Ke^{-\alpha(t - s)}\mbox{ for }s \le t &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;|| \Phi(t) (I - P) \Phi^{-1}(s) || \le Le^{-\beta(s - t)}\mbox{ for }s \ge t &gt; -\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

If furthermore, ''L'' = 1/''K'' and β = α, then '''0''' is said to have a ''uniform exponential dichotomy''.

The constants α and β allow us to define the ''spectral window'' of the equilibrium point, (&amp;minus;α,&amp;nbsp;β).

==Explanation==
The matrix ''P'' is a projection onto the stable subspace and ''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''P'' is a projection onto the unstable subspace.  What the exponential dichotomy says is that the norm of the projection onto the stable subspace of any orbit in the system [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ and the norm of the projection onto the unstable subspace of any orbit decays exponentially as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;∞, and furthermore that the stable and unstable subspaces are conjugate (because &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P \oplus (I - P) = \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;).

An equilibrium point with an exponential dichotomy has many of the properties of a hyperbolic equilibrium point in [[autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous system]]s.  In fact, it can be shown that a hyperbolic point has an exponential dichotomy.

[[Image:FTGbord Leuven 1.jpg|thumb|right|Sign announcing the Belgian city of [[Leuven]]'s Fair Trade Town status|300px]]

The '''Fair Trade Towns''' campaign is the result of a grass-roots citizens movement that started in the UK in 2001 (see below). It allows citizens to get together in order to self-proclaim their town (or other local geographical area) as a region that complies with a few general Fair Trade criteria, that can be adapted from country to country but which retain their main elements.

In some countries, the '''Fair Trade Town''' became a status awarded by a recognized Fair Trade certification body (i.e. the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[TransFair Canada]] in [[Canada]] etc.) describing an area which is committed to the promotion of [[Fair Trade certification|Fair Trade certified]] goods. By extension, the organizations also award the statuses of '''Fair Trade City''', '''Fair Trade Village''', '''Fair Trade Zone''', '''Fair Trade Borough''', '''Fair Trade Island''', '''Fair Trade Country''' and '''Fair Trade University'''.

== History ==
The Fair Trade Town campaign was first launched in 2001 in [[Garstang]], [[Lancashire]], under the initiative of Bruce Crowther, a local [[Oxfam]] supporter, and the Garstang Oxfam Group. The initiative, which aimed to promote Fair Trade certified goods in the town, was highly successful: within a couple of months, awareness of the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fairtrade Mark]] jumped to over 70% in the town while sales of Fairtrade certified goods increased significantly. Moreover, over the course of the campaign, Garstang developed links with Fair Trade cocoa farming communities in West Africa, which led to the [[Twin towns and sister cities|twin town]] relationship with [[New Koforidua]], [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;Garstang Fair Trade Town (2002). [http://www.garstangfairtrade.org.uk/ft/fairtrade.htm Garstang Fair Trade Town]. URL accessed on December 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the activities at Garstang gained wider attention, the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] launched a set of Fair Trade Town Goals and an Action Guide to encourage others to follow in the town's success. During the 2001-2006 period, over 209 British towns were awarded the Fair Trade status by the Fairtrade Foundation. In October 2009 448 British towns and 312 towns worldwide awarded the Fair Trade status (in total 760). In November 2012, there were over 1200 worldwide.

In an attempt to replicate the success of the [[Fairtrade Foundation]]'s Fairtrade Town program, a Europe-wide program called "Fair Trade Towns in Europe", part-funded by the [[European Commission]], was launched jointly by several Fair Trade labelling initiatives.

In November 2006, the first ever European Fair Trade Towns conference was hosted at London Southbank University. The goals of the conference were to
*identify and develop procedures to strengthen the links within and between local communities and private and public organisations;
*develop strategies to enable the UK Fair Trade Towns model to meet the requirements of each individual country.

Following the success of the first event, a second Fair Trade towns conference was subsequently held in Brussels in January 2008. The sixth conference was held in Poznan (Poland) in November 2012, and the 2013 and 2014 international conferences are foreseen to take place in Oslo (Norway) and Kumamoto (Japan), respectively.

There are currently Fair Trade Towns in [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. The [[list of Fairtrade settlements]] is a more comprehensive current list.

== Criteria ==
[[Image:Wolfville-fair-trade-sm.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sign announcing [[Wolfville]]'s (Canada) Fair Trade Town status]]

Formal guidelines have been produced jointly by several [[FLO International|FLO]] member Fairtrade labelling initiatives. In order to be awarded [[Fair Trade]] status, an area must meet five criteria (exact numbers and proportions vary from country to country):

* Local council passes a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] supporting [[Fair Trade]], and agrees to serve Fair Trade [[tea]] and [[coffee]] at its meetings and in its [[office]]s and [[canteen (place)|canteen]]s.
* A range of (at least two) Fair Trade products is readily available in the area’s [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shops]] and local [[café]]s/[[catering]] establishments.
** Target for number of retail outlets: population of &lt; 10000 - 1 retail outlet per 2500; population &lt; 200000 - 1 retail outlet per 5000; population of &lt; 500000 - 1 retail outlet per 10000.

* Attract [[Mass media|media]] coverage and popular support for the campaign.
* A local Fair Trade steering group is convened to ensure continued commitment to its Fair Trade Town status.

== Other initiatives ==
In 2002 The [[Wales]] Fair Trade Forum, a network of development NGOs and Fair Trade campaigners, began working to make Wales the world's first Fair Trade country.  The idea was based upon the Fair Trade Town scheme run by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the UK.  In 2005 The [[Welsh Assembly Government]] agreed to back the idea and in 2006 Fair Trade groups from [[Scotland]] and Wales agreed the criteria for becoming a Fair Trade country.

The draft criteria for a "Fair Trade Nation" are:[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/News-Extras/fair-trade]
* 75% of the population should purchase a Fair Trade product every year.
* 40% of people regularly buy Fair Trade products.
* All local authorities have active Fair Trade groups working towards Fair Trade status.
* 55% local authority areas with Fair Trade status with 10% annual increase in following years

Wales became the world's first Fair Trade nation in June 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7958">In [[time series]] analysis, a '''fan chart''' is a chart that joins a simple [[line chart]] for observed past data, by showing ranges for possible values of future data together with a line showing a central estimate or most likely value for the future outcomes. As predictions become increasingly uncertain the further into the future one goes, these forecast ranges spread out, creating distinctive wedge or "fan" shapes, hence the term. Alternative forms of the chart can also include uncertainty for past data, such as preliminary data that is subject to revision.

The term "fan chart" was coined by the [[Bank of England]], which has been using these charts and this term since 1997 in its "Inflation Report" &lt;ref name="BoEInfRep" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BrittonEtAl1998" /&gt; to describe its best prevision of future [[inflation]] to the general public. Fan charts have been used extensively in [[finance]] and [[monetary policy]], for instance to represent forecasts of [[inflation]].
[[File:FanChartInfl.jpg|thumb|alt=FanChartInfl|Hypothetical Fan Chart of the Inflation Rate]]

== Implementation ==
Predicted future values can be diagrammed in various ways; most simply, by a single predicted value, and an upper and lower range around that (three lines total), or by various future intervals, depicted by varying degrees of shading (darkest near the center of the range, fainter near the ends of the range).

There are several ways to represent the forecast density depending on the shape of the forecasting distribution.
*If the forecast density is symmetric ([[Normal distribution|normal]] or [[Student's t distribution|Student's t]], for instance), the fan centers at the mean (which coincides with the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]] and [[median]]) forecast, and the ranges expand like [[confidence interval]]s by adding and subtracting multiples of the forecasting standard error to the mean forecast. These ranges are known as equal-tail ranges and centre at the mean forecast. Low resolution charts may add and subtract one, two and three forecasting standard errors for approximate coverages of 68%, 95% and 99.7%. These charts can easily be built through standard Excel graphs.
*If the forecast density is non-symmetric, centering the fan at the median and using equal tail ranges might not be appropriate as it would overstate the forecast uncertainty. In this case it is better to center the fan at the more likely forecast (the mode) and use Highest Probability Density (HPD) ranges.&lt;ref name="CasellaBerger2002" /&gt; HPDs are by definition the shortest ranges covering a given probability, say 50%, and are centered at the mode. In this case it is usual to include increasing probability ranges of 10%, 20%, …, 90%, for instance.&lt;ref name="Julio2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Julio2009" /&gt;

In the Bank of England’s implementation it is assumed that the forecast distribution is a two piece normal or [[split normal distribution|split normal density]].&lt;ref name="John1982" /&gt; This density results from joining the two halves of corresponding normal densities with the same mode but different variances. As a result, the split normal density is non-symmetric and uni-modal. In this case, inflation forecast fan charts are usually accompanied with the balance of risks, the probability that the future inflation falls below its modal forecast. In this way, central banks that employ [[inflation targeting]] report to the general public not only the more likely forecasts of the inflation rate ''but also its balance of risks''!&lt;ref name="BlixSellin1998" /&gt;

The split normal density is completely characterized by three parameters, the mode, variance and skewness. Therefore, the fan chart ranges depend on these parameters only.&lt;ref name="Julio2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Julio2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="John1982" /&gt; and &lt;ref name="KotzEtAl1994" /&gt;

In a central bank that employs [[inflation targeting]], the three moments of the inflation forecast distribution are determined as follows:

* The mode. Modal forecasts are derived from the suite of models of the central bank.
* The variance. Standard errors of forecasts might be derived from appropriately formulated forecasting models but it is advisable to derive them from historical forecasting errors instead.&lt;ref name="BrittonEtAl1998" /&gt;
* The skewness. A mapping from the skewness (or balances of risks) of factors that affect the inflation rate along the forecast horizon to the skewness of the inflation forecast distribution has to be specified.&lt;ref name="BlixSellin1998"/&gt;

{{American socialism |History}}

The '''First Red Scare''' was a period during [[History of the United States (1918–1945)|the early 20th-century history of the United States]] marked by a widespread fear of [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]] and [[anarchism]], due to real and imagined events; real events included the [[Russian Revolution]] and [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|anarchist bombings]].  At its height in 1919–1920, concerns over the effects of radical political agitation in American society and the alleged spread of [[communism]] and [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchism]] in the [[American labor movement]] fueled a general sense of concern.

The Scare had its origins in the [[hyper-nationalism]] of [[World War I]] as well as the Russian Revolution.  At the war's end, following the [[October Revolution]], American authorities saw the threat of Communist revolution in the actions of [[Trade union|organized labor]], including such disparate cases as the [[Seattle General Strike]] and the [[Boston Police Strike]] and then in the [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|bombing campaign]] directed by anarchist groups at political and business leaders. Fueled by labor unrest and the anarchist bombings, and then spurred on by [[United States Attorney General]] [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer|A. Mitchell Palmer's]] attempt to suppress radical organizations, it was characterized by exaggerated rhetoric, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|illegal search and seizures]], [[Arrest warrant|unwarranted arrests]] and detentions, and the [[deportation]] of several hundred suspected radicals and anarchists. In addition, the growing anti-[[immigration]] [[nativism (politics)|nativism]] movement among Americans viewed increasing immigration from [[Southern Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]] as a threat to American political and social stability.

Bolshevism and the threat of a [[Communism|Communist]]-inspired revolution in the U.S. became the overriding explanation for challenges to the [[social order]], even such largely unrelated events as incidents of [[Mass racial violence in the United States|interracial violence]]. Fear of radicalism was used to explain the suppression of freedom of expression in form of display of certain flags and banners. The First Red Scare effectively ended in mid-1920, after Attorney General Palmer forecast a massive radical uprising on [[May Day]] and the day passed without incident.

==Origins==
The First Red Scare's immediate cause was the increase in subversive actions (both real and imagined) of foreign and [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] elements in the United States, especially militant followers of [[Luigi Galleani]], and in the attempts of the U.S. government to quell protest and gain favorable public views of America's entering [[World War I]]. At the end of the 19th century and prior to the rise of the Galleanist anarchist movement, the [[Haymarket affair]] of 1886 had already heightened the American public's fear of foreign anarchist and radical socialist elements within the budding American workers' movement. In 1917, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] established the [[Committee on Public Information]] to circulate and distribute anti-[[Germany|German]] and pro-[[Allies of World War I|Allied]] propaganda and other news. To add to the effectiveness of the Committee, the Bureau of Investigation (the name for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] until 1935) disrupted the work of German-American, union, and leftist organizations through the use of raids, arrests, [[agents provocateurs]], and legal prosecution. [[Revolutionary]] and [[Pacifism|pacifist]] groups, such as the [[Socialist Party of America]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW; its members are known as ''Wobblies''), strongly opposed the war. Many leaders of these groups, most notably [[Eugene V. Debs]], were prosecuted for giving speeches urging resistance to the [[Conscription|draft]]. Members of the [[Ghadar Party]] were also put on trial in the [[Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial]].

The effort was also helped by the [[United States Congress]], with the passing of the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] in 1917, the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], and the [[Immigration Act of 1918]]. The Espionage Act made it a crime to interfere with the operation or success of the military, and the Sedition Act forbade Americans to use "disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language" about the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]], [[Flag of the United States|flag]], or [[Military of the United States|armed forces of the United States]] during war.&lt;ref&gt;Laws of the United States, ''Espionage Act of 1917'' (Act of June 15, 1917), ch. 30, title I, §3, 40 Stat. 219, amended by Act of May 16, 1918, ch. 75, 40 Stat. 553-54, reenacted by Act of Mar. 3, 1921, ch. 136, 41 Stat. 1359, (codified at 18 U.S.C. §2388); Laws of the United States, ''Sedition Act of 1918'', (1918 Amendments to §3 of The Espionage Act of 1917), Act of May 16, 1918, ch. 75, 40 Stat. 553-54, (repealed by Act of Mar. 3, 1921, ch. 136, 41 Stat. 1359)&lt;/ref&gt; The Immigration Act of 1918 targeted anarchists by name and was used to deport [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Luigi Galleani]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hagedorn, ''Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919'' (NY: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2007), 184-5, 218-22&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war officially ended, the government investigations abated for a few months but did not cease. They soon resumed in the context of the Russian Revolution of 1917, the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]], and the [[Red Terror]]. To some Americans, this was a time of uncertainty and fear over the prospects of an anarchist, socialist or communist revolution in the United States.

=={{anchor|History}} Progression of events==

===Seattle General Strike===
{{Main|Seattle General Strike}}
[[File:Seattle General Strike.jpg|thumb|Headlines announcing the [[Seattle General Strike|Seattle General Strike of 1919]], the nation's first [[general strike]]]]
On January 21, 1919, 35,000 shipyard workers in [[Seattle]] went on strike seeking wage increases. They appealed to the Seattle Central Labor Council for support from other unions and found widespread enthusiasm. Within two weeks, more than 100 local unions joined in a call on February 3 for general strike to begin on the morning of February 6.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 58-60; Brecher, 121&lt;/ref&gt; The 60,000 total strikers paralyzed the city's normal activities, like streetcar service, schools, and ordinary commerce, while their General Strike Committee maintained order and provided essential services, like trash collection and milk deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 87; [[Jeremy Brecher|Brecher]], 122-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the strike began, the press begged the unions to reconsider. In part they were frightened by some of labor's rhetoric, like the labor newspaper editorial that proclaimed: "We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by labor in this country&amp;nbsp; ... We are starting on a road that leads &amp;ndash; NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!"&lt;ref&gt;Brecher, 124-5&lt;/ref&gt; Daily newspapers saw the general strike as a foreign import: "This is America &amp;ndash; not Russia," one said when denouncing the general strike.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 60-1&lt;/ref&gt; The non-striking part of Seattle's population imagined the worst and stocked up on food. Hardware stores sold their stock of guns.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 60-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle Mayor [[Ole Hanson]] announced that he had 1500 police and 1500 federal troops on hand to put down any disturbances. He personally oversaw their deployment throughout the city.&lt;ref name="Murray, 63"&gt;Murray, 63&lt;/ref&gt; "The time has come," he said, "for the people in Seattle to show their Americanism&amp;nbsp; ... The anarchists in this community shall not rule its affairs."&lt;ref name="Murray, 63"/&gt; He promised to use them to replace striking workers, but never carried out that threat.&lt;ref&gt;Brecher, 126-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile the national leadership of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) and international leaders of some of the Seattle locals recognized how inflammatory the general strike was proving in the eyes of the American public and Seattle's middle class. Press and political reaction made the general strike untenable, and they feared Seattle labor would lose gains made during the war if it continued.&lt;ref&gt;Brecher, 127-8; Murray, 64&lt;/ref&gt; The national press called the general strike "Marxian" and "a revolutionary movement aimed at existing government."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 65&lt;/ref&gt; "It is only a middling step," said the ''Chicago Tribune'', "from Petrograd to Seattle."&lt;ref&gt;Murray 65&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as February 8 some unions began to return to work at the urging of their leaders. Some workers went back to work as individuals, perhaps fearful of losing their jobs if the Mayor acted on his threats or in reaction to the pressure of life under the general strike.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 75&lt;/ref&gt; The executive committee of the General Strike Committee first recommended ending the general strike on February 8 but lost that vote. Finally on February 10, the General Strike Committee voted to end the strike the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 75-6&lt;/ref&gt; The original strike in the shipyards continued.&lt;ref&gt;Brecher, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the general strike collapsed because labor leadership viewed it as a misguided tactic from the start, Mayor Hanson took credit for ending the five-day strike and was hailed by the press. He resigned a few months later and toured the country giving lectures on the dangers of "domestic bolshevism." He earned $38,000 in seven months, five times his annual salary as mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 65-6; Hagedorn, 180&lt;/ref&gt; He published a pamphlet called ''Americanism versus Bolshevism''.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 77n; Noggle, 102-3; Ole Hanson, ''Americanism versus Bolshevism'' (Garden City, NY, 1920), [https://archive.org/details/americanismversu00hansuoft ''Americanism versus Bolshevism''], accessed April 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overman Committee===
{{Main|Overman Committee}}
[[File:OvermanCommittee.png|left|thumb|upright=1.67|alt="Senators Tell What Bolshevism in America Means.|''[[The New York Times]]'', June 15, 1919&lt;ref name=nytsenators&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/06/15/archives/senators-tell-what-bolshevism-in-america-means-overman-committee-no.html "Senators Tell What Bolshevism in America Means," June 15, 1919]. Retrieved February 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Overman Committee]] was a special five-man subcommittee of the U.S. [[Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] chaired by North Carolina Democrat [[Lee Slater Overman]]. First charged with investigating German subversion during World War I, its mandate was extended on February 4, 1919, just a day after the announcement of the Seattle General Strike, to study "any efforts being made to propagate in this country the principles of any party exercising or claiming to exercise any authority in Russia" and "any effort to incite the overthrow of the Government of this country.&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 6; Hagedorn, 55; Murray, 94; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/02/05/archives/senate-orders-reds-here-investigated-directs-overman-committee-to.html "Senate Orders Reds Here Investigated," February 5, 1919]. Retrieved February 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's hearings into Bolshevik propaganda, conducted from February 11 to March 10, 1919, developed an alarming image of Bolshevism as an imminent threat to the U.S. government and American values. The Committee's final report appeared in June 1919.

[[Archibald E. Stevenson]], a New York attorney with ties to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], probably as a "volunteer spy",&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 54, 58&lt;/ref&gt; testified on January 22, 1919, during the German phase of the subcommittee's work. He established that anti-war and anti-draft activism during World War I, which he described as pro-German activity, had now transformed itself into propaganda "developing sympathy for the Bolshevik movement".&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 12-4; Powers, 20&lt;/ref&gt; America's wartime enemy, though defeated, had exported an ideology that now ruled Russia and threatened America anew.

It had its origin in the philosophy of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and its leaders were Germans."&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 14; Lowenthal, 49&lt;/ref&gt; He cited the propaganda efforts of [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and gave many examples from the foreign press. He told the Senators that "We have found money coming into this country from Russia."&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 19, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senators were particularly interested in how Bolshevism had united many disparate elements on the left, including anarchists and socialists of many types,&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 14-8&lt;/ref&gt; "providing a common platform for all these radical groups to stand on."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 34&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Knute Nelson]], Republican of Minnesota, responded by enlarging Bolshevism's embrace to include an even larger segment of political opinion: "Then they have really rendered a service to the various classes of progressives and reformers that we have here in this country."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other witnesses described the horrors of the revolution in Russia and the consequences of a comparable revolution in the United States: the imposition of atheism, the seizure of newspapers, assaults on banks, and the abolition of the insurance industry. The Senators heard various views of women in Russia, including claims that women were made the property of the state.&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 475&lt;/ref&gt;

The press reveled in the investigation and the final report, referring to the Russians as "assassins and madmen," "human scum," "crime mad," and "beasts."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 97&lt;/ref&gt; The occasional testimony by some who viewed the Russian Revolution favorably lacked the punch of its critics. One extended headline in February read:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F07E5DA1139E13ABC4052DFB4668382609EDE&amp; "Bolshevism Bared by R.E.

===Anarchist bombings===
{{Main|1919 United States anarchist bombings}}
There were several anarchist bombings in 1919.

====April 1919 mail bombs====
[[File:Palmer Bombing.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer's house with bomb damage]]

In late April 1919, approximately 36 [[letter bomb|booby trap bombs were mailed]] to prominent politicians, including the Attorney General of the United States, judges, businessmen (including John D. Rockefeller),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footnote.com/spotlight/6883/1919_anarchist_bombings_chicago/ "Send Death Bombs to 36 U.S. Leaders"] ''Chicago Tribune'', May 1, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; and a Bureau of Investigation field agent, R.W. Finch, who happened to be investigating the ''Galleanist'' organization.&lt;ref&gt;The Galleanists were radical anarchists and devotees of Luigi Galleani who advocated 'direct action', i.e. bombing and assassination, against capitalists and representatives of the government.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', Princeton University Press (1991), pp. 147: The inclusion of R.W. Finch, a low-ranking BOI agent who had been assigned to question and investigate the ''Galleanist'' movement and had questioned other Galleanists about movements of its members, dispelled any doubt on the identity of the bombers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombs were mailed in identical packages and were timed to arrive on May Day, the day of celebration of organized labor and the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', Princeton University Press (1991), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;  A few of the packages went undelivered because they lacked sufficient postage.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  One bomb intended for Seattle Mayor [[Ole Hanson]], who had opposed the Seattle General Strike, arrived early and failed to explode as intended. Seattle police in turn notified the Post Office and other police agencies. On April 29, a package sent to U.S. Senator [[Thomas W. Hardwick]] of Georgia, a sponsor of the [[Anarchist Exclusion Act]], exploded injuring his wife and housekeeper. On April 30, a post office employee in [[New York City]] recognized 16 packages by their wrapping and interrupted their delivery. Another twelve bombs were recovered before reaching their targets.

====June 1919 bombs====
In June 1919, eight bombs, far larger than those mailed in April, exploded almost simultaneously in several U.S. cities.  These new bombs were believed to contain up to twenty-five pounds of dynamite,&lt;ref name="PLO"&gt;''Plotter Here Hid Trail Skillfully; His Victim Was A Night Watchman'', The New York Times, 4 June 1919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRE"&gt;''Wreck Judge Nott's Home'', The New York Times, 3 June 1919&lt;/ref&gt; and all were wrapped or packaged with heavy metal slugs designed to act as shrapnel.&lt;ref&gt;''20 Pounds of Dynamite In Bomb Used in New York,'', The Washington Post, June 4, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the intended targets had participated in some way with the investigation of or the opposition to anarchist radicals.  Along with Attorney General Palmer, who was targeted a second time, the intended victims included a Massachusetts state representative and a New Jersey silk manufacturer.  Fatalities included a New York City night watchman, [https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1919-06-04/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1919&amp;index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Boehner+William+WILLIAM&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1919&amp;ortext=William+Boehner&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 William Boehner],&lt;ref name="PLO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WRE"/&gt; and one of the bombers, Carlo Valdinoci, a ''[[Luigi Galleani|Galleanist]]'' radical who died in spectacular fashion when the bomb he placed at the home of Attorney General Palmer exploded in his face.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'' (AK Press, 2005) {{ISBN|1-904859-27-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904859-27-7}}, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; Though not seriously injured, Attorney General Palmer and his family were thoroughly shaken by the blast, and their home was largely demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the bombs were delivered with pink flyers bearing the title "Plain Words" that accused the intended victims of waging class war and promised: "We will destroy to rid the world of your tyrannical institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, 149&lt;/ref&gt;  Police and the Bureau of Investigation tracked the flyer to a print shop owned by an anarchist, Andrea Salcedo, but never obtained sufficient evidence for a prosecution.  Evidence from Valdonoci's death, bomb components, and accounts from participants later tied both bomb attacks to the ''Galleanists''.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', Princeton University Press (1991), pp. 168-183&lt;/ref&gt;  Though some of the ''Galleanists'' were deported or left the country voluntarily, attacks by remaining members continued until 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'' (AK Press, 2005) {{ISBN|1-904859-27-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904859-27-7}}, pp. 132, 501&lt;/ref&gt;

===May Day 1919===
The American labor movement had been celebrating its May Day holiday since the 1890s and had seen none of the violence associated with the day's events in Europe.&lt;ref name="Murray, 74"&gt;Murray, 74&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 1919, the left mounted especially large demonstrations, and violence greeted the normally peaceful parades in Boston, New York, and Cleveland. In Boston, police tried to stop a march that lacked a permit. In the ensuing melee both sides fought for possession of the Socialists' red flags. One policeman was stabbed and killed. [[William Sidis]] was arrested. Later a mob attacked the Socialist headquarters. Police arrested 114, all from the Socialist side. Each side's newspapers provided uncritical support to their own the next day.&lt;ref name="Murray, 74"/&gt; In New York, soldiers in uniform burned printed materials at the Russian People's House and forced immigrants to sing the ''Star-Spangled Banner''.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 185-6; Murray, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cleveland, Ohio]] saw the worst violence. Leftists protesting the imprisonment of [[Eugene V. Debs]] and promoting the campaign of [[Charles Ruthenberg]], the Socialist candidate for mayor, planned to march through the center of the city. A group of [[War bond|Victory Loan]] workers, a nationalist organization whose members sold war bonds and thought themselves still at war against all forms of anti-Americanism, tried to block some of the marchers and a [[May Day Riots of 1919|melee ensued]]. A mob ransacked Ruthenberg's headquarters. Mounted police, army trucks, and tanks restored order. Two people died, forty were injured, and 116 arrested. Local newspapers noted that only 8 of those arrested were born in the United States. The city government immediately passed laws to restrict parades and the display of red flags.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 185-6; Murray 75-5&lt;/ref&gt;

With few dissents, newspapers blamed the May Day marchers for provoking the nationalists' response. The Salt Lake City ''Tribune'' did not think anyone had a right to march. It said: "Free speech has been carried to the point where it is an unrestrained menace."&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 185-6&lt;/ref&gt; A few, however, thought the marches were harmless and that the marchers' enthusiasm would die down on its own if they were left unmolested.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race riots===
{{Main|Red Summer of 1919}}
More than two dozen American communities, mostly urban areas or industrial centers, saw racial violence in the summer and early fall of 1919. Unlike earlier race riots in U.S. history, the 1919 riots were among the first in which blacks responded with resistance to the white attacks. Martial law was imposed in [[Charleston, South Carolina]],&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/05/archives/for-action-on-race-riot-peril-radical-propaganda-among-negroes.html "For Action on Race Riot Peril," October 5, 1919], accessed January 20, 2010. This newspaper article includes several paragraphs of editorial analysis followed by Dr. Haynes' report, "summarized at several points."&lt;/ref&gt; where men of the U.S. Navy led a race riot on May 10.  Five white men and eighteen black men were injured in the riot. A Naval investigation found that four U.S. sailors and one civilian—all white men—were responsible for the outbreak of violence.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;Walter C. Rucker, James N. Upton. ''Encyclopedia of American Race Riots''. Volume 1. 2007, page 92–3.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 3, the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th U.S. Cavalry]], a segregated African-American unit founded in 1866, was attacked by local police in [[Bisbee, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;Rucker, Walter C. and Upton, James N.

[[File:chicago-race-riot.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A white gang looking for African Americans during the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]]]]
Two of the most violent episodes occurred in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. In Washington, D.C., white men, many in military uniforms, responded to the rumored arrest of a black man for rape with four days of mob violence, rioting and beatings of random black people on the street. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. When the violence ended, ten whites were dead, including two police officers, and 5 blacks. Some 150 people had been the victims of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, 60–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago race riot of 1919|rioting in Chicago]] started on July 27. Chicago's beaches along Lake Michigan were segregated in practice, if not by law. A black youth who drifted into the area customarily reserved for whites was stoned and drowned. Blacks responded violently when the police refused to take action. Violence between mobs and gangs lasted 13 days. The resulting 38 fatalities included 23 blacks and 15 whites. Injuries numbered 537 injured, and 1,000 black families were left homeless.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/110488/Chicago-Race-Riot-of-1919 "Chicago Race Riot of 1919"]. Retrieved January 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 50 people were reported dead. Unofficial numbers were much higher. Hundreds of mostly black homes and businesses on the South Side were destroyed by mobs, and a militia force of several thousand was called in to restore order.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

In mid-summer, in the middle of the Chicago riots, a "federal official" told the ''New York Times'' that the violence resulted from "an agitation, which involves the I.W.W., Bolshevism and the worst features of other extreme radical movements." He supported that claim with copies of negro publications that called for alliances with leftist groups, praised the Soviet regime, and contrasted the courage of jailed Socialist Eugene V. Debs with the "school boy rhetoric" of traditional black leaders. The ''Times'' characterized the publications as "vicious and apparently well financed," mentioned "certain factions of the radical Socialist elements," and reported it all under the headline: "Reds Try to Stir Negroes to Revolt."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07E0D71638E13ABC4051DFB1668382609EDE "Reds Try to Stir Negroes to Revolt," July 28, 1919]. Retrieved January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-October, government sources again provided the ''Times'' with evidence of Bolshevist propaganda targeting America's black communities that was "paralleling the agitation that is being carried on in industrial centres of the North and West, where there are many alien laborers." Vehicles for this propaganda about the "doctrines of Lenin and Trotzky" included newspapers, magazines, and "so-called 'negro betterment' organizations." Quotations from such publications contrasted the recent violence in Chicago and Washington, D.C. with "Soviet Russia, a country in which dozens of racial and lingual types have settled their many differences and found a common meeting ground, a country which no longer oppresses colonies, a country from which the lynch rope is banished and in which racial tolerance and peace now exist." The ''Times'' cited one publication's call for unionization: "Negroes must form cotton workers' unions. Southern white capitalists know that the negroes can bring the white bourbon South to its knees. So go to it."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/19/archives/reds-are-working-among-negroes-widespread-propaganda-by-radical.html "Reds are Working among Negroes," October 19, 1919]. Retrieved January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strikes===

====Boston Police Strike====
{{Main|Boston Police Strike}}
The [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) began granting charters to police unions in June 1919 when pressed to do so by local groups, and in just 5 months had recognized affiliate police unions in 37 cities.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 93; Slater 243&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Police Department|Boston police]] rank and file went out on strike on September 9, 1919 in order to achieve recognition for their union and improvements in wages and working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 351-3&lt;/ref&gt; Police Commissioner [[Edwin Upton Curtis]] denied that police officers had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the AFL. During the strike, [[Boston]] experienced two nights of lawlessness until several thousand members of the State Guard supported by volunteers restored order, though not without causing several deaths. The public, fed by lurid press accounts and hyperbolic political observers, viewed the strike with a degree of alarm out of proportion to the events, which ultimately produced only about $35,000 of property damage.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box

}}

The strikers were called "deserters" and "agents of Lenin."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 126&lt;/ref&gt; The Philadelphia ''Public Ledger'' viewed the Boston violence in the same light as many other of 1919's events: "Bolshevism in the United States is no longer a specter. Boston in chaos reveals its sinister substance."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 129; Foner, 96-7&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Woodrow Wilson]], speaking from Montana, branded the walkout "a crime against civilization" that left the city "at the mercy of an army of thugs."&lt;ref&gt;Pietrusza, 99&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of the strike also happened to present the police union in the worst light. September 10, the first full day of the strike, was also the day a huge New York City parade celebrated the return of Gen. [[John J. Pershing]], the hero of the [[American Expeditionary Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 351-2&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from Washington, D.C. included this headline: "Senators Think Effort to Sovietize the Government Is Started."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] saw in the strike the dangers of the national labor movement: "If the American Federation of Labor succeeds in getting hold of the police in Boston it will go all over the country, and we shall be in measurable distance of Soviet government by labor unions."&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 97&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ohio State Journal'' opposed any sympathetic treatment of the strikers: "When a policeman strikes, he should be debarred not only from resuming his office, but from citizenship as well. He has committed the unpardonable sin; he has forfeited all his rights."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Gompers]] of the AFL recognized that the strike was damaging labor in the public mind and advised the strikers to return to work. The Police Commissioner, however, remained adamant and refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor [[Calvin Coolidge]], whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. Famous as a man of few words, he put the anti-union position simply: "There is no right to strike against the public safety, anywhere, anytime."&lt;ref&gt;Pietrusza, 100; Foner, 100. See also ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/09/15/archives/bay-state-governor-firm-says-wilsons-suggestion-does-not-apply-as.html "Bay State Governor Firm," September 15, 1919]. Retrieved February 5, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike proved another setback for labor and the AFL immediately withdrew its recognition of police unions. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for Vice-President in the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]] in part due to his actions during the Boston Police Strike.

==== Steel strike of 1919 ====
{{Main|Steel strike of 1919}}
[[File:Coming out of the smoke.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|"Coming out of the Smoke", ''New York World'', October 11, 1919]]

Though the leadership of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) opposed a strike in the steel industry, 98% of their union members voted to strike beginning on September 22, 1919. It shut down half the steel industry, including almost all mills in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]]; [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]; [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]]; [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; [[Lackawanna, New York]]; and [[Youngstown, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;Brody, 233-44&lt;/ref&gt;

The owners quickly turned public opinion against the AFL. As the strike began, they published information exposing AFL National Committee co-chairman William Z. Foster's radical past as a [[Industrial Workers of the World|Wobbly]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]], and claimed this was evidence that the steelworker strike was being masterminded by radicals and revolutionaries. The steel companies played on nativist fears by noting that a large number of steelworkers were immigrants. Public opinion quickly turned against the striking workers. State and local authorities backed the steel companies. They prohibited mass meetings, had their police attack pickets and jailed thousands. After strikebreakers and police clashed with unionists in [[Gary, Indiana]], the [[U.S. Army]] took over the city on October 6, 1919, and [[martial law]] was declared. National guardsmen, leaving Gary after federal troops had taken over, turned their anger on strikers in nearby [[Indiana Harbor, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayback, 287; Brody, 244-253; Dubofsky and Dulles, 220&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel companies also turned toward strikebreaking and rumor-mongering to demoralize the picketers. They brought in between 30,000 and 40,000 [[African-American]] and [[Mexican-American]] workers to work in the mills. Company spies also spread rumors that the strike had collapsed elsewhere, and they pointed to the operating steel mills as proof that the strike had been defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Rayback, 287; Dubofsky and Dulles, 220-21; Brody, 254-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress conducted its own investigation, focused on radical influence upon union activity. In that context, U.S. Senator [[Kenneth McKellar (politician)|Kenneth McKellar]], a member of the Senate committee investigating the strike, proposed making one of the Philippine Islands a penal colony to which those convicted of an attempt to overthrow the government could be deported.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/25/archives/bill-provides-penal-colony-in-philippines-for-anarchists.html "Bill Provides Penal Colony in Philippines for Anarchists," October 25, 1919]. Retrieved January 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago mills gave in at the end of October. By the end of November, workers were back at their jobs in Gary, Johnstown, Youngstown, and Wheeling. The strike collapsed on January 8, 1920, though it dragged on in isolated areas like Pueblo and Lackawanna.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, 258-62&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coal strike of 1919====
The [[United Mine Workers]] under [[John L. Lewis]] announced a strike for November 1, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 176-8&lt;/ref&gt; They had agreed to a wage agreement to run until the end of World War I and now sought to capture some of their industry's wartime gains. Attorney General [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer|A.

Retrieved January 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; a wartime measure that made it a crime to interfere with the production or transportation of necessities. The law, meant to punish hoarding and profiteering, had never been used against a union. Certain of united political backing and almost universal public support, Palmer obtained an injunction on October 31&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/01/archives/palmer-to-enforce-law-defends-injunction-as-the-only-way-to-meet.html "Palmer to Enforce Law," November 1, 1919]. Retrieved January 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and 400,000 coal workers struck the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 178-9&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the President authorized the action, following a meeting with the severely ill President in the presence of his doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 178-9. On the President's role, see also Kenneth D. Ackerman, ''Young J. Edgar: Hoover, the Red Scare, and the Assault on Civil Liberties'' (NY: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2007), 100&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer also asserted that the entire Cabinet had backed his request for an injunction. That infuriated Secretary of Labor Wilson who had opposed Palmer's plan and supported Gompers' view of the President's promises when the Act was under consideration. The rift between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor was never healed, which had consequences the next year when Palmer's attempts to deport radicals were [[Palmer raids#Aftermath|frustrated by the Department of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Daniels, ''The Wilson Era: Years of War and After, 1917-1923'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1946), 546-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Gompers]], President of the [[American Federation of Labor]], protested that President Wilson and members of his Cabinet had provided assurances when the Act was passed that it would not be used to prevent strikes by labor unions. He provided detailed accounts of his negotiations with representatives of the administration, especially Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B. Wilson]]. He also argued that the end of hostilities, even in the absence of a signed treaty, should have invalidated any attempts to enforce the Act's provisions.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/23/archives/gompers-repeats-injunction-charge-produces-notes-and-statements-to.html "Gompers Repeats Injunction Charge," November 23, 1919].

Final agreement came on December 10.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 181-3; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/12/11/archives/miners-finally-agree-only-one-dissenting-voice-when-leaders-vote-to.html "Miners Finally Agree," December 11, 1919].

====Palmer Raids====
{{Main|Palmer Raids}}
[[File:Radicals awaiting deportation.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Men arrested in raids awaiting deportation hearings on Ellis Island, January 13, 1920]]

Despite two attempts on his life in April and June 1919, Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] moved slowly to find a way to attack the source of the violence. An initial raid in July 1919 against a small anarchist group in Buffalo failed when a federal judge tossed out his case.&lt;ref&gt;Pietruszka, 146-7&lt;/ref&gt; In August,  he organized the General Intelligence Unit within the Department of Justice and recruited [[J. Edgar Hoover]], a recent law school graduate, to head it.&lt;ref&gt;Pietruszka, 146&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover pored over arrest records, subscription records of radical newspapers, and party membership records to compile lists of resident aliens for deportation proceedings. On October 17, 1919, just a year after the [[Immigration Act of 1918]] had expanded the definition of aliens that could be deported, the U.S. Senate demanded Palmer explain his failure to move against radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer launched his campaign against radicalism with two sets of police actions known as the [[Palmer Raids]] in November 1919 and January 1920. Federal agents supported by local police rounded up large groups of suspected radicals, often based on membership in a political group rather than any action taken. Undercover informants and warrantless wiretaps (authorized under the [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Act]]) helped to identify several thousand suspected leftists and radicals to be arrested.

Only the dismissal of most of the cases by Acting [[United States Secretary of Labor]] [[Louis Freeland Post]] limited the number of deportations to 556. Fearful of extremist violence and revolution, the American public supported the raids. Civil libertarians, the radical left, and legal scholars raised protests. Officials at the Department of Labor, especially Post, asserted the rule of law in opposition to Palmer's anti-radical campaign. Post faced a Congressional threat to impeach or censure him. He successfully defended his actions in two days of testimony before the House Rules Committee in June 1919 and no action was ever taken against him. Palmer testified before the same committee, also for two days, and stood by the raids, arrests, and deportation program. Much of the press applauded Post's work at Labor, while Palmer, rather than President Wilson, was largely blamed for the negative aspects of the raids.

On December 21, the [[USAT Buford|''Buford'']], a ship the press nicknamed the "Soviet Ark", left New York harbor with 249 deportees. Of those, 199 had been detained in the November [[Palmer Raids]], with 184 of them deported because of their membership in the [[Union of Russian Workers]], an anarchist group that was a primary target of the November raids. Others on board, including the well-known radical leaders [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]], had not been taken in the Palmer Raids. Goldman had been convicted in 1893 of "inciting to riot" and arrested on many other occasions. Berkman had served 14 years in prison for the attempted murder of industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]] in 1892. Both were convicted in 1917 of interfering with military recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 12–6, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the 249 were leftists or anarchists or at least fell within the legal definition of anarchist because they "believed that no government would be better for human society than any kind of government."&lt;ref&gt;Post, 14–6&lt;/ref&gt; In beliefs they ranged from violent revolutionaries to pacifist advocates of non-resistance. Others belonged to radical organizations but disclaimed knowledge of the organization's political aims and had joined to take advantage of educational programs and social opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, 158–63; Jerome Davis, ''The Russian Immigrant'' (NY: Macmillan, 1922), 114ff., 164ff.; [[Kate Claghorn|Kate Holladay Claghorn]], ''The Immigrant's Day in Court'' (NY: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1923), 367, 371–3. Louis Freeland Post details the case of Peter Bianky, who was fully aware of and committed to the revolutionary principles of the Union of Russian Workers, but as for most of that organization's members among the deportees Post thought it "a reasonable probability that they were totally ignorant of the objectionable clauses" in the organization's statements that provided the legal basis for deporting them. Post, 22–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[United States Department of War|War Department]] used the ''Buford'' as a transport ship in the [[Spanish–American War]] and in [[World War I]] and loaned it to the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] in 1919 for the deportation mission.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 3&lt;/ref&gt; A "strong detachment of marines" numbering 58 enlisted men and four officers made the journey and pistols were distributed to the crew.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/12/21/archives/ark-with-300-reds-sails-early-today-for-unnamed-port-bufords.html "'Ark' with 300 Reds Sails Early Today for Unnamed Port", December 21, 1919].

[[Finland]], though chosen, was not an obvious choice, since Finland and Russia were at war.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 3, 10–1&lt;/ref&gt;

The notoriety of Goldman and Berkman as convicted anti-war agitators allowed the press and public to imagine that all the deportees had similar backgrounds. ''The New York Times'' called them all "Russian Reds".&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/12/13/archives/hundreds-of-reds-on-soviet-ark-sail-soon-for-russia-united-states.html "Hundreds of Reds on Soviet 'Ark' Sail Soon for Europe," December 13, 1919].

The Cleveland ''Plain Dealer'' wrote: "It is hoped and expected that other vessels, larger, more commodious, carrying similar cargoes, will follow in her wake."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 208–09&lt;/ref&gt; The New York ''[[New York Evening Mail|Evening Mail]]'' said: "Just as the sailing of the Ark that Noah built was a pledge for the preservation of the human race, so the sailing of the Ark of the Soviet is a pledge for the preservation of America."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 208&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman later wrote a book about her experiences after being deported to Russia, called ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]''.

===Expulsion of Socialists from the New York Assembly===
[[File:Five Socialist Assemblymen.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Five Socialist Assemblymen Suspended by the New York State Legislature&lt;ref&gt;George Matthew Adams Service, January 24, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On January 7, 1920, at the first session of the [[New York State Assembly]], Assembly Speaker [[Thaddeus C. Sweet]] attacked the Assembly's five Socialist members, declaring they had been "elected on a platform that is absolutely inimical to the best interests of the state of New York and the United States." The Socialist Party, Sweet said, was "not truly a political party," but was rather "a membership organization admitting within its ranks aliens, enemy aliens, and minors." It had supported the revolutionaries in [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|Germany]], Austria, and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]], he continued, and consorted with international Socialist parties close to the [[Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, 2-7&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly suspended the five by a vote of 140 to 6, with just one Democrat supporting the Socialists. A trial in the Assembly, lasting from January 20 to March 11, resulted in a recommendation that the five be expelled and [[Socialist Party of America#Expulsion of Socialists from the New York Assembly (1920)|the Assembly voted overwhelmingly for expulsion]] on April 1, 1920.

Opposition to the Assembly's actions was widespread and crossed party lines. From the start of the process, former Republican Governor, Supreme Court Justice, and presidential candidate [[Charles Evans Hughes]] defended the Socialist members: "Nothing&amp;nbsp; ... is a more serious mistake at this critical time than to deprive Socialists or radicals of their opportunities for peaceful discussion and thus to convince them that the Reds are right and that violence and revolution are the only available means at their command."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/01/10/archives/hughes-upholds-socialists-rights-tells-speaker-sweet-assemblys.html "Hughes Upholds Socialists' Rights," January 10, 2910].

==Coverage==

===Newspaper coverage===
[[File:Red Bible - Carl W Ackerman - October 27, 1919.jpg|thumb|'''Red "Bible"''', a variation on ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', published in the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'', Philadelphia, October 27, 1919, by Carl W. Ackerman]]

America's newspapers continually reinforced their readers' pro-American views and presented a negative attitude toward the Soviet Union and communism. They presented a threat of imminent conflict with the Soviet Union that would be justified by the clash with American ideals and goals.&lt;ref name="Kriesberg, Martin 1947"&gt;Kriesberg, Martin. "Soviet News in the 'New York Times'". ''The Public Opinion Quarterly'', Vol. 10. (Winter, 1946–1947): 540–564. JSTOR. 23 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, when ''The New York Times'' reported positively about the Soviet Union, it received less attention from the public than when it reported antagonistically about it. This did not hold true when Soviet interests agreed with American ones. As a result of this, the ''Times'' had a tendency to use exaggerated headlines, weighted words, and questionable sources in order to create a negative slant against the Soviets and communism. The tendency was to be very pro-American and theatrical in their coverage.&lt;ref name="Kriesberg, Martin 1947"/&gt;

The Red Scare led to the Western popularization of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. The text was purportedly brought to the United States by a Russian army officer in 1917; it was translated into English by [[Natalie de Bogory]] (personal assistant of [[Harris A. Houghton]], an officer of the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]]) in June 1918,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, N. ''Henry Ford and the Jews. The mass production of hate''. PublicAffair (2001), p. 82. {{ISBN|1891620525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[White movement|White Russian]] expatriate [[Boris Brasol]] soon circulated it in American government circles, specifically diplomatic and military, in typescript form,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. ''The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich''. St. Martin's Press (2003), p. 60. {{ISBN|0312290225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in 1919 in the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' as a pair of serialized newspaper articles. But all references to "Jews" were replaced with references to ''[[Bolsheviki]]'' as an [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] by the journalist—and subsequently highly respected [[Columbia University]] School of Journalism dean—[[Carl W. Ackerman]]. Shortly thereafter it was adapted as "[[The International Jew]]" series in [[The Dearborn Independent]], establishing the myth of [[Jewish Bolshevism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p61ACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT190&amp;lpg=PT190&amp;dq=ackerman.+zion.+bolshevik&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SQs_6856AM&amp;sig=1A-Ll7ZMvv3419WlV06ZPKKXnVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAhuCB_NLXAhWS3KQKHd4jAJcQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Replaced%20every%20reference%20to%20Jews%20with%20Bolshevists&amp;f=false|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|last=Toczek|first=Nick|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=1317525876|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Sfn | Singerman | 1980 | pp = 48–78}}

===Film===
America's film industry reflected and exploited every aspect of the public's fascination with and fear of Bolshevism. ''The German Curse in Russia'' dramatized the German instigation of Russia's [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 317&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet nationalization of women was central to the plot of ''The New Moon'', in which women between the ages of 23 and 32 are the property of the state and the heroine, [[Norma Talmadge]], is a Russian princess posing as a peasant during the Russian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 179; Hanson, 657&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''The World and Its Woman'' starring [[Geraldine Farrar]], the daughter of an American engineer working in Russia becomes an opera star and has to fend off attempts to "nationalize" her.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 1069&lt;/ref&gt;

Several films used labor troubles as their setting, with an idealistic American hero and heroine struggling to outwit manipulative left-wing agitators.&lt;ref&gt;''Virtuous Men'', Hanson, 990; ''The Face at Your Window'', Hanson, 257; ''Uncharted Channels'', Hanson, 963–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In one interesting reversal of the usual plot elements, in ''Wolves of the Street'' Wall street profiteers foment a Bolshevik strike to ruin a competitor, the film's hero. Hanson, 1052–3&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dangerous Hours]]'' tells the story of an attempted Russian infiltration of American industry.&lt;ref&gt;Its working title was ''Americanism (Versus Bolshevism)'', Hanson, 187, the title of a pamphlet by [[Ole Hanson]], the mayor of Seattle who claimed to have broken the [[Seattle General Strike]] in 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; College graduate John King is sympathetic to the left in a general way. Then he is seduced, both romantically and politically, by Sophia Guerni, a female agitator. Her superior is the Bolshevik Boris Blotchi, who has a "wild dream of planting the scarlet seed of terrorism in American soil."&lt;ref name="Brownlow, 263"&gt;Brownlow, 263&lt;/ref&gt; Sofia and Boris turn their attention to the Weston shipyards that are managed by John's childhood sweetheart, May. The workers have valid grievances, but the Bolsheviks set out to manipulate the situation. They are "the dangerous element following in the wake of labor as riffraff and ghouls follow an army."&lt;ref name="Brownlow, 263"/&gt; When they threaten May, John has an epiphany and renounces revolutionary doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, 263; Hanson, 187&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer in ''Picture Play'' protested the film's stew of radical beliefs and strategies: "Please, oh please, look up the meaning of the words 'bolshevik' and 'soviet.' Neither of them mean [sic] 'anarchist,' 'scoundrel' or 'murderer' &amp;ndash; really they don't!"&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Some films just used Bolsheviks for comic relief, where they are easily seduced (''The Perfect Woman'')&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 711&lt;/ref&gt; or easily inebriated (''Help Yourself'').&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 386&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Bullin the Bullsehviks'' an American named Lotta Nerve outwits Trotsky. New York State Senator [[Clayton R. Lusk]] spoke at the film's New York premiere in October 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 110&lt;/ref&gt; Other films used one feature or another of radical philosophy as the key plot point: anarchist violence (''The Burning Question''),&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 112&lt;/ref&gt; assassination and devotion to the red flag (''The Volcano''),&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 994. The film had a special showing for government officials and political leaders at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 1919 several weeks in advance of its release.&lt;/ref&gt; utopian vision (''[[Bolshevism on Trial]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising for ''Bolshevism on Trial'' called it "the timeliest picture ever filmed" and reviews were good. "Powerful, well-knit with indubitably true and biting satire," said ''[[Photoplay]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 178&lt;/ref&gt; As a promotion device, the April 15, 1919, issue of ''Moving Picture World'' suggested staging a mock radical demonstration by hanging red flags around town and then have actors in military uniforms storm in to tear them down. The promoter was then to distribute handbills to the confused and curious crowds to reassure them that ''Bolshevism on Trial'' takes a stand against Bolshevism and "you will not only clean up but will profit by future business."&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 175, 180&lt;/ref&gt; When this publicity technique came to the attention of U.S. Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B. Wilson]], he expressed his dismay to the press: "This publication proposes by deceptive methods of advertising to stir every community in the United States into riotous demonstrations for the purpose of making profits for the moving picture business&amp;nbsp; ..." He hoped to ban movies treating Bolshevism and Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other films were ''When Doctors Disagree'', Hanson, 1017, ''The Great Shadow'', Hanson, 351, and two films for which prints do not survive: ''Everybody's Business'', Hanson, 249, and ''Give and Take'', Hanson, 333&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
In 1919 Kansas enacted a law titled "An act relating to the flag, standard or banner of Bolshevism, anarchy or radical socialism" in an attempt to punish the display of the most common symbol of radicalism, the [[Red flag (politics)#Laws to ban red flags|red flag]]. Only Massachusetts (1913) and Rhode Island (1914) passed such "red flag laws" earlier. By 1920 they were joined by 24 more states.&lt;ref name="Franklin, 292"&gt;Franklin, 292&lt;/ref&gt; Some banned certain colors (red or black), or certain expressions ("indicating disloyalty or belief in anarchy" or "antagonistic to the existing government of the United States"), or certain contexts ("to overthrow the government by general strike"), or insignia ("flag or emblem or sign").&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 292-3; Noggle, 107; Nelles, 3&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yale Law Journal'' mocked the Connecticut law against symbols "calculated to&amp;nbsp; ... incite people to disorder," anticipating its enforcement at the next Harvard-Yale football game.&lt;ref name="Franklin, 292"/&gt; Ohio exempted college pennants and Wisconsin made an exception for historical museums.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 293&lt;/ref&gt; Minnesota allowed red flags for railroad and highway warnings.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Setting patriotic standards, red flag laws regulated the proper display of the American flag: above all other flags, ahead of all other banners in any parade, or flown only in association with state flags or the flags of friendly nations.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 291&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment generally included fines from $1,000 to $5,000 and prison terms of 5 to 10 years, occasionally more.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 294. On red flag laws generally, see Chafee, 180ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the federal level, the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the amendments to it in the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] prohibited interference with the war effort, including many expressions of opinion. With that legislation rendered inoperative by the end of [[World War I]], Attorney General [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer|A. Mitchell Palmer]], supported by President Wilson,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 87&lt;/ref&gt; waged a public campaign in favor of a peacetime version of the Sedition Act without success.&lt;ref name="Chafee, 195"&gt;Chafee, 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/16/archives/palmer-for-stringent-law-attorney-general-asks-senate-for-sedition.html "Palmer for Stringent Law," November 16, 1919]. Retrieved February 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent a circular outlining his rationale to newspaper editors in January 1919, citing the dangerous foreign-language press and radical attempts to create unrest in African American communities.&lt;ref&gt;Chafee, 195-6&lt;/ref&gt; At one point Congress had more than 70 versions of proposed language and amendments for such a bill,&lt;ref&gt;Chafee, 197&lt;/ref&gt; but it took no action on the controversial proposal during the campaign year of 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer called for every state to enact its own version of the Sedition Act.&lt;ref name="Chafee, 195"/&gt; Six states had laws of this sort before 1919 usually aimed at sabotage, but another 20 added them in 1919 and 1920. Usually called "anti-syndicalist laws," they varied in their language, but generally made it a crime to "destroy organized government" by one method or another, including "by the general cessation of industry," that is, through a general strike.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 294-6; Chafe, 187ff. The authoritative study of this subject is Elbridge Foster Dowell, ''History of Criminal Syndicalist Legislation'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; Many cities had their own versions of these laws, including 20 in the state of Washington alone.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles, 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==

===May Day 1920===
[[File:Come unto me, ye opprest.jpg|thumb|right|A political cartoon from the [[Memphis Commercial Appeal]] depicting an anarchist attempting to destroy the Statue of Liberty]]
Within Attorney General Palmer's Justice Department, the General Intelligence Division (GID) headed by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] had become a storehouse of information about radicals in America. It had infiltrated many organizations and, following the raids of November 1919 and January 1920, it had interrogated thousands of those arrested and read through boxes of publications and records seized. Though agents in the GID knew there was a gap between what the radicals promised in their rhetoric and what they were capable of accomplishing, they nevertheless told Palmer they had evidence of plans for an attempted overthrow of the U.S. government on May Day 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 234-5&lt;/ref&gt;

With Palmer's backing, Hoover warned the nation to expect the worst: assassinations, bombings, and general strikes. Palmer issued his own warning on April 29, 1920, claiming to have a "list of marked men"&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/04/30/archives/nationwide-plot-to-kill-high-officials-on-red-may-day-revealed-by.html "Nation-Wide Plot to Kill High Officials on Red May Day Revealed by Palmer," April 30, 1920]. Retrieved January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and said domestic radicals were "in direct connection and unison" with European counterparts with disruptions planned for the same day there. Newspapers headlined his words: "Terror Reign by Radicals, says Palmer" and "Nation-wide Uprising on Saturday." Localities prepared their police forces and some states mobilized their militias. New York City's 11,000-man police force worked for 32 hours straight. Boston police mounted machine guns on automobiles and positioned them around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 234-5; ''New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0DE2D91E31E03ABC4953DFB366838B639EDE "City under Guard against Red Plot Threatened Today," May 1, 1920]. Retrieved January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The date came and went without incident. Newspaper reaction was almost uniform in its mockery of Palmer and his "hallucinations." [[Clarence Darrow]] called it the "May Day scare."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07E2D81E31E03ABC4C53DFB366838B639EDE "Union Men Assail Palmer," May 4, 1920]. Retrieved January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' asked the Attorney General to cease his alerts: "We can never get to work if we keep jumping sideways in fear of the bewiskered Bolshevik."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 253; Ackerman, 283-4&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Boston American'' assessed the Attorney General on May 4:&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, 283-4&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everybody is laughing at A. Mitchell Palmer's May Day "revolution." The joke is certainly on A. Mitchell Palmer, but the matter is not wholly a joke. The spectacle of a Cabinet officer going around surrounded with armed guards because he is afraid of his own hand-made bogey is a sorry one, even though it appeals to the humor of Americans. Of course, the terrible "revolution" did not come off. Nobody with a grain of sense supposed that it would. Yet, in spite of universal laughter, the people are seriously disgusted with these official Red scares. They cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars spent in assembling soldiers and policemen and in paying wages and expenses to Mr. Palmer's agents. They help to frighten capital and demoralize business, and to make timid men and women jumpy and nervous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Palmer's embarrassment buttressed Louis Freeland Post's position in opposition to the Palmer raids when he testified before a Congressional Committee on May 7–8.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 235-6; Post, 238ff&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse===
Once Palmer's warnings of a May Day attempt to overthrow the government proved false, the anti-Bolshevik hysteria wound down quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Gage, 179-82&lt;/ref&gt; In testimony before Congress on May 7–8, Louis Freeland Post defended his release of hundreds seized in Palmer's raids so successfully that attempts to impeach or censure him ended.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, 277-80, 289-94&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the month, a dozen prominent lawyers including [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Roscoe Pound]] endorsed a report that condemned Palmer's Justice Department for the "utterly illegal acts committed by those charged with the highest duty of enforcing the laws" including entrapment, police brutality, prolonged incommunicado detention, and violations of due process in court.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''To the American People'', 4; Coben, 238-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Federal District Court]] Judge [[George Weston Anderson|George Anderson]] ordered the discharge of twenty more arrested aliens and effectively ended the possibility of additional raids.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 225-26&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative ''Christian Science Monitor'' found itself unable to support Palmer any longer, writing on June 25, 1920: "What appeared to be an excess of radicalism&amp;nbsp; ... was certainly met with&amp;nbsp; ... an excess of suppression."&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 226; Chafee, 198&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of industry voiced similar sentiments, including [[Charles M. Schwab]] of [[Bethlehem Steel]], who thought Palmer's activities created more radicals than they suppressed, and [[T. Coleman du Pont]] who called the Justice Department's work evidence of "sheer Red hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 239; on business leaders' denunciations of the deportations and defense of immigrants from charges of radicalism, see John Higham, ''Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism'' (NY: Atheneum, 1968), 232&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Democratic National Convention in July, Palmer never had a chance at winning the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;Pietrusza, 193-4&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge, famous for his opposition to the right of police to strike, won a place on the Republican ticket, but the party's nominee, and the eventual winner of the 1920 election, was the U.S. Senator from Ohio, [[Warren G. Harding]]. He sounded a very different note in mid-August. An interviewer wrote that "his jaws fairly snapped" when he said that "too much has been said about Bolshevism in America. It is quite true that there are enemies of Government within our borders. However, I believe their number has been greatly magnified. The American workman is not a Bolshevik; neither is the American employer an autocrat."&lt;ref&gt;Google Books: [https://books.google.com/books?id=izdk8r0svwcC&amp; Sherman Rogers, "Senator Harding on Labor,"]  in ''[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]'', vol. 125, August 18, 1920, 668-670, quote 670; quoted in part: Gage, 230-1. Harding had used anti-Bolshevik rhetoric earlier, but for his presidential campaign took a conciliatory stance on labor issues. See Randolph C. Downes, ''The Rise of Warren Gamaliel Harding, 1865-1920'' (Ohio State University Press, 1970), 260, 275-6, 319-22, 361, 600, 605-9&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
The '''four stages of enlightenment''' in [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] are the four progressive stages culminating in full [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] as an [[Arhat|Arahant]].

These four stages are [[Sotāpanna|Sotāpanna]], [[Sakadagami|Sakadāgāmi]], [[Anāgāmi]], and Arahant. The Buddha referred to people who are at one of these four stages as noble people (''ariya-puggala'') and the community of such persons as the noble sangha (''ariya-sangha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo|title=What is the Triple Gem?|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/triplegem.html|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sangha|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/sangha.html|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= A Path to Freedom: A Self-guided Tour of the Buddha's Teachings|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of the four stages of enlightenment is a central element of the [[early Buddhist schools]], including the [[Theravada]] school of Buddhism, which still survives.

==Origins==
In the [[Sutta Pitaka]] several types of Buddhist practitioners are described, according to their level of attainment. The standard is four, but there are also longer descriptions with more types. The four are the Stream-enterer, Once-returner, Non-returner and the Arahant.

In the [[Visuddhimagga]] the four stages are the culmination of the seven purifications. The descriptions are elaborated and harmonized, giving the same sequence of purifications before attaining each of the four paths and fruits.

The Visuddhimagga stresses the importance of [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], insight into [[anatta]] and the Buddhist teachings, as the main means to liberation. [[Vipassana]] has a central role in this. Insight is emphasized by the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]].

==Path and Fruit==
A '''[[Stream-enterer]]''' ([[Sotapanna]]) is free from:
*1. Identity view
*2. Attachment to rites and rituals
*3. Doubt about the teachings

A '''[[Once-returner]]''' ([[Sakadagami]]) has greatly attenuated:
*4. Sensual desire
*5. Ill will

A '''[[Non-returner]]''' ([[Anāgāmi]]) is free from:
*4. Sensual desire
*5. Ill will

An '''[[Arahant]]''' is free from all of the five lower fetters and the five higher fetters, which are:
*6. Attachment to the four meditative absorptions having form (rupa jhana)
*7.  Attachment to the four formless absorptions (ārupa jhana)
*8. Conceit
*9. Restlessness
*10. Ignorance

The [[Sutta Pitaka]] classifies the four levels according to the levels' attainments. In the [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthaviravada]] and Theravada traditions, which teach that progress in understanding comes all at once, and that 'insight' (''abhisamaya'') does not come 'gradually' (successively - ''anapurva''),"{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=284}} this classification is further elaborated, with each of the four levels described as a path to be attained suddenly, followed by the realisation of the fruit of the path.

The process of becoming an Arahat is therefore characterized by four distinct and sudden changes, although in the sutras it says that the path has a gradual development, with gnosis only after a long stretch, just as the ocean has a gradual shelf, a gradual inclination with a sudden drop only after a long stretch. The Mahasanghika had the doctrine of ''ekaksana-citt'', "according to which a Buddha knows everything in a single thought-instant" (Gomez 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;69). The same stance is taken in [[Chan Buddhism]], although the Chán school harmonized this point of view with the need for gradual training after the initial insight.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This "gradual training" is expressed in teachings as [[Five Ranks|the Five ranks of enlightenment]], [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]] which detail the steps on the Path, [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|The Three mysterious Gates]] of Linji, and the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]]. The same stance is taken in the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]], especially the so-called [[U Nārada|"New Burmese Method"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Armstrong|first=Steve|title=The Practical Dharma of Mahasi Sayadaw|url=http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2010/04/the-practical-dharma-of-mahasi-sayadaw/|publisher=[[Buddhist Geeks]]|accessdate=August 13, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164438/http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2010/04/the-practical-dharma-of-mahasi-sayadaw/|archivedate=May 3, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ordinary person==
An ordinary person or ''puthujjana'' ([[Pali]]; [[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|pṛthagjana}}i.e. pritha : without, and jnana : knowledge) is trapped in the endless cycling of [[Samsara|{{IAST|samsara}}]]. One is reborn, lives, and dies in endless rebirths, either as a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]], human, animal, male, female, neuter, ghost, asura, hell being, or various other entities on different categories of existence.

An ordinary entity has never seen and experienced the ultimate truth of [[Dharma]] and therefore has no way of finding an end to the predicament. It is only when suffering becomes acute, or seemingly unending, that an entity looks for a "solution" to and, if fortunate, finds the Dharma.

==The four stages of attainment==
{{StagesFettersRebirths|notes=1}}
The Sangha of the Tathagata's disciples (Ariya Sangha) can be described as including four or eight kinds of individuals. There are four [groups of noble disciples] when path and fruit are taken as pairs, and eight groups of individuals, when each path and fruit are taken separately:
# (1) the path to stream-entry; (2) the fruition of stream-entry;
# (3) the path to once-returning; (4) the fruition of once-returning;
# (5) the path to non-returning; (6) the fruition of non-returning;
# (7) the path to arahantship; (8) the fruition of arahantship.

===Stream-enterer===
{{main|Sotāpanna}}
The first stage is that of [[Sotāpanna]] ([[Pali]]; [[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|Srotāpanna}}), literally meaning "one who enters ({{IAST|āpadyate}}) the stream (sotas)," with the stream being the supermundane [[Noble Eightfold Path]] regarded as the highest Dharma. The stream-enterer is also said to have "opened the eye of the Dharma" (dhammacakkhu, Sanskrit: {{IAST|dharmacakṣus}}).

A stream-enterer reaches arahantship within seven rebirths upon opening the eye of the Dharma.

Because the stream-enterer has attained an intuitive grasp of Buddhist doctrine ({{IAST|samyagdṛṣṭi}} or {{IAST|sammādiṭṭhi}}, "right view") and has complete confidence or [[Saddha]] in the [[Three Jewels]]: [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], [[Dharma]], and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], and has removed the sankharas that force rebirth in lower planes, that individual will not be reborn in any plane lower than the human (animal, [[preta]], or in [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]).

===Once-returner===
{{main|Sakadagami}}
The second stage is that of the {{IAST|Sakadāgāmī}} (Sanskrit: {{IAST|Sakṛdāgāmin}}), literally meaning "one who once ({{IAST|sakṛt}}) comes ({{IAST|āgacchati}})". The once-returner will at most return to the realm of the senses (the lowest being human and the highest being the devas wielding power over the creations of others) one more time. Both the stream-enterer and the once-returner have abandoned the first three fetters. The stream-enterer and once-returner are distinguished by the fact that the once-returner has weakened lust, hate, and delusion to a greater degree. The once-returner therefore has fewer than seven rebirths. Once-returners do not have only one more rebirth, as the name suggests, for that may not even be said with certainty about the non-returner who can take multiple rebirths in the five "Pure Abodes". They do, however, only have one more rebirth in the realm of the senses, excluding, of course, the planes of hell, animals and hungry ghosts.

===Non-returner===
{{main|Anāgāmi}}

The third stage is that of the {{IAST|Anāgāmī}} (Sanskrit: {{IAST|Anāgāmin}}), literally meaning "one who does not (an-) come ({{IAST|'''āgacchati'''}})". The non-returner, having overcome sensuality, does not return to the human world, or any unfortunate world lower than that, after death. Instead, non-returners are [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reborn]] in one of the five special worlds in [[Buddhist cosmology#Form Realm (Rūpadhātu)|Rūpadhātu]] called the [[Buddhist cosmology#Pure Abodes|{{IAST|Śuddhāvāsa}} worlds]], or "Pure Abodes", and there attain [[Nirvana|{{IAST|Nirvāṇa}}]]; Pāli: Nibbana; some of them are reborn a second time in a higher world of the Pure Abodes.

An {{IAST|Anāgāmī}} has abandoned the five lower fetters, out of ten total fetters, that bind beings to the [[Samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]]. An {{IAST|Anāgāmī}} is well-advanced.

===Arahant===
{{Main|Arahant}}
The fourth stage is that of [[Arahant]] (Sanskrit: ''Arhat''), a fully awakened person. They have abandoned all ten fetters and, upon death (Sanskrit: [[Parinirvana|{{IAST|Parinirvāṇa}}]], Pāli: {{IAST|Parinibbāna}}) will never be reborn in any plane or world, having wholly escaped [[Samsara (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/sangha.html Sangha]&lt;/ref&gt; An Arahant has attained awakening by following the path given by the Buddha. In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] the term ''Buddha'' is reserved for ones who "self-enlighten" such as Siddhartha Gautama Buddha, who discovered the path by himself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2273">'''Gentleness''' is the value and quality of one's [[Moral character|character]]. Being gentle has a long history in many, but not all [[culture]]s. Gentleness is considered to play a very important role in life.

The quality of gentleness is colloquially understood to be that of kindness, consideration and amiability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gentleness&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] used it in a technical sense as the virtue that strikes the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|mean]] with regard to anger: being too quick to anger is a vice, but so is being detached in a situation where anger is appropriate; justified and properly focused anger is named mildness or gentleness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrett|first=Jan|title=Virtue Ethics: A Basic Introductory Essay|url=http://www.wku.edu/~jan.garrett/ethics/virtthry.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gentleness is a strong hand with a soft touch. It is a tender, compassionate approach toward others' weaknesses and limitations. A gentle person still speaks truth, sometimes even painful truth, but in doing so guards their tone so the truth can be well received.  "When my daughter was young, she used to love to squeeze my hand as hard as she could, trying to make it hurt. She could squeeze with all her might, but it never hurt. She didn't need to be gentle because she lacked the power to cause me any pain. Then, just for fun, I'd give her hand a tight little squeeze until she yelped.
It's the strong hand, not the weak one, that must learn to be gentle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawk|first=Dean| title=The Strength of Gentleness|url=http://www.thrivingfamily.com/Family/Faith/2011/strength-of-gentleness.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second important usage was common in medieval times, associated with higher social classes: hence the derivation of the terms [[gentleman]], [[gentlewoman]] and [[gentry]]. The broadening of gentle behavior from a literal sense of the gentry to the metaphorical "like a gentleman" applicable to any person was a later development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=C.S.|title=Mere Christianity|year=2001|publisher=Harper|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0060652920|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 25 of the [[Constitution of the United Arab Emirates|Constitution of the UAE]] provides for the equitable treatment of persons with regard to [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], nationality, [[religious beliefs]] or [[social status]]. However, in reality there are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with full UAE locals being given preferential treatment when it comes to employment, even though they generally show minimal interest in working.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/emiratisation-wont-work-if-people-dont-want-to-learn Emiratisation won't work if people don't want to learn | The National].

[[Labour force of the United Arab Emirates|Labour injustices in Dubai]] have attracted the attention of various human rights groups, which have tried to persuade the government to become a signatory to two of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s eight core conventions, which allows for the formation of labour unions. The Dubai government, however, denied any kind of labour injustices and stated that the watchdog's accusations were misguided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4861540.stm |title=UAE to allow construction unions |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-03-30 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of March 2006, the government announced steps to allow construction unions.

The [[BBC]] has reported that "local newspapers often carry stories of construction workers allegedly not being paid for months on end.

In December 2005, the Indian [[consulate]] in Dubai submitted a report to the [[Government of India]] detailing labor problems faced by [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian expatriates]] in the emirate. The report highlighted delayed payment of wages, substitution of [[employment contract]]s, premature termination of services and excessive working hours as being some of the challenges faced by Indian workers in the city.

Despite protests by Human Rights Watch and several governments, companies allegedly continue to take the passports of workers and refuse to pay promised salaries. These practices have been labeled as "modern slavery" by some organizations.&lt;ref name="slavesofdubai"&gt;[https://www.vice.com/vice-news/the-slaves-of-dubai]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a European national by the name of [[Prosecution of Marte Dalelv|Marte Dalelv]], was arrested and jailed on trumped up charges.

There are various examples of local folk ill-treating people, just on the basis of nationality or race. In one instance, a local taxi passenger caused a serious injury to a foreign driver.

[[Apostasy]] is a crime [[punishable by death]] in the UAE; in practice this has never been applied.

== Religious freedom ==
{{Details|Freedom of religion in the United Arab Emirates}}
Islam is the official religion in Dubai.  A policy of religious toleration allows foreigners to practice their faith in a private residence or official place of worship, or they can petition the government for a land grant and permission to build a religious institution to hold religious services, which may be a slow process.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14017.htm|title=United Arab Emirates|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslim groups are generally allowed to meet and advertise their events, but the law prohibits and punishes proselytizing.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

== Freedom of expression ==
{{Details|Emirates Discussion Forum}}
Human rights groups have expressed concerns about freedom of expression in Dubai, which is often limited by enacted laws or Ministerial edicts in the name of protecting traditional Islamic morality or the image and reputation of Dubai and its leaders.

In 2007, the Dubai government shut down two Pakistani television channels, [[Geo News]] and [[ARY Digital Network|ARY One]].  Their entertainment, but not news and political programming, were eventually permitted to broadcast in Dubai.&lt;ref name="anhri.net"&gt;[http://www.anhri.net/en/reports/2007/pr1127.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dubai Ministry of Culture and Media banned the exhibition of a play, "Kholkhal", just hours before it was scheduled to be performed at the 8th annual Gulf Theater Festival.&lt;ref name="anhri.net"/&gt; While journalists can no longer be jailed for doing their job, other legal actions can be taken against them. Several members of the Dubai press remain on a government list as being banned from being published within the Emirate. There is also reportedly a degree of self-censorship that occurs, for fear of governmental sanctions, of certain topics that are critical of government policy, the royal family, or may offend traditional Islamic morality.&lt;ref name="anhri.net"/&gt;

In July 2013, a video was uploaded onto [[YouTube]], which depicted a local driver hitting an expatriate worker, following a road related incident. Using part of his [[Keffiyeh|local head gear]], the local driver whips the expatriate and also pushes him around, before other passers-by intervene. A few days later, Dubai Police announced that both the local driver and the person who filmed the video have been arrested. It was also revealed that the local driver was a senior UAE government official.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/senior-uae-official-arrested-over-driver-attack-509289.html|title=Senior UAE official arrested over driver attack|work=ArabianBusiness.com|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video once again brings into question the way that lower classes of foreign workers are treated. Police in November 2013 also arrested a US citizen and some UAE citizens, in connection with a YouTube parody video which allegedly portrayed Dubai and its youth in a bad light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=data/crime/2013/December/crime_December24.xml&amp;section=crime|title=Three held for parody video on Satwa streets|last=Fisher|first=Amira Agarib And Amanda|website=www.khaleejtimes.com|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was shot in areas of [[Satwa]], [[Dubai]] and featured gangs learning how to fight each other using simple weapons, including shoes, the aghal, etc. Eventually, the US citizen was released; in a later interview with the BBC, the Sheikh of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammad mentioned that his treatment was unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/dubai-ruler-speaks-to-bbc-about-uaes-legal-system-syria-and-egypt|title=Dubai Ruler speaks to BBC about UAE’s legal system, Syria and Egypt|work=The National|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, 94 Emirati activists were held in secret detention centres and put on trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/06/uae-trial-94-activists|title=The UAE's bizarre, political trial of 94 activists|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=David Hearst|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights organizations have spoken out against the secrecy of the trial. An Emirati, whose father is among the defendants, was arrested for tweeting about the trial. In April 2013, he was sentenced to 10 months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man faces 10 months jail for tweets about trial in UAE|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/11/world/meast/uae-twitter-jail/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=11 April 2013|author=Ben Brumfield|author2=Caroline Faraj|author3=Saad Abedine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repressive measures were also used against people in order to justify the UAE government's claim that there is an "international plot" in which UAE citizens and foreigners were working together to destabilize the country.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt; Foreign nationals were also subjected to a campaign of deportations.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt; There are many documented cases of Egyptians and other foreign nationals who had spent years working in the UAE and were then given only a few days to leave the country.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt;

Foreign nationals subjected to forced disappearance include two [[Libyans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/05/uae-reveal-whereabouts-disappeared-libyans|title=UAE: Reveal Whereabouts of ‘Disappeared’ Libyans}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two [[Qatar]]is.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/uaa25614.pdf|title=Urgent Action: Enforced Disappearance of Qatari Nationals|work=[[Amnesty International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty reported that the Qatari men have been abducted by the UAE government and the UAE government has withheld information about the men's fate from their families.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qta" /&gt; Amongst the foreign nationals detained, imprisoned and expelled is [[Iyad El-Baghdadi]], a popular blogger and Twitter personality.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt; He was arrested by UAE authorities, detained, imprisoned and then expelled from the country.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt; Despite his lifetime residence in the UAE, as a Palestinian citizen, El-Baghdadi had no recourse to contest this order.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt; He could not be deported back to the [[Palestinian territories]], therefore he was deported to Malaysia.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt;

In 2012, Dubai police subjected three British citizens to [[battery (crime)|beatings]] and [[electric shocks]] after arresting them on drugs charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22324220|title=Dubai drugs trial: Mother tells of 'torture horror'|publisher=BBC|date=28 April 2013|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], expressed "concern" over the case and raised it with the UAE President, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during his 2013 state visit to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22334081|title=Dubai drugs trial: David Cameron 'concerned' over torture claims|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three men were pardoned and released&lt;!--released or deported?--&gt; in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/19/dubai-releases-britons-tortured-jailed-drugs|title=Dubai pardons three Britons 'tortured' and jailed over drugs|publisher=The Guardian|date=19 July 2013|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights==
{{Details|Women in the United Arab Emirates}}
In 2006, less than 20% of Emirati women were part of the national labor force.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.academia.edu/5813970/The_Emirati_Workforce_Tables_figures_and_thoughts The Emirati Workforce] Page 30&lt;/ref&gt; UAE has the second lowest percentage of local women working in the GCC.&lt;ref name="par"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfZR8SNg0bwC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq|title=Kuwait: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix|work=[[International Monetary Fund]] |year=2012|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008-2009, only 21% of Emirati women were part of the labor force.&lt;ref name=par /&gt; UAE has the highest percentage of total female labor participation in the GCC (including [[expatriate]] women). However, [[Kuwait]] has the highest percentage of local female labor participation in the GCC because more than 45% of Kuwaiti women are part of the national labor force.&lt;ref name=par /&gt; 80% of women in UAE are classified as household workers (maids).&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Amy.

''[[Arabian Business]]'' (December 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The UAE's judicial system is derived from the [[civil law system]] and [[Sharia law]]. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], UAE's civil and criminal courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law, in a way which discriminates against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/11012631/Human-Rights-Watch-warns-expat-women-about-the-UAE.html|title=Human Rights Watch warns expat women about the UAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape victims===
Rape victims are not immune for punishment for other crimes they have committed in Dubai.&lt;ref name=tdb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/07/30/dubai-s-progressive-charade.html|title=Dubai's Progressive Charade|work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nydaily&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/dubai-rape-vic-arrested-drinking-article-1.1214682|title=Gang-rape victim in Dubai arrested for drinking alcohol: report|work=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/06/the-court-in-abu-dhabi-ruled-today-that-the-18-year-old-emirati-woman-who-accused-six-men-of-gang-rape-will-serve-a-one-year.html|title=DUBAI: Victim of gang rape sentenced to one year in prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a small number of cases, the courts of the UAE have jailed women after they reported being raped and it was proven that the accusations were false.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; A British woman, after she reported being gang raped by three men, was fined AED 1000 after confessing to consuming alcohol without a license;&lt;ref name=nydaily/&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; her attackers are currently serving ten years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/courts/dubai-men-who-raped-briton-sentenced-to-10-year-jail-terms|title=Dubai men who raped Briton sentenced to 10-year jail terms|work=The National|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another British woman was charged with public intoxication and extramarital sex (with her fiancé, not the accused) after she reported being raped;&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakr |first=Amena |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/21/us-emirates-courts-norway-idUSBRE96K0AK20130721 |title=Woman jailed in Dubai after reporting rape hopes to warn others |work=Reuters |date= 21 July 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in one final case, an 18-year-old Emirati woman withdrew her complaint of gang rape inside a car by 6 men when faced with a long jail term when it was found there was no evidence that rape occurred.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-07/u-a-e-woman-withdraws-gang-rape-claim-to-avoid-lashes-prison-sentence.html|title=U.A.E.

In July 2013, a [[Prosecution of Marte Dalelv|Norwegian woman, Marte Dalelv]], reported rape to the police and received a prison sentence for "illicit sex and alcohol consumption"&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/22/world/meast/uae-norway-rape-controversy/index.html|title=Dubai ruler pardons Norwegian woman convicted after she reported rape|work=CNN.com|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after she confessed lying about the rape.

==LGBT rights==
{{Details|LGBT rights in the United Arab Emirates}}
In keeping with traditional Islamic morality, both Federal and Emirate law prohibit [[homosexuality]] and [[cross-dressing]] with punishment ranging from long prison sentences, deportation for foreigners, and the death penalty.  No nightclub exists for LGBT explicitly, but spots exist in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, with the details spreading only by word-of-mouth. No political organization is allowed to advocate for LGBT rights.

==Prostitution==
Prostitution, although illegal, exists in Dubai. Research conducted by the American Center for International Policy Studies (AMCIPS) found that Russian and Ethiopian women are the most common prostitutes, as well as women from other African countries, while Indian prostitutes are part of a well-organised trans-Oceanic prostitution network.&lt;ref name="pbsdsex"/&gt; A 2007 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary entitled ''Dubai: Night Secrets'' reported that prostitution in clubs is tolerated by authorities and many foreign women work there by choice.&lt;ref name="pbsdsex"&gt;Mimi Chakarova.

==Zero tolerance drug policy==
Drugs found in urine or blood testing count as "possession" under UAE law. Raymond Bingham, BBC's DJ [[Grooverider]], was sentenced to four years in prison after a pair of jeans in his luggage was found to contain just over 2&amp;nbsp;grams of marijuana.&lt;ref name=grooverider&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7253514.stm | work=BBC News | title=Radio 1 DJ jailed on drug charge | date=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dubai authorities have been known to stop tourists on layovers at the airport and are now using extremely sensitive electronic detection equipment, including urine and blood screening, to search for traces of illegal substances. Keith Brown, a British national, was arrested on September 17, 2007 after authorities claim to have discovered a speck of cannabis on the bottom of one of his shoes. According to an article in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'',&lt;ref name=keithbrown&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=512815&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ito=1490 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Briton jailed for four years in Dubai after customs find cannabis weighing less than a grain of sugar under his shoe | date=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the alleged illegal substance was smaller than a grain of sugar - weighing approximately .003&amp;nbsp;grams. He has also been sentenced to four years in prison. Other tourists and residents have been sentenced to [[Capital punishment|execution]] for selling cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/briton-faces-execution-after-uae-drugs-bust-.html Briton faces execution after UAE drugs bust], Yahoo News&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no reports of anyone being executed in the UAE for solely drug offences, unlike neighboring Saudi Arabia. Another UK citizen, Tracy Wilkinson, was arrested and accused of being a "drugs baroness" in 2005 after authorities found [[codeine]] in her blood.&lt;ref name=tracywilkinson&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/southern_counties/4200952.stm | work=BBC News | first=Tanya | last=Gupta | title=Bad back led to jail torment | date=1 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson has a bad back and received an injection of codeine at a Dubai hospital. She ended up spending two months in a cell where she contracted [[dysentery]], [[Head louse|head lice]] and an infestation of [[flea]]s before she was eventually released on bail. German television producer Cat Le-Huy was arrested in January 2008 for possessing a bottle of the over-the-counter hormone sleep aid [[Melatonin]].&lt;ref name=catlehuy&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/tv-executive-faces-jail-in-dubai-for-barely-visible-cannabis-speck-785595.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Amol | last=Rajan | title=TV executive faces jail in Dubai for barely visible cannabis speck | date=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities claimed that some dirt in Mr. Le-Huy's luggage was [[hashish]]. A Vancouver resident named Bert Tatham was arrested at Dubai International Airport returning home from [[Afghanistan]] (where he was working with farmers to try to convince them not to grow poppies). The anti-narcotics officer was found to have two dead poppy bulbs and a tiny amount of hashish melted into the seams of one of his trouser pockets.&lt;ref name=bertatham&gt;[http://money.aol.ca/article/uae-canadian-pardoned-2nd-writethru-bgt/101850/ AOL Canada: Canadian jailed in drug case in Dubai is pardoned by ruler of the emirate]&lt;/ref&gt; After spending more than 10 months in prison, he was eventually pardoned by U.A.E. President H.H. [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]].

==The 2007 censorship of two Pakistani satellite channels==
On 16 November 2007 [[Dubai Media City|Tecom]] stopped [[broadcast]] of two major [[Pakistan]]i [[satellite]] news channels, uplinked from [[Dubai Media City]], which was initially marketed by Tecom under the tagline "Freedom to Create." The [[Dubai]] [[government]] had ordered Tecom to shut down the popular independent Pakistani news channels [[Geo News]] and [[ARY One World]] on the demand of Pakistan's military regime led by General [[Pervez Musharraf]]. This was implemented by [[Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company|du]] Samacom disabling their [[Serial digital interface|SDI]] &amp; [[Asynchronous serial interface|ASI]] streams. Later, policy makers in Dubai permitted these channels to air their entertainment programs, but news, current affairs and political analysis were forbidden. Although subsequently the conditions were removed, marked differences have since been observed in their coverage. This incident has had a serious impact on all organizations in the media city with Geo TV and ARY OneWorld considering relocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/indepth/pak_emergency/more_stories/10169767.html Gulf News - Pakistani TV channels may move out of Dubai Media City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422054301/http://archive.gulfnews.com/indepth/pak_emergency/more_stories/10169767.html |date=2008-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/11/25/10170154.html Gulf News - Geo TV also plans to move out of Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401105222/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/11/25/10170154.html |date=2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070033255&amp;ch=11/18/2007%208:27:00%20PM NDTV.com - Geo TV hints at options outside of Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220150253/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070033255&amp;ch=11%2F18%2F2007%208%3A27%3A00%20PM |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''illusion of external agency''' is a set of [[attributional bias]]es consisting of illusions of influence, insight and benevolence, proposed by [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]], [[Timothy D. Wilson]], Ryan Brown and Elizabeth Pinel.&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Illusion of External Agency |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2000 |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=690–700 |url=http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/Gilbert%20et%20al%20%28External%20Agency%29.PDF |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.690 |pmid=11079235 |last1=Gilbert |first1=Daniel T. |last2=Brown |first2=Ryan P. |last3=Pinel |first3=Elizabeth C. |last4=Wilson |first4=Timothy D. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085559/http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/Gilbert%20et%20al%20%28External%20Agency%29.PDF |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=Daniel|title=The vagaries of religious experience|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gilbert05/gilbert05_index.html|publisher=Edge.org|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of experiments, experimenters induced participants to [[cognitive dissonance|rationalize]] a choice or experience (called the "optimizing" condition) after which they were more likely to make certain attributions of an external agent, as follows:
* ''illusion of influence''. Subjects who had been induced to rationalize liking for a teammate were more likely to attribute this liking to the influence of "subliminal messages" which experimenters claimed to have attempted to influence them to the best outcome. In this experiment the experimenters were presumed to have "insight" into the problem and "benevolence" towards participants.
* ''illusion of insight''. Subjects listened to a song chosen for them by a "SmartRadio" that they were told was benevolent and effective. Some subjects were informed of and rated the song before listening, and these subjects rated the song more highly and were more likely to continue using it, attributing their liking to the device's "insight".
* ''illusion of benevolence''. Subjects were given a gift; some rated it before receiving it and some rated it afterwards. Those in the afterwards condition rated it more highly (''[[endowment effect]]''). All participants were told that they were given the gift by another (unseen) participant as the best gift for them based on a questionnaire; those in the afterwards condition were more likely to believe that their liking was due to the benevolence of the gift-giver.

Gilbert ''et al.'' argued that "participants confused their own optimization of subjective reality with an external agents' optimizing of objective reality. Simply speaking, participants mistook 'the magic in here' for 'the magic out there.'"&lt;ref name="gilbert" /&gt;

'''Interwiki linking''' (''W-link'') is a facility for creating [[hyperlink|link]]s to the many [[wiki]]s on the [[World Wide Web]]. Users avoid pasting in entire [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] (as they would for regular web pages) and instead use a [[shorthand]] similar to links within the same wiki (intrawiki links).

Unlike [[domain name]]s on the Internet, there is no globally defined list of interwiki prefixes, so owners of a wiki must define an '''interwiki map''' (InterMap) appropriate to their needs.  Users generally have to create separate accounts for each wiki they intend to use (unless they intend to edit anonymously).  Variations in text formatting and layout can also hinder a seamless transition from one wiki to the next.

By making wiki links simpler to type for the members of a particular community, these features help bring the different wikis closer together. Furthering that goal, interwiki "bus tours" (similar to [[webring]]s) have been created to explain the purposes and highlights of different wikis. Such examples on [[Wikipedia]] include {{srlink|Wikipedia:TourBusStop}} and {{srlink|Wikipedia:WikiNode}}.

== Syntax ==
Interwiki link notation varies, depending largely on the syntax a wiki uses for markup. The two most common link patterns in wikis are [[CamelCase]] and free links (arbitrary phrases surrounded by some set [[delimiter]], such as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[double square brackets]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;). [[CURIE]] syntax—an emerging W3C standard—uses a single set of square brackets.

Interwiki links on a CamelCase-based wiki frequently take the form of "Code:PageName", where ''Code'' is the defined InterMap prefix for another wiki. Thus, a link "WikiPedia:InterWiki" could be rendered in [[HTML]] as a link to an article on Wikipedia: for example, {{srlink|Wikipedia:Interlanguage links}}. Linking from a CamelCase-wiki to a page that contains spaces in its title typically requires replacing the spaces with underscores (e.g. WikiPedia:Main_Page).

Interwiki links on wikis based on free links, such as Wikipedia, typically follow the same principle, but using the delimiters that would be used for internal links. These links can then be parsed and escaped as they would be if they were internal, allowing easier typing of spaces but potentially causing problems with other special characters. For example, on Wikipedia, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[MeatBall:AssumeGoodFaith]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; appears as [[MeatBall:AssumeGoodFaith]], and  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:de:InterWiki]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (former syntax: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[DeWikipedia:InterWiki]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) appears as [[:de:InterWiki]].

The [[MediaWiki]] software has an additional feature which uses similar notation to create automatic interlanguage links—for instance, the link &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[de:InterWiki]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (with no leading colon) automatically creates a reference labeled "Other languages: [[:de:InterWiki|Deutsch]] | ..." at the top and bottom of, or in a sidebar next to, the article display. Various other [[wiki software]] systems have features for "semi-internal" links of this kind, such as support for [[namespace]]s or multiple sub-communities.

Most InterMap implementations simply replace the interwiki prefix with a full URL prefix, so many non-wiki websites can also be referred to using the system. A reference to a definition on the [[Free On-line Dictionary of Computing]], for instance, could take the form &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Foldoc:foo]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which would tell the system to append and display the link as [http://foldoc.org/foldoc.cgi?foo Foldoc:foo].  This makes it very easy to link to commonly referenced resources from within a wiki page, without the need to even know the form of the URL in question.

The interwiki concept can equally be applied to links ''from'' non-wiki websites. [[Advogato]], for instance, offers a syntax for creating shorthand links based on a MeatBall-derived InterMap.

[[WordPress]] offers a similar "shortcode" shorthand notation for embedding images, videos, LaTeX formulas and equations, maps, etc. hosted on other websites.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://en.support.wordpress.com/shortcodes/ "What is a shortcode?"]
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
Internally, a wiki that uses interwiki links needs to have a mapping from wiki-code links to full URLs. For example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[MeatBall:InterWiki]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; might appear as [[MeatBall:InterWiki]], but link to &lt;code&gt;http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?InterWiki&lt;/code&gt;.

Since most wiki systems use URLs for individual pages where the page's title appears at the end of an otherwise unchanging address, the simplest way of defining such mappings is by substituting the interwiki prefix for the unchanging part of the URL. So in the example above, the &lt;code&gt;MeatBall:&lt;/code&gt; has simply been replaced by &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in creating the target of the [[HTML]] rendered link.

Rather than creating a new list from scratch for every wiki, it is often useful to obtain a copy of that from another site. Sites such as [[MeatballWiki]] [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?InterMap] and the [[UseModWiki]] site contain comprehensive lists which are often used for this purpose - the former being publicly editable in the same way as any other wiki page, and the latter being verified as usable but potentially out of date. MediaWiki's default list of interwiki links is derived from an old version of MeatballWiki's list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/maintenance/interwiki.list?view=markup |title=[mediawiki&amp;#93; Contents of /trunk/phase3/maintenance/interwiki.list |publisher=Svn.wikimedia.org |date=2008-02-27 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/maintenance/interwiki.sql?view=markup |title=[mediawiki&amp;#93; Contents of /trunk/phase3/maintenance/interwiki.sql |publisher=Svn.wikimedia.org |date=2008-02-27 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rajagopal speaking to 25,000 people, Janadesh 2007, India.jpg|thumb|400px|Rajagopal speaking to 25,000 people.]]
'''Janadesh''' is the name of a national campaign on land rights in [[India]] launched by the movement [[Ekta Parishad]]. The [[word]] "Janadesh" means "The Verdict of the People" in [[Hindi]]. The campaign was launched in 2005 and culminated in 2007, in the form of a 350&amp;nbsp;km foot march involving 25,000 people. According to the organizers, the majority of the marchers were landless [[Adivasi]] and [[Dalit]].

According to Ekta Parishad the lack of secure land rights is a major contributor to rural poverty in India, and the government of India needs to undertake major [[land reform]]s to address this issue. The aim of the Janadesh campaign is to put pressure on the Indian government to undertake specific land reforms aimed at securing land rights for the poorest groups in India.

==Rural poverty in India==
According to a recent [[World Bank]] report [[poverty]] remains a significant problem in India, with India’s progress in reducing poverty compared with some of its Asian neighbors described as ‘modest’. According to the same report, poverty in India is most widespread in [[rural]] areas (where almost three out of four Indians live), and the highest incidence of poverty of all is found among the rural landless, 68% of whom are classed as living below the poverty line.
These findings are echoed in other reports on the subject. For example, Sundaram and Tendulkar found in a 2003 study of poverty in India that the highest levels of poverty were found among assetless (i.e. landless) rural households dependent on agricultural wage labor. Levels of poverty were found to be even higher among members of this group if they also belonged to either a [[Scheduled Tribe]] or [[Scheduled Caste]].
Furthermore, although at an overall percentage level rural poverty is decreasing in India, due to population growth the absolute number of people in rural areas below the poverty line is not decreasing.

Obviously there are differing viewpoints on what measures would be most effective to alleviate poverty among these groups. According to Ekta Parishad, the single most important measure that could be taken to reduce these levels of poverty would be to grant secure land rights to small pieces of land to landless peasants, reducing their dependence on casual wage labor and providing a measure of [[food security]].

These views are supported by research in the area. For example, Hanstad, Brown, and Prosterman suggest based on research in [[Karnataka]] and [[West Bengal]] that providing amply-sized plots of land (these can be as small as 0.05-0.15 acres in size) gives substantial benefits to landless families at relatively low costs. These benefits include increased income, increased access to credit, and increased social status. They also note that based on the land costs in their Karnataka study, the cost of a program to distribute packages of land like this to the ten million poorest families in India would be approximately 3,330 million rupees spread over ten years. By contrast, the central government’s rural housing scheme has cost 15,360 million rupees per year over the past five years, whilst producing housing viewed as being of very low quality by the participants in this study. Hanstad, Brown and Prosterman also cite numerous other studies from around the world which have shown results similar to their own.

==Current state of land reform in India==
In Ekta Parishad's experience of campaigning across eight states in India they found that even having a land entitlement did not necessarily equate to possessing land. In fact they found that in around 50% of cases having a land entitlement had not led to possession of the land itself.

There are a number factors involved in creating this situation.

Firstly, land records, which provide the basis for land ownership, are out of date in India. The [[Indian government]] is currently working to computerize land records to improve efficiency. However, a recent report by the [[Asian Development Bank]] pointed out that, more than computerizing records, correcting them should be the priority. They note that: "It is a common observation in villages that the person in whose name land is recorded is either deceased or does not possess the land".

Secondly, according to a recent discussion paper produced by PACS, even if land records are up to date, they do not ensure security of possession. If the poor are dispossessed of their land the record of their possession itself is of little use – instead they have to go to court to establish their title. The process for establishing title is such that a wealthy opponent is able to prolong the process for years through higher courts of appeal, which the poor can ill afford. Thus the land record system is fundamentally anti-poor, and provides little protection against land grabs by wealthier land-owners. These land grabs take a variety of forms, from simple violent expulsion through to bribery of government or bank officials. It is often more than a simple question of the economic value of the land. R Srivastava argues that the landed are often not in favor of giving land to the landless since it increases their autonomy and ability to demand better wages. He also notes the wealthy landed often have substantial influence over politician and administrators at the state level.

Finally, the national government has reserved for itself substantial powers of land acquisition through the ‘Land Acquisition Act’ of 1984. This permits the central government to acquire any area of land that it chooses if is in the ‘public interest’ to do so. However, the term ‘public interest’ is left undefined in this legislation, giving the government exceptionally broad powers to acquire land as and when it chooses.

Taken all together, these factors combine to create a system of land ownership which provides little security for the rural poor.

==Objectives of Janadesh 2007==
Based on this view of current land legislation Ekta Parishad argue that it is only through legislative action at a national level that lasting change can be achieved. Although campaigns at state level have resulted in a number of successes in terms of distributing land to the landless, there need to be major changes at the national level to create a system of land rights that protects the rights of the poor and ensures that they can actually benefit from their land.

The Janadesh campaign is seen as a means of connecting the numerous local campaigns which they are involved in into a single national campaign large enough to pressure the government into taking action.

The Janadesh 2007 campaign will culminate with a foot march by 25,000 people, mainly landless Adivasis and Dalits. The route of the march will be from [[Gwalior]] to [[Delhi]] in northern India, following the main highway (a distance of approximately 350&amp;nbsp;km). The march will set out from Gwalior on 2 October 2007 and will arrive in Delhi on 28 October 2007. This will be an act of mass non-violent civil disobedience in the tradition of [[Gandhi]]. According to Ekta Parishad, it will be the largest such action since the struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]].

The campaign has three specific demands around land reform. These are:

* Establishment of a National Land Authority to provide a clear statement of land utilization in India, identify the lands available for redistribution and strengthen pro-poor laws
* Establishment of fast track courts to settle past and future conflicts related to land
* Establishment of a single window system so that farmers can resolve easily and freely the land issues, without wasting time, money and energy

==Ekta Parishad==
The Janadesh 2007 campaign is being organized by Ekta Parishad, an organization that was formally established in 1990. According to its founder, [[P V Rajagopal|Puthan Veetil Rajagopal]], Ekta Parishad is not an NGO or a political party. It is instead a people’s movement, which works at the grass-roots level to mobilize people to challenge corruption and exploitation.
Quoted in the book "Truth Force" Rajagopal states this aim: "What I am trying to do, through Ekta Parishad, is to help people to understand that they can be leaders of the country". Ekta Parishad are particularly focused on land and livelihood issues amongst marginalized communities (such as Dalits and Adivasis) in rural India and are active in eight Indian states ([[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and in direct contact with around 4000 villages.

There are two main components to Ekta Parishad’s work – the struggle component and constructive work.

The struggle component involves mobilizing people to take part in various forms of non-violent resistance such as Padyatras (foot marches), Dharnas (sit-ins), Gheraos (preventing unjust incidents from taking place by encircling people who wield power), and Chakka jam (road blockades) to press for their land rights. This is based on the Gandhian tradition of non-violent resistance.

The constructive work focuses on running economic and development activities alongside the land rights struggle, with the intention of allowing villages that have gained land to become economically self-sufficient. These activities include:
* Providing spaces for the sale of village produce (e.g. handicrafts, [[khadi]], honey, rice, oil) in urban centers;
* Promoting agricultural development through [[organic farming]] methods and cultivation of herbal plants for medicinal purposes;
* Development of irrigation schemes, and small-scale economic programs like running shops, grain banks, fishery, poultry and goat rearing.

In [[arithmetic]], '''long division''' is a standard [[division algorithm]] suitable for dividing multidigit numbers that is simple enough to perform by hand. It breaks down a [[division (mathematics)|division]] problem into a series of easier steps. As in all division problems, one number, called the [[division (mathematics)|dividend]], is divided by another, called the [[divisor]],  producing a result called the [[quotient]]. It enables computations involving arbitrarily large numbers to be performed by following a series of simple steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname=LongDivision | title= Long Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviated form of long division is called [[short division]], which is almost always used instead of long division when the divisor has only one digit. [[Chunking (division)|Chunking]] (also known as the partial quotients method or the hangman method) is a less-efficient form of long division which may be easier to understand.

While related algorithms have existed since the 12th century AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://new.math.uiuc.edu/im2008/rogers/algebra.html|title=Islamic Mathematics|website=new.math.uiuc.edu|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the specific algorithm in modern use was introduced by [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] {{Circa}} 1600 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Henry Briggs - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810104516866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Place in education ==
Inexpensive calculators and computers have become the most common way to solve division problems, eliminating a traditional [[mathematical exercise]], and decreasing the educational opportunity to show how to do so by paper and pencil techniques. (Internally, those devices use one of a variety of [[division algorithm]]s). In the United States, long division has been especially targeted for de-emphasis, or even elimination from the school curriculum, by [[reform mathematics]], though traditionally introduced in the 4th or 5th grades.

== Method ==
In English-speaking countries, long division does not use the [[division slash]] {{angle brackets|[[∕]]}} or [[obelus]] {{angle brackets|÷}} signs but instead constructs a '''tableau'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholson |first=W. Keith |title=Introduction to Abstract Algebra, ''4th ed.'' |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=2012 |p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w-GaLpapRcEC&amp;pg=PA206 206] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[divisor]] is separated from the [[dividend]] by a [[right parenthesis]] {{angle brackets|[[)]]}} or [[vertical bar]] {{angle brackets|[[vertical bar|{{!}}]]}}; the dividend is separated from the [[quotient]] by a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] (i.e., [[overbar]]). The combination of these two symbols is sometimes known as a '''long division symbol''' or '''division bracket'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Wolfram MathWorld |contribution-url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LongDivisionSymbol.html |contribution=Long Division Symbol |url=http://wolfram.com |accessdate=11 February 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It developed in the 18th century from an earlier single-line notation separating the dividend from the quotient by a [[left parenthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Symbols of Operation |contribution-url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/operation.html |date=2010 |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |last=Miller |first=Jeff }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hill|first=John|title=Arithmetick both in the theory and practice|publisher=Straben et al.|year=1772|edition=11th|orig-year=First published 1712|place=London|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nietz;cc=nietz;idno=00abf4892m;node=00abf4892m%3A1.11;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=3;page=root;size=s|accessdate=12 February 2016|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process is begun by dividing the left-most digit of the dividend by the divisor.  The quotient (rounded down to an integer) becomes the first digit of the result, and the [[remainder]] is calculated (this step is notated as a subtraction).  This remainder carries forward when the process is repeated on the following digit of the dividend (notated as 'bringing down' the next digit to the remainder).  When all digits have been processed and no remainder is left, the process is complete.

An example is shown below, representing the division of 500 by 4 (with a result of 125).
     &lt;u&gt; &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;     (Explanations)
    4)500
      &lt;u&gt;4&lt;/u&gt;        ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; =  4)
      &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;0       ( 5 -  4 =  &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
       &lt;u&gt;8&lt;/u&gt;       ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; =  8)
       &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;0      (10 -  8 =  &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)
       &lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;      ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; = 20)
        0      (20 - 20 =  0)

[[File:Long division.JPG|thumb|An example of long division performed without a calculator.]]
In the above example, the first step is to find the shortest sequence of digits starting from the left end of the dividend, 500, that the divisor 4 goes into at least once; this shortest sequence in this example is simply the first digit, 5. The largest number that the divisor 4 can be multiplied by without exceeding 5 is 1, so the digit 1 is put above the 5 to start constructing the quotient. Next, the 1 is multiplied by the divisor 4, to obtain the largest whole number (4 in this case) that is a multiple of the divisor 4 without exceeding the 5; this product of 1 times 4 is 4, so 4 is placed underneath the 5. Next the 4 under the 5 is subtracted from the 5 to get the remainder, 1, which is placed under the 4 under the 5. This remainder 1 is necessarily smaller than the divisor 4. Next the first as-yet unused digit in the dividend, in this case the first digit 0 after the 5, is copied directly underneath itself and next to the remainder 1, to form the number 10. At this point the process is repeated enough times to reach a stopping point: The largest number by which the divisor 4 can be multiplied without exceeding 10 is 2, so 2 is written above the 0 that is next to the 5&amp;nbsp;– that is, directly above the last digit in the 10. Then the latest entry to the quotient, 2, is multiplied by the divisor 4 to get 8, which is the largest multiple of 4 that does not exceed 10; so 8 is written below 10, and the subtraction 10 minus 8 is performed to get the remainder 2, which is placed below the 8. This remainder 2 is necessarily smaller than the divisor 4. The next digit of the dividend (the last 0 in 500) is copied directly below itself and next to the remainder 2, to form 20. Then the largest number by which the divisor 4 can be multiplied without exceeding 20 is ascertained; this number is 5, so 5 is placed above the last dividend digit that was brought down (i.e., above the rightmost 0 in 500). Then this new quotient digit 5 is multiplied by the divisor 4 to get 20, which is written at the bottom below the existing 20. Then 20 is subtracted from 20, yielding 0, which is written below the 20. We know we are done now because two things are true: there are no more digits to bring down from the dividend, and the last subtraction result was 0.

If the last remainder when we ran out of dividend digits had been something other than 0, there would have been two possible courses of action. (1) We could just stop there and say that the dividend divided by the divisor is the quotient written at the top with the remainder written at the bottom; equivalently we could write the answer as the quotient followed by a fraction that is the remainder divided by the divisor. Or, (2) we could extend the dividend by writing it as, say, 500.000... and continue the process (using a decimal point in the quotient directly above the decimal point in the dividend), in order to get a decimal answer, as in the following example.

     &lt;u&gt;  31.75&lt;/u&gt;     
    4)127.00
      &lt;u&gt;12&lt;/u&gt;         (12 ÷ 4 = 3)
       07        (0 [[remainder]], bring down next figure)
        &lt;u&gt;4&lt;/u&gt;        (7 ÷ 4 = 1 r 3 )                                             
        3.0      (0 is added in order to make 3 divisible by 4; the 0 is accounted for by adding a decimal point in the quotient.)
        &lt;u&gt;2.8&lt;/u&gt;      (7 &amp;times; 4 = 28)
          20     (an additional zero is brought down)
          &lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;     (5 &amp;times; 4 = 20)
           0

In this example, the decimal part of the result is calculated by continuing the process beyond the units digit, "bringing down" zeros as being the decimal part of the dividend.

This example also illustrates that, at the beginning of the process, a step that produces a zero can be omitted.  Since the first digit 1 is less than the divisor 4, the first step is instead performed on the first two digits 12.  Similarly, if the divisor were 13, one would perform the first step on 127 rather than 12 or 1.

===Basic procedure for long division of ''n'' ÷ ''m''===

# Find the location of all decimal points in the dividend ''n'' and divisor ''m''.
# If necessary, simplify the long division problem by moving the decimals of the divisor and dividend by the same number of decimal places, to the right, (or to the left) so that the decimal of the divisor is to the right of the last digit.
# When doing long division, keep the numbers lined up straight from top to bottom under the tableau.
# After each step, be sure the remainder for that step is less than the divisor. If it is not, there are three possible problems: the multiplication is wrong, the subtraction is wrong, or a greater quotient is needed.
# In the end, the remainder, ''r'', is added to the growing quotient as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]],&amp;nbsp;''r''/''m''.

===Example with multi-digit divisor===

[[Image:LongDivisionAnimated.gif]]

A divisor of any number of digits can be used. In this example, 1260257 is to be divided by 37. First the problem is set up as follows:

        &lt;u&gt;       &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257

Digits of the number 1260257 are taken until a number greater than or equal to 37 occurs. So 1 and 12 are less than 37, but 126 is greater. Next, the greatest multiple of 37 less than or equal to 126 is computed. So 3 &amp;times; 37 = 111 &lt; 126, but 4 &amp;times; 37 &gt; 126. The multiple 111 is written underneath the 126 and the 3 is written on the top where the solution will appear:

        &lt;u&gt;  3    &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        111

Note carefully which place-value column these digits are written into. The 3 in the quotient goes in the same column (ten-thousands place) as the 6 in the dividend 1260257, which is the same column as the last digit of 111.

The 111 is then subtracted from the line above, ignoring all digits to the right:

        &lt;u&gt;  3    &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;
         15

Now the digit from the next smaller place value of the dividend is copied down appended to the result 15:

        &lt;u&gt;  3    &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;
         150

The process repeats: the greatest multiple of 37 less than or equal to 150 is subtracted. This is 148 = 4 &amp;times; 37, so a 4 is added to the solution line. Then the result of the subtraction is extended by another digit taken from the dividend:

        &lt;u&gt;  34   &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;
         150
         &lt;u&gt;148&lt;/u&gt;
           22

The greatest multiple of 37 less than or equal to 22 is 0 &amp;times; 37 = 0. Subtracting 0 from 22 gives 22, we often don't write the subtraction step. Instead, we simply take another digit from the dividend:

        &lt;u&gt;  340  &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;
         150
         &lt;u&gt;148&lt;/u&gt;
           225

The process is repeated until 37 divides the last line exactly:

        &lt;u&gt;  34061&lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;
         150
         &lt;u&gt;148&lt;/u&gt;
           225
           &lt;u&gt;222&lt;/u&gt;
             37

===Mixed mode long division===
For non-decimal currencies (such as the British [[£sd]] system before 1971) and measures (such as [[avoirdupois]]) '''mixed mode''' division must be used.  Consider dividing 50 miles 600 yards into 37 pieces:

           mi -     yd -   ft -   in
       &lt;u&gt;     1 -    634      1      9 r. 15"&lt;/u&gt;
     37)   50 -    600 -    0 -    0
           &lt;u&gt;37&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;u&gt;22880&lt;/u&gt;     &lt;u&gt;66&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;u&gt;348&lt;/u&gt;
        &lt;u&gt;   13&lt;/u&gt;    23480     66    348
        17600    &lt;u&gt;222&lt;/u&gt;       &lt;u&gt;37&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;u&gt;333&lt;/u&gt;
        &lt;u&gt; 5280&lt;/u&gt;     128      &lt;u&gt;29&lt;/u&gt;     15
        22880     &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;     348     &lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;
        &lt;nowiki&gt;=====&lt;/nowiki&gt;      170    &lt;nowiki&gt;===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
                   &lt;u&gt;148&lt;/u&gt;
                    &lt;u&gt;22&lt;/u&gt;
                    66
                    &lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Each of the four columns is worked in turn.  Starting with the miles: 50/37 = 1 remainder 13.  No further division is
possible, so perform a long multiplication by 1,760 to convert miles to yards, the result is 22,880 yards.  Carry this to the top of the yards column and add it to the 600 yards in the dividend giving 23,480.  Long division of 23,480 / 37 now proceeds as normal yielding 634 with remainder 22.  The remainder is multiplied by 3 to get feet and carried up to the feet column.  Long division of the feet gives 1 remainder 29 which is then multiplied by twelve to get 348 inches.  Long division continues with the final remainder of 15 inches being shown on the result line.

===Non-decimal radix===
The same method and layout can be used for, e.g., [[Binary number|binary]], [[octal]] and [[hexadecimal]] numeral systems. For example, a hexadecimal address range of 0xf412df divided into 0x12 parts is:

        &lt;u&gt;  0d8f45&lt;/u&gt; r. 5
     12 ) f412df
          &lt;u&gt;ea&lt;/u&gt;
           a1
           &lt;u&gt;90&lt;/u&gt;
           112
           &lt;u&gt;10e&lt;/u&gt;
             4d
             &lt;u&gt;48&lt;/u&gt;
              5f
              &lt;u&gt;5a&lt;/u&gt;
               5
Calculation within the binary number system is more immediate, because each digit in the course can only be 1 or 0:

         &lt;u&gt;      1110&lt;/u&gt; r. 11
     1101) 10111001
            &lt;u&gt;1101&lt;/u&gt;
            10100
             &lt;u&gt;1101&lt;/u&gt;
              1110
              &lt;u&gt;1101&lt;/u&gt;
                 11

===Interpretation of decimal results===

When the quotient is not an integer and the division process is extended beyond the decimal point, one of two things can happen. (1) The process can terminate, which means that a remainder of 0 is reached; or (2) a remainder could be reached that is identical to a previous remainder that occurred after the decimal points were written. In the latter case, continuing the process would be pointless, because from that point onward the same sequence of digits would appear in the quotient over and over. So a bar is drawn over the repeating sequence to indicate that it repeats forever.

==Notation in non-English-speaking countries==
China, Japan, Korea use the same notation as English-speaking nations including India. Elsewhere, the same general principles are used, but the figures are often arranged differently.

===Latin America===
In [[Latin America]] (except [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Brazil]]), the calculation is almost exactly the same, but is written down differently as shown below with the same two examples used above. Usually the quotient is written under a bar drawn under the divisor. A long vertical line is sometimes drawn to the right of the calculations.

      500 ÷ 4 =  &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   (Explanations) 
      &lt;u&gt;4&lt;/u&gt;                ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; =  4)
      &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;0               ( 5 -  4 =  &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
       &lt;u&gt;8&lt;/u&gt;               ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; =  8)
       &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;0              (10 -  8 =  &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)
       &lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;              ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; = 20)
        0              (20 - 20 =  0)

and

      127 ÷ 4 = 31.75
      &lt;u&gt;124&lt;/u&gt;                             
        30      (a 0 is added in order to make 3 divisible by 4; the 0 is accounted for by adding a decimal point in the quotient)
        &lt;u&gt;28&lt;/u&gt;      (7 &amp;times; 4 = 28)
         20     (an additional zero is added)
         &lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;     (5 &amp;times; 4 = 20)
           0
In [[Mexico]], the US notation is used, except that only the result of the subtraction is annotated and the calculation is done mentally, as shown below:

     &lt;u&gt; &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;     (Explanations)
    4)500
      &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;0      ( 5 -  4 = &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
       &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;0     (10 -  8 = &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)
        0     (20 - 20 = 0)

In [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Uruguay]], [[Quebec]], [[Colombia]], and [[Peru]], the European notation (see below) is used, except that the quotient is not separated by a vertical line, as shown below:

     127|&lt;u&gt;4    &lt;/u&gt;
    −&lt;u&gt;124&lt;/u&gt; 31,75
       30
      −&lt;u&gt;28&lt;/u&gt;
        20
       −&lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;
         0

Same procedure applies in [[Mexico]] and [[Argentina]], only the result of the subtraction is annotated and the calculation is done mentally.

===Eurasia===
In Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Lithuania, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, the divisor is to the right of the dividend, and separated by a vertical bar. The division also occurs in the column, but the quotient (result) is written below the divider, and separated by the horizontal line. The same method is used in Iran and Mongolia.

     127|&lt;u&gt;4    &lt;/u&gt;
    −&lt;u&gt;124&lt;/u&gt;|31,75
       30
      −&lt;u&gt;28&lt;/u&gt;
        20
       −&lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;
         0

In Cyprus, as well as in France, a long vertical bar separates the dividend and subsequent subtractions from the quotient and divisor, as in the [[:fr:Poser une division#Méthode classique|example]] below of 6359 divided by 17, which is 374 with a remainder of 1.

{|border ="0" cellspacing = "0"

|}

Decimal numbers are not divided directly, the dividend and divisor are multiplied by a power of ten so that the division involves two whole numbers. Therefore, if one were dividing 12,7 by 0,4 (commas being used instead of decimal points), the dividend and divisor would first be changed to 127 and 4, and then the division would proceed as above.

In [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]], the notational form of a normal equation is used. &lt;dividend&gt; : &lt;divisor&gt; = &lt;quotient&gt;, with the colon ":" denoting a binary infix symbol for the division operator (analogous to "/" or "÷"). In these regions the decimal separator is written as a comma. (cf. first section of Latin American countries above, where it's done virtually the same way):

     127 : 4 = 31,75
    −&lt;u&gt;12&lt;/u&gt;
      07
      −&lt;u&gt;4&lt;/u&gt;
       30
      −&lt;u&gt;28&lt;/u&gt;
        20
       −&lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;
         0

The same notation is adopted in [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Poland]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Vietnam]] and in [[Serbia]].

In the [[Netherlands]], the following notation is used:

    12 / 135 \ 11,25
         &lt;u&gt;12&lt;/u&gt;
          15
          &lt;u&gt;12&lt;/u&gt;
           30
           &lt;u&gt;24&lt;/u&gt;
            60
            &lt;u&gt;60&lt;/u&gt;
             0

==Generalizations==

=== Rational numbers ===
Long division of integers can easily be extended to include non-integer dividends, as long as they are [[rational number|rational]]. This is because every rational number has a [[recurring decimal]] expansion. The procedure can also be extended to include divisors which have a finite or terminating [[decimal]] expansion (i.e. [[decimal fraction]]s). In this case the procedure involves multiplying the divisor and dividend by the appropriate power of ten so that the new divisor is an integer&amp;nbsp;– taking advantage of the fact that ''a''&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;''b'' = (''ca'')&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;(''cb'')&amp;nbsp;–  and then proceeding as above.

===Polynomials===
A generalised version of this method called [[polynomial long division]] is also used for dividing [[polynomial]]s (sometimes using a shorthand version called [[synthetic division]]).

'''Metaphysical solipsism''' is the variety of [[idealism]] which asserts that nothing exists externally to ''this one mind'', and since ''this mind'' is the whole of reality then the "external world" was never anything more than an ''idea''.  It can also be expressed by the assertion "there is nothing external to these present experiences", in other words, no reality exists beyond whatever is presently being sensed.  The aforementioned definition of solipsism entails the non-existence of anything presently unperceived including the external world, causation, other minds (including God's mind or a subconscious mind), the past or future, and a subject of experience.  Despite their ontological non-existence, these entities may nonetheless be said to "exist" as ''useful descriptions'' of the various experiences and thoughts that constitute 'this' mind.  The solipsistic self is described by Wittgenstein in the Tractatus: "The self of solipsism shrinks to a point without extension and there remains the reality co-ordinated with it" (''TLP'' 5.64).

There are weaker versions of metaphysical solipsism, such as Caspar Hare's [[egocentric presentism]] (or [[perspectival realism]]), in which other persons are conscious but their experiences are simply not ''present''. Similarly, J. J. Valberg develops a concept of one's [[personal horizon]] and discusses how it is in a sense ''the'' (preeminent) horizon, stating that "we are all solipsists" in his sense of solipsism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valberg|first=J. J.|title=Dream, Death, and the Self|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691128597|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for metaphysical solipsism==

The argument in favor of solipsism:

* The only thing one has direct access to is the contents of one's own mind (one's mental states). What one knows most certainly are one's mental states – one's thoughts, experiences, emotions, and so on.
* Just because one sees an object does not mean that the object exists. One could be dreaming or hallucinating.  There is no direct conceptual or logically necessary link between the mental and the physical.
* The experiences of a given person are necessarily private to that person. The contents of one's mind are the only things one has direct access to. One cannot get ‘outside’ of one's mind to encounter any other objects including other persons. Other minds are even more removed.

The basic form of the argument:

* Person's mental states are the only things they have access to.
* One cannot conclude the existence of anything outside of their mental states.
** Therefore, only their mental states exist.
Similar philosophy is found in Hindu religion, namely [[drishti-srishti-vada]].&lt;ref name="Drishti-sristi-vada"&gt;[http://www.vmission.org.in/vedanta/articles/drishtishristi.htm], Drishti-sristi-vada.&lt;/ref&gt;
In teachings of Ramana Maharshi there are two cues on solipsism:

"Jiva is called so because he sees the world. A dreamer sees many jivas in a dream, but all of them are not real. The dreamer alone exists and he sees all. So it is with the individual and the world. There is the creed of only one Self, which is also called the creed of only one jiva. It says that the jiva is the only one who sees the whole world and the lives therein."

==Criticism of metaphysical solipsism==

One reason for the lack of support of this philosophical position is how strange it would be for a solipsist to preach solipsism – as if to convince everyone around them that they are purely a figment of the author's own imagination. The very idea of communicating philosophical ideas would be arbitrary to a true solipsist, as according to them, there is no other mind with whom they would communicate their beliefs.

[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] commented, on the same theme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As against solipsism, it is to be said, in the first place, that it is psychologically impossible to believe, and is rejected in fact even by those who mean to accept it. I once received a letter from an eminent logician, Mrs. [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]],
saying that she was a solipsist, and was surprised that there were no others. Coming from a logician, this surprised me. The fact that I cannot believe something does not prove that it is false, but it does prove that I am insincere and frivolous if I pretend to believe it." (Russell, p. 180).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The basic argument for solipsism suffers a logical error as well. It is argued that, because the mind can not conclude the existence of anything external, therefore nothing external exists. But this conclusion does not follow, only that the existence of externalities cannot be known. It is just as logically consistent that there are external realities/minds/etc. as there are not when experience cannot be verified either true or false.

'''Monism''' attributes oneness or singleness (Greek: μόνος) to a concept e.g., existence. Various kinds of monism can be distinguished:
* ''Priority monism'' states that all existing things go back to a source that is distinct from them; e.g., in [[Neoplatonism]] everything is derived from [[Neoplatonism#The One|The One]].{{sfn|Brugger|1972}} In this view only one thing is ontologically basic or prior to everything else.
* ''Existence monism'' posits that, strictly speaking, there exists only a single thing, the [[Universe]], which can only be artificially and arbitrarily divided into many things.&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, G. (2014 in press): "Nietzsche's metaphysics?". In: Dries, M. &amp; Kail, P. (eds): "Nietzsche on Mind and Nature". Oxford University Press. [http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30981598/Nietzsches_Metaphysics_June_2012_Strawson_draft_-libre.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1396293668&amp;Signature=Bji6%2FSyzFKV1jkuZRJfnLSB0Qko%3D PDF of draft]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Substance monism'' asserts that a variety of existing things can be explained in terms of a single reality or substance.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1974}} Substance monism posits that only one kind of stuff exists, although many things may be made up of this stuff, e.g., matter or mind.

==Definitions==
There are two sorts of definitions for monism:
# The wide definition: a philosophy is monistic if it postulates unity of origin of all things; all existing things return to a source that is distinct from them.{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
# The restricted definition: this requires not only unity of origin but also unity of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]].{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}

Although the term "monism" is derived from Western philosophy to typify positions in the [[mind–body problem]], it has also been used to typify religious traditions. In modern Hinduism, the term "absolute monism" is being used for [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|Chande|2000|p=277}}{{sfn|Dasgupta|1992|p=70}}

==History==
The term "monism" was introduced in the 18th century by [[Christian von Wolff]]&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt; in his work ''Logic'' (1728),&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/7886/Monism.html jrank.org, ''Monism'']&lt;/ref&gt; to designate types of philosophical thought in which the attempt was made to eliminate the dichotomy of body and mind&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; and explain all phenomena by one unifying principle, or as manifestations of a single substance.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/monism.aspx#4 "monism"], Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition. Retrieved 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mind–body problem]] in philosophy examines the relationship between [[mind]] and matter, and in particular the relationship between [[consciousness]] and the brain. The problem was addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]], and by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book  |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title= Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year= 1996 |pages= 702–11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind-body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author= Robert M. Young |edition=Paperback reprint of Routledge 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, Howard |title=Dualism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/dualism/ |date=Nov 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Avicennism|Avicennian philosophy]],&lt;ref name=Lagerlund&gt;{{cite book |title= Forming the Mind: Essays on the Internal Senses and the Mind/Body Problem from Avicenna to the Medical Enlightenment |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media]] |year= 2010 |edition=Paperback reprint of 2007 |isbn=  9048175305 |chapter=Introduction |page=3 |author=Henrik Lagerlund |editor= Henrik Lagerlund |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IV-dcQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in earlier Asian and more specifically Indian traditions.

It was later also applied to the theory of absolute identity set forth by [[Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]].{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} Thereafter the term was more broadly used, for any theory postulating a unifying principle.{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} The opponent thesis of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] also was broadened, to include pluralism.{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} According to Urmson, as a result of this extended use, the term is "systematically ambiguous".{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}

According to Jonathan Schaffer, monism lost popularity due to the emergence of [[Analytic philosophy]] in the early twentieth century, which revolted against the neo-Hegelians. Carnap and Ayer, who were strong proponents of [[positivism]], "ridiculed the whole question as incoherent [[mysticism]]".{{sfn|Schaffer|2010}}

The mind–body problem has reemerged in social psychology and related fields, with the interest in mind–body interaction{{sfn|Fiske|2010|p=195}} and the rejection of Cartesian mind–body dualism in the ''[[Type physicalism|identity thesis]]'', a modern form of monism.{{sfn|Fiske|2010|p=195-196}} Monism is also still relevant to the [[philosophy of mind]],{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} where various positions are defended.{{sfn|Mandik|2010}}{{sfn|McLaughlin|2009}}

===Types===
[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|300px|A diagram with neutral monism compared to Cartesian dualism, physicalism and idealism.]]
Different types of monism include:{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}&lt;ref name=Schaffer&gt;Schaffer, Jonathan, Monism: The Priority of the Whole, http://www.jonathanschaffer.org/monism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Substance theory|Substance]] monism, "the view that the apparent plurality of substances is due to different states or appearances of a single substance"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Attributive monism, "the view that whatever the number of substances, they are of a single ultimate kind"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Partial monism, "within a given realm of being (however many there may be) there is only one substance"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Existence monism, "the view that there is only one concrete object [[Type–token distinction|token]] (The One, "Τὸ Ἕν" or the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]])"&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, Jonathan, "Monism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/monism/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Priority monism, "the whole is prior to its parts" or "the world has parts, but the parts are dependent fragments of an integrated whole"&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;
# Property monism, "the view that all properties are of a single type (e.g., only physical properties exist)" 
# Genus monism, "the doctrine that there is a highest category; e.g., being"&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;

Views contrasting with monism are:
* Metaphysical dualism, which asserts that there are two ultimately irreconcilable substances or realities such as Good and Evil, for example, [[Manichaeism]],{{sfn|Brugger|1972}} 
* [[Pluralism (philosophy)|Metaphysical pluralism]], which asserts three or more fundamental substances or realities.{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
* [[Nihilism|Metaphysical nihilism]], negates any of the above categories (substances, properties, concrete objects, etc.).

Monism in modern [[philosophy of mind]] can be divided into three broad categories:
# [[Idealism|Idealist]], mentalistic monism, which holds that only mind or spirit exists. {{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
# [[Neutral monism]], which holds that one sort of thing fundamentally exists,{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}} to which both the mental and the physical can be reduced&lt;ref name="mastin"&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_monism.html Luke Mastin (2008), "Monism"]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Material monism]] (also called [[Physicalism]] and [[materialism]]), which holds that the material world is primary, and consciousness arises through the interaction with the material world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Materialism and Empirio-criticism|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|year=1909|isbn=|location=World Socialist Web Site|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}
::a. [[Eliminativism|Eliminative Materialism]], according to which everything is physical and mental things do not exist{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}
::b. [[Reductive physicalism]], according to which mental things do exist and are a kind of physical thing{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}{{refn|group=note|Such as [[Behaviourism]],&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; [[Type-identity theory]]&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]]&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt;}}

Certain positions do not fit easily into the above categories, such as [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], [[anomalous monism]], and [[reflexive monism]]. Moreover, they do not define the meaning of "real".

===Monistic philosophers===

====Pre-Socratic====
While the lack of information makes it difficult in some cases to be sure of the details, the following [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]] thought in monistic terms:{{sfn|Abernethy|Langford|pp.1-7}}
* [[Thales]]: Water.
* [[Anaximander]]: Apeiron (meaning 'the undefined infinite'). Reality is some, one thing, but we cannot know what.
* [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]: Air.
* [[Heraclitus]]: Change, symbolized by fire (in that everything is in constant flux).
* [[Parmenides]] argued that Being or Reality is an unmoving perfect sphere, unchanging, undivided.{{sfn|Abernethy|Langford|pp.8,9}}

====Post-Socrates====
* Neopythagorians such as [[Apollonius of Tyana]] centered their cosmologies on the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] or One.
* [[Stoics]] taught that there is only one substance, identified as God.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a very broad generalization over a very diverse school of thought. Someone with time should seriously consider whether it is justified.|date=January 2018}}
* Middle Platonism under such works as those by [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]] taught that the Universe emanates from the Monad or One.
* [[Neoplatonism]] is monistic. [[Plotinus]] taught that there was an ineffable transcendent god, 'The One,' of which subsequent realities were emanations. From The One emanates the Divine Mind ([[Nous]]), the Cosmic Soul ([[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]), and the World ([[Cosmos]]).

====Modern====

==Religion==

===Pantheism===
{{Main article|Pantheism}}
Pantheism is the belief that everything composes an all-encompassing, [[immanence|immanent]] God,&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy ed. Paul Edwards |publisher=Macmillan and Free Press |year = 1967 |location = New York|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the [[universe]] (or [[nature]]) is identical with [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English | publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998 | location = Oxford | pages = 1341|isbn = 0-19-861263-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantheists thus do not believe in a [[personal god|personal]] or [[anthropomorphic]] god, but believe that interpretations of the term differ.

Pantheism was popularized in the modern era as both a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th century philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]],&lt;ref name=Picton&gt;{{cite book|last=Picton|first=James Allanson|title=Pantheism: its story and significance|year=1905|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; CO LTD.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1419140082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_yjarZwEhoC&amp;pg=PP8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' was an answer to [[Descartes]]' famous dualist theory that the body and spirit are separate.&lt;ref name=Plumptre /&gt; Spinoza held that the two are the same, and this monism is a fundamental quality of his philosophy. He was described as a "God-intoxicated man," and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance.&lt;ref name=Plumptre&gt;{{cite book|last=Plumptre|first=Constance|title=General sketch of the history of pantheism, Volume 2|year=1879|publisher=Samuel Deacon and Co|location=London|isbn=9780766155022|pages=3–5, 8, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term pantheism was not coined until after his death, Spinoza is regarded as its most celebrated advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoham|first=Schlomo Giora|title=To Test the Limits of Our Endurance|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=1443820687|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Huw Owen|H. P. Owen]] claimed that
{{quote|Pantheists are "monists" ... they believe that there is only one Being, and that all other forms of reality are either modes (or appearances) of it or identical with it.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Owen, 1971, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pantheism is closely related to monism, as pantheists too believe all of reality is one substance, called Universe, God or Nature. [[Panentheism]], a slightly different concept (explained below), however is dualistic.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Donald A. (2008). Living with Ambiguity: Religious Naturalism and the Menace of Evil. New York: State University of New York Press. pp. 124. {{ISBN|0-7914-7519-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most famous pantheists are the [[Stoics]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].

===Panentheism===
{{Main article|Panentheism}}
Panentheism (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πᾶν}} (pân) "all"; {{lang|grc|ἐν}} (en) "in"; and {{lang|grc|θεός}} (theós) "God"; "all-in-God") is a belief system that [[postulate|posits]] that the divine (be it a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[God]], [[polytheism|polytheistic]] [[gods]], or an eternal cosmic animating force) interpenetrates every part of nature, but is not one with nature. Panentheism differentiates itself from [[pantheism]], which holds that the divine is synonymous with the universe.&lt;ref name="Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, David B. Barrett 1999"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sCY4sAjTGIYC&amp;pg=PA21|title= The Encyclopedia of Christianity pg. 21|publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|author1=Erwin Fahlbusch |author2=Geoffrey William Bromiley |author3=David B. Barrett |year = 1999|isbn = 0-8028-2416-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In panentheism, there are two types of substance, "pan" the [[universe]] and God. The universe and the divine are not [[ontology|ontologically]] equivalent. God is viewed as the eternal animating force within the universe. In some forms of panentheism, the [[cosmos]] exists within God, who in turn "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]]", "pervades" or is "in" the cosmos.

While pantheism asserts that 'All is God', panentheism claims that God animates all of the universe, and also transcends the universe. In addition, some forms indicate that the universe is contained within God,&lt;ref name="Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, David B. Barrett 1999"/&gt;  like in the concept of [[Tzimtzum]]. Much [[Hindu thought]] is highly characterized by panentheism and pantheism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441533/pantheism/38168/Pantheism-and-panentheism-in-non-Western-cultures] Britannica - Pantheism and Panentheism in non-Western cultures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Robert. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_UfRgCZThWYC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=shakti+panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jz7nT6-kF8P3rQejn_GDCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=shakti%20panentheism&amp;f=false Religions for Today] Stanley Thomes (Publishers) Ltd. P. VIII. {{ISBN|0-7487-0586-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hasidic Judaism]] merges the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical transcendent Divine Panentheism, through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of [[Kabbalah]], with the populist emphasis on the panentheistic [[Divine immanence]] in everything and deeds of kindness.

[[Paul Tillich]] has argued for such a concept within Christian theology, as has [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] biblical scholar [[Marcus Borg]] and [[Christian mysticism|mystical]] theologian [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]], an Episcopal priest.{{refn|group=note|See [[Creation Spirituality]]}}

===Pandeism===
{{Main article|Pandeism}}
Pandeism or pan-deism (from {{lang-grc|πᾶν|pan|[[The All|all]]}} and {{lang-la|[[deus]]}} meaning "[[god]]" in the sense of [[deism]]), is a term describing beliefs coherently incorporating or mixing [[logic]]ally reconcilable elements of pantheism (that "God", or a metaphysically equivalent [[creator deity]], is identical to [[Nature]]) and [[Deism#History of classical deism|classical deism]] (that the creator-god who designed the universe no longer exists in a status where it can be reached, and can instead be confirmed only by reason). It is therefore most particularly the belief that the creator of the universe actually became the universe, and so ceased to exist as a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The History of Science: A Beginner's Guide p. 90 |author = Sean F. Johnston |year = 2009 |ISBN = 1-85168-681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Ashman, ''[[BBC News]]'', "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A25172309 Metaphysical Isms]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this [[synergy]] pandeism claims to answer primary objections to deism (why would God create and then not interact with the universe?) and to pantheism (how did the universe originate and what is its purpose?).

===Brahmanic faiths===

====Characteristics====
The central problem in Asian (religious) philosophy is not the body-mind problem, but the search for an unchanging Real or Absolute beyond the world of appearances and changing phenomena,{{sfn|Nakamura|1991}} and the search for liberation from [[dukkha]] and the liberation from the [[Reincarnation|cycle of rebirth]].{{sfn|Puligandla|1997}} In Hinduism, [[Substance theory|substance-ontology]] prevails, seeing [[Brahman]] as the unchanging real beyond the world of [[Maya (illusion)|appearances]].{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=50}} In Buddhism [[process ontology]] is prevalent,{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=50}} seeing reality as [[sunyata|empty]] of an unchanging essence.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}

Characteristic for various Asian religions is the discernment of levels of truth,{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=9-11}} an emphasis on [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|intuitive-experiential understanding]] of the Absolute{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}{{sfn|Hawley|2006}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|renard|2010|p=59}} such as [[jnana]], [[bodhi]]  and [[kensho]], and an emphasis on the integration of these levels of truth and its understanding.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=31}}{{sfn|Maezumi|2007}}

=====Vedanta=====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|''[[Adi Shankara]] with Disciples'', by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] (1904)|right|thumb|x216px]]
{{Main article|Vedanta}}
Vedanta is the inquiry into and systematisation of the Vedas and Upanishads, to harmonise the various and contrasting ideas that can be found in those texts. Within Vedanta, different schools exist:&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1995), Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791425824}}, pages 137-143&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Advaita Vedanta]], absolute monism, of which [[Adi Shankara]] is the best-known representative;{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=239}}
* [[Vishishtadvaita]], qualified monism, is from the school of [[Ramanuja]];&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita: A Text and Commentary for Students, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, page xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shuddhadvaita]], in-essence monism, is the school of [[Vallabha]]; 
* [[Dvaitadvaita]], differential monism, is a school founded by [[Nimbarka]]; 
* [[Dvaita]], dualism, is a school founded by [[Madhvacharya]] is probably the only Vedantic System that is opposed to all types of monism. It believes that God is eternally different from souls and matter in both form and essence.
* [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]], a school of [[Vedanta]] representing the philosophy of ''inconceivable one-ness and difference''.

=====Advaita Vedanta=====
{{main article|Advaita Vedanta}}
Monism is most clearly identified in [[Advaita Vedanta]],{{sfn|Momen|2009|p=191}} though Renard points out that this may be a western interpretation, bypassing the intuitive understanding of a nondual reality.{{sfn|renard|2010}}

In Advaita Vedanta, [[Brahman]] is the eternal, unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being, and everything beyond in this Universe. The nature of Brahman is described as transpersonal, personal and impersonal by different philosophical schools.&lt;ref name="Brodd, Jefferey 2003"&gt;Brodd, Jefferey (2003). World Religions. Winona, MN: Saint Mary's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-88489-725-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Vedanta gives an elaborate path to attain moksha. It [[logical consequence|entails]] more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one's real nature. Practice, especially Jnana Yoga, is needed to "destroy one’s tendencies [[Vāsanā|(vAasanA-s)]]" before real insight can be attained.&lt;ref name="Swartz"&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/trad_neo/neo_vedanta_swartz.htm James Swartz, ''What is Neo-Advaita?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}} Usually two levels are being mentioned,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} but Shankara uses [[Advaita vedanta#Criterion of Sublation|sublation]] as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref name=Discrimination&gt;[http://www.advaita-vision.org/discrimination/ advaita-vision.org, ''Discrimination'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IAST|Pāramārthika}} (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved".&lt;ref name=Discrimination /&gt; This experience can't be sublated by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}

=====Vaishnava=====
{{Main article|Vaishnavism}}
All [[Vaishnava]] schools are [[panentheistic]] and view the universe as part of [[Krishna]] or [[Narayana]], but see a plurality of souls and substances within [[Brahman]]. Monistic theism, which includes the concept of a personal god as a [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]], [[omnipotent]] [[Supreme Being]] who is both [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], is prevalent within many other schools of Hinduism as well.

=====Tantra=====
{{Main article|Tantra}}
[[Tantra]] sees the Divine as both immanent and transcendent. The Divine can be found in the concrete world. Practices are aimed at transforming the passions, instead of transcending them.

=====Modern Hinduism=====
{{Main article|Hindu reform movements}}
The colonisation of India by the British had a major impact on Hindu society.{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} In response, leading Hindu intellectuals started to study western culture and philosophy, integrating several western notions into Hinduism.{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} This modernised Hinduism, at its turn, has gained popularity in the west.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}

A major role was played in the 19th century by [[Swami Vivekananda]] in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called [[Neo-Vedanta]].{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}} In Advaita, Shankara suggests meditation and [[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa Samadhi]] are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of ''Brahman'' and ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'',{{sfn|Comans|1993}} not the highest goal itself:
{{quote|[Y]oga is a meditative exercise of withdrawal from the particular and identification with the universal, leading to contemplation of oneself as the most universal, namely, Consciousness. This approach is different from the classical Yoga of complete thought suppression.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}}}

Vivekananda, according to [[Gavin Flood]], was "a figure of great importance in the development of a modern Hindu self-understanding and in formulating the West's view of Hinduism."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} Central to his philosophy is the idea that the divine exists in all beings, that all human beings can achieve union with this "innate divinity",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} and that seeing this divine as the essence of others will further love and social harmony.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} According to Vivekananda, there is an essential unity to Hinduism, which underlies the diversity of its many forms.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} According to Flood, Vivekananda's view of Hinduism is the most common among Hindus today.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=259}} This monism, according to Flood, is at the foundation of earlier Upanishads, to theosophy in the later Vedanta tradition and in modern Neo-Hinduism.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=85}}

====Buddhism====
{{Main article|Buddhism}}
According to the [[Pāli Canon]], both pluralism (''nānatta'') and monism (''ēkatta'') are speculative [[View (Buddhism)|views]]. A [[Theravada]] commentary notes that the former is similar to or associated with [[nihilism]] (''ucchēdavāda''), and the latter is similar to or associated with eternalism (''[[sassatavada]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 88. The passage is SN 2.77.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[middle way]].

In the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], the ultimate nature of the world is described as ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' or "emptiness", which is inseparable from sensorial objects or anything else. That appears to be a monist position, but the Madhyamaka views - including variations like ''[[rangtong]]'' and ''[[shentong]]'' - will refrain from asserting any ultimately existent entity. They instead deconstruct any detailed or conceptual assertions about ultimate existence as resulting in absurd consequences. The [[Yogacara]] view, a minority school now only found among the Mahayana, also rejects monism.

=====Levels of truth=====

Within Buddhism, a rich variety of philosophical{{sfn|Williams|1994}} and pedagogical models{{sfn|Buswell|1994}} can be found. Various schools of Buddhism discern levels of truth:
* The [[Two truths doctrine]] of the [[Madhyamaka]]
* The [[Three natures|Three Natures]] of the [[Yogacara]]
* [[Essence-Function]], or [[Chinese Chán#Absolute-relative|Absolute-relative]] in Chinese and Korean Buddhism
* The [[Trikaya]]-formule, consisting of 
** The ''[[Dharmakāya]]'' or ''Truth body'' which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries;
** The ''[[Sambhogakāya]]'' or ''body of mutual enjoyment'' which is a body of bliss or clear light manifestation;
** The ''Nirmāṇakāya'' or ''created body'' which manifests in time and space.&lt;ref name="Welwood, John 2007"&gt;Welwood, John (2000). [http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm ''The Play of the Mind: Form, Emptiness, and Beyond''], accessed January 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita-sutras]] and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: "form is emptiness, emptiness is form", as the [[heart sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} In Chinese Buddhism this was understood to mean that ultimate reality is not a transcendental realm, but equal to the daily world of relative reality. This idea fitted into the Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world:
{{quote|To deny the duality of samsara and nirvana, as the Perfection of Wisdom does, or to demonstrate logically the error of dichotomizing conceptualization, as Nagarjuna does, is not to address the question of the relationship between samsara and nirvana -or, in more philosophical terms, between phenomenal and ultimate reality [...] What, then, is the relationship between these two realms?{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}}}
This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]],{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]], and [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Hakuin's Four ways of knowing]].{{sfn|Low|2006}}

==== Sikhism ====
{{Main|God in Sikhism}}
Sikhism complies with the concept of Priority&amp;nbsp;Monism. Sikh philosophy advocates that all that our senses comprehend is an illusion; God is the sole reality. Forms being subject to time shall pass away. God's Reality alone is eternal and abiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allaboutsikhs.com/sikhism-articles/the-idea-of-the-supreme-being-god-in-sikhism|title=The Idea Of The Supreme Being (God) In Sikhism - Sikhism Articles - Gateway to Sikhism|last=User|first=Super|work=Gateway to Sikhism|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The thought is that Atma (soul) is born from, and a reflection of, ParamAtma (Supreme Soul), and "will again merge into it", in the words of the Tenth guru of Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh, "just as water merges back into the water."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/metaphysics/atma|title=ATMA,|last=Gujral|first=Maninder S|work=The Sikh Encyclopedia -ਸਿੱਖ ਧਰਮ ਵਿਸ਼ਵਕੋਸ਼|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abrahamic faiths===

====Judaism====
{{Main article|Judaism}}
Jewish thought considers God as separate from all physical, created things ([[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]) and as existing outside of time (eternal).{{refn|group=note|For a discussion of the resultant [[paradox]], see ''[[Tzimtzum]]''.}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Negative theology]].}}

According to [[Hasidic philosophy|Chasidic Thought]] (particularly as propounded by the 18th century, early 19th century founder of [[Chabad]], [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]), God is held to be [[Immanence|immanent]] within [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] for two interrelated reasons:
# A very strong Jewish belief is that "[t]he Divine life-force which brings [the universe] into existence must constantly be present ... were this life-force to forsake [the universe] for even one brief moment, it would revert to a state of utter nothingness, as before the creation ..."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/archive/LibraryArchive2.asp?AID=7988&lt;/ref&gt;
# Simultaneously, Judaism holds as [[axiom]]atic that [[Jewish principle of faith#God is One|God is an absolute unity]], and that he is [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|Perfectly Simple]]—thus, if his sustaining power is within nature, then his essence is also within nature.

The [[Vilna Gaon]] was very much against this philosophy, for he felt that it would lead to pantheism and [[heresy]]. According to some this is the main reason for the Gaon's ban on Chasidism.

According to [[Maimonides]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''Foundations of the Law'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; God is an incorporeal being that caused all other existence.  In fact, God is defined as the necessary existent that caused all other existence. According to Maimonides, to admit corporeality to God is tantamount to admitting complexity to God, which is a contradiction to God as the First Cause and constitutes heresy.  While Hasidic mystics considered the existence of the physical world a contradiction to God's simpleness, Maimonides saw no contradiction.{{refn|group=note|See the "Guide for the Perplexed", especially chapter I:50.}}

====Christianity====
{{See also|Christian anthropology}}

=====Creator–creature distinction=====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
[[Christianity]] strongly maintains the creator–creature distinction as fundamental. Christians maintain that God created the universe ''[[ex nihilo]]'' and not from his own substance, so that the creator is not to be confused with creation, but rather [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] it (metaphysical dualism) (cf. [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]). Although, there is growing movement to have a "Christian Panentheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53880197|title=In whom we live and move and have our being : panentheistic reflections on God's presence in a scientific world|last=1956-|first=Clayton, Philip,|last2=Robert)|first2=Peacocke, A. R. (Arthur|date=2004|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Pub|isbn=0802809782|oclc=53880197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more immanent concepts and theologies are to be defined together with God's omnipotence, omnipresence and omniscience, due to God's desire for intimate contact with his own creation (cf. Acts 17:27). Another use of the term "monism" is in [[Christian anthropology]] to refer to the innate nature of humankind as being [[holistic]], as usually opposed to [[bipartite (theology)|bipartite]] and [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] views.

=====Rejection of radical dualism=====
In ''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|On Free Choice of the Will]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] argued, in the context of [[the problem of evil]], that evil is not the opposite of good, but rather merely the absence of good, something that does not have existence in itself. Likewise, [[C. S. Lewis]] described evil as a "parasite" in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', as he viewed evil as something that cannot exist without good to provide it with existence. Lewis went on to argue against dualism from the basis of [[moral absolutism]], and rejected the dualistic notion that God and [[Satan]] are  opposites, arguing instead that God has no equal, hence no opposite. Lewis rather viewed Satan as the opposite of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the archangel]]. Due to this, Lewis instead argued for a more limited type of dualism.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.S, "God and Evil" in "God in the Dock: Essays in Theology and Ethics", ed. W. Hooper (Grand Rapids, Mich, Eerdsmans, 1970), p. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; Other theologians, such as [[Greg Boyd (theologian)|Greg Boyd]], have argued in more depth that the Biblical authors held a "limited dualism", meaning that God and Satan do engage in real battle, but only due to free will given by God, for the duration God allows.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Gregory. A, "God at War" (Downers Grove, IL, InterVarsity Press, 1971) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah 45:5-7
5 I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:
6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the Lord, and there is none else.
7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.

=====Theosis=====
In [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], while human beings are not ontologically identical with the Creator, they are nonetheless capable with uniting with his Divine Nature via [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]], and especially, through the devout reception of the [[Eucharist|Holy Eucharist]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This is a supernatural union, over and above that natural union, of which [[St. John of the Cross]] says, "it must be known that God dwells and is present substantially in every soul, even in that of the greatest sinner in the world, and this union is natural." [[Julian of Norwich]], while maintaining the orthodox duality of Creator and creature, nonetheless speaks of God as "the true Father and true Mother" of all natures; thus, he indwells them substantially and thus preserves them from annihilation, as without this sustaining indwelling everything would cease to exist.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

However, in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] creation is united to God by grace and not by nature. This is what is known as the [[Essence-Energies distinction]], while in union with God, Orthodox Christians believe, the human person retains its individuality and is not swallowed up by the Monad.

=====Christian Monism=====
Some Christian theologians are avowed monists, such as [[Paul Tillich]]. Since God is he "in whom we live and move and have our being" ([[Book of Acts]] 17.28), it follows that everything that has being partakes in God.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Islam====
{{See also|Tawhid}}

=====Quran=====
[[Vincent Cornell]] argues that the [[Quran]] provides a monist image of God by describing reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things. But most argue that Semitic religious scriptures, especially the Quran, see creation and God as two separate existences. It explains that everything has been created by God and is under his control, but at the same time distinguishes creation as being dependent on the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yusuf |first1=Hamza |title=The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi |date=2009 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Creed-Imam-al-Tahawi-Hamza-Yusuf/dp/097028439X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sufism=====
{{See also|Sufism}}
Sufi mystics advocate monism. One of the most notable being the 13th-century Persian poet [[Rumi]] (1207–73) in his didactic poem ''[[Masnavi]]'' espoused monism.&lt;ref name="nicholson"&gt;[http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/rumi/intro_nicholson.html Reynold Nicholson ''Rumi''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017141204/http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/rumi/intro_nicholson.html |date=2006-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rumi.org.uk/sufism/persian_sufism.htm Cyprian Rice (1964) ''The Persian Sufism'' George Allen, London]&lt;/ref&gt; Rumi says in the [[Masnavi]],
{{quote|In the shop for Unity (wahdat); anything that you see there except the One is an idol.&lt;ref name="nicholson" /&gt;}}

The most influential of the [[Islam|Islamic]] monists was the Sufi philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] (1165–1240). He developed the concept of 'unity of being' (Arabic: ''[[Sufi metaphysics|waḥdat al-wujūd]]''), a pantheistic monoist philosophy. Born in [[al-Andalus]], he made an enormous impact on the Muslim world, where he was crowned "the great Master". In the centuries following his death, his ideas became increasingly controversial.

===Bahá'í===
{{Main article|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
Although the [[Bahá'í teachings]] have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year = 1992|contribution = The Bahá'í Faith|title = Britannica Book of the Year
|isbn = 0-85229-486-7|editor1=Daphne Daume |editor2=Louise Watson |publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica|location = Chicago | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include statements of a monist nature (e.g., ''[[The Seven Valleys]]'' and the ''[[Hidden Words]]''). The differences between dualist and monist views are reconciled by the teaching that these opposing viewpoints are caused by differences in the observers themselves, not in that which is observed. This is not a 'higher truth/lower truth' position. God is unknowable. For man it is impossible to acquire any direct knowledge of God or the Absolute, because any knowledge that one has, is relative.&lt;ref name="momen1988"&gt;{{cite book | last =Momen | first = Moojan |year = 1988 | title = Studies in the Bábí and Bahá’í Religions vol. 5, chapter: A Basis For Bahá’í Metaphysics | publisher = Kalimat Press | pages = 185–217 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_relativism_bahai_metaphysics | isbn = 0-933770-72-3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-dualism===
{{Main article|Nondualism}}
According to nondualism, many forms of religion are based on an experiential or intuitive understanding of "the Real".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}} Nondualism, a modern reinterpretation of these religions, prefers the term "nondualism", instead of monism, because this understanding is "nonconceptual", "not graspable in an idea".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}{{refn|group=note|In Dutch: "Niet in een denkbeeld te vatten".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Renard, [[Alan Watts]] has explained the difference between "non-dualism" and "monism" in ''The Supreme Identity'', Faber and Faber 1950, p.69 and 95; ''The Way of Zen'', Pelican-edition 1976, p.59-60.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59, p.285 note 17}} According to Renard, Alan Watts has been one of the main contributors to thepopularisation of the notion of "nondualism".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}}}

To these nondual traditions belong [[Hinduism]] (including [[Vedanta]], some forms of [[Yoga]], and certain schools of [[Shaivism]]), [[Taoism]], [[Pantheism]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and similar systems of thought.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Multilinear subspace learning#Algorithms|Multilinear subspace learning algorithms]] are higher-order generalizations of [[linear subspace]] learning methods such as [[principal component analysis]] (PCA), [[independent component analysis]] (ICA), [[linear discriminant analysis]] (LDA) and [[canonical correlation|canonical correlation analysis]] (CCA).

== Background ==
With the advances in [[data acquisition]] and [[Computer data storage|storage technology]], [[big data]] (or massive data sets) are being generated on a daily basis in a wide range of emerging applications. Most of these big data are multidimensional. Moreover, they are usually very-[[high-dimensional]], with a large amount of redundancy, and only occupying a part of the input space. Therefore, [[Dimension reduction|dimensionality reduction]] is frequently employed to map [[high-dimensional data]] to a low-dimensional space while retaining as much information as possible.

[[Linear subspace]] learning algorithms are traditional dimensionality reduction techniques that represent input data as [[Coordinate vector|vector]]s and solve for an optimal [[linear mapping]] to a lower-dimensional space. Unfortunately, they often become inadequate when dealing with massive multidimensional data. They result in very-high-dimensional vectors, lead to the estimation of a large number of parameters.&lt;ref name="Vasilescu2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSLsurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TSAnips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPCA-Lu2008"&gt;H.

Multilinear Subspace Learning employ different types of data tensor analysis tools for dimensionality reduction.  Multilinear Subspace learning can be applied to observations whose measurements were vectorized and organized into a data tensor,&lt;ref name="Vasilescu2003"/&gt; or whose measurements are treated as a matrix and concatenated into a tensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Future Directions in Tensor-Based Computation and Modeling |date=May 2009|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cv/tenwork/finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multilinear principal component analysis ===
Historically, [[multilinear principal component analysis]] has been referred to as "M-mode PCA", a terminology which was coined by Peter Kroonenberg.&lt;ref name="Kroonenberg1980"&gt;P. M. Kroonenberg and J. de Leeuw, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/c8551t1p31236776/ Principal component analysis of three-mode data by means of alternating least squares algorithms], Psychometrika, 45 (1980), pp. 69–97.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, [[M. Alex O. Vasilescu|Vasilescu]] and [[Demetri Terzopoulos|Terzopoulos]] introduced the Multilinear PCA&lt;ref name="MPCA-MICA2005"&gt;M. A. O. Vasilescu, D.

*A TTP is a direct projection of a high-dimensional tensor to a low-dimensional tensor of the same order, using ''N'' projection matrices for an ''N''th-order tensor. It can be performed in ''N'' steps with each step performing a tensor-matrix multiplication (product). The ''N'' steps are exchangeable.&lt;ref name="HOSVD"&gt;L.D.  Lathauwer,  B.D.  Moor,  J.

*A TVP is a direct projection of a high-dimensional tensor to a low-dimensional vector, which is also referred to as the rank-one projections. As TVP projects a tensor to a vector, it can be viewed as multiple projections from a tensor to a scalar. Thus, the TVP of a tensor to a ''P''-dimensional vector consists of ''P'' projections from the tensor to a scalar. The projection from a tensor to a scalar is an elementary multilinear projection (EMP). In EMP, a tensor is projected to a point through ''N'' unit projection vectors. It is the projection of a tensor on a single line (resulting a scalar), with one projection vector in each mode. Thus, the TVP of a tensor object to a vector in a ''P''-dimensional vector space consists of ''P'' EMPs. This projection is an extension of the [[CP decomposition|canonical decomposition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Typical approach in MSL ===
There are ''N'' sets of parameters to be solved, one in each mode. The solution to one set often depends on the other sets (except when ''N=1'', the linear case). Therefore, the suboptimal iterative procedure in&lt;ref&gt;L.  D.  Lathauwer,  B.  D.  Moor,  J.  Vandewalle,  [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=354405 On  the  best  rank-1  and rank-(R1, R2, ..., RN ) approximation of higher-order tensors], SIAM Journal of Matrix Analysis and Applications 21 (4) (2000) 1324–1342.&lt;/ref&gt; is followed.

#Initialization of the projections in each mode
#For each mode, fixing the projection in all the other mode, and solve for the projection in the current mode.
#Do the mode-wise optimization for a few iterations or until convergence.

This is originated from the alternating least square method for multi-way data analysis.&lt;ref name="Kroonenberg1980"/&gt;

=== Pros and cons ===
[[File:Compactness Comparison of Linear and Multilinear Projections.png|right|thumb|360px|This figure compares the number of parameters to be estimated for the same amount of [[dimension reduction]] by vector-to-vector projection (VVP), (i.e., linear projection,) tensor-to-vector projection (TVP), and tensor-to-tensor projection (TTP).  Multilinear projections require much fewer parameters and the representations obtained are more compact. (This figure is produced based on Table 3 of the survey paper&lt;ref name="MSLsurvey"/&gt;)]]
The advantages of MSL over traditional linear subspace modeling, in common domains where the representation is naturally somewhat tensorial, are:&lt;ref name="MSLsurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TSAnips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPCA-Lu2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DATER"/&gt;

*MSL preserves the structure and correlation that the original data had before projection, by operating on a natural tensorial representation of the multidimensional data.
*MSL can learn more compact representations than its linear counterpart; in other words, it needs to estimate a much smaller number of parameters. Thus, MSL can handle big tensor data more efficiently, by performing computations on a representation with many fewer dimensions. This leads to lower demand on computational resources.

However, MSL algorithms are iterative and are not guaranteed to converge; where an MSL algorithm does converge, it may do so at a [[local optimum]]. (In contrast, traditional linear subspace modeling techniques often produce an exact closed-form solution.) MSL convergence problems can often be mitigated by choosing an appropriate subspace dimensionality, and by appropriate strategies for initialization, for termination, and for choosing the order in which projections are solved.&lt;ref name="MSLsurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TSAnips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPCA-Lu2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DATER"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17937">The '''N170''' is a component of the [[event-related potential]] (ERP) that reflects the neural processing of [[Face perception|faces]].

When potentials evoked by images of faces are compared to those elicited by other visual stimuli, the former show increased negativity 130-200 ms after stimulus presentation. This response is maximal over occipito-temporal electrode sites, which is consistent with a source located at the [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] and [[Inferior temporal gyrus|inferior-temporal]] gyri, confirmed by [[electrocorticography]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghuman|first=Avniel Singh|last2=Brunet|first2=Nicolas M.|last3=Li|first3=Yuanning|last4=Konecky|first4=Roma O.|last5=Pyles|first5=John A.|last6=Walls|first6=Shawn A.|last7=Destefino|first7=Vincent|last8=Wang|first8=Wei|last9=Richardson|first9=R.

==History==
The N170 was first described by [[Shlomo Bentin]] and colleagues in 1996,&lt;ref name=bentinEtAl1996 /&gt; who measured ERPs from participants viewing faces and other objects. They found that human faces and face parts (such as eyes) elicited different responses than other stimuli, including animal faces, body parts, and cars.

Earlier work performed by Botzel and Grusser and first reported in 1989&lt;ref name=botzelGrusser1989 /&gt; also attempted to find a component of the ERP that corresponded to the processing of human faces. They showed observers line drawings (in one experiment) and black-and-white photographs (in two additional experiments) of faces, trees, and chairs. They found that, compared to the other stimulus classes, faces elicited a larger positive component approximately 150 ms after onset, which was maximal at central electrode sites (at the top of the head). The topography of this effect and lack of lateralization led to the conclusion that this face-specific potential did not arise in face-selective areas in the occipital-temporal region, but instead in the [[limbic system]]. Subsequent work referred to this component as the vertex positive potential (VPP).&lt;ref name=jeffreys1996 /&gt;

In an attempt to rectify these two apparently conflicting results, Joyce and Rossion&lt;ref name=joyceRossion2005 /&gt; recorded ERPs from 53 scalp electrodes while participants viewed faces and other visual stimuli. After recording, they re-referenced the data to several commonly used reference electrode sites, including the nose and [[mastoid process]]. They found that the N170 and VPP can be accounted for by the same [[Electric dipole|dipole arrangement]] arising from the same neural generators, and therefore reflect the same process.

==Functional sensitivity==
Three of the most studied attributes of the N170 include manipulations of face inversion, facial race, and emotional expressions.

It has been established that inverted faces (i.e., those presented upside-down) are more difficult to perceive&lt;ref name=yin1969 /&gt; (the [[Thatcher effect]] is a good illustration of this). In their landmark study, Bentin et al. found that inverted faces increased the latency of the N170 component.&lt;ref name=bentinEtAl1996 /&gt; Jacques and colleagues further studied the timecourse of the [[face inversion effect]] (FIE) using an adaptation paradigm.&lt;ref name=jacquesEtAl2007 /&gt; When the same stimulus is presented multiple times, the neuronal response decreases over time; when a different stimulus is presented, the response recovers. The conditions under which a "release from adaptation" occurs therefore provides a way to measure stimulus similarity. In their experiment, Jacques et al. found that the release from adaptation is smaller and occurs 30 ms later for inverted faces, indicating that the neuronal population encoding face identity require additional processing time to detect the identity of inverted faces.

In an experiment examining the effects of race on the N170's amplitude, it was found that an "Other-Race Effect" was elicited in conjunction with face inversions.  Vizioli and colleagues examined the effect of face recognition impairment while subjects process same race (SR) or other race (OR) pictures.&lt;ref name=vizioliEtAl2010 /&gt; The research team devised a N170 experiment based on the premise that visual expertise plays a critical role in inversion, hypothesizing that viewers' greater level of expertise with SR faces (holistic processing) should elicit a stronger FIE compared to OR face stimuli. The authors recorded EEGs from Western Caucasian and East Asian subjects (two separate groups) who were presented with pictures of Western Caucasian, East Asian and African America faces in upright and inverted orientations. All the facial stimuli were cropped to remove external features (i.e. hair, beards, hats, etc.). Both groups displayed a later N170 with larger amplitude (over the right hemisphere) for inverted than upright same-race (SR) faces, but showed no inversion effect for OR and AA photo stimuli. Moreover, no race effects were observed in regard to the peak amplitude of the N170 for upright faces in both groups of participants. The results also found no significant latency differences among the races of stimuli, but facial inversion did increase and delay the N170 amplitude and onset respectively. They conclude that the subjects' lack of experience with inverted faces makes processing such stimuli more difficult than pictures shown in their canonical orientation, regardless of what race the stimulus is.

Besides modulation by inversion and race, emotional expressions have also been a focus of N170 face research. In an experiment conducted by Righart and de Gelder, ERP results show that the early stages of face processing may be affected by emotional scenes when categorizations of fearful and happy facial expressions are made by subjects.&lt;ref name=righardDeGelder2008 /&gt; In this paradigm subjects had to view color pictures of happy or fearful faces that were centrally overlaid on pictures of natural scenes. And in order to control for low level features, such as color and other items that could care meaning, all the scene pictures were scrambled by randomizing the position of pixels across the image. The final results of the experiment show that emotion effects were associated with the N170 in which there was a larger (negative) amplitude for faces when they appeared in a fearful context then when placed in happy or neutral scenes. In fact, left occipito-temporal distributed N170 amplitudes were dramatically increased for intact fearful faces when they appeared in a fearful scene, though levels were not as high when a fearful face was presented in a happy or neutral scene. Similar results did occur in regard to intact happy faces, but the amplitudes were not as high as those related to fearful scenes or expressions.&lt;ref name=blauEtAl2007 /&gt; Righart and de Gelder conclude that information from task-irrelevant scenes is rapidly combined with the information from facial expressions, and that subjects use context information in the early stage of processing when they need to discriminate/categorize facial expressions.

Results from a study conducted by Ghuman and colleagues using direct neural recordings from the [[fusiform face area]] using [[electrocorticography]] showed that while the N170 displays a very strong response to faces when compared to other visual images, the N170 is not sensitive to the identity of the face.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instead, they showed that which face a person is viewing can be decoded from the activity between 250–500 ms, consistent with the hypothesis that identity processing begins with the N250.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=James W.|last2=Curran|first2=Tim|last3=Porterfield|first3=Albert L.|last4=Collins|first4=Daniel|date=2006-09-01|title=Activation of preexisting and acquired face representations: the N250 event-related potential as an index of face familiarity|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1488–1497|doi=10.1162/jocn.2006.18.9.1488|issn=0898-929X|pmid=16989550}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results suggest that the N170 is important for gist-level processing of faces and face detection, processes which may set the stage for later face individuation.

==Generators==
Given the ease and rapidity with which humans can recognize faces, a great deal of neuroscientific research has endeavored to understand how and where the brain processes them. Early research on [[prosopagnosia]], or "face blindness", found that damage to the occipito-temporal region led to an impaired or complete inability for people to recognize faces. Convergent evidence for the importance of this region in face processing came through the use of [[fMRI]], which found that a region of the [[fusiform gyrus]], the "[[fusiform face area]]", responded selectively to images of faces.

Intracranial recordings in humans using [[electrocorticography]] provide very strong evidence that the fusiform face area is one of the generators of the N170,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; though other regions of the face processing network may also contribute to the N170.

An investigation of the N170 undertaken&lt;ref name="itierTaylor2004" /&gt; used ERP source-localization techniques to estimate the location of the neural generator of the N170. They concluded that the N170 arose from the posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]]. However, it should be noted that these techniques are fraught with potential sources of error, and there is disagreement on the validity of inferences drawn from such findings.&lt;ref name="luck2005" /&gt;

==Faces or interstimulus variance==
In 2007, Guillaume Thierry and colleagues&lt;ref name=thierryEtAl2007 /&gt; presented evidence that called into question the face-specificity of the N170. Most earlier experiments found an N170 when the response to frontal views of faces was compared to those of other objects that could appear in more variable poses and configurations. In their study, they introduced a new factor: stimuli could be faces or non-faces, and either class could have high or low similarity. Similarity was measured by calculating the [[correlation]] between [[pixel]] values in pairs of same-category stimuli. When ERPs were compared for these conditions, they found a typical N170 effect in the low-similarity non-face vs. high-similarity face comparison. However, high-similarity non-faces showed a significant N170, while low-similarity faces did not. These results led the authors to conclude that the N170 is actually a measure of stimulus similarity, and not face processing per se.

In response to this, Rossion and Jacques&lt;ref name=rossionJacques2008 /&gt; measured similarity as above for several object categories used in a previous study of the N170. They found that faces elicited a larger N170 than other classes of objects that had similar or higher similarity values, such as houses, cars, and shoes. While it remains uncertain why Thierry et al. observed an effect of similarity on the N170, Rossion and Jacques speculate that lower similarity leads to more variance in the latency of the response. Since ERP components are measured by averaging the results from many individual trials, high latency variance effectively “smears” the response, reducing the amplitude of the average. Rossion and Jacques also offer criticism of the methodology used by Thierry and colleagues, arguing that their failure to find a difference between high-similarity faces and high-similarity non-faces was due to a poor choice of electrode sites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10904">'''Narcissistic defenses''' are those processes whereby the idealized aspects of the self are preserved, and its limitations denied.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw J.A. (1999). ''Sexual Aggression'', American Psychiatric Publishing, pp. 28–9.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be rigid and totalistic.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Alper, ''Self Defence in a Narcissistic World'' (2003) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They are often driven by feelings of [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], conscious or unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

Narcissistic defenses are among the earliest [[defense mechanisms]] to emerge, and  include [[denial]], [[cognitive distortion|distortion]], and [[psychological projection|projection]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry P.D., Farmer S. (2002). ''Mental Health and Mental Illness'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Splitting (psychology)|Splitting]] is another defense mechanism prevalent among individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]]—seeing people and situations in black and white terms, either as all bad or all good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lubit R | year = 2002 | title = The long-term organizational impact of destructively narcissistic managers | url = | journal = Academy of Management Executive | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 127–38 | doi=10.5465/ame.2002.6640218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A narcissistic defense, with the disorder's typical over-valuation of the self, can appear at any stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Wilber|Wilber K.]], Engler J., Brown D. (1986). ''Transformations of Consciousness: Conventional and Contemplative Perspective of Development'', Boston: New Science Library, New York City, NY, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence sequences&lt;!--'Narcissistic defence sequences' redirects here--&gt;==

==Freudians==
[[File:Freud 420a.jpg|thumb|Sigmund Freud]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] did not focus specifically on narcissistic defenses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/narcissistic-defenses Elsa Schmid-Kitsikis, "Narcissistic Defenses"]&lt;/ref&gt; but did note in ''[[On Narcissism]]'' how "even great criminals and humorists, as they are represented in literature, compel our interest by the narcissistic consistency with which they manage to keep away from their ego anything that would diminish it".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud saw narcissistic [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] as a defensive answer to object loss – denying the loss of an important object by way of a substitutive identification with it.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Metapsychology'', p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud also considered social narcissism as a defence mechanism, apparent when communal identifications produce irrational panics at perceived threats to 'Throne and Altar' or 'Free Markets',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; or in English over-reaction to any questioning of [[Shakespeare authorship question|the status and identity of William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;James Shapiro, ''Contested Will'' (2010) p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fenichel===
[[Otto Fenichel]] considered that "identification, performed by means of [[introjection]], is the most primitive form of relationship to objects" a primitive mechanism only used "if the ego's function of reality testing is severely damaged by a narcissistic regression."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946), pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fenichel also highlighted "eccentrics who have more or less succeeded in regaining the security of [[primary narcissism]] and who feel 'Nothing can happen to me'....[failing] to give up the archaic stages of repudiating displeasure and to turn toward reality".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacan===
[[Jacques Lacan]], following out Freud's view of the ego as the result of identifications,&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Oxford 1997), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; came to consider the ego itself as a narcissistic defence, driven by what he called "the 'narcissistic passion' ...in the coming-into-being (''devenir'') of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kleinians==
[[Melanie Klein]], emphasised [[projective identification]] in narcissism, and the manic defence against becoming aware of the damage done to objects in this way.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Grotstein, "Foreword", in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; For Kleinians, at the core of manic defences in narcissism stood what [[Hanna Segal]] called "a triad of feelings—control, triumph and contempt".&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosenfeld===
[[Herbert Rosenfeld]] looked at the role of [[omnipotence]], combined with projective identification, as a narcissistic means of defending against awareness of separation between ego and  object.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''The Taming of Solitude'' (2004), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object relations theory==
In the wake of Klein, [[object relations theory]], including particularly the American schools of [[Otto Kernberg]] and [[Heinz Kohut]] has explored narcissistic defences through analysis of  such mechanisms as denial,  projective identification, and extreme idealization.&lt;ref name="Schmid-Kitsikis"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/narcissistic-defenses Schmid-Kitsikis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kernberg emphasised the role of the splitting apart introjections, and identifications of opposing qualities, as a cause of ego weakness.&lt;ref&gt;Otto F. Kernberg, ''Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism'' (London 1990) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut too stressed the fact in narcissism "vertical splits are between self-structures (among others)—'I am grand' and 'I am wretched'—with very little communication between them".&lt;ref&gt;Kohut, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neville Symington]] however placed greater weight on the way "a person dominated by narcissistic currents...survives through being able to sense the emotional tone of the other...wearing the cloaks of others";&lt;ref&gt;Symington, pp. 52, 88&lt;/ref&gt; while for Spotnitz the key element is that the narcissist turns feelings in upon the self in narcissistic defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://modernpsychoanalysis.blogspot.com/2006/09/narcissistic-defense.html James G. Fennessy, "The Narcissistic Defense"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive defenses===
Kernberg emphasised the positive side to narcissistic defenses,&lt;ref&gt;Elsa Ronningstam, ''Disorders of Narcissism'' (1997) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; while Kohut also stressed the necessity in early life for narcissistic positions to succeed each other in orderly maturational sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Kohut, ''The Analysis of the Self'' (Madison 1971) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Others like Symington would maintain that "it is a mistake to split narcissism into positive and negative...we do not get positive narcissism without self-hatred".&lt;ref&gt;Symington, pp. 58, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stigmatising attitude to psychiatric illness==
Arikan found that a [[Social stigma|stigmatising]] attitude to [[psychiatric]] patients is associated with narcissistic defences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arikan, K. |title=A stigmatizating attitude towards psychiatric illnesses is associated with narcissistic personality traits |journal=Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=248–50 |year=2005 |format=PDF |url=http://www.kemalarikan.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/arikan_stigma_narsisizm.pdf |pmid=16618057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
The twenty-first century has seen a distinction drawn between cerebral and somatic narcissists – the former building up their self-sense through intellectualism, the latter through an obsession with their bodies,&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about Me'' (London 2007) pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- self-help book?? --&gt;  as with the woman who, in [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]], invests her sense of freedom only in being an object of beauty for others.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Reynolds, ''Understanding Existentialism'' (2006) p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary parallels==
* [[Sir Philip Sidney]] is said to have seen poetry in itself as a narcissistic defense.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Goldberg, ''Voice Terminal Echo'' (1986) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s aloof, detached protagonists have been seen as crude narcissists who preserve their sense of self only by petrifying it into solid form.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Kotarba/A. Fontana, ''The Existential Self in Society'' (1987) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nazi eugenics''' ({{lang-de|Nationalsozialistische Rassenhygiene}}, "National Socialist racial hygiene") were [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Nazism and race|racially based]] social policies that placed the biological improvement of the [[Aryan race]] or Germanic "''[[Übermensch]]en''" [[master race]] through [[eugenics]] at the center of Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Longerich2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Longerich|title=Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews|date=15 April 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280436-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Germany]], eugenics were mostly known under the synonymous term '''racial hygiene'''. Following the [[Second World War]], both terms effectively vanished and were replaced by ''Humangenetik'' ([[human genetics]]).

Eugenics research in Germany before and during the Nazi period was similar to that in the [[Eugenics in the United States|United States]] (particularly California), by which it had been partly inspired. However, its prominence rose sharply under [[Adolf Hitler]]'s leadership when wealthy Nazi supporters started heavily investing in it. The programs were subsequently shaped to complement [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policies]].&lt;ref name="murphy"/&gt;

Those humans targeted for destruction under Nazi eugenics policies were largely living in private and state-operated institutions, identified as "[[life unworthy of life]]" ({{lang-de|Lebensunwertes Leben}}), including prisoners, [[Degeneration|"degenerates"]], [[Gleichschaltung|dissidents]], people with congenital cognitive and physical disabilities (including people who were "feebleminded", epileptic, schizophrenic, manic-depressive, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, deaf, blind) ({{lang-de| erbkranken}}), [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|homosexual]], idle, insane, and the weak, for elimination from the chain of [[heredity]]. More than 400,000 people were [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilized against their will]], while more than 70,000 were killed under [[Aktion T4|Action T4]], a [[euthanasia]] program.&lt;ref name="USHMM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalassets.ushmm.org/photoarchives/detail.aspx?id=10049&amp;search=EUTHANASIA+%28PATIENTS%2FVICTIMS%29&amp;index=25 | title=Close-up of Richard Jenne, the last child killed by the head nurse at the Kaufbeuren-Irsee euthanasia facility. | publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', Chapter VI, first section (London, 1991, rev. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, S. &amp; D.

==Origins in the U.S. eugenics movement==
{{See also|Eugenics in the United States}}

The early German eugenics movement was led by [[Wilhelm Schallmayer]] and [[Alfred Ploetz]].&lt;ref name="weiss1987"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520058231  |title=Race Hygiene and National Efficiency: The Eugenics of Wilhelm Schallmayer  |last=Weiss |first=Sheila |date=1987 |website= |publisher=University of California Press |access-date= |quote=Wilhelm Schallmayer (1857-1919) who, along with Alfred Ploetz (1860-1940), founded German eugenics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedlander2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedlander |first=Henry |date=2000 |title=The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKjqCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press |page=13 |isbn=978-0807846759 |author-link= | quote=Although the German eugenics movement, led until the Weimar years by Alfred Ploetz and Wilhelm Schallmayer, did not differ radically from the American movement, it was more centralized. Unlike in the United States, where federalism and political heterogeneity encouraged diversity even with a single movement, in Germany one society, the German Society for Race Hygiene (''Deutsche Gesellschaft fue Rassenhygiene''), eventually represented all eugenicists, while one journal, the ''Archiv fur Rassen- und Gsellschafts Biologie'', founded by Ploetz in 1904, remained the primary scientific publication of German Eugenics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Friedlander]] wrote that although the German and American eugenics movements were similar, the German movement was more centralized and did not contain as many diverse ideas as the American movement.&lt;ref name="friedlander2000"/&gt;  Unlike the American movement, one publication and one society, the [[German Society for Racial Hygiene]], represented all eugenicists.&lt;ref name="friedlander2000"/&gt;

[[Edwin Black]] wrote that after the eugenics movement was well established in the United States, it was spread to Germany. California eugenicists began producing literature promoting eugenics and sterilization and sending it overseas to German scientists and medical professionals.&lt;ref name="black2003"&gt;{{cite web| author=Edwin Black | title=Eugenics and the Nazis -- the California connection | publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle'' | url= http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Eugenics-and-the-Nazis-the-California-2549771.php | date=November 9, 2003 | access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1933, California had subjected more people to forceful sterilization than all other U.S. states combined. The forced sterilization program engineered by the Nazis was partly inspired by California's.&lt;ref name="murphy"&gt;Murphy &amp; Lappé, 1994: [https://books.google.com/books?id=1lvbUy441m0C&amp;pg=PA18 p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology (KWIA), an organization which concentrated on physical and social anthropology as well as human genetics, was founded in Berlin with significant financial support from the American philanthropic group, the Rockefeller Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen E. Schafft, ''From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich'' (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2004), pp. 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt; German professor of medicine, anthropology and eugenics [[Eugen Fischer]] was the director of this organization, a man whose work helped provide the scientific basis for the Nazis' eugenics policies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Wistrich, ''Who's Who In Nazi Germany'' (New York: Routledge, 2001), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1933, Adolf Hitler appointed Fischer rector of Frederick William University of Berlin, now [[Humboldt University]]. See: [http://www.historische-kommission-muenchen-editionen.de/rektoratsreden/anzeige/index.php?type=rektor&amp;id=93753244 "Rektoratsreden im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert – Online-Bibliographie"], der ehemalige Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] even funded some of the research conducted by [[Josef Mengele]] before he went to [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="black2003"/&gt;

Upon returning from Germany in 1934, where more than 5,000 people per month were being forcibly sterilized, the California eugenics leader [[Charles Goethe|C. M. Goethe]] bragged to a colleague:

{{blockquote|You will be interested to know that your work has played a powerful part in shaping the opinions of the group of intellectuals who are behind [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in this epoch-making program. Everywhere I sensed that their opinions have been tremendously stimulated by American thought... I want you, my dear friend, to carry this thought with you for the rest of your life, that you have really jolted into action a great government of 60 million people.&lt;ref name="black2003"/&gt;}}

Eugenics researcher [[Harry Laughlin|Harry H. Laughlin]] often bragged that his Model Eugenic Sterilization laws had been implemented in the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial hygiene laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Jackson, John P. &amp; Weidman, Nadine M.|title=Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction|year=2005|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-3736-8|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-crlAYsZ-MC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Laughlin was invited to an award ceremony at [[Heidelberg University]] in Germany (scheduled on the anniversary of Hitler's 1934 purge of Jews from the Heidelberg faculty), to receive an honorary doctorate for his work on the "science of racial cleansing". Due to financial limitations, Laughlin was unable to attend the ceremony and had to pick it up from the Rockefeller Institute. Afterwards, he proudly shared the award with his colleagues, remarking that he felt that it symbolized the "common understanding of German and American scientists of the nature of eugenics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Three Generations, No Imbeciles: Eugenics, the Supreme Court, and "Buck v. Bell" | publisher=[[JHU Press]] | author=Lombardo, Paul A. | authorlink=Paul A.

==Hitler's views on eugenics==
[[File:Aktion_brand.jpg|thumb|Hitler's order for Action T4]]
[[Adolf Hitler]] read about [[racial hygiene]] during his imprisonment in [[Landsberg Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Jonathan C.|title=The Routledge History of the Holocaust|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-77956-2|pages=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5v2U8AAv1EcC&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler believed the nation had become weak, corrupted by [[dysgenics]], the infusion of degenerate elements into its bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J. Evans|title=The Third Reich in Power|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=978-1-59420-074-8|pages=429|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3j-Aq1hAgJEC&amp;lpg=PT429&amp;pg=PT429|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racialism and idea of competition, termed [[social Darwinism]] in 1944, were discussed by European scientists and also in the Vienna press during the 1920s. Where Hitler picked up the ideas is uncertain. The theory of evolution had been generally accepted in Germany at the time, but this sort of extremism was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Mathúna | first1 = Dónal P | year = 2006 | title = Human dignity in the Nazi era: implications for contemporary bioethics | journal = [[BMC Medical Ethics]] | volume =  7| issue = | pages = E2| pmc=1484488 | pmid=16536874 | doi=10.1186/1472-6939-7-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Zweites Buch|''Second Book'']], which was unpublished during the Nazi era, Hitler praised Sparta, (using ideas perhaps borrowed from [[Ernst Haeckel]]),&lt;ref&gt;In 1876 Haeckel had discussed the selective [[infanticide]] policy of the Greek city of ancient [[Sparta]].{{cite web |first= |last= |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |author=Haeckel, Ernst |coauthors= |title=The History of Creation, vol.

Appleton |id= |page=170 |year=1876 |accessdate= |quote=Among the Spartans all newly born children were subject to a careful examination or selection. All those that were weak, sickly, or affected with any bodily infirmity, were killed. Only the perfectly healthy and strong children were allowed to live, and they alone afterwards propagated the race.}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that he considered Sparta to be the first "[[Völkisch]] State". He endorsed what he perceived to be an early [[eugenics]] treatment of deformed children:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sparta must be regarded as the first Völkisch State. The exposure of the sick, weak, deformed children, in short, their destruction, was more decent and in truth a thousand times more humane than the wretched insanity of our day which preserves the most pathological subject, and indeed at any price, and yet takes the life of a hundred thousand healthy children in consequence of [[birth control]] or through [[abortion]]s, in order subsequently to breed a race of degenerates burdened with illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hitler, Adolf |title=[[Hitler's Secret Book]] |year=1961 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=0-394-62003-8 |oclc=9830111 |pages=17–18 | quote= |authorlink=Adolf Hitler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawkins, Mike |title=Social Darwinism in European and American Thought, 1860-1945: nature as model and nature as threat |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-57434-X |oclc=34705047 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SszNCxSKmgkC&amp;pg=PA276 | page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Nazi eugenics program==

Fellow German, that is your money, too." from the [[Office of Racial Policy]]'s [[Neues Volk]].]]
[[File:Bus Hartheim Foto Niedernhart Prozess.jpg|thumb|Collection bus for killing patients]]
In organizing their eugenics program the Nazis were inspired by the United States' programs of [[forced sterilization]], especially on the eugenics laws that had been enacted in [[California]].&lt;ref name="black2003"/&gt;

The [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]], enacted on July 14, 1933, allowed the compulsory sterilisation of any citizen who according to the opinion of a "Genetic Health Court" suffered from a list of alleged genetic disorders and required [[physician]]s to register every case of hereditary illness known to them, except in women over 45 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facinghistorycampus.org/campus/rm.nsf/0/81C67A69F8081A5885257037005E9C6A facinghistorycampus.org – The Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207110601/http://www.facinghistorycampus.org/campus/rm.nsf/0/81C67A69F8081A5885257037005E9C6A |date=2009-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians could be fined for failing to comply.

In 1934, the first year of the Law's operation, nearly 4,000 persons appealed against the decisions of sterilization authorities. A total of 3,559 of the appeals failed. By the end of the Nazi regime, over 200 [[Hereditary Health Court]]s ({{lang|de|Erbgesundheitsgerichte}}) were created, and under their rulings over 400,000 persons were sterilized against their will.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Proctor, ''Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1988): 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi eugenics institutions===
[[File:Hadamar 012.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Gas chamber in Hadamar]]
The [[Hadamar Clinic]] was a [[mental hospital]] in the German town of [[Hadamar]] used by the Nazi-controlled German government as the site of [[Action T4]]. The [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] was founded in 1927. [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]] was also part of the euthanasia programme where the Nazis killed individuals they deemed disabled. The first method used involved transporting patients by buses in which the engine exhaust gases were passed into the interior of the buses, and so killed the passengers. [[Gas chamber]]s were developed later and used pure [[carbon monoxide]] gas to kill the patients.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
In its early years, and during the Nazi era, the Clinic was strongly associated with theories of eugenics and racial hygiene advocated by its leading theorists [[Fritz Lenz]] and [[Eugen Fischer]], and by its director [[Otmar von Verschuer]]. Under Fischer, the sterilization of so-called [[Rhineland Bastard]]s was undertaken. [[Grafeneck Castle]] was one of Nazi Germany's killing centers, and today it is a memorial place dedicated to the victims of the Action T4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Memorialization_in_Germany_since_1945.html?hl=de&amp;id=1znCPwAACAAJ Knittel, S. "Remembering Euthanasia: Grafeneck in the Past, Present, and Future." B. Niven &amp; C. Paver &amp;#91;eds&amp;#93;.  Memorialization in Germany since 1945].  New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010: 124-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H13374, Philipp Bouhler.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Philipp Bouhler]], head of the T4 programme]]
The Law for Simplification of the Health System of July 1934 created Information Centers for Genetic and Racial Hygiene, as well as Health Offices. The law also described procedures for 'denunciation' and 'evaluation' of persons, who were then sent to a [[Genetic Health Court]] where sterilization was decided.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U-GhQrKj9vQC The Nazi census: identification and control in the Third Reich], By Götz Aly, Karl Heinz Roth, Edwin Black, Assenka Oksiloff, 2004, Temple University Press, p104&lt;/ref&gt;

Information to determine who was considered 'genetically sick' was gathered from routine information supplied by people to doctor's offices and welfare departments. Standardized questionnaires had been designed by Nazi officials with the help of [[Dehomag]] (a subsidiary of [[IBM]] in the 1930s), so that the information could be encoded easily onto [[Hollerith]] punch cards for fast sorting and counting.&lt;ref name="black1"&gt;See [[IBM and the Holocaust]] by [[Edwin Black]], 2001, Crown / Random House, pg 93-96 and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hamburg, doctors gave information into a Central Health Passport Archive (circa 1934), under something called the 'Health-Related Total Observation of Life'. This file was to contain reports from doctors, but also courts, insurance companies, sports clubs, the Hitler Youth, the military, the labor service, colleges, etc. Any institution that gave information would get information back in return. In 1940, the Reich Interior Ministry tried to impose a Hamburg-style system on the whole Reich.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U-GhQrKj9vQC The Nazi census: identification and control in the Third Reich], By Götz Aly, Karl Heinz Roth, Edwin Black, Assenka Oksiloff, 2004, Temple University Press, p104-108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi eugenics policies regarding marriage===
After the Nazis passed the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, it became compulsory for both marriage partners to be tested for [[hereditary diseases]] in order to preserve the perceived racial purity of the Aryan race. Everyone was encouraged to carefully evaluate his or her prospective marriage partner eugenically during courtship. Members of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] were cautioned to carefully interview prospective marriage partners to make sure they had no family history of hereditary disease or insanity, but to do this carefully so as not to hurt the feelings of the prospective [[fiancee]] and, if it became necessary to reject her for eugenic reasons, to do it tactfully and not cause her any offense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Padfield|Padfield, Peter]] ''Himmler'' New York:1990--Henry Holt&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''neural correlate''' of a content of [[experience]] is any bodily component, such as an electro-neuro-biological state or the state assumed by some [[biophysics|biophysical]] subsystem of the brain, whose presence necessarily and regularly correlates with such a specific content of [[experience]].

When the full [[ontology|ontological]] consistence or build-up of the reality variably called [[mind]], [[soul]], [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], or existentiality is called "[[consciousness]]" and [[Philosophy of mind|deemed to]] exclusively consist in mental contents associated with and at least partly generated by the [[Human brain|brain]] organ, the notion of [[neural correlates of consciousness|neural correlate of consciousness]]  is commonly employed. When it is only the sensations that are held to be produced by brain states, whether exclusively or not (''e.g.'', when sensations are also deemed capable of being generated by the mind reacting against itself), then the notion of '''neural correlate of a content of experience''' is commonly utilized. A mid-way concept, not always clarified, is that of a neural correlate encompassing the production of every mental content but not of consciousness itself.

== Conceptual frameworks using the notion == 
The notion of a '''neural correlate''' of a mental state is an important concept for [[materialists]], those [[List of philosophers of mind|philosophers of mind]] and researchers who believe that all mental states are equivalent to brain states. According to strict [[materialists]], all properties credited to the [[mind]], including [[consciousness]], [[emotion]], [[beliefs]], and [[motivation|desires]] have direct neural correlates.  This is also a pragmatic view adopted by a number of scholars. This view frequently depends on considering [[mind]]s exclusively as sentient knots {{citation needed|reason=This concept needs more developement|date=April 2015}} in [[nature]]'s causal net.

Instead, other [[neuroscientist]]s find minds inaugurating [[Causality|causal actions]] in nature, rather than solely being able of merely continuing previously initiated causal sequences. These neuroscientists thus describe minds as percipient agencies, the mind's very agency or causal aptitude being deemed extraneous to any neural correlate.

Still, some neurobiologists consider reasons to further assume that rememberings are not engraved in brain tissue but retained by the very mind, which thereby transforms itself in a way different from the time changes underwent by non-minds. These later neuroscientists consider that there is no neural correlate for [[episodic memory|episodal]] and some other memories, but that the mind moves the brain state (like as it may also inaugurate a finger movement) in such a way as to produce a brain state which the mind then reacts to by fleshing its selected memory again ([[Husserl]]'s ''Einfüllung''), re-imagining it. This view develops a notion by [[Aristotle]] and, again, makes no use of the notion of neural correlate for certain experiences, namely in regard to complex mental contents. It only admits neural correlates for the mind's elementary sensational reactions, which are called "intonations" (following neurobiologist Christfried Jakob, 1866-1956).

The concept of a neural correlate only encompassing the production of intonations occurs in a variety of researchers on different neurobiological traditions, including [[Scholasticism]] (see ''References''). Rather, the concept of a neural correlate encompassing the production of every mental content occurs only in a specific conceptual line of theoretical [[neuroscience]], characterized by the following features:

* Minds are sometimes viewed as incapable of positing causal acts upon self-initiated, internal modifications. This posits [[observation|observer]]s in nature as [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomenal]], unable to introduce perturbations, even less to absolutely inaugurate causal series.
* Mental contents are considered stand-alone realities, similar to any other physical reality as apples, rocks, or molecules. Such a line of opinion does not admit a difference in level between non-mental things and mental contents, namely that while things as apples and rocks do not belong with any other natural reality and thus are capable of standing alone, mental contents rather belong with a particular mind or, as sometimes called, a particular existentiality: e.g., this red is in Jane's experience whereas that red (which might be sensationally identical to Jane's) is John's experience and not Jane's at all. This distinctive feature of the contents of experience is dismissed (see Szirko's article cited in ''References''), so that the physical condition of mental contents is deemed identical to the stand-alone condition of apples and rocks.
* The relationship of a mind with the body in which it finds itself is [[plato]]nistically portrayed, so that any a mind might have found itself in any a brain-body system, like as a steerman may find himself in any ship that he chances to steer. Therefore this line of theoretical [[neuroscience]] does not admit that every mind and its particular body could intrinsically make a unity besides and apart from their causal interactions, which interactions, inasmuch as the mind is also deemed [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomenal]], reduce to bodily influences upon the mind's experiences or states.
* As a consequence, the connections of a mind and the body in which it finds itself are deemed to exclusively be of [[Causality|causal-efficient]] nature, similar to the energy supplied for a domestic appliance to function. This view entails that minds are no more than the mental contents which may be causally generated in them by their respective brains. Sentience (minds' intonability), [[semovience]] (minds' capability of inaugurating [[Causality|efficient causal actions]] on internal forces) and circumstantiation (every mind's finding itself in not another body) are thus viewed as highly problematic and their research is usually relegated.

In the conceptual line characterized by these four features, and in recent years, papers have been published on the neural correlates of [[awareness]], [[emotions]], and [[decision making]]. [[Francis Crick]] wrote a popular book "The Astonishing Hypothesis" whose thesis is that the neural correlate for consciousness lies in our nerve cells and their associated molecules.  Crick and his collaborator [[Christof Koch]] have sought to avoid philosophical debates that are associated with the study of consciousness, by emphasizing the search for "correlation" and not "causation".

There is much room for disagreement about the nature of this correlation (''e.g.'', does it require synchronous spikes of neurons in different regions of the brain? Is the co-activation of frontal or parietal areas necessary?). The philosopher [[David Chalmers]] maintains that a neural correlate of consciousness, unlike other correlates such as for memory, will fail to offer a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon.

== Laboratory studies ==

Neurophysiological studies in animals provided some insights on the neural correlates of conscious behavior. [[Vernon Mountcastle]], in the early 1960s, set up to study this set of problems, which he termed "the Mind/Brain problem", by studying the neural basis of perception in the [[somatic sensory system]]. His labs at Johns Hopkins were among the first, along with Edward V.Evarts at NIH, to record neural activity from behaving monkeys. Struck with the elegance of SS Stevens approach of magnitude estimation, Mountcastle's group discovered three different modalities of somatic sensation shared one cognitive attribute: in all cases the firing rate of peripheral neurons was linearly related to the strength of the percept elicited. More recently, Ken H. Britten, William T. Newsome, and C. Daniel Salzman have shown that in [[Visual cortex#V5.2FMT|area MT]] of monkeys, neurons respond with variability that suggests they are the basis of decision making about direction of motion. They first showed that neuronal rates are predictive of decisions using signal detection theory, and then that stimulation of these neurons could predictably bias the decision. Such studies were followed by Ranulfo Romo in the somatic sensory system, to confirm, using a different percept and brain area, that a small number of neurons in one brain area underlie perceptual decisions.

Other lab groups have followed Mountcastle's seminal work relating cognitive variables to neuronal activity with more complex cognitive tasks. Although monkeys cannot talk about their perceptions, behavioral tasks have been created in which animals made nonverbal reports, for example by producing hand movements. Many of these studies employ perceptual illusions as a way to dissociate sensations (''i.e.'', the sensory information that the brain receives) from perceptions (''i.e.'', how the consciousness interprets them). Neuronal patterns that represent perceptions rather than merely sensory input are interpreted as reflecting the neuronal correlate of consciousness.

Using such design, [[Nikos Logothetis]] and colleagues discovered perception-reflecting neurons in the temporal lobe. They created an experimental situation in which conflicting images were presented to different eyes (''i.e.'', [[binocular rivalry]]). Under such conditions, human subjects report bistable percepts: they perceive alternatively one or the other image. Logothetis and colleagues trained the monkeys to report with their arm movements which image they perceived. Temporal lobe neurons in Logothetis experiments often reflected what the monkeys' perceived. Neurons with such properties were less frequently observed in the primary visual cortex that corresponds to relatively early stages of visual processing. Another set of experiments using binocular rivalry in humans showed that certain layers of the cortex can be excluded as candidates of the neural correlate of consciousness. Logothetis and colleagues switched the images between eyes during the percept of one of the images. Surprisingly the percept stayed stable. This means that the conscious percept stayed stable and at the same time the primary input to layer 4, which is the input layer, in the visual cortex changed. Therefore layer 4 can not be a part of the neural correlate of consciousness. [[Attention versus memory in prefrontal cortex|Mikhail Lebedev]] and their colleagues observed a similar phenomenon in monkey prefrontal cortex. In their experiments monkeys reported the perceived direction of visual stimulus movement (which could be an illusion) by making eye movements. Some prefrontal cortex neurons represented actual and some represented perceived displacements of the stimulus. Observation of perception related neurons in prefrontal cortex is consistent with the theory of [[Christof Koch]] and [[Francis Crick]] who postulated that neural correlate of consciousness resides in prefrontal cortex. Proponents of distributed neuronal processing may likely dispute the view that consciousness has a precise localization in the brain.

== Of cognitive variables ==

In addition to neural correlate of consciousness in general, much progress has been made in elucidating neural correlates of specific cognitive variables.  Thus, Earl Miller and colleagues discovered prefrontal cortex neurons that represent perceptual categories (cats versus dogs in their experiments). The work of Richard Andersen, Steven Wise, Carl Olson, Jun Tanji, Apostolos Georgopoulos and other neuroscientists has illuminated neuronal correlates of [[motor planning]], selective visual attention, motor sequences and spatial reference frames in which these entities are represented by brain cells. The progress in understanding neuronal correlates of motor planning has led to the creation of [[brain-machine interface]] so, the devices that translate neuronal activity into purposeful commands to artificial actuators.

A large number of studies have addressed the problem of neural correlates of mental representations in human subjects. For example,  functional neuroimaging have shown that parts of the cortex are still active in vegetative patients that are presumed to be unconscious (Laureys, Trends Cogn Sci, 2005, 9:556-559). However, these areas appear to be functionally disconnected from associative cortical areas whose activity is needed for awareness.

'''''Parable of the Polygons''''' is a 2014 interactive [[blog]] post created by [[Vi Hart]] and [[Game design|game developer]] Nicky Case. The article focuses on a society of blue squares and yellow triangles which have slight personal biases against diversity, which leads to social segregation. It is based on [[game theory|game theorist]] [[Thomas Schelling]]'s papers about [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]]. The article was well-received, especially its visual and playable aspects, and was called a useful educational tool for topics like [[racial segregation]].

The article is an interactive [[blog]] post, "part story and part game".&lt;ref name="startribune2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt; It has a model consisting of a society of blue squares and yellow triangles, presented in a grid.&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt; At the top of the article, a crowd of triangles and squares are wiggling.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Just under, it says, "This is a story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world."&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; The article first demonstrates step-by-step how [[systemic bias|institutional bias]] can occur even when there is little personal bias against diversity, and individuals are well-intentioned.&lt;ref name="cjr2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; The article describes the squares and triangles as "slightly shapist".&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt; In the first example, a square or triangle is happy only if at least a third of its neighbors are of the same shape as it is.&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt; The shapes merely adopt a [[meh]] face in a homogeneous neighborhood.&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt; 

At this point, the article lets the reader interact with the model.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; The reader's goal is to make all residents happy with where they live, by moving only unhappy shapes.&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt; At first, the bias is easily managed; however, as the population grows, the shapes' bias quickly leads to visually segregated areas.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; The article reads: "Sometimes a neighborhood just becomes square, and it's not their fault if no triangles wanna stick around. And a triangular neighborhood would welcome a square, but they can't help it if squares ain't interested."&lt;ref name="wapo2014" /&gt; 

The reader can later execute automated simulations, and increase and decrease the shapes' bias.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mnn2014" /&gt; When the bias is increased, the segregation is more prominent.&lt;ref name="citylab2014" /&gt; A subsequent iteration of the game shows that decreasing bias does not make a difference if the population started out segregated.&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Shapes then have to reject the default scenario of segregation in favor of seeking out the other shapes.&lt;ref name="startribune2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Finally, the reader can generate new models using a sandbox.&lt;ref name="cjr2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; 

The article departs from Schelling's work by discussing a demand for "even the smallest bit of diversity" which reverses [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]]; Case said that the article teaches that such segregation is "easily offset" with a "small amount of anti-bias", even if bias is still present.&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; The article also departs from Schelling by concluding with encouraging words on how to enact change.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; The article concludes with: "If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life – that's unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors."&lt;ref name="bustle2015" /&gt;

== Development and release ==
[[Vi Hart]] and Nicky Case, creator of ''[[Coming Out Simulator 2014]]'', teamed up following a talk on the lack of tech event diversity and [[women in STEM]] delivered by Hart, which convinced Case "of the necessity of active measures".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; The article applies ideas from [[game theory|game theorist]] and economist [[Thomas Schelling]]'s 1978 paper ''Micromotives and Macrobehaviour'' which describes how small personal [[bias]] against diversity leads to greater segregation in the general population.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; It is also based on Schelling's 1971 paper ''Dynamic Models of Segregation''.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; 

Case described Schelling's model as "perfect – simple and fun to play";&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Schelling played his own model on a chess board or graph paper with nickels and dimes, moving them one by one.&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo2014" /&gt; Case said that he was "fascinated with taking models/systems from the arts [and] humanities, and translating them into game models/systems".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; The second part of the article was based on a "new surprising aspect of Schelling's model", which introduced a nonconformity bias.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that by playing around with variables, they found that "just as a ''small'' bias can turn a society segregated, a ''small'' anti-bias can reverse that".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Hart said they knew that nonconformity would mix up the population, but that they were "pleasantly surprised to see it work even [at a] very minimum level".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that the article ends on an "optimistic note" that "small local changes really can change institutions from the bottom-up".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Development of the article began in September 2014.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;

The goal of ''Parable of the Polygons'' was for readers to "learn to demand diversity".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; People are represented by abstract shapes because marking their races and genders would be "really weird" and "have the unfortunate implication that [the races and genders] are binary and immutable".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; A triangle was chosen because it appears in Hart's videos.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; The article contains few words, and the ability to move shapes is introduced "slowly and deliberately".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Hart said that they felt that "it was important to start with moving the shapes by hand, so that later when shapes move automatically [the reader would know] there's nothing going on behind [their] back".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;  The article provides readers with interactive sections governed by simple rules to help them prove the counter-intuitive results to themselves.&lt;ref name="blog2015" /&gt; Case said that there was "an effort made to keep players from being scared off by the big stuff"; thus, the article includes jokes, slang, and "cute and friendly shapes".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Hart said that they wanted to make sure to explain systemic bias without changing the readers' "minds".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that a main message was "[not to] take it personally" because "large collective bias can exist even with small individual bias".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;

The article was released in December 2014; Hart noted that "matters of systematic bias [were] even more topical [at the moment]",&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; and Case said, "There's a huge gap between the racial proportions of the police force and the neighborhoods they're policing, that both reinforces and results from racial tensions."&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; Case said that Schelling's models could be identified in that "a black officer [had led] the police force one night" amidst the [[Ferguson unrest]].&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; A remixed version which includes a green pentagon was made the same year and is featured at the bottom of the article.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Hart described the reaction to the article as "more positive than anything [Hart's] ever done" and "almost disturbingly eerie".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said: "It's been surprisingly positive and polite, especially for something that touches on a touchy subject!"&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Hart said that they planned to "tweak some stuff after release", but did not because the reception was "so overwhelmingly positive".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that the article was doing "shockingly well", so any fixes "might weaken or confuse the message" when applied.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The critical reception for the article was overwhelmingly positive. Joanna Rothkopf of [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']] called the article "an adorable and eloquent primer on issues of segregation".&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt; ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]''{{'s}} Chava Gourarie described the article as "a cute, engaging, playable explanation".&lt;ref name="cjr2016" /&gt; Aatish Bhatia of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] described the design and characters as "charming" and "delightfully animated".&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;

The playable aspect of the article received praise. ''[[Kill Screen]]''{{'s}} Jess Joho wrote, "''Parable of the Polygons'' asks you to tackle Schelling's concepts in a way only a game could."&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;
Bhatia called the article "a truly interactive way of communicating an idea".&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;
Jesse Singal of [[New York (magazine)|''The Cut'']] called the article "a really well-done use of the web".&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt;

Singal noted the article's parallels to human behavior.&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt;
Bhatia said that the article delivers an "effective, lucid and very relevant" lesson on real-world segregation, race and equality.&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;
Laura Moss of ''[[Mother Nature Network]]'' said that it "accurately illustrates [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] neighborhoods", and noted that the article illustrates "Schelling's three major findings": the effect of slight individual bias, the starting game state and the reluctancy to become more diverse, and the necessity of intervention "in creating and maintaining diversity".&lt;ref name="mnn2014" /&gt;
Joho said that "demonstrating a difficult reality while still maintaining a sense of actionable hope" was the article's "greatest achievement by far".&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;

''[[Gamasutra]]''{{'s}} Phill Cameron praised the article for using triangles and squares and effectively dissociating itself from "the prejudices of real life".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;
Bhatia said that the article does not get "embroiled in a heated political debate".&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;
Joho wrote that the article is "careful not to throw blame around", and that it constantly emphasizes that personal biases might be "unexamined, unintentional, or even unconscious".&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;
''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'s}} Ana Swanson said that the call to action is a "powerful" message.&lt;ref name="wapo2014" /&gt;
[[Polygon (website)|''Polygon'']]{{'s}} Megan Farokhmanesh wrote, "Half game, half informational post, ''Parable of the Polygons'' wants to encourage people to talk about topics like racism and sexism in healthy, constructive ways."&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;

Amanda Montañez wrote in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' blog that the shapes assume that "their individual preference for diversity is sufficient to propel their society toward integration", but that "the social system in which they operate prohibits it".&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Montañez said that "true progress requires a more active, dramatic shift than expected" and that, in the article, "the complacent squares and triangles must abandon their preconceptions about the nature of 'shapism' and adopt a new, activist stance on integration".&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Montañez compared the idea of using two-dimensional geometric shapes to represent people to the 1884 illustrated novella ''[[Flatland]]'' by [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]].&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt;

'''The philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]''' has been a major influence in the development of [[20th-century philosophy]], especially [[existentialism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Kierkegaard was a 19th-century Danish philosopher who has been called the "Father of Existentialism".&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alister E.  ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Thought''. Blackwell Publishing, 1993. p 202&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy also influenced the development of [[existential psychology]].&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;Matustik, M. J. and M. Westphal (eds). ''Kierkegaard in Post/Modernity'', Indiana University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-253-20967-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard criticized aspects of the philosophical systems that were brought on by philosophers such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] before him and the Danish [[Hegelianism|Hegelians]]. He was also indirectly influenced by the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name="Kant"&gt;Green, Ronald M. ''Kierkegaard and Kant: The Hidden Debt''. SUNY Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-7914-1107-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He measured himself against the model of philosophy which he found in [[Socrates]], which aims to draw one's attention not to explanatory systems, but rather to the issue of how one exists.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'': "''Socrates' infinite merit is to have been an ''existing'' thinker, not a speculative philosopher who forgets what it means to exist… The infinite merit of the Socratic position was precisely to accentuate the fact that the knower is an existing individual, and that the task of existing is his essential task.''" Swenson/Lowrie translation (1941), pp. 184-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Kierkegaard's recurrent themes is the importance of subjectivity, which has to do with the way people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', he argues that "subjectivity is truth" and "truth is subjectivity." What he means by this is that most essentially, truth is not just a matter of discovering objective facts. While objective facts are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.&lt;ref name="Hong"&gt;Hong, Howard V. and Edna H. "Subjectivity/Objectivity." ''Søren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers''. Vol. 4. Indiana University Press, 1975, pp. 712-13. {{ISBN|0-253-18243-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note on pseudonyms==
{{see also|Søren Kierkegaard#Indirect_communication_and_pseudonymous_authorship|l1=Indirect Communication and Pseudonymous Authorship}}
Many of Kierkegaard's earlier writings from 1843 to 1846 were written pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'', he explained that the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is ''Anti-Climacus'', a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of ''The Point of View'': Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.&lt;ref name="Journals"&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren.

Because the pseudonymous authors write from perspectives which are not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy mentioned in this article may or may not necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, ''Johannes Climacus'' is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. ''Anti-Climacus'', as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.&lt;ref name="Journals"/&gt;

Most of Kierkegaard's later philosophical and religious writings from 1846 to 1855 were written and authored by himself, and he assigned no pseudonyms to these works. Subsequently, these works are considered by most scholars to reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs.&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard''.

==Themes in his philosophy==

===Alienation===
[[Social alienation|Alienation]] is a term philosophers apply to a wide variety of phenomena, including any feeling of separation from, and discontent with, society; feeling that there is a moral breakdown in society; feelings of powerlessness in the face of the solidity of social institutions; the impersonal, dehumanised nature of large-scale and bureaucratic social organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06 Dictionary of the History of Ideas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard recognizes and accepts the notion of alienation, although he phrases it and understands it in his own distinctly original terms. For Kierkegaard, the present age is a reflective age—one that values objectivity and thought over action, lip-service to ideals rather than action, discussion over action, publicity and advertising over reality, and fantasy over the real world. For Kierkegaard, the meaning of values has been removed from life, by lack of finding any true and legitimate authority. Instead of falling into any claimed authority, any "literal" sacred book or any other great and lasting voice, self-aware humans must confront an existential uncertainty.

Humanity has lost meaning because the accepted criterion of reality and truth is ambiguous and subjective thought—that which cannot be proven with [[logic]], historical research, or [[scientific analysis]]. Humans cannot think out choices in life, we must live them; and even those choices that we often think about become different once life itself enters into the picture. For Kierkegaard, the type of objectivity that a scientist or historian might use misses the point—humans are not motivated and do not find meaning in life through pure objectivity. Instead, they find it through passion, desire, and moral and religious commitment. These phenomena are not objectively provable—nor do they come about through any form of analysis of the external world; they come about through a direct relationship between one and the external world. Here Kierkegaard's emphasis is on relationship rather than analysis. This relationship is a way of looking at one’s life that evades objective scrutiny. 

Kierkegaard's analysis of the present age uses terms that resemble but are not exactly coincident with Hegel and [[Marx's theory of alienation]]. However Kierkegaard expressly means that human beings are alienated from God because they are living too much in the world. Individuals need to [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843#To Gain One’s Soul In Patience|gain their souls]] from the world because it actually belongs to God. Kierkegaard has no interest in external battles as [[Karl Marx]] does. His concern is about the inner fight for faith.{{Quotation|Let us speak further about the wish and thereby about sufferings. Discussion of sufferings can always be beneficial if it addresses not only the self-willfulness of the sorrow but, if possible, addresses the sorrowing person for his upbuilding. It is a legitimate and sympathetic act to dwell properly on the suffering, lest the suffering person become impatient over our superficial discussion in which he does not recognize his suffering, lest he for that reason impatiently thrust aside consolation and be strengthened in double-mindedness. It certainly is one thing to go out into life with the wish when what is wished becomes the deed and the task; it is something else to go out into life away from the wish.

Abraham had to leave his ancestral home an emigrate to an alien nation, where nothing reminded him of what he loved – indeed, sometimes it is no doubt a consolation that nothing calls to mind what one wishes to forget, but it is a bitter consolation for the person who is full of longing. Thus a person can also have a wish that for him contains everything, so that in the hour of the separation, when the pilgrimage begins, it is as if he were emigrating to a foreign country where nothing but the contrast reminds him, by the loss, of what he wished; it can seem to him as if he were emigrating to a foreign country even if he remains at home perhaps in the same locality – by losing the wish just as among strangers, so that to take leave of the wish seems to him harder and more crucial than to take leave of his senses.

Apart from this wish, even if he still does not move from the spot, his life’s troublesome way is perhaps spent in useless sufferings, for we are speaking of those who suffer essentially, not of those who have the consolation that their sufferings are for the benefit of a good cause, for the benefit of others. It was bound to be thus – the journey to the foreign country was not long; in one moment he was there, there in that strange country where the suffering ones meet, but not those who have ceased to grieve, not those whose tears eternity cannot wipe away, for as an old devotional book so simply and movingly says, “How can God dry your tears in the next world if you have not wept?” Perhaps someone else comes in a different way, but to the same place. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993 pp. 102-103}}

[[Albert Camus]] wrote about the idea of being a stranger in the world but reversed Kierkegaard's meaning. A [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|stranger]] for Camus was someone living in the world who is forced to exist in a Christian way even though the individual does not want to be a Christian. But Kierkegaard was discussing the Christian who wants to be a Christian living in a world that has abandoned Christianity. Both Camus and Kierkegaard had in common an equal distaste for a Christian Democracy where all are forced to take a positive part in Christianity because freedom of choice would be lacking and in a non-Christian Democracy where none are allowed to take an active part in Christianity. Kierkegaard was against voting about Christianity, for him, Christ was the only authority. Camus called "the existential attitude philosophical suicide." This is how he put it in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus|The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Writings]]'' {{Quotation|Now, it is admitted that the absurd is the contrary of hope, it is seen that existential thought for [[Lev Shestov|Chestov]] (Lev Shestov 1866-1938) presupposes the absurd but proves it only to dispel it. Such subtlety of thought is a conjuror's emotional trick. When Chestov elsewhere sets his absurd in opposition to current morality and reason, he calls it truth and redemption. Hence, there is basically in that definition of the absurd an approbation that Chestov grants it. What is perceptible in Leo Chestov will be perhaps even more so in Kierkegaard. To be sure, it is hard to outline clear propositions in so elusive a writer. But, despite apparently opposed writings, beyond the pseudonyms, the tricks, and the smiles, can be felt throughout that work, as it were, the presentiment (at the same time as the apprehension) of a truth which eventually bursts forth in the last works: Kierkegaard likewise takes the leap. Kierkegaard’s view that despair is not a fact but a state: the very state of sin. For sin is what alienates from God. The absurd, which is the metaphysical state of the consciousness of man, does not lead to God. Perhaps this notion will become clearer if I risk this shocking statement: the absurd is sin without God. It is a matter of living in that state of the absurd. I am taking the liberty at this point of calling the existential attitude philosophical suicide. But this does not imply a judgment. It is a convenient way of indicating the movement by which a thought negates itself and tends to transcend itself in its very negation. For the existential negation is their God. To be precise, that god is maintained only through the negation of human reason. (Let me assert again: it is not the affirmation of God that is questioned here, but rather the logic leading to that affirmation.) Albert Camus, ''The Myth of Sisyphus and other essays'' p. 26-32 Vintage books 1955 Alfred A Knopf}}

Kierkegaard put it this way in ''Three Edifying Discourses'' 1843 and ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' (1846). {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;Getting the majority vote on one’s side and one’s God-relationship transformed into a speculative enterprise on the basis of probability and partnership and fellow shareholders is the first step toward becoming objective.
*''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 66.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The love which covers a multitude of sins in never deceived. When the heart is niggardly, when one gives with one eye and with seven eyes looks to see what one will get in return, then one easily discovers a multitude of sins. But when the heart is filled with love, then the eye is never deceived; for love when it gives, does not scrutinize the gift, but its eye is fixed on the Lord. When the heart is filled with envy, then the eye has power to call forth uncleanness even in the pure; but when love dwells in the heart, then the eye has the power to foster the good in the unclean; but this eye does not see the evil but the pure, which it loves and encourages it by loving it. Certainly there is a power in this world which by its words turns good into evil, put there is a power above which turns the evil into good; that power is the love which covers a multitude of sins.

When hate dwells in the heart, then sin lies at a man’s door, and its manifold desires exist in him; but when love dwells in the heart, then sin flees far away, and he sees it no more. When disputes, malice, wrath, quarrels, dissensions, factions fill the heart, does one then need to go far in order to discover the multitudinousness of sin, or does a man need to love very long to produce these outside of himself! But when joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance dwell in the heart, what wonder, then, that a man, even if he were surrounded by a multitude of sins, remains an alien, a stranger, who understands only a very little about the customs of the country, even if these were explained to him? Would not this, then, be a covering of the multitude of sins?
* Soren Kierkegaard ''Three Edifying Discourses'' 1843, Swenson translation 1943 p. 69.

Love does not seek its own. Love does not seek its own, for there are no mine and yours in love. But "mine" and "yours" are only relational specifications of "one's own"; thus, if there are no mine and yours, there is no "one's own" either. But if there is no "one's own" at all, then it is of course impossible to seek one's own. Justice is identified by its giving each his own, just as it also in turn claims its own. This means that justice pleads the cause of its own, divides and assigns, determines what each can lawfully call his own, judges and punishes if anyone refuses to make any distinction between mine and yours. The individual has the right to so as he pleases with this contentious and yet legally entitled mine; and if he seeks his own in no other way than that which justice allows, justice has nothing with which to reproach him and has no right to upbraid him for anything. As soon as someone is defrauded of his own, or as soon as someone defrauds another of his own, justice intervenes, because it safeguards the common security in which everyone has his own, which he rightfully has.-But sometimes a change intrudes, a revolution, a war, an earthquake, or some such terrible misfortune, and everything is confused. Justice tries in vain to secure for each person his own; it cannot maintain the distinction between mine and yours; in the confusion it cannot keep the balance and therefore throws away the scales-it despairs! Terrible spectacle! Yet does not love in a certain sense, even if in the most blissful way, produce the same confusion? But love, it too is an event, the greatest of all, yet also the happiest. Love is a change, the most remarkable of all, but the most desirable-in fact we say in a very good sense that someone who is gripped by love is changed or becomes changed. Love is a revolution, the most profound of all, but the most blessed! 
* Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', 1847, Hong 1995 pp. 264-265}}

===Abstraction===
An element of Kierkegaard's critique of modernity in his socio-political work, ''[[Two Ages]]'', is the mention of [[money]] — which he calls an [[abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''The Two Ages'', trans. Howard and Edna Hong. Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-07226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Robert L. ''Two Ages: International Kierkegaard Commentary''. Mercer University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-86554-081-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abstraction is something that only has a reality in an [[ersatz]] reality. It is not tangible, and only has meaning within an artificial context, which ultimately serves devious and deceptive purposes. It is a figment of thought that has no [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] reality, neither now nor in the future.

How is money an abstraction? Money gives the illusion that it has a direct relationship to the work that is done. That is, the work one does is worth so much, equals so much money. In reality, however, the work one does is an expression of who one is as a person; it expresses one's goals in life and associated meaning. As a person, the work one performs is supposed to be an external realization of one's relationship to others and to the world. It is one's way of making the world a better place for oneself and for others. What reducing work to a monetary value does is to replace the concrete reality of one's everyday struggles with the world —to give it shape, form and meaning— with an abstraction. Kierkegaard lamented that "a young man today would scarcely envy another his capacities or skill or the love of a beautiful girl or his fame, no, but he would envy him his money. Give me money, the young man will say, and I will be all right."&lt;ref&gt;''Two Ages'', p.75, Hong translation.&lt;/ref&gt; But Kierkegaard thinks this emphasis on money leads to a denial of the gifts of the spirit to those who are poor and in misery. {{Quotation|Do not forget to do good and to share – Hebrews 13.16 - But do not forget either that this incessant talk by worldliness about beneficence and benevolence and generosity and charitable donations and gift upon gift is almost merciless. Ah, let the newspaper writers and tax collectors and parish beadles talk about generosity and count and count; but let us never ignore that Christianity speaks essentially of mercifulness, that Christianity would least of all be guilty of mercilessness, as if poverty and misery not only needed money etc. but also were excluded from the highest, from being able to be generous, beneficent, benevolent. But people prattle and prate ecclesiastically-worldly and worldly-ecclesiastically about generosity, beneficence-but forget, even in the sermon, mercifulness. Preaching should indeed be solely and only about mercifulness. If you know how to speak effectually about this, then generosity will follow of itself and come by itself accordingly as the individual is capable of it. But bear in mind, that if a person raised money, money, money by speaking about generosity-bear this in mind, that by being silent about mercifulness he would be acting mercilessly toward the poor and miserable person for whom he procured relief by means of the money of wealthy generosity. Bear this I mind, that if poverty and misery disturb us with their pleas, we can of course manage to get help for them through generosity; but bear this in mind, that it would be much more appalling if we constrained poverty and misery “to hinder our prayers,” as Scripture says (1 Peter 3:7), by grumbling against us to God-because we were atrociously unfair to poverty and misery by not telling that they are able to practice mercifulness. We shall now adhere to this point in this discourse about mercifulness and guard ourselves against confusing mercifulness with what is linked to external conditions, that is, what love as such does not have in its power, whereas it truly has mercifulness in its power just as surely as it has a heart in its bosom. It does not follow that because a person has a heart in his bosom he has money in his pocket, but the first is still more important and certainly is decisive with regard to mercifulness. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' Hong 1995 pp. 315-316}}

Below are three quotes concerning Kierkegaard's idea of abstraction which cannot be thought about without thinking about concretion. He moves from the world historical, the general, to the single individual, the specific. The first from the esthete and the second from the ethicist in ''Either/Or'' and the third from the book that explained all his previous works; ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]''.{{Quotation|As has already been noted above, all [[classic]] productions stand equally high, because each one stands infinitely high. If, despite this fact, one were to attempt to introduce an order of rank into the classic procession, one would evidently have to choose as a basis for such a distinction, something that was not essential; for if the basis were essential, the difference itself would become an essential difference; from that it would again follow that the word "classic" was wrongly predicated of the group as a whole. The more abstract the idea is, the smaller the probability of a numerous representation. But how does the idea become concrete? By being permeated with the [[historical]] [[consciousness]]. The more concrete the idea, the greater the probability. The more abstract the medium, the smaller the probability; the more concrete, the greater. But what does it mean to say that the medium is concrete, other than to say it is language, or is seen in approximation to language; for language is the most concrete of all media. The idea, for example, which comes to expression in sculpture is wholly abstract, and bears no relation to the historical; the medium through which it is expressed is likewise abstract, consequently there is a great probability that the section of the classic works which includes sculpture will contain only a few. In this I have the testimony of time and experience on my side. If, on the other hand, I take a concrete idea and a concrete medium, then it seems otherwise. [[Homer]] is indeed a classic [[poet]], but just because the epic idea is a concrete idea, and because the medium is language, it so happens that in the section of the classics which contains the epic, there are many epics conceivable, which are all equally classic, because history constantly furnishes us with new epic material. In this too, I have the testimony of history and the assent of experience. ''Either/Or Part I'', Swenson p. 49, 53}}  {{Quotation|The two positions touched on here could be regarded as attempts to actualize an ethical life-view. The reason that they do not succeed is that the individual has chosen himself in his isolation or has chosen himself abstractly. To say it in other words, the individual has not chosen himself [[ethics|ethically]]. He therefore has no connection with [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|actuality]], and when that is the case no ethical way of life can be put into practice. But the person who chooses himself ethically chooses himself concretely as this specific individual, and he achieves this concretion because this choice is identical with the [[repentance]], which ratifies the [[choice]]. The individual with these capacities, these inclinations, these drives, these passions, influenced by this specific social milieu, as this specific product of a specific [[Social environment|environment]]. But as he becomes aware of all this, he takes upon himself [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for all of it. He does not hesitate over whether he will take this particular thing or not, for he knows that if he does not do it something much more important will be lost. In the moment of choice, he is in complete isolation, for he withdraws from his social milieu, and yet at the same moment he is in absolute continuity, for he chooses himself as a product. And this choice is freedom’s choice in such a way that in choosing himself as product he can just as well be said to produce himself. At the moment of choice, he is at the point of consummation, for his personality is consummating itself, and yet at the same moment he is at the very beginning, because he is choosing himself according to his freedom. Either/Or Part II, Hong p. 251}}{{Quotation|When in pure thinking mention is made of an immediate unity of reflection-in-itself and reflection-in-the-other and of the annulment of this immediate unity, then something must indeed come between the elements of the immediate unity. What is this? Yes, it is time. But time cannot be assigned a place within pure thinking. What, then, do annulment and transition and a new unity signify? What, if anything, does it mean to think in such a way that one always merely makes a show of it because everything that is said is absolutely revoked? And what does it mean not to admit that one thinks this way but then continually to proclaim from the housetops the positive truth of this pure thinking? Just as existence has joined thinking and existing, inasmuch as an existing person is a thinking person, so are there two media: the medium of abstraction and the medium of actuality. But pure thinking is yet a third medium, very recently invented. It begins, it is said, after the most exhaustive abstraction. Pure thinking is-what shall I say-piously or thoughtlessly unaware of the relation that abstraction still continually has to that from which it abstracts. Here in this pure thinking there is rest for every doubt; here is the eternal positive truth and whatever one cares to say. This means that pure thinking is a phantom. And if Hegelian philosophy is free from all postulates, it has attained this with one insane postulate: the beginning of pure thinking. For the existing person, existing is for him his highest interest, and his interestedness in existing in his actuality. What actuality is cannot be rendered in the language of abstraction. Actuality is an ''inter-esse'' [between being] between thinking and being in the hypothetical unity of abstraction. Abstraction deals with possibility and actuality, but its conception of actuality is a false rendition, since the medium is not actuality but possibility. Only by annulling actuality can abstraction grasp it, but to annul it is precisely to change it into possibility. Within abstraction everything that is said about actuality in the language of abstraction is said within possibility. That is, in the language of actuality all abstraction is related to actuality as a possibility, not to an actuality within abstraction and possibility. Actuality, existence, is the dialectical element in a trilogy, the beginning and end of which cannot be for an existing person, who ''qua'' existing is in the [[dialectic]]al element. Abstraction merges the trilogy. Quite right. But how does it do it? Is abstraction a something that does it, or is it not the act of the abstractor? But the abstractor is, after all, an existing person, and as an existing person is consequently in the dialectical element, which he cannot mediate or merge, least of all absolutely, as long as he is existing. If he does do it, then this must be related as a possibility to actuality, to the existence which he himself is. He must explain how he goes about it-that is, how he as an existing person goes about it, or whether he ceases to be an existing person, and whether an existing person has a right to do that. As soon as we begin to ask such questions, we are asking ethically and are maintaining the claim of the ethical upon the existing person, which cannot be that he is supposed to abstract from existence, but that he is supposed to exist, which is also the existing person’s highest interest. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Vol 1, pp. 314-315 Hong translation}}

===Death===
[[Death]] is inevitable and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact in order to live passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'', Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, "I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend."&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong 1992 p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his [[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is going to decide which life was easier, whether it was the life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death?&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dread or anxiety===
For Kierkegaard's author, ''Vigilius Haufniensis'', [[anxiety]]/[[Existential dread|dread]]/[[angst]] (depending on the translation and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses the example of a man standing on the edge of a tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our "dizziness of freedom."&lt;blockquote&gt;Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]] becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, [[anxiety]] is the dizziness of [[Free will|freedom]], which emerges when the spirit wants to [[wikt:Special:Search/posit#Verb|posit]] the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, [[psychology]] cannot and will not go. In that very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the [[leap of faith|leap]], which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as [[ambiguous]]ly guilty as it is possible to become. Vigilius Haufniensis, ''The Concept of Anxiety'' p. 61.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'', Haufniensis focuses on the first anxiety experienced by man: [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts of good and evil did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, which is now dubbed [[original sin]], Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was evil. What he did know was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety comes from the fact that God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin, and it is anxiety that leads Adam to sin. Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin.

However, Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is a way for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. ([[Jean-Paul Sartre]] calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.
{{Quotation|Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate. … Anxiety is freedom’s possibility, and only such anxiety is through faith absolutely educative, because it consumes all finite ends and discovers all their deceptiveness. And no [[Tomás de Torquemada|Grand Inquisitor]] has such dreadful torments in readiness as anxiety has, and no secret agent knows as cunningly as anxiety to attack his suspect in his weakest moment or to make alluring the trap in which he will be caught, and no discerning judge understands how to interrogate and examine the accused as does anxiety, which never lets the accused escape, neither through amusement, nor by noise, nor during work, neither by day nor by night.|Vigilius Haufniensis|The Concept of Anxiety pp. 155-156.}}

===Despair===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
{{Quotation|Is despair a merit or a defect? Purely dialectically it is both. If one were to think of despair only in the abstract, without reference to some particular despairer, one would have to say it is an enormous merit. The possibility of this sickness is man’s advantage over the beast, and it is an advantage which characterizes him quite otherwise than the upright posture, for it bespeaks the infinite erectness or loftiness of his being spirit. The possibility of this sickness is man’s advantage over the beast; to be aware of this sickness is the Christian’s advantage over natural man; to be cured of this sickness is the Christian’s blessedness. |Anti-Climacus|The Sickness Unto Death p. 45}}

Most emphatically in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'', Kierkegaard's author argues that the human self is a composition of various aspects that must be brought into conscious balance: the finite, the infinite, a consciousness of the "relationship of the two to itself," and a consciousness of "the power that posited" the self. The finite (limitations such as those imposed by one's body or one's concrete circumstances) and the infinite (those capacities that free us from limitations such as imagination) always exist in a state of tension. That tension between two aspects of the "self" that must be brought into balance. When the self is out of balance, i.e., has the wrong understanding of who it is because it conceives itself too much in terms of its own limiting circumstances (and thus fails to recognize its own freedom to determine what it will be) or too much in terms of what it would like to be, (thus ignoring its own circumstances), the person is in a state of [[Existential despair|despair]]. Notably, Anti-Climacus says one can be in despair even if one feels perfectly happy. Despair is not just an emotion, in a deeper sense it is the loss of self, i.e., it describes the state when one has the wrong conception of oneself.
In ''[[Either/Or]]'', ''A'' and ''Judge William'' each has one [[epistolary novel]] in two volumes. The ''A'' is an aesthete well aware that he can use the power of interpretation to define who he is and what he takes to be valuable. He knows he can shape and reshape his own self-identity. Nothing binds him to his relationships. Nothing binds him to his past actions. In the end though, he also knows he lacks a consistent understanding of who he is. He lacks a self that resists his own power of reinterpretation. His older friend ''Judge William,'' argues that a deeper concept of selfhood is discovered as one commits to one's actions, and takes ownership of the past and present. A concept of oneself, as this particular human being, begins to take form in one's own consciousness.
Another perspective, one in which an individual can find some measure of freedom from despair, is available for the person with religious "faith." This attunes the individual so that he or she can recognize what has always been there: a self to be realized within the circumstances it finds itself right now, i.e., this inner attunement brings about a sort of synthesis between the infinite and the finite.
In ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', ''Johannes de Silentio'' argues that the choice of [[Abraham]] to obey the private, unethical, commandment of God to sacrifice his son reveals what faith entails: he directs his consciousness absolutely toward "the absolute" rather than the merely ethical, i.e., he practices an inner spirituality that seeks to be "before god" rather than seeking to understand himself as an ethically upright person. His God requires more than being good, he demands that he seek out an inner commitment to him. If Abraham were to blithely obey, his actions would have no meaning. It is only when he acts ''with fear and trembling'' that he demonstrates a full awareness that murdering a son is absolutely wrong, ethically speaking.

Despair has several specific levels that a person can find themselves, each one further in despair than the last as laid out in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''.

The first level is "The despair that is ignorant of being despair or the despairing ignorance of having a self and an eternal self." Essentially this level is one which has the wrong conception of what a self is, i.e., is ignorant of how to realize the self one already potentially is. In this sense, the person does not recognize his own despair because he often measures the success of his life based on whether he himself judges himself to be happy. Regardless of whether you know you are in despair or not, Kierkegaard asserts, you can still be in that state. He notes that this is the most common in the world.

The next level of despair is "The despair that is conscious of being despair and therefore is conscious of having a self in which there is something eternal and then either in despair does not will to be itself or in despair wills to be itself." This becomes further subdivided into three categories: the despair not to will or want to be oneself, the despair not to will to be a self, and lowest, the despair to wish for a new self. These three divisions are mostly the self-worth the person has and the amount to which they understand their own despair. The despair to not be oneself is pretty straightforward. A person sees themself as unworthy and as such does not see themself as worthy before something they do not understand. The despair not to be a self is deeper, because to not wish to be a self is to wish to not have a relation to God or at the very least see one's relation to God as unworthy, and thus shrink from it. The lowest form of this group, however, is the desire to be a new self. This is logically the deepest form as it assumes the deepest understanding of one's despair. Once in despair, without a complete relation to God one will always be in despair, so to be in this level one understands the permanence of the despair. The despair in this group arises from the nature of sensate things and physical desires. These three sub groups are also grouped under the heading "Despair over the earthly."

The second level of conscious despair under the heading "Despair over the eternal." Someone in this level views themself in light of their own weakness. Unlike in the upper level, this weakness is understood and as such, instead of turning to faith and humbling oneself before God, they despair in their own weakness and unworthiness. In this sense, they despair over the eternal and refuse to be comforted by the light of God.

The last and lowest form of despair is the desire "In despair to will to be oneself." This last form of despair is also referred to by Kierkegaard as "demonic despair" (Note that the term demonic is used in the Classical Greek Sense, not the modern sense). In this form of despair, the individual finds him or herself in despair, understands they are in despair, seeks some way to alleviate it, and yet no help is forthcoming. As a result, the self becomes hardened against any form of help and "Even if God in heaven and all the angels offered him aid, he would not want it." At this level of despair the individual revels in their own despair and sees their own pain as lifting them up above the base nature of other humans who do not find themselves in this state. This is the least common form of despair and Kierkegaard claims it is mostly found in true poets. This despair can also be called the despair of defiance, as it is the despair that strikes out against all that is eternal. One last note is that as one travels further down the forms of despair, the number of people in each group becomes fewer.

===Ethics===
[[File:Abraham.jpg|250px|right|thumb|In [[Fear and Trembling]], Johannes de Silentio analyzes [[Abraham]]'s action to sacrifice [[Isaac]].  Silentio argues that Abraham is a knight of faith.]]
Many philosophers who initially read Kierkegaard, especially Kierkegaard's (written under the pseudonym of ''Johannes de Silentio'') ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', often come to the conclusion that Kierkegaard supports a [[divine command theory|divine command]] law of ethics. The divine command theory is a [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] theory which claims moral values are whatever is commanded by a god or gods. However, Kierkegaard is not arguing that morality is created by [[God]]; instead, he would argue that a divine command from God ''transcends'' ethics. This distinction means that God does not necessarily create human morality: it is up to us as individuals to create our own morals and values. But any religious person must be prepared for the event of a divine command from God that would take precedence over all moral and rational obligations. Kierkegaard called this event the ''[[Teleology|teleological]] suspension of the ethical''. Abraham, the [[knight of faith]], chose to obey God unconditionally, and was rewarded with his son, his faith, and the title of ''Father of Faith''. Abraham transcended ethics and leaped into faith.

But there is no valid logical argument one can make to claim that morality ought to be or can be suspended in any given circumstance, or ever. Thus, Silentio believes ethics and faith are separate stages of consciousness. The choice to obey God unconditionally is a true existential 'either/or' decision faced by the individual. Either one chooses to live in faith (the religious stage) or to live ethically (the ethical stage).

In ''[[Either/Or]]'', Kierkegaard insists that the single individual has ethical [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] of his life. However, everyone wants to enjoy themselves and ethics gets in the way of a person's enjoyment of life if taken to extremes. This results in a battle between those who want to live for pleasure and those who demand an ethical existence. But Kierkegaard always points toward the religious goal, an "eternal happiness", or the [[salvation]] of the [[soul]] as the highest good. He says, be whatever you want, but remember that your soul belongs to God, not to the world. {{Quotation| By now you have easily seen that in his life the ethical individual goes through stages we previously set forth as [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Three stages of life|separate stages]]. He is going to develop in his life the [[Personal identity|personal]], the [[Civics|civic]], the [[religious]] virtues, and his life advances through his continually translating himself from one stage to another. As soon as a person thinks that one of these stages is adequate and that he dares to concentrate on it one-sidedly, he has not chosen himself ethically but has failed to see the significance of either isolation or continuity and above all has not grasped that the truth lies in the identity of the two. The person who has ethically chosen and found himself possess himself defined in his entire concretion. He then possesses himself as an [[individual]] who has these [[Aptitude|capacities]], these [[Passion (emotion)|passions]], these [[wikt:tendency|inclinations]], these [[habit (psychology)|habit]]s, who is subject to these external influences, who is influenced in one direction thus and in another thus. Here he then possesses himself as a task in such a way that it is chiefly to order, shape, temper, inflame, control-in short, to produce an evenness in the soul, a harmony, which is the fruit of the personal virtues.'' Either/Or Part 2'', Hong p. 262}}

{{Quotation|[[Resignation]] has made the [[individual]] face or has seen to it that he face toward an eternal happiness as the [[w:Telos (philosophy)|τέλος]] ("end", "purpose", or "goal"). This τέλος is not an element among other elements. Thus the both-and of mediation is not much better, even though less naïve, than the previously described jovial chatter that includes everything. At the moment of resignation, of collecting oneself, of choice the individual is allowed to salute the absolute τέλος-but then, then comes the mediation. So, too, a dog can be taught to walk on two legs for a moment but then, then comes the mediation, and the dog walks on four legs – mediation also does that. Spiritually understood, a human being’s upright walk is his absolute respect for the absolute τέλος, otherwise he walks on all fours. When it is a matter of relative elements mediation has its significance (that they are all equal before mediation), but when it is a matter of the absolute end or goal, mediation means that the absolute τέλος is reduced to a [[relativism|relative]] τέλος. It is not true, either, that the absolute τέλος becomes concrete in the relative ends, because resignation’s absolute distinction will at every moment safeguard the absolute τέλος against all fraternizing. It is true that the individual oriented toward the absolute τέλος, is in the relative ends, but he is not in them in such a way that the absolute τέλος is exhausted in them. It is true that before God and before the absolute τέλος we are all equal, but it is not true that God or the absolute τέλος is equal with everything else for me or for a particular individual. It may be very commendable for a particular individual to be a councilor of justice, a good worker in the office, no.1 lover in the society, almost a virtuoso on the flute, captain of the popinjay shooting club, superintendent of the orphanage, a noble and respected father-in short, a devil of a fellow who can both-and has time for everything. But let the councilor take care that he does not become too much a devil of a fellow and proceed to do both all this and have time to direct his life toward the absolute τέλος. In other words, this [[both-and]] means that the absolute [[w:Telos (philosophy)|τέλος]] is on the same level with everything else. But the absolute τέλος has the remarkable quality of wanting to be the absolute τέλος at every moment. If, then, at the moment of resignation, of collecting oneself, of choice, an individual has understood this, it surely cannot mean that he is supposed to have forgotten it the next moment. Therefore, as I said before, resignation remains in the individual and the task is so far from getting the absolute τέλος [[mediation|mediated]] into all sorts of both-and that, on the contrary, it is to aim at the form of existence that permanently has the pathos of the great moment. ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'', Hong, pp. 400-401}}

In ''[[Works of Love]]'' and ''Purity of Heart'', Kierkegaard skillfully examines [[Christian ethics]] and the maxim, ''Love Thy Neighbour''.&lt;ref&gt;Here are some verses from the Bible about loving your neighbor [http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Bible-Verses-About-Love-Your-Neighbor/ Love thy neighbor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK.org"&gt;{{cite web | title=D. Anthony Storm | work=Kierkegaard Commentary | url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org | accessdate=September 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard stressed that it was [[Christianity]] that "discovered the neighbor".&lt;ref&gt;Works of Love, Hong p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|Test it, place as the middle term between the lover and the beloved the neighbor, whom one shall love, place as a middle term between two friends the neighbor, whom one shall love, and you will immediately see jealousy. Yet the neighbor is self-denial’s middle term that steps in between self-love’s I and I, but also between erotic love’s and friendship’s I and the other I. .... Love for the neighbor is therefore the eternal equality in loving. Equality is simply not to make distinctions and eternal equality is unconditionally not to make the slightest distinction, unqualifiedly not to make the slightest distinction. The essential Christian is itself too weighty, in its movements too earnest to scurry about, dancing, in the frivolity of such facile talk about the higher, highest, and the supremely highest. Think of the most cultured person, one of whom we all admiringly say, “He is so cultured!” Then think of Christianity, which says to him, “You shall love the neighbor!” of course, a certain social courtesy, a politeness toward all people, a friendly condescension toward inferiors, a boldly confident attitude before the mighty, a beautifully controlled freedom of spirit, yes, this is culture – do you believe that it is also loving the neighbor? With the neighbor you have the equality of a human being before God. God is the middle term. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, 1847, Hong p. 44-61}}

===Individuality===
For Kierkegaard, true [[individual]]ity is called selfhood. Becoming aware of our true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist at a level that is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our [[pleasure]]s—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in ''Either/Or'', &lt;blockquote&gt;Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because if there is to be meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little [[teleology]] as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and [[contemplate]] life. Now you rest in despair. [[Absurdism|Nothing concerns you]]; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world. ''Either/Or Part II'' p. 195-196, 272ff&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Sickness Unto Death]]'' specifically Kierkegaard deals with the self as a product of relations. In this sense, a human results from a relation between the Infinite (Noumena, spirit, eternal) and Finite (Phenomena, body, temporal). This does not create a true self, as a human can live without a "self" as he defines it. Instead, the Self or ability for the self to be created from a relation to the Absolute or God (the Self can only be realized through a relation to God) arises as a relation between the relation of the Finite and Infinite relating back to the human. This would be a positive relation.

An individual person, for Kierkegaard, is a particular that no abstract formula or definition can ever capture. Including the individual in "the public" (or "the crowd" or "the herd") or subsuming a human being as simply a member of a species is a reduction of the true meaning of life for individuals. What philosophy or politics try to do is to categorize and pigeonhole individuals by group characteristics, each with their own individual differences. In [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]] Kierkegaard says the differences aren't important, the likeness with God is what brings equality. &lt;blockquote&gt;In the hallowed places, in every upbuilding view of life, the thought arises in a person’s soul that help him to fight the good fight with flesh and blood, with principalities and powers, and in the fight to free himself for equality before God, whether this battle is more a war of aggression against the differences that want to encumber him with worldly favoritism or a defensive war against the differences that want to make him anxious in worldly perdition. Only in this way is equality the divine law, only in this way is the struggle the truth, only in this way does the victory have validity- only when the single individual fights for himself with himself within himself and does not unseasonably presume to help the whole world to obtain external equality, which is of very little benefit, all the less so because it never existed, if for no other reason than that everyone would come to thank him and become unequal before him, only in this way is equality the divine law. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', by Soren Kiekegaard Hong, p. 143&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard's critique of the modern age, therefore, is about the loss of what it means to be an individual. Modern society contributes to this dissolution of what it means to be an individual. Through its production of the [[false idol]] of "the public", it diverts attention away from individuals to a mass public that loses itself in abstractions, communal dreams, and fantasies. It is helped in this task by the media and the mass production of products to keep it distracted. Even the fight for temporal equality is a distraction. In [[Works of Love]] he writes, {{Quotation| To bring about similarity among people in the world, to apportion to people, if possible equally, the conditions of temporality, is indeed something that preoccupies worldliness to a high degree. But even what we may call the well-intentioned worldly effort in this regard never comes to an understanding with Christianity. Well-intentioned worldliness remains piously, if you will, convinced that there must be one temporal condition, one earthly dissimilarity – found by means of calculations and surveys or in whatever other way – that is [[Liberalism|equality]]. ''Works of Love'', by Søren Kierkegaard, 1847, Hong 1995 pp. 71-72 see pp. 61-90}}

Although Kierkegaard attacked "the public", he is supportive of communities:
{{Quotation|In community, the individual is, crucial as the prior condition for forming a community. … Every individual in the community guarantees the community; the public is a chimera, numerality is everything…|Søren Kierkegaard|Journals&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

===Pathos (passion)===
For Kierkegaard, in order to apprehend the absolute, the mind must radically empty itself of objective content. What supports this radical emptying, however, is the desire for the absolute. Kierkegaard names this desire ''Passion''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.uab.cat/pub/enrahonar/0211402Xn29p119.pdf Kangas]&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this philosophy, some scholars have drawn similarities between the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] concept of [[Apatheia]] and Subjective Truth as the highest form of Wisdom. For the Stoics, Pathos (Passion) is a Perturbation which man has to overcome in a similar manner to Kierkegaard's concept of Objective Truth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=-01DAM9kgEMC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=apathy+kierkegaard], Kierkegaard and the Greek World: Aristotle and other Greek authors.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kierkegaard, the human self desires that which is beyond [[reason]]. Desire itself appears to be a desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, according to [[Plato]], is a kind of desire for [[immortality]]—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. [[Erotic love]] itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of [[time]] and [[space]]. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals in the name of a higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion. {{Quotation|If anyone is unwilling to learn from Christianity to love himself in the right way, he cannot love the neighbor either. He can perhaps hold together with another or a few other persons, “through thick and thin,” as it is called, but this is by no means loving the neighbor. To love yourself in the right way and to love the neighbor correspond perfectly to one another, fundamentally they are one and the same thing. When the Law’s ''as yourself'' has wrested from you the self-love that Christianity sadly enough must [[presuppose]] to be in every human being, then you actually have learned to love yourself. The Law is therefore: you shall love yourself in the same way as you love your neighbor when you love him as yourself.

Whoever has any [[knowledge]] of people will certainly admit that just as he has often wished to be able to move them to relinquish self-love, he has also had to wish that it were possible to teach them to love themselves. When the bustler wastes his time and powers in the service of the futile, [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inconsequential inconsequential] pursuits, is that not because he has not [[learn]]ed rightly to love himself? When the light-minded person throws himself almost like a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nonentity nonentity] into the folly of the moment and makes nothing of it, is this not because he does not know how to love himself rightly?

When the depressed person desires to be rid of life, indeed of himself, is this not because he is unwilling to learn earnestly and rigorously to love himself? When someone surrenders to [[despair (emotion)|despair]] because the world or another person has faithlessly left him betrayed, what then is his fault (his innocent suffering is not referred to here) except not loving himself in the right way? When someone self-tormentingly thinks to do God a service by torturing himself, what is his sin except not willing to love himself in the right way? And if, alas, a person presumptuously lays violent hands upon himself, is not his sin precisely this, that he does not rightly love himself in the sense in which a person ''ought'' to love himself?

Oh, there is a lot of talk in the world about treachery, and faithlessness, and, God help us, it is unfortunately all too true, but still let us never because of this forget that the most dangerous traitor of all is the one every person has within himself. This treachery whether it consists in selfishly loving oneself or consists in selfishly not willing to love oneself in the right way – this treachery is admittedly a secret. No cry is raised as it usually is in the case of treachery and faithlessness. But is it not therefore all the more important that Christianity’s doctrine should be brought to mind again and again, that a person shall love his neighbor as himself, that is as he ought to love himself?  …  You shall love – this, then is the word of the [[Great Commandment|royal Law]]. ''Works of Love'', Hong p. 22-24}}

One can also look at this from the perspective of what the meaning of our existence is. Why suffer what humans have suffered, the pain and despair—what meaning can all of this have? For Kierkegaard, there is no meaning unless passion, the emotions and will of humans, has a divine source.

Passion is closely aligned with faith in Kierkegaard's thought. [[Faith]] as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in a transcendent world, even though everything we can know intellectually speaks against it. To live and die for a belief, to stake everything one has and is in the belief in something that has a higher meaning than anything in the world—this is belief and passion at their highest.

Kierkegaard wrote of the subjective thinker's task in his ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Intellectual reason had been deified by Hegel in his theology and Kierkegaard felt this would lead to the [[objectification]] of religion.{{Quotation|There is an old proverb: ''oratio, tentatio, meditatio, faciunt theologum'' [prayer, trial, meditation, make a theologian]. Similarly, for a subjective thinker, [[imagination]], [[feeling]] and dialectics in impassioned existence-inwardness are required. But first and last, passion, because for an existing person it is impossible to think about existence without becoming passionate, inasmuch as existing is a prodigious contradiction from which the subjective thinker is not to abstract, for then it is easy, but in which he is to remain. In a world-historical dialectic, individuals fade away into humankind; in a dialectic such as that it is impossible to discover you and me, an individual existing human being, even if new magnifying glasses for the concrete are invented. The subjective thinker is a [[dialectic]]ian oriented to the [[existential]]; he has the intellectual passion to hold firm the qualitative disjunction. But, on the other hand, if the qualitative disjunction is used flatly and simply, if it is applied altogether abstractly to the [[individual]] [[human]] [[being]], then one can run the ludicrous risk of saying something infinitely decisive, and of being right in what one says, and still not say the least thing. Therefore, in the psychological sense it is really remarkable to see the absolute disjunction deceitfully used simply for evasion. When the death penalty is placed on every crime, the result is that no crimes at all are punished. It is the same with the absolute disjunction when applied flatly and simply; it is just like a silent letter-it cannot be pronounced or, if it can be pronounced, it says nothing. The [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[Intellectual|thinker]], therefore, has with intellectual [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] the absolute disjunction as belonging to existence, but he has it as the final decision that prevents everything from ending in a quantifying. Thus he has it readily available, but not in such a way that by abstractly recurring to it, he just frustrates [[existence]]. The subjective thinker, therefore, has also [[esthetic]] passion and [[ethics|ethical]] passion, whereby concretion is gained. All existence-issues are passionate, because existence, if one becomes [[conscious]] of it, involves passion. To think about them so as to leave out passion is not to think about them at all, is to forget the point that one indeed is oneself and existing person. Yet the subjective thinker is not a poet even if he is also a poet, not an ethicist even if he is also an ethicist, but is also a dialectician and is himself essentially existing, whereas the poet’s existence is inessential in relation to the poem, and likewise the ethicist’s in relation to the teaching, and the dialectician’s in relation to the thought. The subjective thinker is not a scientist-scholar; he is an artist. To exist is an art. The subjective thinker is esthetic enough for his life to have esthetic content, ethical enough to [[Regulation|regulate]] it, dialectical enough in thinking to master it. The subjective thinker’s task is to understand himself in existence. pp. 350-351}}

===Subjectivity&lt;!--linked from 'Perspectivism'--&gt;===

''Johannes Climacus'', in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'', writes the following cryptic line: "[[Subjectivity]] is Truth". To understand Climacus's concept of the individual, it is important to look at what he says regarding subjectivity. What is subjectivity? In very rough terms, subjectivity refers to what is personal to the individual—what makes the individual ''who he is in distinction from others''. It is what is inside—what the individual can see, feel, think, imagine, dream, etc. It is often opposed to objectivity—that which is outside the individual, which the individual and others around can feel, see, measure, and think about. Another way to interpret subjectivity is the ''unique'' relationship between the subject and object.

Johann Fichte wrote similarly about subjectivity in his 1799 book ''[[The Vocation of Man]]''. &lt;blockquote&gt;I must, however, remind my reader that the "I" who speaks in the book is not the author himself, but it is his earnest wish that the reader should himself assume this character, and that he should not rest contented with a mere historical apprehension of what is here said, but really and truly, during reading, hold converse with himself, deliberate, draw conclusions, and form resolutions, like his representative in the book, and, by his own labour and reflection, developed out of his own soul, and build up within himself, that mode of thought the mere picture of which is laid before him in the work. Preface&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scientists and historians, for example, study the objective world, hoping to elicit the truth of nature—or perhaps the truth of [[history]]. In this way, they hope to predict how the future will unfold in accordance with these laws. In terms of history, by studying the past, the individual can perhaps elicit the laws that determine how events will unfold—in this way the individual can predict the future with more exactness and perhaps take control of events that in the past appeared to fall outside the control of humans.

In most respects, Climacus did not have problems with [[science]] or the scientific endeavor. He would not disregard the importance of objective knowledge. Where the scientist or historian finds certainty, however, Climacus noted very accurately that results in science change as the tools of observation change. But Climacus's special interest was in history. His most vehement attacks came against those who believed that they had understood history and its laws—and by doing so could ascertain what a human’s true self is. That is, the assumption is that by studying history someone can come to know who he really is as a person. Kierkegaard especially accused Hegel's philosophy of falling prey to this assumption. He explained this in, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'': {{Quotation|It is the existing [[spirit]] who asks about [[truth]], presumably because he wants to exist in it, but in any case the questioner is [[conscious]] of being an existing individual human being. In this way I believe I am able to make myself understandable to every Greek and to every [[Rationality|rational]] human being. If a German philosopher follows his inclination to put on an act and first transforms himself into a superrational something, just as alchemists and sorcerers bedizen themselves fantastically, in order to answer the question about truth in an extremely satisfying way, this is of no more concern to me than his satisfying answer, which no doubt is extremely satisfying-if one is fantastically dressed up. But whether a German philosopher is or is not doing this can easily be ascertained by anyone who with enthusiasm concentrates his soul on willing to allow himself to be guided by a sage of that kind, and uncritically just uses his guidance compliantly by willing to form his [[existence]] according to it. When a person as a [[learner]] enthusiastically relates in this way to such a German professor, he accomplishes the most superb epigram upon him, because a speculator of that sort is anything but served by a learner’s honest and enthusiastic zeal for expressing and accomplishing, for existentially appropriating his [[wisdom]], since this wisdom is something that the Herr Professor himself has [[imagination|imagined]] and has written books about but has never attempted himself. It has not even occurred to him that it should be done. Like the customers clerk who, in the belief that his business was merely to write, wrote what he himself could not read, so there are speculative thinkers who merely write, and write that which, if it is to be read with the aid of action, if I may put it that way, proves to be nonsense, unless it is perhaps intended only for fantastical beings. P. 191}}

Hegel wanted to philosophize about Christianity but had no intention to ever become a Christian. For Climacus, the individual comes to know who he is by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will give meaning to his life. As an existing individual, who must come to terms with everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life that no one else will ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho-physical resources.

Subjectivity is that which the individual—and no one else—has. But what does it mean to have something like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a [[car]] or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society's, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: {{Quotation|We are truly reluctant to make a young person arrogant prematurely and teach him to get busy judging the world. God forbid that anything we say should be able to contribute to developing this malady in a person. Indeed, we think we ought to make his life so strenuously inwardly that from the very beginning he has something else to think about, because it no doubt is a morbid hatred of the world that, perhaps without having considered the enormous responsibility, wants to be persecuted. But on the other hand we are also truly reluctant to deceive a young person by suppressing the difficulty and by suppressing it at the very moment we endeavor to recommend Christianity, inasmuch as that is the very moment we speak. We put our confidence in boldly daring to praise Christianity, also with the addition that in the world its reward, to put it mildly, is ingratitude. We regard it as our duty continually to speak about it in advance, so that we do not sometimes praise Christianity with an omission of what is essentially difficult, and at other times, perhaps on the occasion of a particular text, hit upon a few grounds of comfort for the person tried and tested in life. No, just when Christianity is being praised most strongly, the difficulty must simultaneously be emphasized. (….) Christianly the world’s opposition stands in an essential relationship to the inwardness of Christianity. Moreover, the person who chooses Christianity should at that very moment have an impression of its difficulty so that he can know what it is that he is choosing. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, Hong 1995, pp. 193-194}}

The goal of life, according to [[Socrates]], is to know thyself. Knowing oneself means being aware of who one is, what one can be and what one cannot be. Kierkegaard uses the same idea that Socrates used in his own writings. He asks the one who wants to be a single individual the following questions in his 1847 book, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' {{Quotation|Everyone must make an accounting to God as an individual; the king must make an accounting to God as an individual, and the most wretched beggar must make an accounting to God as an individual – lest anyone be arrogant by being more than an individual, lest anyone despondently think that he is not an individual, perhaps because in the busyness of the world he does not even have a name but is designated only by a number. What else, indeed, is the accounting of eternity than that the voice of conscience is installed eternally in its eternal right to be the only voice!...Are you now living in such a way that you are aware of being a single individual and thereby aware of your eternal responsibility before God; are you living in such a way that this awareness can acquire the time and stillness and liberty to withdraw from life, from an honorable occupation, from a happy domestic life – on the contrary, that awareness will support and transfigure and illuminate your conduct in the relationships of life. You are not to withdraw and sit brooding over your eternal accounting, whereby you only take on a new responsibility. You will find more and more time for your duties and tasks, while concern for your eternal responsibility will keep you from being busy and from busily taking part in everything possible – an activity that can best be called a waste of time...Have you made up your mind about how you want to perform your work, or are you continually of two minds because you want to be in agreement with the crowd? Do you stick to your bid, not defiantly, not despondently, but eternally concerned; do you, unchanged, continue to bid on the same thing and want to buy only the same thing while the terms are variously being changed?...Are you hiding nothing suspicious in your soul, so that you would still wish things were different, so that you would dare robber-like to seize the reward for yourself, would dare to parade it, would dare to point to it; so that you would wish the adversity did not exist because it constrains in you the selfishness that, although suppressed, yet foolishly deludes you into thinking that if you were lucky you would do something for the good that would be worth talking about, deludes you into forgetting that the devout wise person wishes no adversity away when it befalls him because he obviously cannot know whether it might not indeed be a good for him, into forgetting that the devout wise person wins his most beautiful victory when the powerful one who persecuted him wants, as they say, to spare him, and the wise one replies: I cannot unconditionally wish it, because I cannot definitely know whether the persecution might not indeed be a good for me. Are you doing good only out of the fear of punishment, so that you scowl even when you will the good, so that in your dreams at night you wish the punishment away and to that extent also the good, and in your daydreams delude yourself into thinking that one can serve the good with a slavish mind? 
* Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong pp. 127-140}}

Subjectivity comes with consciousness of myself as a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.

Kierkegaard decided to step up to the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] for himself, replacing [[Adam]], and make his [[choice]] in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do in ''Fear and Trembling''. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about [[culpability|guilt]] and [[innocence]]. His book, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.

In [[Kierkegaard]]'s meaning, purely theological assertions are [[subjective truth]]s and they cannot be either verified or invalidated by science, i.e. through objective knowledge.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;Robert C. Solomon, No Excuses: Existentialism and the Meaning of Life, The Great Courses, The Teaching Company, http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=437&lt;/ref&gt; For him, choosing if one is for or against a certain subjective truth is a purely arbitrary choice.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; He calls the jump from objective knowledge to religious faith a [[leap of faith]], since it means subjectively accepting statements which cannot be rationally justified.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; For him the Christian faith is the result of the trajectory initiated by such choices, which don't have and cannot have a rational ground (meaning that reason is neither for or against making such choices).&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; Objectively regarded, purely theological assertions are neither true nor false.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;

===Three stages of life&lt;!--linked from 'Søren Kierkegaard'--&gt;===
Early American Kierkegaard scholars tried to reduce the complexity of Kierkegaard's authorship by focusing on three levels of individual existence, which are named in passing by one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, who wrote ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Though the stages represent only one way of interpreting Kierkegaard's thought, it has become a popular way of introducing his authorship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In continental European circles, stage theory never took hold in the same way. This typifies what Kierkegaard was talking about throughout his writing career. "Early American scholars" and "European circles" denote partitions of thought concerning the writings of his works. He was against "reflecting oneself out of reality" and partitioning the "world of the spirit" because the world of the spirit cannot be objectively divided. He wrote about Hegel's stages in his book, ''Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion'': {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;These stages may be compared to those of the ages of man. The child is still in the primal immediate unity of the will with nature, as representing both his own nature and the nature which surrounds him. The second stage, adolescence, when individuality is in process of becoming independent, is the living spirituality, the vitality of Spirit, which while setting no end before it as yet, moves forward, has aspirations, and takes an interest in everything which comes its way. The third is the age of manhood; this is the period of work for a particular end, to which the man makes himself subserviently, to which he devotes his energies. Finally, old age might be considered as a last stage, which having the Universal before it as an end, and recognizing this end, has turned back from the particular interests of life and work to the universal aim, the absolute final end, and has, as it were, gathered itself together out of the wide and manifold interests of actual outward existence and concentrated itself in the infinite depths of its inner life. Such are the determinations which follow in a logical manner from the nature of the Notion. At the close it will become apparent that even the original immediacy does not exist as immediacy, but is something posited. The child itself is something begotten.  George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,  ''Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion vol 1'' translated by Rev. E B Speiers 1895 p. 266ff&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/philosophyofreli01hegeuoft#page/n283/mode/1up ''Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion vol 1''] also see Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, March 13, 1847 by Soren Kierkegaard, copyright 1993 by Howard Hong, Princeton University Press p. 12ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In the world of the spirit, the different stages are not like cities on a journey, about which it is quite all right for the traveler to say directly, for example: We left Peking and came to Canton and were in Canton on the fourteenth. A traveler like that changes places, not himself; and thus it is alright for him to mention and to recount the change in a direct, unchanged form. But in the world of the spirit to change place is to be changed oneself, and there all direct assurance of having arrived here and there is an attempt a la [[Baron Munchausen|Munchausen]]. The presentation itself demonstrates that one has reached that far place in the world of spirit. ... The [[pseudonym]]ous author and I along with them were all [[Qualia|subjective]]. I ask for nothing better than to be known in our ''objective'' times as the only person who was not capable of being objective. That subjectivity, inwardness, is truth, that existing is the decisive factor, that this was the way to take to Christianity, which is precisely inwardness, but please note, not every inwardness, which was why the preliminary stages definitely had to be insisted upon-that was my idea, I thought that I had found a similar endeavor in the pseudonymous writings, and I have tried to make clear my interpretation of them and their relation to my ''[[Philosophical Fragments|Fragments]]''. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', 1846, Hong translation 1992&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

In one popular interpretation of stage theory, each of the so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This makes it easier to degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see. Either love the person you see as that person is the person he is or stop talking about loving everyone.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Works of Love'' and ''Practice in Christianity''&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|1=Back to the ''[[Stages on Life's Way|Stages]]''. It is markedly different from ''[[Either/Or]]'' by a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|tripartition]]. There are three stages, an esthetic, an ethical, a religious, yet not [[Abstract object|abstract]] as the immediate mediate, the unity, but concrete in the qualification of existence categories as pleasure-perdition, action-victory, suffering. But despite this tripartition, the book is nevertheless an either/or. That is, the ethical and the religious stages have an essential relation to each other. The inadequacy of ''Either/Or'' is simply that the work ended ethically, as has been shown. In ''Stages'' that has been made clear, and the religious is maintained in its place. .... A story of suffering; suffering is the religious category.

He did not say, "Peter must first change and become another person before I can love him again." No, he said exactly the opposite, "Peter is Peter, and I love him. My love, if anything will help him to become another person." Therefore he did not break off the friendship in order perhaps to renew it if Peter would have become another person; no, he preserved the friendship unchanged and in that way helped Peter to become another person. Do you think that Peter would have been won again without Christ's faithful friendship? But it is so easy to be a friend when this means nothing else than to request something in particular from the friend and, if the friend does not respond to the request, then to let the friendship cease, until it perhaps begins again if he responds to the request. Is this a relationship of friendship? Who is closer to helping an erring one than the person who calls himself his friend, even if the offense is committed against the friend! But the friend withdraws and says (indeed, it is as if a third person were speaking): When he has become another person, then perhaps he can become my friend again. We are not far from regarding such behavior as magnanimous. But truly we are far from being able to say of such a friend that in loving he loves the person he sees. Christ’s love was boundless, as it must be if this is to be fulfilled: in loving to love the person one sees. This is very easy to perceive. However much and in whatever way a person is changed, he still is not changed in such a way that he becomes invisible. If this-the impossible-is not the case, then of course we do see him, and the duty is to love the person one sees. Ordinarily we think that if a person has essentially changed for the worse, he is then so changed that we are exempt from loving him. But Christianity asks: Can you because of this change no longer see him? The answer to that must be: Certainly I can see him; I see that he is no longer worth loving. But if you see this, then you do not really see him (which you certainly cannot deny you are doing in another sense), you see only the unworthiness and the imperfection and thereby admit that when you loved him you did not see ''him'' in another sense but merely saw his excellence and perfections, which you loved. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' (1847) Hong 1995 p. 172-173

When a person to whom the possible pertains relates himself equally to the duality of the possible, we say: He expects. To expect contains within itself the same duality that the possible has, and to expect is to relate oneself to the possible purely and simply as such. Then the relationship divides according to the way the expecting person chooses. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope, which for that very reason cannot be any temporal expectancy but is an eternal hope. To relate oneself expectancy to the possibility of evil is to fear. But both the one who hopes and the one who fears are expecting. As soon, however, as the choice is made, the possible is changed, because the possibility of the good is the eternal. It is only in the moment of contact that the duality of the possible is equal; therefore, by the decision to choose hope, one decided infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision.

People think that they are speaking with ample experience in dividing a person’s life into certain periods and ages and then call the first period the age of hope or of possibility. What nonsense! Thus, in talk about hope they completely leave out the eternal and yet speak about hope. But how is this possible, since hope pertains to the possibility of the good, and thereby to the eternal! On the other hand, how is it possible to speak about hope in such a way that it is assigned to a certain age! Surely the eternal extends over the whole of life and there is and should be hope to the end; then there is no period that is the age of hope, but a person’s whole life should be the time of hope! And then they think they are speaking with ample experience about hope-by abolishing the eternal. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' (1847) Hong 1995 p. 249-251}}

====Stage one: aesthetic====
Kierkegaard was interested in [[aesthetics]], and is sometimes referred to as the "poet-philosopher" because of the passionate way in which he approached [[philosophy]]. But he is often said to be interested in showing the inadequacy of a life lived entirely in the aesthetic level. Aesthetic life is defined in numerous different ways in Kierkegaard's authorship, including a life defined by intellectual enjoyment, sensuous desire, and an inclination to interpret oneself as if one were "on stage." There are many degrees of this aesthetic existence and a single definition is thus difficult to offer. At bottom, one might see the purely unreflective lifestyle. At the top, we might find those lives which are lived in a reflective, independent, critical and socially apathetic way. But many interpreters of Kierkegaard believe that most people live in the least reflective sort of aesthetic stage, their lives and activities guided by everyday tasks and concerns. Fewer aesthetically guided people are the reflective sort. Whether such people know it or not, their lives will inevitably lead to complete despair. Kierkegaard's author ''A'' is an example of an individual living the aesthetic life. {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;You love the accidental. A smile from a pretty girl in an interesting situation, a stolen glance, that is what you are hunting for, that is a motif for your aimless fantasy. You who always pride yourself on being an observateur must, in return, put up with becoming an object of observation. Ah, you are a strange fellow, one moment a child, the next an old man; one moment you are thinking most earnestly about the most important scholarly problems, how you will devote your life to them, and the next you are a lovesick fool. But you are a long way from marriage. ''Either/Or Part II'' p. 7-8&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Just consider, your life is passing; for you, too, the time will eventually come even to you when your life is at an end, when you are no longer shown any further possibilities in life, when recollection alone is left, recollection, but not in the sense in which you love it so much, this mixture of fiction and truth, but the earnest and faithful recollection of your conscience. Beware that it does not unroll a list for you-presumably not of actual crimes but of wasted possibilities, showdown pictures it will be impossible for you to drive away. The [[intellectual]] agility you possess is very becoming to youth and diverts the eye for a time. We are astonished to see a clown whose joints are so loose that all the restraints of man’s gait and posture are annulled. You are like that in an intellectual sense; you can just as well stand on your head as on your feet. Everything is [[Logical possibility|possible]] for you, and you can surprise yourself and others with this possibility, but it is unhealthy, and for your own peace of mind I beg you to watch out lest that which is an advantage to you end by becoming a curse. Any man who has a conviction cannot at his pleasure turn himself and everything topsy-turvy in this way. Therefore I do not warn you against the world but against yourself and the world against you. ''Either/Or II'', Hong p. 16&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

====Stage two: ethical====
The second level of existence is the ethical. This is where an individual begins to take on a true direction in life, becoming aware of and personally responsible for [[goodness and value theory|good]] and [[evil]] and forming a commitment to oneself and others. One's actions at this level of existence have a consistency and coherence that they lacked in the previous sphere of existence. For many readers of Kierkegaard, the ethical is central. It calls each individual to take account of their lives and to scrutinize their actions in terms of absolute responsibility, which is what Kierkegaard calls [[repentance]]. If we compare Kierkegaard's idea of ethics with Vedic system of four aims of life, this Ethical system probably correlates most with [[Dharma]] - following this or that religion,set of rules, laws etc. (Hindus would call any religion as "dharma", though dharma is also a [[law]]). &lt;blockquote&gt;"He repents himself back into himself, back into the family, back into the race, until he finds himself in God. Only on this condition can he choose himself. And this is the only condition he wants, for only in this way can he choose himself absolutely." ....  “I repent myself out of the whole existence. Repentance specifically expresses that evil essentially belongs to me and at the same time expresses that it does not essentially belong to me. If the evil in me did not essentially belong to me, I could not choose it; but if there were something in me that I could not choose absolutely, then I would not be choosing myself absolutely at all, then I myself would not be the absolute but only a product." .... "It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam."  ... "The [[Either/Or]] I erected between living esthetically and living ethically is not an unqualified dilemma, because it actually is a matter of only one choice. Through this choice, I actually choose between good and evil, but I choose the good, I choose ''eo ipso'' the choice between good and evil. The original choice is forever present in every succeeding choice." Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216-217, 224, 237-238, 219&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Judge Wilhelm," a pseudonymous author of ''Either/Or'' and the voice who defines the ethical consciousness, argues that the commitment to take responsibility for one's own choices must be made individually. To take responsibility for the various relationships in which an individual finds him- or herself is a possibility open to every human being, but it does not follow that every human being chooses to do so as a matter of course. The meaning of a person's life for Wilhelm depends on how he takes responsibility for his current and future choices, and how he takes ownership of those choices already made. For Wilhelm, the ethically governed person takes responsibility for past actions, some good and some bad, seeks consistency, and takes seriously the obligation to live in a passionate and devoted way. 
{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;The Christian God is spirit and Christianity is spirit, and there is discord between the flesh and the spirit but the flesh is not the sensuous-it is the selfish. In this sense, even the spiritual can become sensuous-for example, if a person took his spiritual gifts in vain, he would then be carnal. And of course I know that it is not necessary for the Christian that Christ must have been physically beautiful; and it would be grievous-for a reason different from the one you give-because if beauty were some essential, how the believer would long to see him; but from all this it by no means follows that the sensuous is annihilated in Christianity. The first love has the element of beauty in itself, and the joy and fullness that are in the sensuous in its innocence can very well be caught up in Christianity. But let us guard against one thing, a wrong turn that is more dangerous than the one you wish to avoid; let us not become too spiritual. Either/Or Part II p. 50&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The question, namely, is this: Can this love be actualized? After having conceded everything up to this point, you perhaps will say: Well, it is just as difficult to actualize marriage as to actualize first love. To that I must respond: No, for in marriage there is a law of motion. First love remains an unreal [[Noumenon#Positive and negative noumena|in itself]] that never acquires inner substance because it moves only in the external medium. In the ethical and religious intention, marital love has the possibility of an inner history and is as different from first love as the historical is from the unhistorical. This love is strong, stronger than the whole world, but the moment it doubts it is annihilated; it is like a sleepwalker who is able to walk the most dangerous places with the complete security but plunges down when someone calls his name. Marital love is armed, for in the intention not only is attentiveness directed to the surrounding world but the will is directed toward itself, toward the inner world. Either/Or II p. 94&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The choice itself is crucial for the content of the personality: through the choice the personality submerges itself in that which is being chosen, and when it does not choose, it withers away in atrophy. ... Imagine a captain of a ship the moment a shift of direction must be made; then he may be able to say: I can do either this or that. But if he is not a mediocre captain he will also be aware that during all this the ship is ploughing ahead with its ordinary velocity, and thus there is but a single moment when it is inconsequential whether he does this or does that. So also with a person-if he forgets to take into account the velocity-there eventually comes a moment where it is no longer a matter of an Either/Or, not because he has chosen, but because he has refrained from it, which also can be expressed by saying: Because others have chosen for him-or because he has lost himself. Either/Or II p. 163-164&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

====Stage three: religious====
The ethical and the [[religious]] are intimately connected:  a person can be ethically serious without being religious, but the religious stage includes the ethical. Whereas living in the ethical sphere involves a commitment to some [[Moral absolutism|moral absolute]], living in the religious sphere involves a commitment and relation to the Christian God. Kierkegaard explained this in ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' like this: {{Quotation|Johannes the [[Seducer]] ends with the [[thesis]] that woman is only the moment. This in its general sense is the essential esthetic thesis, that the moment is all and to that extent, in turn, essentially nothing, just as the [[Sophist]]ic thesis that everything is true is that nothing is true. On the whole the conception of [[time]] is the decisive element in every standpoint up to the paradox, which paradoxically accentuates time. To the degree that time is accentuated, to the same degree there is movement from the esthetic, the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], to the [[ethical]], the religious, and the [[Christian]]-religious. Where Johannes the Seducer ends, the Judge begins: Woman’s beauty increases with the years. Here time is accentuated ethically, but still not in such a way that precludes the possibility of recollection’s withdrawal out of [[existence]] into the [[Immortality|eternal]]. p. 298-299

If a man like Kant, standing on the pinnacle of scientific scholarship, were to say in reference to demonstrations of the existence of God: Well, I do not know anything more about that than that my father told me it was so-this is humorous and actually says more than a whole book about demonstrations, if the book forgets this. p. 552-553}}

The Kierkegaardian pseudonyms who speak of stage theory consider religion to be the highest stage in human existence. In one discussion of religious life, one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, distinguishes two types within this stage, which have been called ''Religiousness A'' and ''Religiousness B''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' p. 555ff&lt;/ref&gt; One type is symbolized by the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Socrates]], whose passionate pursuit of the truth and individual conscience came into conflict with his society. Another type of religiousness is one characterized by the realization that the individual is [[sin]]ful and is the source of untruth.  In time, through revelation and in direct relationship with the [[paradox]] that is [[Jesus]], the individual begins to see that his or her eternal salvation rests on a paradox—[[Attributes of God in Christianity#Transcendence|God, the transcendent]], coming into time in human form to redeem human beings. For Kierkegaard, the very notion of this occurring was scandalous to human reason—indeed, it must be, and if it is not then one does not truly understand the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] nor the meaning of human sinfulness. For Kierkegaard, the impulse towards an awareness of a transcendent power in the universe is what religion is. Religion has a social and an individual (not just personal) dimension. But it begins with the individual and his or her awareness of sinfulness. Here are several quotes from Kierkegaard's where he discusses his concept of sin. &lt;blockquote&gt;The sin/faith opposition is the Christian one which transforms all ethical concepts in a Christian way and distils one more decoction from them. At the root of the opposition lies the crucial Christian specification: before God; and that in turn has the crucial Christian characteristic: the absurd, the paradox, the possibility of offense. And it is of the utmost importance that this is demonstrated in every specification of the Christian, since offense is the Christian protection against all speculative philosophy. In what, then, do we find the possibility of offense here? In the fact that a person should have the reality of his being, as a particular human being, directly before God, and accordingly, again, and by the same token, that man’s sin should be of concern of God. This notion of the single human being before God never occurs to speculative thought; it only universalizes particular human phantastically into the human race. It is exactly for this reason that a disbelieving Christianity came up with the idea that sin is sin, that it is neither here nor there whether it is before God. In other words, it wanted to get rid of the specification ‘before God’, and to that end invented a new wisdom, which nevertheless, curiously enough, was neither more nor less than what the higher wisdom generally is-old paganism. ''The Sickness Unto Death'', Hannay, 1989 p. 115&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Admittance is only through the consciousness of sin; to want to enter by any other road is high treason against Christianity. … The simple soul who humbly acknowledges himself to be a sinner, himself personally (the single individual), has no need at all to learn about all the difficulties that come when one is neither simple or humble. … To the extent Christianity, terrifying, will rise up against him and transform itself into madness or horror until he either learns to give up Christianity or-by means of what is anything but scholarly propaedeutics, apologetics, etc., by means of the anguish of a contrite conscience, all in proportion to his need-learns to enter into Christianity by the narrow way, through the consciousness of sin. ''Practice in Christianity'', Hong, 1991, p. 67-68&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Kierkegaard's thoughts on other philosophers==

===Kierkegaard and Fichte===
[[File:Johann Gottlieb Fichte.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Fichte]] Kierkegaard wrote much about [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] in his thesis ''[[The Concept of Irony]]''&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Concept of Irony'', p. 272ff&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in his first book ''[[De omnibus dubitandum est]]'', written under the pseudonym Johannes Climacus, and his Journals. Fichte wrote the book ''[[The Vocation of Man]]'' (1800) which called for a progression in the life of the human being from doubt to knowledge and then to faith. ''De omnibus dubitandum est'' is from Descartes and means everything must be doubted. Both Kierkegaard and Fichte were interested in this idea of beginning with doubt as well as subjectivity. Kierkegaard wrote: "In Fichte, subjectivity became free, infinite, negative. But in order for subjectivity to get out of this movement of emptiness in which it moved in infinite abstraction, it had to be negated; in order for thought to become actual, it had to become concrete."&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Irony, Hong p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quotation|Our whole age is imbued with a formal striving. This is what led us to disregard congeniality and to emphasize symmetrical beauty, to prefer conventional rather than sincere social relations. It is this whole striving which is denoted by — to use the words of another author — Fichte's and the other philosophers' attempts to construct systems by sharpness of mind and [[Robespierre]]'s attempt to do it with the help of the guillotine; it is this which meets us in the flowing butterfly verses of our poets and in Auber's music, and finally, it is this which produces the many revolutions in the political world. I agree perfectly with this whole effort to cling to form, insofar as it continues to be the medium through which we have the idea, but it should not be forgotten that it is the idea which should determine the form, not the form which determines the idea. We should keep in mind that life is not something abstract but something extremely individual. We should not forget that, for example, from a poetic genius' position of immediacy, form is nothing but the coming into existence of the idea in the world, and that the task of reflection is only to investigate whether or not the idea has gotten the properly corresponding form. Form is not the basis of life, but life is the basis of form. Imagine that a man long infatuated with the Greek mode of life had acquired the means to arrange for a building in the Greek style and a Grecian household establishment — whether or not he would be satisfied would be highly problematical, or would he soon prefer another form simply because he had not sufficiently tested himself and the system in which he lived. But just as a leap backward is wrong (something the age, on the whole, is inclined to acknowledge), so also a leap forward is wrong — both of them because a natural development does not proceed by leaps, and life's earnestness will ironize over every such experiment, even if it succeeds momentarily.

===Kierkegaard and Hegel===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|150px|thumb|Hegel]]
Many philosophers think that one of Kierkegaard's greatest contributions to philosophy is his critique of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Indeed, many of Kierkegaard's works are written in response to or as a critique of Hegel. Although Kierkegaard strongly criticized some aspects of Hegelian philosophy, his work also shows that he was also positively influenced by Hegel, and had respect for Hegel himself.
{{Quotation | Now everything is set in motion, and usually this also involves making the system popular — per systema influxus physici it lays hold of all men. How [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] was treated in his time is well known, and therefore I need only mention the infinite mass of lexicons, summaries, popular presentations, and explanations for everyman, etc. And how did Hegel fare later, Hegel, the most modern [[philosopher]], who because of his rigorous form would most likely command silence? Has not the logical trinity been advanced in the most ludicrous way? And therefore it did not astound me that my shoemaker had found that it could also be applied to the development of boots, since, as he observes, the dialectic, which is always the first stage in life, finds expression even here, however insignificant this may seem, in the squeaking, which surely has not escaped the attention of some more profound research psychologist. Unity, however, appears only later, in which respect his shoes far surpass all others, which usually disintegrate in the dialectic, a unity which reached the highest level in that pair of boots Carl XII wore on his famous ride, and since he as an orthodox shoemaker proceeded from the thesis that the immediate (feet without shoes — shoes without feet) is a pure [[abstraction]] and took it [the dialectical] as the first stage in the development. And now our modern [[politicians]]! By veritably taking up Hegel, they have given a striking example of the way one can serve two masters, in that their revolutionary striving is paired with a life-outlook which is a remedy for it, an excellent remedy for lifting part of the illusion which is necessary for encouraging their fantastic striving. And the actuality of the [[phenomenon]] will surely not be denied if one recalls that the words "immediate or spontaneous unity" occur just as necessarily in every scientific-scholarly treatise as a brunette or a blonde in every well-ordered romantic household. At the happy moment everyone received a copy of Holy Scriptures, in which there was one book which was almost always too brief and sometimes almost invisible, and this was, I regret — the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. And how curious it is to note that the present age, whose social striving is trumpeted quite enough, is ashamed of the monks and nuns of the [[Middle Ages]], when at the same time, to confine ourselves to our own native land, a society has been formed here which seems to embrace almost the entire kingdom and in which a speaker began thus: Dear Brothers and Sisters. How remarkable to see them censure the Jesuitry of the Middle Ages, since precisely the liberal development, as does every one-sided enthusiasm, has led and must lead to that. And now Christianity — how has it been treated? I share entirely your disapproval of the way every Christian concept has become so volatilized, so completely dissolved in a mass of fog, that it is beyond all recognition. To the concepts of faith, incarnation, tradition, inspiration, which in the Christian sphere are to lead to a particular historical fact, the philosophers choose to give an entirely different, ordinary meaning, whereby faith has become the immediate consciousness, which essentially is nothing other than the vitale Fluidum of mental life, its atmosphere, and tradition has become the content of a certain experience of the world, while inspiration has become nothing more than God's breathing of the life-spirit into man, and incarnation no more than the presence of one or another idea in one or more individuals. — Journals IA 328 1836 or 1837}}

In a journal entry made in 1844, Kierkegaard wrote:
{{Quotation|If Hegel had written the whole of his logic and then said, in the preface or some other place, that it was merely an experiment in thought in which he had even begged the question in many places, then he would certainly have been the greatest thinker who had ever lived.  As it is, he is merely comic. |Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1844&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;)}}

While Kierkegaard was a student of theology at the University of Copenhagen, [[Hegelianism]] had become increasingly popular. [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] and [[Hans Lassen Martensen]] were key figures in Danish Hegelianism. Kierkegaard remarked in his journal on 17 May 1843 that Heiberg's writings were "borrowed" from Hegel, implying Heiberg would have been a nobody without Hegel.

Kierkegaard objected to Hegel's claim that he had devised a system of thought that could explain the whole of reality, with a [[Dialectical#Hegelian dialectic|dialectical]] analysis of history leading the way to this whole. Hegel claimed that the doctrines and history of Christianity could be explained as a part of the rational unfolding and development of our understanding of the natural world and our place within it. Kierkegaard considered Hegel's explanation of Christianity as a necessary part of world history to be a distortion of the Christian message and a misunderstanding of the limits of human reason. He attempted to refute this aspect of Hegel's thought by suggesting that many doctrines of Christianity - including the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|doctrine of Incarnation]], a God who is also human - cannot be explained rationally but remain a logical paradox. However, he was in favor of youthful striving after truth. {{Quotation|Let a doubting youth, but an existing doubter with youth’s lovable, boundless confidence in a hero of scientific scholarship, venture to find in Hegelian positivity the truth, the truth of existence-he will write a dreadful epigram on Hegel. Do not misunderstand me. I do not mean that every youth is capable of overcoming Hegel, far from it. If a young person is conceited and foolish enough to try that, his attack is inane. No, the youth must never think of wanting to attack him; he must rather be willing to submit unconditionally to Hegel with feminine devotedness, but nevertheless with sufficient strength also to stick to his question-then he is a satirist without suspecting it. The youth is an existing doubter; continually suspended in [[doubt]], he grasps for the truth-so that he can exist in it. Consequently, he is negative, and Hegel’s philosophy is, of course, positive-no wonder he puts his trust in it. But for an existing person pure thinking is a [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] when the truth is supposed to be the truth in which to exist. Having to exist with the help of the guidance of pure thinking is like having to travel in Denmark with a small map of Europe on which Denmark is no larger than a steel pen-point, indeed, even more impossible. The youth’s admiration, his enthusiasm, and his limitless confidence in Hegel are precisely the satire on Hegel. This would have been discerned long ago if pure thinking had not maintained itself with the aid of a reputation that impresses people, so that they dare not say anything except that it is superb, that they have understood it-although in a certain sense that it is indeed impossible, since no one can be led by this philosophy to understand himself, which is certainly an absolute condition for all other understanding. Socrates has rather ironically said that he did not know for sure whether he was a human being or something else, but in the confessional a Hegelian can say with all solemnity: I do not know whether I am a human being-but I have understood the system. I prefer to say: I know that I am a human being, and I know that I have not understood the system. And when I have said that very directly, I shall add that if any of our Hegelians want to take me into hand and assist me to an understanding of the system, nothing will stand in the way from my side. In order that I can learn all the more, I shall try hard to be as obtuse as possible, so as not to have, if possible, a single presupposition except my ignorance. And in order to be sure of learning something, I shall try hard to be as indifferent as possible to all charges of being unscientific and unscholarly. Existing, if this is to be understood as just any sort of existing, cannot be done without passion.
* Soren Kierkegaard 1846, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments,'' Hong p. 310-311}}

To refute Hegel's claim that Christianity should be understood as a part of the necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of [[Abraham]] to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can be said of a human being) and that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.
{{Quotation|Kierkegaard's strategy was to invert this dialectic by seeking to make everything more difficult. Instead of seeing scientific knowledge as the means of human redemption, he regarded it as the greatest obstacle to redemption. Instead of seeking to give people more knowledge he sought to take away what passed for knowledge. Instead of seeking to make God and Christian faith perfectly intelligible he sought to emphasize the absolute transcendence by God of all human categories. Instead of setting himself up as a religious authority, Kierkegaard used a vast array of textual devices to undermine his authority as an author and to place responsibility for the existential significance to be derived from his texts squarely on the reader. … Kierkegaard's tactic in undermining Hegelianism was to produce an elaborate parody of Hegel's entire system. The pseudonymous authorship, from ''[[Either/Or]]'' to ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'', presents an inverted Hegelian dialectic which is designed to lead readers away from knowledge rather than towards it.|Søren Kierkegaard|[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/#Rhet William McDonald]}}

By doing this, Hegelian critics accuse Kierkegaard of using the dialectic to disprove the dialectic, which seems somewhat contradictory and hypocritical. However, Kierkegaard would not claim the dialectic itself is bad, only the Hegelian premise that the dialectic ''would lead to a harmonious reconciliation of everything'', which Hegel called the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]. Kierkegaard stated this most clearly in his book ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'', &lt;blockquote&gt;[[Theology|Dogmatics]] must not explain [[Original Sin|hereditary sin]] but rather explain it by presupposing it, like that vortex about which Greek speculation concerning nature had so much to say, a moving something that no science can grasp. That such is the case with dogmatics will readily be granted if once again time is taken to understand [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]’s immortal service to this science. He was left behind long ago when men chose Hegel. Yet Schleiermacher was a thinker in the beautiful Greek sense, a thinker who spoke only of what he knew. Hegel, on the contrary, despite all his outstanding ability and stupendous learning, reminds us again and again by his performance that he was in the German sense a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] on a large scale, because he ''a tout prix'' [at any price] must explain all things. ''The Concept of Anxiety'', by Reidar Thomte Princeton University Press 1980 P. 20&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaardian scholars have made several interpretations of how Kierkegaard proceeds with parodying Hegel's dialectic. One of the more popular interpretations argues the aesthetic-ethical-religious stages are the triadic process Kierkegaard was talking about. See section ''Spheres of existence'' for more information. Another interpretation argues for the world-individual-will triadic process. The dialectic here is either to assert an individual's own desire to be independent and the desire to be part of a community. Instead of reconciliation of the world and the individual where problems between the individual and society are neatly resolved in the Hegelian system, Kierkegaard argues that there's a delicate bond holding the interaction between them together, which needs to be constantly reaffirmed. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] takes this latter view and says the individual is in a constant state of reaffirming his or her own identity, else one falls into [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]].

This process of reconciliation leads to a "both/and" view of life, where both thesis and antithesis are resolved into a synthesis, which negates the importance of personal responsibility and the human choice of either/or. The work ''[[Either/Or]]'' is a response to this aspect of Hegel's philosophy. A passage from that work exemplifies Kierkegaard's contempt for Hegel's philosophy. Note the comparison between "A" and "B" (Judge Vilhelm) in ''Either/Or'' and ''Stages on Life's Way''. 
{{Quotation|Marry, and you will regret it. Do not marry, and you will also regret it. Marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Whether you marry or you do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the stupidities of the world, and you will regret it; weep over them, and you will also regret it. Laugh at the stupidities of the world or weep over them, you will regret it either way. Whether you laugh at the stupidities of the world or you weep over them, you will regret it either way. Trust a girl, and you will regret it. Do not trust her, and you will also regret it. … Hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. Whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. This, gentlemen, is the quintessence of all the wisdom of life.|Søren Kierkegaard|Either/Or Part I, Hong}}
{{Quotation|My dear reader, if you do not have the time and opportunity to take a dozen years of your life to travel around the world to see everything a world traveler is acquainted with, if you do not have the capability and qualifications from years of practice in a foreign language to penetrate to the differences in national characteristics as these become apparent to the research scholar, if you are not bent upon discovering a new astronomical system that will displace both the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] and the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]]-then marry; and if you have time for the first, the capability for the second, the idea for the last, then marry ''also''. Even if you did not manage to see the whole globe or to speak in many tongues or to know all about the heavens, you will not regret it, for marriage is and remains the most important voyage of discovery a human being undertakes; compared with a married man’s knowledge of life, any other knowledge of it is superficial, for he and he alone has properly immersed himself in life.|Søren Kierkegaard|Judge Vilhelm, Stages on Life's Way, Hong p. 89}}

Here are two more from 1846
{{Quotation|As is well known, Hegelian philosophy has canceled the principle of contradiction, and Hegel himself has more than once emphatically held judgment day on the kind of thinkers who remained in the sphere of understanding and reflection and who have therefore insisted that there is an either/or. Since that time, it has become a popular game, so that as soon as someone hints at an aut/aut [either/or] a Hegelian comes riding trip-trap-trap on horse and wins a victory and rides home again. Among us, too, the Hegelians have several times been on the move, especially against Bishop Mynster, in order to win [[Continental philosophy|speculative]] thought’s brilliant victory; and [[Jacob Peter Mynster|Bishop Mynster]], has more than once become a defeated standpoint, even though for being a defeated standpoint he is holding up very well, and it is rather to be feared that the enormous exertion of the victory has been too exhausting to the undefeated victors. And yet there may be a misunderstanding at the root at the conflict and the victory, Hegel is perfectly and absolutely right in maintaining that, looked at eternally, ''sub specie aeterni'', there is no aut/aut [[either/or]] in the language of abstraction, in [[pure thought]] and pure being. Where the devil would it be, since abstraction, after all, simply removes the contradiction; therefore Hegel and the Hegelians should instead take the trouble to explain what is meant by the masquerade of getting contradiction, movement, transition, etc. into logic. The defenders of aut/aut are in the wrong if they push their way into the territory of pure thinking and want to defend their cause there. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, Volume I'' p. 305}}
{{Quotation | According to Hegel the truth is the continuous world-historical process. Each generation, each stage of this process, is legitimated and yet is only an element of the truth. Short of resorting to a bit of charlatanry, which helps by assuming that the generation in which Hegel lived or the one after him is ''[[imprimatur]]'', and this generation is the last and [[History of the world|world history]] is past, we are all implicated in [[skepticism]]. The passionate question of truth does not even come up, because philosophy has first tricked the [[individual]]s into becoming [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]. The positive Hegelian truth is just as deceptive as happiness was in paganism. Not until afterward does one come to know whether or not one has been happy, and thus the next generation comes to know what truth was in the preceding generation. The great secret of the system is close to [[Protagoras]]’s [[sophism]] “[[Relativism|Everything is relative]]”, except that here everything is relative in the continuous process. But no living soul is served by that … ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]] Volume I'', by Johannes Climacus, edited by Søren Kierkegaard, Copyright 1846 – Edited and Translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong 1992, Princeton University Press. Note p. 33}}

The whole idea of one generation spending all its time studying past generations and then the next generation spending their time studying past generations and making moral and social comments about preceding generations was called, "The Hegelian cud-chewing process with three-stomachs - first immediacy - then regurgitation - then down again." He said, "Maybe a succeeding master-mind could continue this with four stomachs, etc., down once more and up again. I don't know if the master-mind grasps what I mean."&lt;ref&gt;Journals and Papers 25 August 1936 1A229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kierkegaard and Schelling===
[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling.png|150px|thumb|Schelling]]
In 1841–1842, Kierkegaard attended the [[Berlin]] lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]]. Schelling was a critic of [[Georg Hegel]] and a professor at the [[University of Berlin]]. The university started a lecture series given by Schelling in order to espouse a type of [[positive philosophy]] which would be diametrically opposed to [[Hegelianism]]. Kierkegaard was initially delighted with Schelling. Before he left Copenhagen to attend Schelling's lectures in Berlin, he wrote to his friend Peter Johannes Sprang:
{{Quotation|Schelling lectures to a select, numerous, and yet also ''undique conflatum auditorium''. During the first lectures it was almost a matter of risking one's life to hear him. I have never in my life experienced such uncomfortable crowding — still, what would one not do to be able to hear Schelling? His main point is always that there are two philosophies, one positive and one negative. The negative is given, but not by Hegel, for Hegel's is neither negative nor positive but a refined Spinozaism. The positive is yet to come. In other words, in the future it will not be only the lawyers who become the ''doctores juris utriusque'', for I venture to flatter myself that without submitting another dissertation I shall become a ''magister philosophiae utriusque''.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1841)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

At Berlin, Kierkegaard gave high praises to Schelling. In a journal entry made sometime around October or November 1841, Kierkegaard wrote this piece about Schelling's second lecture:
{{Quotation|I am so pleased to have heard Schelling's second lecture -- indescribably! I have sighed for long enough and my thoughts have sighed within me; when he mentioned the word, "reality" in connection with the relation of philosophy to reality the fruit of my thought leapt for joy within me. I remember almost every word he said from that moment on.  … Now I have put all my hopes in Schelling!|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1841)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

As time went on, however, Kierkegaard, as well as many in Schelling's audience, began to become disillusioned with Schelling. In a particularly insulting letter about Schelling, Kierkegaard wrote to his brother, Peter Kierkegaard:
{{Quotation|Schelling drivels on quite intolerably! If you want to form some idea what this is like then I ask you to submit yourself to the following experiment as a sort of self-inflicted sadistic punishment. Imagine person R's meandering philosophy, his entirely aimless, haphazard knowledge, and person Hornsyld's untiring efforts to display his learning: imagine the two combined and in addition to an impudence hitherto unequalled by any philosopher; and with that picture vividly before your poor mind go to the workroom of a prison and you will have some idea of Schelling's philosophy. He even lectures longer to prolong the torture. … Consequently, I have nothing to do in Berlin. I am too old to attend lectures and Schelling is too old to give them. So I shall leave Berlin as soon as possible. But if it wasn't for Schelling, I would never have travelled to Berlin. I must thank him for that. … I think I should have become utterly insane if I had gone on hearing Schelling.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 27 February 1842)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

{{Quotation|It is common knowledge that [[Aristotle]] used the term first philosophy primarily to designate [[metaphysics]], though he included within it a part that accorded to our conception belongs to [[theology]]. In paganism it is quite in order for theology to be treated there. It is related to the same lack of an infinite penetration reflection that endowed the theater in paganism with reality as a kind of divine worship. If we now abstract from this ambiguity, we could retain the designation and by first philosophy understand that totality of science which we might call “ethnical,” whose essence is immanence and is expressed in Greek thought by “recollection,” and by second philosophy understand that totality of science whose essence is transcendence or repetition. Schelling called attention to this Aristotelian term in support of his own distinction between negative and positive philosophy. By negative philosophy he meant “logic”; that was clear enough. On the other hand, it was less clear to me what he really meant by positive philosophy, except insofar as it became evident that it was the philosophy that he himself wished to provide. However, since I have nothing to go by except my own opinion, it is not feasible to pursue this subject further. [[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Constantin Constantius]] has called attention to this by pointing out that immanence runs aground upon “interest.” With this concept, actuality for the first time comes into view. Søren Kierkegaard, ''The Concept of Anxiety'' 1844, p. 21 and Note p. 21 Nichol}}

Kierkegaard became disillusioned with Schelling partly because Schelling shifted his focus on actuality, including a discussion on ''quid sit'' [what is] and ''quod sit'' [that is], to a more mythological, psychic-type pseudo-philosophy. Kierkegaard's last writing about Schelling's lectures was on 4 February 1842. He wrote the following in 1844, {{Quotation|Some men of [[Naturphilosophie|Schelling’s school]] have been especially aware of the alteration that has taken place in nature because of sin. Mention has been made also of the anxiety that is supposed to be in inanimate nature.  Schelling’s main thought is that anxiety, etc., characterize the suffering of the deity in his endeavor to create. In Berlin he expressed the same thought more definitely by comparing God with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and Jon Von Muller,&lt;ref&gt;See his Universal History published in 1818 https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL4431565A/John_von_Muller&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom felt well only when producing, and also by calling attention to the fact that such a bliss, when it cannot communicate itself, is unhappiness. ''The Concept of Anxiety'' P. 59-60 Note p. 59}}

Although Schelling had little influence on Kierkegaard's subsequent writings, Kierkegaard's trip to Berlin provided him ample time to work on his masterpiece, ''[[Either/Or]]''. In a reflection about Schelling in 1849, Kierkegaard remarked that Schelling was ''like the [[Rhine]] at its mouth where it became stagnant water - he was degenerating into a Prussian "Excellency". (Journals, January 1849)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;''

===Kierkegaard and Schopenhauer===
[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|150px|thumb|Arthur Schopenhauer]]
Kierkegaard became acquainted with [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s writings quite late in his life. Kierkegaard felt Schopenhauer was an important writer, but disagreed on almost every point Schopenhauer made. In several journal entries made in 1854, a year before he died, Kierkegaard spoke highly of Schopenhauer:
{{Quotation|In the same way that one disinfects the mouth during an epidemic so as not to be infected by breathing in the poisonous air, one might recommend students who will have to live in Denmark in an atmosphere of nonsensical Christian optimism, to take a little dose of Schopenhauer's Ethic in order to protect themselves against infection from that malodourous twaddle.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

However, Kierkegaard also considered him, ''a most dangerous sign'' of things to come:
{{Quotation|Schopenhauer is so far from being a real pessimist that at the most he represents 'the interesting': in a certain sense he makes [[asceticism]] interesting--the most dangerous thing possible for a pleasure-seeking age which will be harmed more than ever by distilling pleasure even out of asceticism… is by studying asceticism in a completely impersonal way, by assigning it a place in the system.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

Kierkegaard believes Schopenhauer's ethical point of view is that the individual succeeds in seeing through the wretchedness of existence and then decides to deaden or mortify the joy of life. As a result of this complete asceticism, one reaches contemplation: the individual does this out of sympathy. He sympathizes with all the misery and the misery of others, which is to exist. Kierkegaard here is probably referring to the pessimistic nature of Schopenhauer's philosophy. One of Kierkegaard's main concerns is a suspicion of his whole philosophy:
{{Quotation|After reading through Schopenhauer's Ethic one learns - naturally he is to that extent honest - that he himself is not an ascetic. And consequently he himself has not reached contemplation through asceticism, but only a contemplation which contemplates asceticism. This is extremely suspicious, and may even conceal the most terrible and corrupting voluptuous [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]: a profound [[misanthropy]]. In this too it is suspicious, for it is always suspicious to propound an ethic which does not exert so much power over the teacher that he himself expresses. Schopenhauer makes ethics into genius, but that is of course an unethical conception of ethics. He makes ethics into genius and although he prides himself quite enough on being a genius, it has not pleased him, or nature has not allowed him, to become a genius where asceticism and mortification are concerned.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

Little else is known about Kierkegaard's attitude to Schopenhauer. On Schopenhauer himself, Kierkegaard felt that Schopenhauer would have been patronizing. "Schopenhauer interests me very much, as does his fate in Germany. If I could talk to him I am sure he would shudder or laugh if I were to show him [my philosophy]."  ''(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;''

==Kierkegaard and Eastern philosophy==
Because Kierkegaard read Schopenhauer, and because Schopenhauer was heavily influenced by Eastern philosophy, it would seem that Kierkegaard would have shown an awareness of Eastern philosophy. There is, however, little direct reference to Asian thought in Kierkegaard's writings. Anyone who is familiar with such Asian traditions as Buddhist, Taoist, or Shinto philosophy, will quickly see the philosophical similarities that Kierkegaard shares with these traditions. These similarities perhaps explain the Japanese reception of Kierkegaard and the fact that Japanese awareness and translations of Kierkegaard were appearing at least 30 years before any English translations.&lt;ref&gt;Masugata, Kinya, “A Short History of Kierkegaard's Reception in Japan”, in J. Giles (ed.) ''Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 31-52&lt;/ref&gt; There is also extensive Japanese scholarship on Kierkegaard, a scholarship that interprets Kierkegaard's philosophy in terms of Asian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Mortensen, Finn Hauberg, ''Kierkegaard Made in Japan'', University Press of Southern Denmark, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is understandable when one sees that Kierkegaard's central concerns of subjectivity, anxiety, freedom, despair, and self-deception, are also of central concern to Buddhism and, consequently, that there is nothing exclusively Christian about such concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, James “Introduction: Kierkegaard's among the Temples of Kamakura”, in J. Giles (ed.) ''Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 1-30&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kierkegaard and Zen Buddhism, for example, have seen the predicaments of existence in very similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Nolan Pliny, “The Predicament of Man in Zen Buddhism and Kierkegaard”, ''Philosophy East and West'' 2, 1952, 238-253&lt;/ref&gt; A specific example of the similarities here can be seen in ''Purity of Heart'' where Kierkegaard describes the state of awareness that one must enter in order to partake of confession. Kierkegaard's description of this state is similar to the state of meditation described by Buddhist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, James, “To Practice One Thing: Kierkegaard through the Eyes of Dogen”, in J. Giles (ed.) ''Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 87-105&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct, however, in that the aim of confession, for Kierkegaard, is "to center itself upon this relation to itself as an individual who is responsible to God" (cf. Kierkegaard, "Purity of Heart").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2523&amp;C=2401&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard aims to claim back the subject from the "crowd" mentality of Christendom (cf. Kierkegaard, "On the Dedication to 'That Single Individual' ")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/k/kierkegaard/untruth/untruth.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and reaffirm the absolute responsibility to God, which is our [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] (cf. Kierkegaard, "Fear and Trembling").&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling, ed. and trans. Howard and Edna Hong, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harald Hoffding]] (1843-1931) helped introduce Kierkegaard to Western Europe in the early years of the 20th century. He compared Kierkegaard to Eastern philosophy in his 1914 book ''The Philosophy Of Religion'' in this way: {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;A characteristic and very frequent type of religious faith is determined by the need of rest. The main cause of fatigue and exhaustion in life is chiefly unrest and distraction of mind. We are influenced on so many sides that it is difficult for us to collect our thoughts; we are drawn in so many directions that we find it difficult to focus our will on any one aim; so many different and changing feelings are aroused that the inner harmony of the mind is exposed to the danger of dissolution. Owing to this feeling of misfit with our ideal we experience an inner need, while our outer needs are borne in upon us in the guise of pain, frailty, and dependence on the elementary wants of life. In the [[Upanishads]] we find: "The Self (Atma), the sinless one, who redeems from old age, death, suffering, hunger, and thirst, whose wishes are the right ones and whose decree is the right one I am that self which men must inquire after and seek to know. He who has found and known this Self has attained all worlds and all wishes." And in another place: “Save me, for I feel in this world’s life like a frog in a sealed fountain." Jesus of Nazareth says: " Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Learn of me, and ye shall find rest for your souls." “Unquiet is our heart," says Augustine to his God, “until it find rest in Thee." This need for rest rises to a passion in natures such as [[St. Theresa]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], and Soren Kierkegaard. There is no doubt an element of deep pathos in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] also, but in his case we have the Platonist and the prince of the church combined with the earnest seeker, and it is the combination of all these elements which renders him such a unique figure in the history of the religious life. St. Theresa felt the need of union with God so powerfully that death alone could satisfy it: "I knew not where else to seek this life but in death. The fish, drawn out of the water, sees at any rate the end of its torment; but what death can compare with the life in which I languish?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;With Kierkegaard, too, his great desire was to be released from the struggle of life. The lines which he desired should be inscribed on his gravestone express this longing: “A little while the search is o’er. The din of battle sounds no more." In this life the believer finds himself in an alien element; between the inner and the outer, between life and its conditions there is a want of harmony. In Kierkegaard s case, too, we get the metaphor of the fish out of water; it is characteristic of this type that the same figure should be employed by the ancient Indians in the Upanishads, by the Spanish nun of the sixteenth century, and by the northern thinker of the nineteenth century. This trait sheds a light on the psychology of religion. The aim of man is infinite, but he is condemned to spend his life in the world of finitude, and hence it follows that his existence acquires a sort of spasmodic character. In Kierkegaard, and even in Pascal, this opposition is more sharply brought out than in St. Theresa. In the latter it evokes longing and inner aspiration, but her will is occupied entirely by the highest object, and only her memory and her imagination are free to analyse her experiences. But both Pascal and Kierkegaard have constantly to summon the will to their aid; in their case they have a desperate struggle to keep themselves upright in face of the harsh discord between the true life and the conditions of actual life; to hold fast to the thought of the object of faith and to resist the onslaughts of doubt. ''The Philosophy Of Religion'', Dr. Harald Hoffding p. 116-118, Translated from the German Edition, By B. E. Meyer 1914&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8578">{{Thomism}}{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}The '''principle of double effect'''—also known as the '''rule of double effect'''; the '''doctrine of double effect''', often abbreviated as '''DDE''' or '''PDE''', '''double-effect reasoning'''; or simply '''double effect'''—is a set of ethical criteria which Christian philosophers, and some others, have advocated for evaluating the permissibility of acting when one's otherwise legitimate act (for example, relieving a terminally ill patient's pain) may also cause an effect one would otherwise be obliged to avoid (sedation and a slightly shortened life). The first known example of double-effect reasoning is [[Thomas Aquinas]]' treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3064.htm#article7 ''Summa Theologiae, IIa-IIae Q. 64, art. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

This set of criteria states that an action having foreseen harmful effects practically inseparable from the good effect is justifiable if the following are true:
* the nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral;
* the agent intends the good effect and does not intend the bad effect either as a means to the good or as an end in itself;
* the good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect and the agent exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Cavanaugh, ''Double-Effect Reasoning: Doing Good and Avoiding Evil'', p.36, Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intentional harm versus side effects==
The principle of double effect is based on the idea that there is a morally relevant difference between an "intended" consequence of an act and one that is foreseen by the actor but not calculated to achieve his motive. So, for example, the principle is invoked to consider the terror bombing of non-combatants having as its goal victory in a legitimate war morally out of bounds, while holding as ethically in bounds an act of strategic bombing that similarly harms non-combatants with foresight  as a side effect of destroying a legitimate military target. Because advocates of double effect propose that consequentially similar acts can be morally different, double effect is most often criticized by [[consequentialism|consequentialists]] who consider the consequences of actions entirely determinative of the action's morality.

In their use of the distinction between intent and foresight without intent, advocates of double effect make three arguments. First, that intent differs from foresight, even in cases in which one foresees an effect as inevitable. Second, that one can apply the distinction to specific sets of cases found in military ethics (terror bombing/strategic bombing), medical ethics (craniotomy/hysterectomy), and social ethics (euthanasia). Third, that the distinction has moral relevance, importance, or significance.

The doctrine consists of four conditions that must be satisfied before an act is morally permissible:

# The ''nature-of-the-act condition.'' The action must be either morally good or indifferent.
# The ''means-end condition.'' The bad effect must not be the means by which one achieves the good effect.
# The ''right-intention condition.'' The intention must be the achieving of only the good effect, with the bad effect being only an unintended side effect.
# The ''proportionality condition.'' The bad effect must not be disproportionate to the good effect.

The second of these four conditions is an application of the more general principle that good ends do not justify evil means.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Timmons, ''Moral Theory: An Introduction'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-8476-9768-7}}), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Medicine===
The principle of double effect is frequently cited in cases of [[pregnancy]] and [[abortion]]. A doctor who believes abortion is always morally wrong may still remove the uterus or [[Fallopian tube|fallopian tubes]] of a pregnant woman, knowing the procedure will cause the death of the [[embryo]] or [[fetus]], in cases in which the woman is certain to die without the procedure (examples cited include aggressive [[uterus|uterine]] [[cancer]] and [[ectopic pregnancy]]). In these cases, the intended effect is to save the woman's life, not to terminate the pregnancy, and the effect of not performing the procedure would result in the greater evil of the death of both the mother and the foetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | title = Doctrine of Double Effect | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/ | editor = Edward N.

In cases of terminally ill patients who would hasten their deaths because of unbearable pain, or whose caregivers would do so for them ([[euthanasia]], [[medical aid in dying]], etc.), a principle of "double effect death" could be applied to justify the deliberate administration of a pain-killer in potentially unsafe doses—not in an attempt to end life but the pain suffered is considered harmful to the patient. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has voiced support for this principle in its deliberations over the constitutionality of medical aid in dying.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vacco v. Quill]]'' and ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'', both in 1997. See: Tucker, Kathryn E., “Legal Advocacy to Improved Care and Expand Options at the End of Life,” in ''Physician-Assisted Dying: The Case for Palliative Care &amp; Patient Choice'', edited by T.E. Quill and M.P. Battin ([[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2004). The Court made it clear that a “medical death” hastened by palliative measures was permissible.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

[[Consequentialism|Consequentialists]], in particular, reject the notion that two acts can differ in their moral permissibility if both have exactly the same consequences, or expected consequences. [[John Stuart Mill]], a nineteenth-century advocate of the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] version of consequentialism, argues that it is a mistake to confuse the standards for right action with a consideration of our motives to perform a right action: "He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble; he who betrays the friend that trusts him, is guilty of a crime, even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under greater obligations." According to Mill, scrutiny of motives will show that almost all good behavior proceeds from questionable intentions. Therefore, Mill argues, our moral analysis should ignore matters of motivation, and so we should reject DDE, which appeals to a distinction between intended and [[unintended consequences]].&lt;ref name="JSM"&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' (London: Parker, Son and Bourn, 1863), page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill further claims that scrutiny of motives will reveal a man's character, but utilitarianism does not judge character, only the rightness or wrongness of actions.

The '''Red Rose of Lancaster''' (a [[rose (heraldry)|rose]] gules) is the [[county flower]] of [[Lancashire]].

The exact [[species]] or [[cultivar]] which the red rose relates to is uncertain, but it is thought to be ''[[Rosa gallica|Rosa gallica officinalis]]''.

The rose was first adopted as an heraldic device by the first [[Edmund Crouchback|Earl of Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bedingfeld and Peter Gwynn-Jones, Heraldry, Chartwell Books, 1993, page 130.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the badges of [[Henry IV of England]], the first king of the [[House of Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bedingfeld and Peter Gwynn-Jones, Heraldry, Chartwell Books, 1993, page 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485, it became the emblem of Lancashire.

==Flower==
[[Image:Rosa gallica officinalis0.jpg|thumb|''Rosa gallica'' var. ''officinalis'']]
{{Main|Rosa gallica}}

Lancaster's Red Rose (also known as [[Apothecary's Rose]], Old Red Damask and Rose of Provins) is an official variety and is possibly the first cultivated [[rose]]. The rose grew wild throughout [[Central Asia]] and was discovered by the ancient [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]. Later adopted by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], who introduced it to [[Gaul]] (France) where it assumed the name ''[[Rosa gallica]]''. It is documented that [[Charlemagne]]'s court exploited the rose as a [[perfume]]. The rose was also appreciated for its medical value and was utilized in countless [[medicinal plants|medical remedies]].

==Medieval symbol==
[[Image:Tudor Rose.svg|thumb|100px|left|The Tudor Rose of England]] The Red Rose of Lancaster derives from the gold rose badge of [[Edward I of England]].  Other members of his family used variants of the royal badge, with the king's brother, the Earl of Lancaster, using a red rose.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bedingfeld and Peter Gwynn-Jones, Heraldry, Chartwell Books, 1993, page 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that the Red Rose of Lancaster was the [[House of Lancaster]]'s [[Heraldic badge|badge]] during the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Evidence for this "wearing of the rose" includes land tenure records requiring service of a red rose yearly for a manor held directly from [[Henry VI of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cardogan Rothery, Concise Encyclopedia of Heraldry, Brackten Books, 1915, page 183&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, however, doubts as to whether the red rose was actually an emblem taken up by the Lancastrians during the Wars of the Roses.  Adrian Ailes has noted that the red rose “probably owes its popular usage to [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] quickly responding to the pre-existing Yorkist white rose in an age when signs and symbols could speak louder than words."  
  
It also  allowed Henry to invent and exploit his most famous heraldic device, the [[Tudor Rose]], combining the so-called Lancastrian red rose and the [[White Rose of York]].  This floral union neatly symbolised the restoration of peace and harmony and his marriage in January 1486 to Elizabeth of York.  It was a brilliant piece of simple heraldic propaganda.”&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Ailes, “Heraldry in Medieval England: Symbols of Politics and Propaganda,” in Heraldry, Pageantry, and Social Display in Medieval England, ed. Peter Cross and Maurice Keen (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell, 2002), 83-104 (101).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tudor Rose]] is used as the plant badge of England ([[Scotland]] uses the [[thistle]], [[Ireland]] uses the [[shamrock]], and [[Wales]] uses the [[leek]]).

==Later use==

[[Image:Coat of arms of Lancashire County Council.png|thumb|190px|Lancashire's official coat of arms has three red roses]]

The rose does not form any part of the insignia of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], but came to be seen as an emblem of the [[county]] of [[Lancashire]], and as such was incorporated in the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of numerous Lancashire local authorities including the county council. Since 1974 a number of [[metropolitan boroughs]] in [[Greater Manchester]] and [[Merseyside]] have included red roses in their armorial bearings to show their formation from parts of Lancashire. It is also present in the crest of the [[coat of arms of the London Borough of Enfield]].

The traditional [[Flag of Lancashire|Lancashire flag]], a red rose on a white field, was never officially registered with the Flag Institute and when this was attempted it was found that this flag had been registered by the town of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose, Scotland]]. As two flags of the same design can not be registered, Lancashire’s official flag is now registered as a red rose on a yellow field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=10&amp;flagtype=county&amp;flagid=108 | title = UK Flag Institute | access-date =April 8, 2017 | publisher =  The Flag Institute | language = English }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.lep.co.uk/news/lancashire-flag-is-all-yellow-1-76611 | title = Lancashire flag is all yellow | date=July 29, 2008 | access-date =May 11, 2017 | publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd. | language = English }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Red Rose is still widely used, and not necessarily on a yellow background. [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] still use the rose as an emblem. [[The Trafford Centre]] also features Red Roses in its architecture, most noticeably on all of the glass panes in the shopping centre. [[Lancashire GAA]] features a red rose on its emblem. [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City Football Club]] featured the red rose on the club badge from 1972 to 1997 and reinstated it in 2015, reflecting Manchester's history as part of Lancashire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-35174237|title=Manchester City's new club badge design leaked online|publisher=BBC News|date=24 December 2015|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features on the badge of [[Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Bolton Wanderers]].
[[Edge Hill University]] in Ormskirk uses the Red Rose on a yellow background on its crest along with a [[Liver bird]] which signifies its current location (Lancashire) and origins in Liverpool. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Mike |last=Nolan |title=The coat of arms |url=http://blogs.edgehill.ac.uk/125by125/logos/the-coat-of-arms/ |work=125 by 125. 125 posts from the archives right through to Edge Hill's 125th year |date=February 21, 2010 | accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shield of Lancashire County Council's [[coat of arms]], however, displays not one but three red roses, on gold [[Pile (heraldry)|piles]] on a red background. The arms have been official since 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Lancashire|title=Lancashire|publisher=Heraldry of the World|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military use==
From the nineteenth century the red rose was part of the badge of a number of units of the [[British Army]] recruiting in the county. In [[World War I]] the rose was worn by [[British 55th (West Lancashire) Division]] during their campaign in [[Belgium]]; their [[motto]] was "They win or die, who wear the Rose of Lancaster". The cap badge of the [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)|Duke of Lancaster's Regiment]], formed in 2006, features the rose.

The Saskatoon [[Light Infantry]] of the [[Canadian Army]] also incorporated the red rose into the design of their cap badge and regimental buttons, due to an alliance with the [[York and Lancaster Regiment]] of the [[British Army]].

The [[Canada|Canadian]] city of [[Montreal]] has a Lancastrian rose in the top right hand corner of its [[Flag of Montreal|flag]], representing the city's historical English community. 

The U.S. [[City of Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], known as "Red Rose City", uses the Lancastrian rose as its seal, and in its flag.

Also in the project is a special sections area featuring nine different sections which showcase comprehensive reports, oral histories, photo collections, and documents about many of the prominent movements and organizations involved in Seattle's rich history of Civil Rights and Labor activism. The sections detail farm workers in Washington State, the Ku Klux Klan in Washington, the Seattle Black Panther Party, Filipino Cannery Unions, the Washington Chicano movement, the 1907 Bellingham anti-Asian riots, the Congress of Racial Equality in Seattle, the Black Student Union at the University of Washington, and the United Construction Workers Association. A section on the history of housing segregation in Seattle attracted media attention and spurred changes in State law that allowed neighborhood associations to remove racially restrictive clauses from their covenants with greater ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turnbull|first=Lornet|title=Homeowners find records still hold blot of racism|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002297312_covenants03m.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=June 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gregory|first=James|title=Stain of racism still haunts Seattle neighborhoods|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2002913362_jamesgregory06.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational Outreach==
The Project includes nine full lesson plans for middle school and high school students, ranging from single class periods to longer units, created by Washington educators. The lesson plans are designed to encourage critical thinking and fulfill State requirements. Examples include ‘Martin Luther King’s Controversial Visit to Seattle’ and ‘Document Based Question: School Segregation in Seattle.’

==Chicano/a Movement in Washington State History Project==
The Chicano/a Movement in Washington State History Project is a multimedia resource on the history of Chicano activism that includes first-hand oral histories, primary documents and academic research.  It traces the development of the movement in the Yakima Valley and the University of Washington in Seattle. The Project is an initiative of the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project at the University of Washington, alongside the Farm Workers in Washington State History Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosales-Castaneda|first=Oscar|title=Writing Chicana/o History with the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|journal=Writing History in the Digital Age|date=Spring 2012|url=http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu/public-history/rosales-castaneda-2012-spring/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
The Project focuses on several organizations including United Mexican American Students (UMAS), [[Brown Berets|the Brown Berets]], [[MEChA|Movimiento Estudiantil Chicana/o de Aztlan]] (MEChA), United Farmworker Cooperative, El Teatro del Piojo, El Centro de la Raza, the Concilio for Spanish Speaking, SEAMAR Community Health Centers, and radio station KDNA. The histories of these organizations are bolstered by video oral histories, photographs from several personal collections and digitized copies of pamphlets and other documents. An in-depth timeline covers the years 1960-1985, and an illustrated essay details the period from the coalescing of the movement in 1967 to the [[2006 United States immigration reform protests|2006 immigration mobilizations]]. In addition, the site contains a database of more than 300 digitized newspaper articles that originally appeared between 1968 and 1979. Like other sections of the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project, the site contains model lesson plans for middle school and high school teachers using the available materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Teaching a City about Its Civil Rights History: A Public History Success Story|journal=Perspectives|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2007/0704/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Seattle Civil Rights &amp; Labor History Project: an Online Video Oral History Collection|journal=Northwest Oral History Association Newsletter|date=Spring 2007|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr3/pdf/NOHA%20Spring%2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selfism''' refers to any philosophy, theory,  doctrine, or tendency that upholds explicitly [[selfish]] principles as being desirable. It is usually used [[pejoratively]].

==Definition==
The term "selfism" was used by [[Paul Vitz]] in his 1977 book ''Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-Worship''. Vitz deconstructs the selfist movement(s) and tries to uphold [[God]]-centered [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]], and claims that all of modern-day [[liberalism]] and [[leftism]] are essentially selfist at their core. He lays the blame predominantly at the feet of [[Erik Erikson]], [[Erich Fromm]], and other prominent psychologists of the third quarter of the 20th century (c. 1950–1975 CE).

Explicit selfishness as a desirable end and moral good had diverse manifestations during that period, for example, in the writings of [[David Seabury]], [[Ayn Rand]], and even among some of Rand's near-opposites, such as Erikson and Fromm. Rand called her philosophy [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Later popularizers of similar positions include [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Paul Lepanto]], [[Robert Ringer]], [[Harry Browne]], and [[David Kelley]], among others. None of these named the system they espoused "selfism" or characterized it as "selfist", although both Seabury and Rand included the word "selfishness" in the titles of books presenting their views. Many of these figures were pro-[[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Secularism|secularists]] ("[[Atheism|atheist]] capitalists"), but Seabury was a [[Christian]], while Erickson and Fromm were prominent [[Leftism|leftists]].

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]] and author of [[The Satanic Bible]], acknowledges [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] as a source of inspiration for [[LaVeyan Satanism]]. This form of Satanism holds the [[self]] above all else in similar fashion to Objectivism. Despite some similarities, they remain separate entities, as there are clear differences between the two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Origins of selfist thought==
Some early examples of "selfist" thinking are the [[Ethical egoism|egoistic]] philosophies of [[Yangism]] in [[ancient China]] and of [[Cyrenaic]] [[hedonism]] in [[ancient Greece]].  Yangists followed the teachings of [[Yang Zhu]] and might have been influenced by [[Taoism]].  [[Cyrenaics]], founded by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]], were [[Religious skepticism|skeptics]] and [[Materialism|materialists]] (but perhaps nominally Greek [[Paganism|pagans]]). [[Thomas Hobbes]], who could also be viewed as ''selfist'', was a [[Materialism|materialist]] but also advocated loyalty to a strong government and [[state church]]. [[Joseph Butler]], whose philosophy is unmistakably selfist, was generally regarded as an [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|orthodox Christian]] and was canonized an [[Anglican]] [[saint]]. The views of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Max Stirner]] provide a more proximate link to the modern selfists.

The '''speckled kingsnake''' (''Lampropeltis holbrooki'') is a nonvenomous [[species]] of [[kingsnake]], which is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[United States]].

==Description==
[[Image:Speckled Kingsnake-head.jpg|thumb|right|Adult in Mississippi]]
The speckled kingsnake usually grows up to {{convert|48|in|cm}} in total length (including tail), but the record total length is {{convert|72|in|cm}}. The common name is derived from the pattern, which is [[black]], with small [[yellow]]-[[white]] specks, one speck in the center of almost every [[Dorsal scales|dorsal scale]]. It is also known as the "salt-and-pepper snake".&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Conant (herpetologist)|Conant R]] (1975). ''A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + Plates 1-48. {{ISBN|0-395-19979-4}} (hardcover), {{ISBN|0-395-19977-8}} (paperback). (''Lampropeltis getulus holbrooki'', pp. 203-204 + Plate 29 + Map 156).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic range==
The speckled kingsnake is found in the central to southern [[United States]] from southern [[Iowa]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsnake.com/louisiana/species_speckled_kingsnake.htm |title=Speckled Kingsnake |publisher=Kingsnake.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its range overlaps that of the desert kingsnake, ''[[Lampropeltis getula splendida]]'', and it is known to [[Hybrid (biology)|intergrade]] with that subspecies.

==Habitat==
The speckled kingsnake prefers wetter [[habitat]]s than other kingsnakes, like swamps and rivers, but it does commonly venture to dry areas like woodlands and grassy fields.

==Diet==
The [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] of the speckled kingsnake consists of [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[rodent]]s, frogs, [[lizard]]s, and other [[snake]]s. It kills by constriction.

==Behavior==
When threatened, the speckled kingsnake will shake its tail like a rattlesnake to deter predators. It frequently will expel [[musk]] and [[feces]] or bite when threatened.

It is usually docile, often striking only one or two times after capture, and is frequently kept as a [[pet]]. It is commonly [[captive breeding|captive bred]].

==Taxonomy and etymology==
This snake was first described by American herpetologist [[John Edwards Holbrook]] in 1842.  At that time he called it ''Coronella sayi'' under the mistaken impression that it was the species previously described by [[Hermann Schlegel|Schlegel]] as ''Coluber sayi''.  In 1902 [[Leonhard Hess Stejneger|Stejneger]] pointed out that because ''Coluber sayi'' is a different snake, ''[[Pituophis catenifer sayi]]'', the name ''sayi'' could not be applied to this snake. Therefore, he proposed the name ''Lampropeltis holbrooki'', honoring Holbrook.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank N. Blanchard|Blanchard FN]] (1921). "A Revision of the King Snakes: Genus ''Lampropeltis'' ". ''Bull. U.S. Nat. Mus.'' (114): 1-260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. (''Lampropeltis getula holbrooki'', p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt; It was for many years considered a subspecies of ''L. getula'', but has been elevated to full species status as ''L. holbrooki''.

In [[mathematics]], a '''subcategory''' of a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' is a category ''S'' whose objects are objects in ''C'' and whose [[morphism]]s are morphisms in ''C'' with the same identities and composition of morphisms. Intuitively, a subcategory of ''C'' is a category obtained from ''C'' by "removing" some of its objects and arrows.

== Formal definition ==
Let ''C'' be a category. A '''subcategory''' ''S'' of ''C'' is given by
*a subcollection of objects of ''C'', denoted ob(''S''),
*a subcollection of morphisms of ''C'', denoted hom(''S'').
such that
*for every ''X'' in ob(''S''), the identity morphism id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is in hom(''S''),
*for every morphism ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in hom(''S''), both the source ''X'' and the target ''Y'' are in ob(''S''),
*for every pair of morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' in hom(''S'') the composite ''f'' o ''g'' is in hom(''S'') whenever it is defined.

These conditions ensure that ''S'' is a category in its own right: the collection of objects is ob(''S''), the collection of morphisms is hom(''S''), and the identities and composition are as in ''C''. There is an obvious [[Full and faithful functors|faithful functor]] ''I'' : ''S'' → ''C'', called the '''inclusion functor''' which takes objects and morphisms to themselves.

Let ''S'' be a subcategory of a category ''C''. We say that ''S'' is a '''full subcategory of''' ''C'' if for each pair of objects ''X'' and ''Y'' of ''S''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{S}(X,Y)=\mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(X,Y).&lt;/math&gt;
A full subcategory is one that includes ''all'' morphisms between objects of ''S''. For any collection of objects ''A'' in ''C'', there is a unique full subcategory of ''C'' whose objects are those in ''A''.

== Examples ==
* The category of [[Finite set|finite sets]] forms a full subcategory of the [[category of sets]].
* The category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are [[Bijection|bijections]] forms a non-full subcategory of the category of sets.
* The [[category of abelian groups]] forms a full subcategory of the [[category of groups]].
* The category of [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]] (whose morphisms are [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]]-preserving ring homomorphisms) forms a non-full subcategory of the category of [[Rng_(algebra)|rngs]].

== Embeddings ==
Given a subcategory ''S'' of ''C'' the inclusion [[functor]] ''I'' : ''S'' → ''C'' is both a [[faithful functor|faithful]] functor and [[Injective function|injective]] on objects. It is [[full functor|full]] if and only if ''S'' is a full subcategory.

Some authors define an '''embedding''' to be a [[full and faithful functor]]. Such a functor is necessarily injective on objects up-to-isomorphism. For instance, the [[Yoneda embedding]] is an embedding in this sense.

Some authors define an '''embedding''' to be a full and faithful functor that is injective on objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jaap van Oosten|title=Basic category theory|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~ooste110/syllabi/catsmoeder.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors define a functor to be an '''embedding''' if it is
faithful and
injective on objects.
Equivalently, ''F'' is an embedding if it is injective on morphisms. A functor ''F'' is then called a '''full embedding''' if it is a full functor and an embedding.

With the definitions of the previous paragraph, for any (full) embedding ''F'' : ''B'' → ''C'' the image of ''F'' is a (full) subcategory ''S'' of ''C'' and ''F'' induces an [[isomorphism of categories]] between ''B'' and ''S''. If ''F'' is not injective on objects, the image of ''F'' is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to ''B''.

In some categories, one can also speak of morphisms of the category being [[embedding#Category theory|embeddings]].

== Types of subcategories ==
A subcategory ''S'' of ''C'' is said to be '''[[isomorphism-closed subcategory|isomorphism-closed]]''' or '''replete''' if every [[isomorphism]] ''k'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in ''C'' such that ''Y'' is in ''S'' also belongs to ''S''. An isomorphism-closed full subcategory is said to be '''strictly full'''.

A subcategory of ''C'' is '''wide''' or '''lluf''' (a term first posed by [[Peter Freyd]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Freyd|first= Peter|authorlink=Peter J. Freyd  |year= 1991|month= |pages=95–104 |chapter= Algebraically complete categories|series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics |volume= 1488|publisher=Springer|title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Category Theory, Como, Italy (CT 1990)|doi=10.1007/BFb0084215}}&lt;/ref&gt;) if it contains all the objects of ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=wide+subcategory|title=Wide subcategory}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide subcategory is typically not full: the only wide full subcategory of a category is that category itself.

A '''Serre subcategory''' is a non-empty full subcategory ''S'' of an [[abelian category]] ''C'' such that for all short [[exact sequence]]s

:&lt;math&gt;0\to M'\to M\to M''\to 0&lt;/math&gt;

in ''C'', ''M'' belongs to ''S'' if and only if both &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;M''&lt;/math&gt; do. This notion arises from [[Localization of a category#Serre's C-theory|Serre's C-theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11106">'''Systematic desensitization''', also known as '''graduated exposure therapy''', is a type of [[cognitive behavior therapy]] developed by South African psychiatrist, [[Joseph Wolpe]]. It is used in the field of [[clinical psychology]] to help many  people effectively overcome [[phobias]] and other [[anxiety disorders]] that are based on [[classical conditioning]], and shares the  same elements of both [[cognitive psychology]] and [[applied behavior analysis]]. When used by the [[professional practice of behavior analysis|behavior analysts]], it is based on [[radical behaviorism]] and [[functional analysis (psychology)|functional analysis]], as it incorporates [[counterconditioning]] principles, such as meditation (a private behavior/[[covert conditioning]]) and breathing (which is a public behavior/overt conditioning). From the cognitive psychology perspective, however, cognitions and feelings trigger motor actions.

The process of systematic desensitization occurs in three steps. The first step of systematic desensitization is the identification of an anxiety inducing [[Exposure hierarchy|stimulus hierarchy]]. The second step is the learning of relaxation or coping techniques. When the individual has been taught these skills, he or she must use them in the third step to react towards and overcome situations in the established [[hierarchy]] of fears. The goal of this process is for the individual to learn how to cope with, and overcome the fear in each step of the hierarchy.

==Three steps of desensitization==
There are three main steps that Wolpe identified to successfully [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitize]] an individual.
#[[Exposure hierarchy|Establish anxiety stimulus hierarchy]]. The individual should first identify the items that are causing the anxiety problems. Each item that causes anxiety is given a subjective ranking on the severity of induced anxiety. If the individual is experiencing great anxiety to many different triggers, each item is dealt with separately. For each trigger or stimuli, a list is created to rank the events from least anxiety provoking to the greatest anxiety provoking.
#Learn the mechanism response. Relaxation training, such as meditation, is one type of  best coping strategies.  Wolpe taught his patients relaxation responses because it is not possible to be both relaxed and anxious at the same time. In this method, patients practice tensing and relaxing different parts of the body until the patient reaches a state of serenity.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, J. (1958). Psychotherapy by reciprocal inhibition. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is necessary because it provides the patient with a means of controlling their fear, rather than letting it increase to intolerable levels. Only a few sessions are needed for a patient to learn appropriate coping mechanisms. Additional coping strategies include anti-anxiety medicine and breathing exercises. Another example of relaxation is [[cognitive reappraisal]] of imagined outcomes. The therapist might encourage patients to examine what they imagine happening when exposed to the  anxiety-inducing stimulus and then allowing for the client to replace the imagined catastrophic situation with any of the imagined positive outcomes.
#Connect stimulus to the incompatible response or coping method by  counter conditioning. In this step the client completely relaxes and is then presented with the lowest item that was placed on their hierarchy of severity of anxiety phobias. When the patient has reached a state of serenity again after being presented with the first stimuli, the second stimuli that should present a higher level of anxiety is presented. This will help the patient overcome their phobia. This activity is repeated until all the items of the hierarchy of severity anxiety is completed without inducing any anxiety in the client at all . If at any time during the exercise the coping mechanisms fail  or became a failure, or the patient fails to complete the coping mechanism due to the severe anxiety, the exercise is then stopped. When the individual is calm, the last stimuli that is presented without inducing anxiety is presented again and the exercise is  then continued depending on the patient outcomes&lt;ref&gt;Mischel, W., Shoda, Y. &amp; Ayduk, O. Introduction to Personality. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
A client may approach a therapist due to their great phobia of snakes. This is how the therapist would help the client using the three steps of systematic desensitization:
#[[Exposure hierarchy|Establish anxiety stimulus hierarchy]]. A therapist may begin by asking the patient to identify a fear hierarchy. This fear hierarchy would list the relative unpleasantness of various levels of exposure to a snake. For example, seeing a picture of a snake might elicit a low fear rating, compared to live snakes crawling on the individual—the latter scenario becoming highest on the fear hierarchy.
#Learn coping mechanisms or incompatible responses. The therapist would work with the client to learn appropriate coping and relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep muscle relaxation responses.
#Connect the stimulus to the incompatible response or coping method. The client would be presented with increasingly unpleasant levels of the feared stimuli, from lowest to highest—while utilizing the deep relaxation techniques (i.e. progressive muscle relaxation) previously learned. The imagined stimuli to help with a phobia of snakes may include: a picture of a snake; a small snake in a nearby room; a snake in full view; touching of the snake, etc. At each step in the imagined progression, the patient is desensitized to the phobia through exposure to the stimulus while in a state of relaxation. As the fear hierarchy is unlearned, anxiety gradually becomes extinguished.

==Specific phobias==
[[Specific phobia]]s are one class of [[mental disorder]] often treated via systematic desensitization. When persons experience such phobias (for example fears of heights, dogs, snakes, closed spaces, etc.), they tend to avoid the feared stimuli; this avoidance, in turn, can temporarily reduce anxiety but is not necessarily an adaptive way of coping with it. In this regard, patients' avoidance behaviors can become reinforced – a concept defined by the tenets of [[operant conditioning]]. Thus, the goal of systematic desensitization is to overcome avoidance by gradually exposing patients to the phobic stimulus, until that stimulus can be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;Kazdin, A. E., &amp; Wilson, G.T. (1978). Evaluation of behavior therapy: Issues, evidence and research strategies. Cambridge, MA: Ballinger.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpe found that systematic desensitization was successful 90% of the time when treating phobias.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpe, J. ''The practice of behavior therapy.'' New York: Pergamon Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1947, Wolpe discovered that the cats of Wits University could overcome their fears through gradual and systematic exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Dubord, Greg. "Part 12. Systematic desensitization." Canadian Family Physician 57 (2011): 1299+. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpe studied [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s work on artificial [[Neurosis|neuroses]] and the research done on elimination of children's fears by Watson and Jones. In 1958, Wolpe did a series of experiments on the artificial induction of neurotic disturbance in cats. He found that gradually deconditioning the neurotic animals was the best way to treat them of their neurotic disturbances. Wolpe deconditioned the neurotic cats through different feeding environments. Wolpe knew that this treatment of feeding would not generalize to humans and he instead substituted relaxation as a treatment to relieve the anxiety symptoms.&lt;ref name = Rachman&gt;Rachman, S. Systematic Desensitization. ''Psychological Bulletin'' 67:2, 93–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolpe found that if he presented a client with the actual anxiety inducing stimulus, the relaxation techniques did not work. It was difficult to bring all of the objects into his office because not all anxiety inducing stimuli are physical objects, but instead are concepts. Wolpe instead began to have his clients imagine the anxiety inducing stimulus or look at pictures of the anxiety inducing stimulus, much like the process that is done today.&lt;ref name = Rachman/&gt;

==Recent use==
Desensitization is widely known as one of the most effective therapy techniques. In recent decades, systematic desensitization has been used less and less as a treatment of choice for anxiety disorders. Since 1970 academic research on systematic desensitization has declined, and the current focus has been on other therapies.  In addition, the number of clinicians using systematic desensitization has also declined since 1980. Those clinicians that continue to regularly use systematic desensitization were trained before 1986.  It is believed that the decrease of systematic desensitization by practicing psychologist is due to the increase in other techniques such as [[Flooding (psychology)|flooding]], implosive therapy, and [[Observational learning|participant modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;McGlynn, F., Smitherman, T., Gothard, K.. 2004 “Comment on the Status of Systematic Desensitization”. ''Behavior Modification'', 28: 2, pp. 194–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test anxiety==
Between 25 and 40 percent of students experience [[test anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassady, J.C. (2010). Test anxiety: Contemporary theories and implications for learning. In J.C. Cassady (Ed.), ''Anxiety in schools: The causes, consequences, and solutions for academic anxieties'' (pp. 7–26). New York, NY: Peter Lang,&lt;/ref&gt; Children can suffer from low self-esteem and stress induced symptoms as a result of test anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Deffenbacher, J., &amp; Hazaleus, S. (1985). Cognitive, emotional, and physiological components of test anxiety. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 9, 169180.&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of systematic desensitization can be used by children to help reduce their test anxiety. Children can practice the muscle relaxation techniques by tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. With older children and college students, an explanation of desensitization can help to increase the effectiveness of the process. After these students learn the relaxation techniques, they can create an anxiety inducing [[Exposure hierarchy|hierarchy]]. For test anxiety these items could include not understanding directions, finishing on time or marking the answers properly. Teachers, school counselors or school psychologists could instruct children on the methods of systematic desensitization.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. Sue &amp; Partridge, E. (1995).

In psychology, '''temperament''' broadly refers to consistent individual differences in behavior that are biologically based and are relatively independent of learning, system of values and attitudes. Some researchers point to association of temperament with formal dynamical features of behavior, such as energetic aspects, plasticity, sensitivity to specific reinforcers and emotionality.&lt;ref name=Tro&amp;Rusal/&gt; Temperament traits (such as Neuroticism, Sociability, Impulsivity, etc.) remain its distinct patterns in behavior throughout adulthood but they are most noticeable and most studied in children. Babies are typically described by temperament, but longitudinal research in the 1920s began to establish temperament as something which is stable across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman, Schustack|first1=Howard S., Miriam W.|title=Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research|date=2016|publisher=Pearson Education|location=USA|isbn=9780133829808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a broad definition of temperament is agreed upon, many classification schemes for temperament have been developed, and there is no consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kagan|first1=Jerome|title=Temperament|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/temperament/according-experts/temperament|website=Encyclopedia of Early Childhood Development|publisher=Encyclopedia of Early Childhood Development|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FET/&gt;

Historically, the concept of temperament (originally "temperamentums" in Latin means "mixtures") was a part of the theory of [[the four humors]], with their corresponding [[The four temperaments|four temperaments]].

This historical concept was explored by [[philosopher]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[psychiatrist]]s and psycho-physiologists from very early times of psychological science, with theories proposed by [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Hermann Lotze]], [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Gerardus Heymans]] among others.

More recently, scientists seeking evidence of a biological basis of personality have further examined the relationship between temperament and [[neurotransmitter system]]s&lt;ref&gt;Depue, R. &amp; Fu, Y. (2012) Neurobiology and neurochemistry of temperament in adults. In: Zentner, M. &amp; Shiner, R. (Eds.) Handbook of Temperament. NY: Guilford Publications, 368-399.

However, biological correlations have proven hard to confirm.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt;

==History and overview==
Temperament is determined through specific behavioral profiles, usually focusing on those that are both easily measurable and testable early in childhood. Commonly tested factors include traits related to energetic capacities (named as "Activity", "Endurance", "Extraversion"), traits related to emotionality (such as irritability, frequency of smiling), and approach or avoidance of unfamiliar events.&lt;ref name=Kagan&gt;{{citation|author=Jerome Kagan|title=Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FET/&gt; There is generally a low correlation between descriptions by teachers and behavioral observations by scientists of features used in determining temperament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14669903 |jstor=3696311|year=2003|last1=Bishop|first1=G|title=Can parents and teachers provide a reliable and valid report of behavioral inhibition?|journal=Child Development|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1899–917|last2=Spence|first2=S. H|last3=McDonald|first3=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperament is hypothesized to be associated with biological factors, but these have proven to be complex and diverse.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt;&lt;ref name=FET/&gt;

Historically, in the second century A.D., the physician [[Galen]] described four temperaments (melancholic, phlegmatic, sanguine and choleric) based upon the [[four humours]] or bodily fluids. These became known as the [[four humours|four classical temperaments]]. In more recent history, [[Rudolf Steiner]] had emphasized the importance of the [[four humours|four classical temperaments]] in elementary education, the time when he believed the influence of temperament on the personality to be at its strongest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/FourTemps/ForTem_index.html|title=The Four Temperaments: Lecture in Berlin|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf |year=1909|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=The Four Temperaments|isbn=978-0-910142-11-3|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Galen nor Steiner are generally applied to the contemporary study of temperament in the approaches of modern medicine or contemporary psychology.

== Main models ==

===Rusalov-Trofimova neurophysiological model of temperament===

This model is based on the longest tradition of neurophysiological experiments started within the investigations of types and properties of nervous systems by [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s school. This experimental tradition started on studies with animals in 1910-20s but expanded its methodology to humans since 1930s and especially since 1960s, including EEG, caffeine tests, evoked potentials, behavioral tasks and other psychophysiological methods.&lt;ref name=Rusal2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rusalov |first1=Vladimir |title=Functional systems theory and the activity-specific approach in psychological taxonomies |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=26 February 2018 |volume=373 |issue=1744 |pages=20170166 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2017.0166|pmid=29483350 |pmc=5832690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest version of this model is based on the "[[Activity-specific approach in temperament research]], on [[Alexander Luria]]'s research in clinical neurophysiology and on the neurochemical model [[Functional Ensemble of Temperament]].&lt;ref name=FET/&gt;&lt;ref name=TroRob/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tro2018/&gt; At the present time the model is associated with the [[Structure of Temperament Questionnaire]] and has 12 scales:
&lt;ref name=Tro&amp;Rusal&gt;{{cite book | year=2007|last1=Rusalov|first1=VM |last2= Trofimova | first2=IN|title=Structure of Temperament and Its Measurement. Toronto, Canada: Psychological Services Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tro1&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|title=An investigation into differences between the structure of temperament and the structure of personality |journal=American Journal of Psychology | volume=123 | issue=4| pages=467–480|doi=10.5406/amerjpsyc.123.4.0467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TroSulis&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|last2=Sulis| first2=W|title=Is temperament activity-specific?

====Endurance-related scales====
* Motor-physical Endurance: the ability of an individual to sustain prolonged physical activity using well-defined behavioral elements
* Social-verbal Endurance (sociability): the ability of an individual to sustain prolonged social-verbal activities using well-defined behavioral elements.
* Mental Endurance, or Attention: the ability to stay focused on selected features of objects with suppression of behavioral reactivity to other features.

====Scales related to speed of integration of behavior====
* Motor-physical Tempo: speed of integration of an action in physical manipulations with objects with well-defined scripts of actions
* Plasticity: the ability to adapt quickly to changes in situations, to change the program of action, and to shift between different tasks
* Social-verbal Tempo: the preferred speed of speech and ability to understand fast speech on well-known topics, reading and sorting of known verbal material

====Scales related to type of orientation of behavior====
* Sensation Seeking (SS): behavioral orientation to well-defined and existing sensational objects and events, underestimation of outcomes of risky behaviour.
* Empathy: behavioral orientation to the emotional states/needs of others (ranging from empathic deafness in autism and schizophrenia disorders to social dependency).
* Sensitivity to Probabilities: the drive to gather information about uniqueness, frequency and values of objects/events, to differentiate their specific features, to project these features in future actions.

====Emotionality scales====
* Satisfaction (Self-Confidence): A disposition to be satisfied with current state of events, a sense of security, confidence in the future. In spite of the optimism about outcomes of his or her activities, the respondent might be negligent in details.
* Impulsivity: Initiation of actions based on immediate emotional reactivity rather than by planning or rational reasoning.
* Neuroticism: A tendency to avoid novelty, unpredictable situations and uncertainty. Preference of well-known settings and people over unknown ones and a need for approval and feedback from people around.

===Kagan's research===

[[Jerome Kagan]] and his colleagues have concentrated empirical research on a temperamental category termed "reactivity." Four-month-old infants who became "motorically aroused and distressed" to presentations of novel stimuli were termed ''highly reactive''. Those who remained "motorically relaxed and did not cry or fret to the same set of unfamiliar events" were termed ''low reactive''.&lt;ref name=Kagan2&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1131931 | last1 = Kagan | first1 = J. | year = 1997 | title = Temperament and the reactions to unfamiliarity| journal = Child Development | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 139–143 | pmid = 9084130 | jstor = 1131931 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These high and low reactive infants were tested again at 14 and 21 months "in a variety of unfamiliar laboratory situations." Highly reactive infants were predominantly characterized by a profile of high fear to unfamiliar events, which Kagan termed inhibited. Contrastingly, low reactive children were minimally fearful to novel situations, and were characterized by an uninhibited profile (Kagan). However, when observed again at age 4.5, only a modest proportion of children maintained their expected profile due to mediating factors such as intervening family experiences. Those who remained highly inhibited or uninhibited after age 4.5 were at higher risk for developing anxiety and conduct disorders, respectively.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt;

Kagan also used two additional classifications, one for infants who were inactive but cried frequently (distressed) and one for those who showed vigorous activity but little crying (aroused). Followed to age 14–17 years, these groups of children showed differing outcomes, including some differences in central nervous system activity. Teenagers who had been classed as high reactives when they were babies were more likely to be "subdued in unfamiliar situations, to report a dour mood and anxiety over the future, [and] to be more religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30163598|title=The Preservation of Two Infant Temperaments into Adolescence|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=72|issue=2|pages=i–95|last1=Kagan|first1=Jerome|last2=Snidman|first2=Nancy|last3=Kahn|first3=Vali|last4=Towsley|first4=Sara|last5=Steinberg|first5=Laurence|last6=Fox|first6=Nathan A|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas and Chess's nine temperament characteristics===

Alexander Thomas, [[Stella Chess]], Herbert G. Birch, Margaret Hertzig and Sam Korn began the classic New York Longitudinal study in the early 1950s regarding infant temperament (Thomas, Chess &amp; Birch, 1968). The study focused on how temperamental qualities influence adjustment throughout life. Chess, Thomas et al. rated young infants on nine temperament characteristics, each of which, by itself, or with connection to another, affects how well a child fits in at school, with their friends, and at home. Behaviors for each one of these traits are on a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]]. If a child leans towards the high or low end of the scale, it could be a cause for concern. The specific behaviors are: activity level, regularity of [[sleep]]ing and [[eating]] patterns, initial reaction, adaptability, intensity of [[emotion]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], distractibility, persistence and [[attention span]], and sensory sensitivity. Redundancies between the categories have been found and a reduced list is normally used by psychologists today.&lt;ref name=IReview&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marcel |first1=Zentner, |last2=E. |first2=Bates, John |title=Child Temperament: An Integrative Review of Concepts, Research Programs, and Measures |journal=International Journal of Developmental Science |date=1 January 2008 |volume=2 |issue=1–2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.598.1517 |doi=10.3233/DEV-2008-21203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 65% of children fit one of the patterns. Of the 65%, 40% fit the easy pattern, 10% fell into the difficult pattern, and 15% were slow to warm up. Each category has its own strength and weakness and one is not superior to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rookieparenting.com/raising-children-temperament-personality/ | title=Raising Children – Temperament and Personality | publisher=Rookie Parenting | date=29 September 2014 | accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn showed that ''easy'' babies readily adapt to new experiences, generally display positive moods and emotions and also have normal eating and sleeping patterns. ''Difficult'' babies tend to be very emotional, irritable and fussy, and cry a lot. They also tend to have irregular eating and sleeping patterns. ''Slow-to-warm-up'' babies have a low activity level, and tend to withdraw from new situations and people. They are slow to adapt to new experiences, but accept them after repeated exposure.

Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn found that these broad patterns of temperamental qualities are remarkably stable through childhood. These traits are also found in children across all cultures.

Thomas and Chess also studied temperament and environment. One sample consisted of white middle-class families with high educational status and the other was of Puerto Rican working-class families. They found several differences. Among those were:&lt;ref name=psychpage/&gt;

- Parents of middle class children were more likely to report behavior problems before the age of nine and the children had sleep problems. This may be because children start preschool between the ages of three and four. Puerto Rican children under the age of five showed rare signs of sleep problems, however, sleep problems became more common at the age of six.
- Middle class parents also placed great stress on the child’s early development, believing that problems in early ages were indicative of later problems in psychological development, whereas Puerto Rican parents felt their children would outgrow any problems.
- At the age of nine, the report of new problems dropped for middle class children but they rose in Puerto Rican children, possibly due to the demands of school.

Observed traits:

* Activity: refers to the child's physical energy. Is the child constantly moving, or does the child have a relaxing approach? A high-energy child may have difficulty sitting still in class, whereas a child with low energy can tolerate a very structured environment. The former may use gross motor skills like running and jumping more frequently. Conversely, a child with a lower activity level may rely more on fine motor skills, such as drawing and putting puzzles together. This trait can also refer to mental activity, such as deep thinking or reading&amp;mdash;activities which become more significant as the person matures.
* Regularity: also known as ''rhythmicity'', refers to the level of predictability in a child’s biological functions, such as waking, becoming tired, hunger, and bowel movements. Does the child have a routine in eating and sleeping habits, or are these events more random?  For example, a child with a high regularity rating may want to eat at 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. every day, whereas a child lower on the regularity scale may eat at sporadic times throughout the day.
* Initial reaction: also known as ''approach or withdrawal''. This refers to how the child responds (whether positively or negatively) to new people or environments. Does the child approach people or things in the environment without hesitation, or does the child shy away? A bold child tends to approach things quickly, as if without thinking, whereas a cautious child typically prefers to watch for a while before engaging in new experiences.
* Adaptability: refers to how long it takes the child to adjust to change over time (as opposed to an initial reaction). Does the child adjust to the changes in their environment easily, or is the child resistant? A child who adjusts easily may be quick to settle into a new routine, whereas a resistant child may take a long time to adjust to the situation.
*Intensity: refers to the energy level of a positive or negative response. Does the child react intensely to a situation, or does the child respond in a calm and quiet manner? A more intense child may jump up and down screaming with excitement, whereas a mild-mannered child may smile or show no emotion.
* Mood: refers to the child’s general tendency towards a happy or unhappy demeanor. All children have a variety of emotions and reactions, such as cheerful and stormy, happy and unhappy. Yet each child biologically tends to have a generally positive or negative outlook. A baby who frequently smiles and coos could be considered a cheerful baby, whereas a baby who frequently cries or fusses might be considered a stormy baby.
*Distractibility: refers to the child’s tendency to be sidetracked by other things going on around them. Does the child get easily distracted by what is happening in the environment, or can the child concentrate despite the interruptions? An easily distracted child is engaged by external events and has difficulty returning to the task at hand, whereas a rarely distracted child stays focused and completes the task at hand.
*Persistence and attention span: refer to the child’s length of time on a task and ability to stay with the task through frustrations—whether the child stays with an activity for a long period of time or loses interest quickly.
*Sensitivity: refers to how easily a child is disturbed by changes in the environment. This is also called '''sensory threshold''' or '''threshold of responsiveness'''. Is the child bothered by external stimuli like noises, textures, or lights, or does the child seem to ignore them? A sensitive child may lose focus when a door slams, whereas a child less sensitive to external noises will be able to maintain focus.

===Mary K. Rothbart’s three dimensions of temperament===
[[Mary K. Rothbart]] views temperament as the individual personality differences in infants and young children that are present prior to the development of higher [[Cognition|cognitive]] and social aspects of [[Personality psychology|personality]].&lt;ref name="Rothbart and Hwang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rothbart, M.K  |author2=Hwang, J. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Temperament and the development of competence and motivation. In A.J. Elliot &amp; A.C. Dweck (Eds.), Handbook of competence and motivation|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York| year = 2005 |isbn=978-1-59385-606-9|pages=167–184|url=http://www.guilford.com/cgi-bin/cartscript.cgi?page=pr/elliot3.htm&amp;dir=pp/sapp&amp;cart_id=471466.23602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbart further defines temperament as individual differences in reactivity and self-regulation that manifest in the domains of emotion, activity and attention. Moving away from classifying infants into categories, Mary Rothbart identified three underlying dimensions of temperament.&lt;ref name="Kail and Barnfield"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kail RV, Barnfield A | title = Children and Their Development, Second Canadian Edition with MyDevelopmentLab | edition = | language = | publisher = Pearson Education Canada | location = Toronto | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-13-255770-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[factor analysis]] on data from 3 -12 month old children, three broad factors emerged and were labelled surgency/extraversion, negative affect, and effortful control.&lt;ref name="Rothbart and Hwang" /&gt;

====Surgency/extraversion====
[[Surgency]]/extraversion includes positive anticipation, [[impulsivity]], increased levels of activity and a desire for sensation seeking.&lt;ref name="Rothbart in Merrill"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothbart|first=M K|title=Temperament and the pursuit of an integrated developmental psychology|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|date=Oct 2004|volume=50|issue=4|pages=492–505|url=http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/mpq/vol50/iss4/7|doi=10.1353/mpq.2004.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; This factor reflects the degree to which a child is generally happy, active, and enjoys vocalizing and seeking stimulation.&lt;ref name="Kail and Barnfield" /&gt; Increased levels of smiling and laughter are observed in babies high in surgency/extraversion.&lt;ref name="Rothbart and Hwang" /&gt; 10- to 11-year-olds with higher levels of surgency/extraversion are more likely to develop externalizing problems like acting out; however, they are less likely to develop internalizing problems such as [[shyness]] and low [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=Ormel&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16300695|doi=10.1017/S0033291705005829|year=2005|last1=Ormel|first1=J|title=Internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescence: General and dimension-specific effects of familial loadings and preadolescent temperament traits|journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=35|issue=12|pages=1825–35|last2=Oldehinkel|first2=A.

K|last10=Verhulst|first10=F. C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Negative affect====
Negative affect includes [[fear]], [[frustration]], [[sadness]], discomfort,&lt;ref name="Rothbart in Merrill" /&gt; and [[anger]].&lt;ref name="Rothbart and Hwang" /&gt; This factor reflects the degree to which a child is shy and not easily calmed.&lt;ref name="Kail and Barnfield" /&gt; Anger and frustration is seen as early as 2 to 3 months of age. Anger and frustration, together, predict externalizing and internalizing difficulties. Anger, alone, is later related to externalizing problems, while fear is associated with internalizing difficulties.  Fear as evidenced by behavioural inhibition is seen as early as 7–10 months of age, and later predicts children's fearfulness and lower levels of [[aggression]].&lt;ref name="Rothbart, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothbart|first=M. K.|title=Temperament, development and personality|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=207–212|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00505.x|url=http://brainstormquestions.wikispaces.com/file/view/Rothbart+-+Temperament,+Development+and+Personality.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effortful control====
Effortful control includes the focusing and shifting of [[attention]], inhibitory control, perceptual sensitivity, and a low threshold for pleasure.&lt;ref name="Rothbart in Merrill" /&gt; This factor reflects the degree to which a child can focus attention, is not easily distracted,&lt;ref name="Kail and Barnfield" /&gt; can restrain a dominant response in order to execute a non-dominant response, and employ planning. When high in effortful control, six- to seven-year-olds tend to be more [[Empathy|empathetic]] and lower in aggressiveness.&lt;ref name="Rothbart in Merrill" /&gt; Higher levels of effortful control at age seven also predict lower externalizing problems at age 11 years.&lt;ref name=Valiente&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14633062|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.7106011|year=2003|last1=Valiente|first1=C|title=The relations of effortful control and reactive control to children's externalizing problems: A longitudinal assessment|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1171–96|last2=Eisenberg|first2=N|last3=Smith|first3=C. L|last4=Reiser|first4=M|last5=Fabes|first5=R. A|last6=Losoya|first6=S|last7=Guthrie|first7=I. K|last8=Murphy|first8=B. C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children high on negative affect show decreased internalizing and externalizing problems when they are also high on effortful control.&lt;ref name="Rothbart, 2007" /&gt; Rothbart suggests that effortful control is dependent on the development of executive attention skills in the early years. In turn, executive attention skills allows greater self-control over reactive tendencies. Effortful control shows stability from infancy into the school years&lt;ref name="Rothbart, 2007" /&gt; and also predicts [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Kochanska et al"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10749079|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.36.2.220|year=2000|last1=Kochanska|first1=G|title=Effortful control in early childhood: Continuity and change, antecedents, and implications for social development|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=36|issue=2|pages=220–32|last2=Murray|first2=K. T|last3=Harlan|first3=E. T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon Diamond described temperaments based upon characteristics found in the animal world: fearfulness, aggressiveness, affiliativeness, and impulsiveness. His work has been carried forward by [[Arnold Buss]] and [[Robert Plomin]], who developed two measures of temperament: The Colorado Child Temperament Inventory, which includes aspects of Thomas and Chess's schema, and the [[EAS Survey for Children]].&lt;ref name=IReview/&gt;

H. Hill Goldsmith and Joseph Campos used emotional characteristics to define temperament, originally analyzing five emotional qualities: motor activity, anger, fearfulness, pleasure/joy, and interest/persistence, but later expanding to include other emotions. They developed several measures of temperament: Lab-TAB and TBAQ.&lt;ref name=IReview/&gt;

Other temperament systems include those based upon theories of adult temperament (e.g. Gray and Martin's Temperament Assessment Battery for Children), or adult personality (e.g.the Big Five personality traits).

==Temperament vs. psychiatric disorders ==

Several psychiatrists and differential psychologists have suggested that temperament and mental illness represent varying degrees along the same continuum of neurotransmitter imbalances in neurophysiological systems of behavioural regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rstb.2017.0168|pmid=29483352|pmc=5832692|title=Assessing the continuum between temperament and affective illness: Psychiatric and mathematical perspectives|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=373|issue=1744|pages=20170168|year=2018|last1=Sulis|first1=W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4370336|year=2014|last1=Watson|first1=D|title=Personality, Emotions, and the Emotional Disorders|journal=Clinical Psychological Science|volume=2|issue=4|pages=422–442|last2=Naragon-Gainey|first2=K|doi=10.1177/2167702614536162|pmid=25815243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/s12888-018-1695-x|pmid=29747614|pmc=5946468|title=There is more to mental illness than negative affect: Comprehensive temperament profiles in depression and generalized anxiety|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=18|issue=1|pages=125|year=2018|last1=Trofimova|first1=I.|last2=Sulis|first2=W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the original four types of temperament (choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic and sanguine) suggested by [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]] resemble mild forms of types of psychiatric disorders described in modern classifications. Moreover, Hippocrates-Galen hypothesis of chemical imbalances as factors of consistent individual differences has also been validated by research in neurochemistry and psychopharmacology, though modern studies attribute this to different compounds. Many studies have examined the relationships between temperament traits (such as impulsivity, sensation seeking, neuroticism, endurance, plasticity, sociability or extraversion) and various neurotransmitter and hormonal systems, (i.e. the very same systems implicated in mental disorders)

Even though temperament and psychiatric disorders can be presented as, correspondingly, weak and strong imbalances within the same regulatory systems, it is incorrect to say that temperament is a weak degree of these disorders. Temperament might be a disposition to develop a mental disorder, but it should not be treated as a guaranteed marker for disorders.

==Family life==

===Influences===
Most experts agree that temperament has a [[genetics|genetic]] and [[biology|biological]] basis, although environmental factors and maturation modify the ways a child's personality is expressed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEU-az-NzTc Development of Temperament Symposium (2008). Philoctetes Center, New York; with panelists Sue Carter, Francis Champagne, [[Susan Coates]], Ed Nercessian, Donald Pfaff, [[Daniel Schechter]], Nadia Bruschweiler Stern]&lt;/ref&gt; The term “goodness of fit” refers to the match or mismatch between temperament and other personal characteristics and the specific features of the environment. Differences of temperament or behavior styles between individuals are important in family life. They affect the interactions among family members. While some children can adapt quickly and easily to family routines and get along with siblings, others who are more active or intense may have a difficult time adjusting. The interactions between these children and their parents or siblings are among a number of factors that can lead to stress and friction within the family.

The temperament mix between parents and children also affects family life.  For example, a slow-paced parent may be irritated by a highly active child; or if both parent and child are highly active and intense, conflict could result. This knowledge can help parents figure out how temperaments affect family relationships. What may appear to be a behavioral problem may actually be a mismatch between the parent’s temperament and their child’s. By taking a closer look at the nine traits that Thomas and Chess revealed from their study, parents can gain a better understanding of their child’s temperament and their own. Parents may also notice that situational factors cause a child's temperament to seem problematic; for example, a child with low rhythmicity can cause difficulties for a family with a highly scheduled life, and a child with a high activity level may be difficult to cope with if the family lives in a crowded apartment upstairs from sensitive neighbors.

Parents can encourage new behaviors in their children, and with enough support a ''slow-to-warm-up'' child can become less shy, or a ''difficult'' baby can become easier to handle. More recently infants and children with temperament issues have been called "spirited" to avoid negative connotations of "''difficult''" and "''slow to warm up''". Numerous books have been written advising parents how to raise their spirited youngsters.

===Understanding for improvement===
Understanding a child’s temperament can help reframe how parents interpret children’s behavior and the way parents think about the reasons for behaviors. By parents having access to this knowledge now helps them to guide their child in ways that respect the child’s individual differences. By understanding children’s temperaments and our own helps adults to work with them rather than try to change them. It is an opportunity to anticipate and understand a child’s reaction. It is also important to know that temperament does not excuse a child’s unacceptable behavior, but it does provide direction to how parents can respond to it. Making small and reasonable accommodations to routines can reduce tension. For example, a child who is slow-paced in the mornings may need an extra half-hour to get ready. Knowing who or what may affect the child’s behavior can help to alleviate potential problems. Although children obtain their temperament behaviors innately, a large part that helps determine a child's ability to develop and act in certain ways is determined by the parents. When a parent takes the time to identify and more importantly respond to the temperaments they are faced with in a positive way it will help them guide their child in trying to figure out the world.

Recognizing the child’s temperament and helping them to understand how it impacts his/her life as well as others is important. It is just as important for parents to recognize their own temperaments. Recognizing each individual’s temperament, will help to prevent and manage problems that may arise from the differences among family members.

Temperament continues into adulthood, and later studies by Chess and Thomas have shown that these characteristics continue to influence behavior and adjustment throughout the life-span.

In addition to the initial clinical studies, academic psychologists have developed an interest in the field and researchers such as Bates, Buss &amp; Plomin, [[Jerome Kagan|Kagan]], [[Vladimir Rusalov|Rusalov]], [[Robert Cloninger|Cloninger]], Trofimova and Rothbart have generated large bodies of research in the areas of [[personality psychology|personality]], [[neuroscience]], and [[behavioural genetics|behavioral genetics]].

[[The Buddha]] identified the '''threefold training''' (''sikkhā'')&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Anguttara Nikaya]] Book of Threes' (''Tikanipata'') Monks chapter (''Samanavagga'').  This chapter's [[Sūtra|sutta]]s are alternately identified as AN 3:82 to 3:92.  Of these suttas, the two most widely translated into English are AN 3:88 and 3:89, respectively referred to as "Sikkha (1)" and "Sikkha (2)" by [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], and as "Dutiyasikkhasuttam" and "Tatiyasikkhasuttam" in the Sinhalese canon.  English translations of these latter two suttas can be found in: Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi (1999), pp. 69-71; Thanissaro (1998a); and, Thanissaro (1998b).

|}
&lt;/ref&gt; as training in:
* higher [[Śīla|virtue]] (''adhisīla-sikkhā'')
* higher [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|mind]] (''adhicitta-sikkhā'')
* higher [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (''adhipaññā-sikkhā'')

== In the Pali Canon ==

According to [[Theravada]] [[Pali Canon|canonical texts]], pursuing this training leads to the abandonment of [[kilesa|lust, hatred, and delusion]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.088.than.html AN 3:88] (Thanissaro, 1998a).&lt;/ref&gt;  One who is fully accomplished in this training attains [[Nibbana]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.089.than.html AN 3.89] (Thanissaro, 1998b).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Anguttara Nikaya]], training in "higher virtue" includes following the [[Patimokkha]], training in "higher mind" (sometimes simply referred to as "concentration") includes entering and dwelling in the four [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]], and training in "higher wisdom" includes directly perceiving the [[Four Noble Truths]] or knowledge of destruction of the taints. &lt;ref&gt;AN 3.85, [https://suttacentral.net/en/an3.89 AN 3.89], [https://suttacentral.net/en/an3.90 AN 3.90]&lt;/ref&gt;

In several [[Pali Canon|canonical]] discourses, a more "gradual" instruction (''[[anupubbikatha|anupubbikathā]]'') is provided to receptive lay people (see also, [[gradual training]]).  This latter instruction culminates in the teaching of the Four Noble Truths which in itself concludes with the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], the constituents of which can be mapped to this threefold training (see below).

=== Similarity to threefold partition of the Noble Eightfold Path ===
The Buddha's threefold training is similar to the threefold grouping of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] articulated by [[Bhikkhuni]] Dhammadinna in Culavedalla Sutta ("The Shorter Set of Questions-And-Answers Discourse," [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 44): virtue (''sīlakkhandha''), concentration (''samādhikkhandha''), wisdom (''paññākkhandha '').&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro (1998c).&lt;/ref&gt;  These three-part schemes simplify and organize the [[Eightfold Path]] as follows:

{{Art and video games}}

'''Video game art''' is a specialized form of [[computer art]] employing [[video game]]s as the [[artistic medium]]. Video game art often involves the use of [[Patch (computing)|patched]] or [[Mod (video gaming)|modified video games]] or the repurposing of existing games or game structures, however it relies on a broader range of artistic techniques and outcomes than [[Art mod|artistic modification]] and it may also include painting, sculpture, appropriation, in-game intervention and performance, sampling, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/936302522|title=Works of Game.|last=John.|first=Sharp,|date=2016-01-01|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262029070|oclc=936302522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876434897|title=Videogames and Art|last=Andy,|first=Clarke,|last2=Grethe,|first2=Mitchell,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Intellect|isbn=9781841504193|oclc=876434897}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It may also include the creation of [[art game]]s either from scratch or by modifying existing games. Notable examples of video game art include [[Cory Arcangel]]'s "Super Mario Clouds" and "I Shot Andy Warhol,"&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;Andy Clarke and Grethe Mitchell (eds.),''Videogames and Art'' (Intellect Books, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Delappe]]'s projects including "Dead in Iraq" and the "Salt Satyagraha Online: Gandhi's March to Dandi in Second Life,"&lt;ref&gt;Mail Away: War Correspondence at Home and Away, by Lindsay Kelley, in the Media-N Journal of the New Media Caucus {{cite web|url=http://www.newmediacaucus.org/html/journal/issues.php?f%3Dpapers%26time%3D2009_summer%26page%3Dkelley |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518135157/http://www.newmediacaucus.org/html/journal/issues.php?f=papers&amp;time=2009_summer&amp;page=kelley |archivedate=May 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Salt Satyahgraha by Joseph Delappe - review by Natasha Chuk, in Furtherfield http://www.furtherfield.org/netbehaviour/salt-satyagraha-joseph-delappe-review-natasha-chuk&lt;/ref&gt; the 2004-2005 Rhizome Commissions "relating to the theme of games,"&lt;ref&gt;Rhizome Commissions http://rhizome.org/commissions/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paolo Pedercini]]'s [[Molleindustria]] games such as "Unmanned" and "[[Every Day the Same Dream]]", and [[Ian Bogost]]'s "[[Cow Clicker|Cowclicker]]."

Artistic modifications are frequently made possible through the use of [[level editor]]s, though other techniques exist. Some artists make use of [[machinima]] applications to produce non-interactive animated artworks, however artistic modification is not synonymous with machinima as these form only a small proportion of artistic modifications.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Machinima is distinct from art mods as it relies on different tools, though there are many similarities with some art mods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Like video games, artistic game modifications are often interactive and may allow for single-player or multiplayer experience. Multiplayer works make use of networked environments to develop new kinds of interaction and collaborative art production.

==Techniques==
===Machinima===
{{Main|Machinima}}
[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|Right|[[Machinima]] filmed in [[Second life]]]]

Machinima is the use of real-time [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] (3-D) graphics [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] engines to generate [[computer animation]]. The term also refers to works that incorporate this animation technique.

===In-game intervention and performance===
Artists may intervene in online games in a non-play manner, often disrupting games in progress in order to challenge or expose underlying conventions and functions of game play. Examples of this include [[Anne Marie Schleiner]]'s ''Velvet-Strike'' (a project designed to allow players of realistic first person shooter games to use anti-war graffiti within the game to make an artistic statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensorcery.net/velvet-strike |title=Velvet-Strike |publisher=Opensorcery.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Dead in Iraq'' (an art project created by Joseph DeLappe in which the player character purposely allows himself to be shot and then recites the names of US soldiers who have died in the Iraq War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unr.edu/art/DELAPPE/Gaming/Dead_In_Iraq/dead_in_iraq%20JPEGS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206122903/http://www.unr.edu/art/DELAPPE/Gaming/Dead_In_Iraq/dead_in_iraq%20JPEGS.html |archivedate=December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Site-specific installations and site-relative mods===
[[Site-specific art|Site-specific]] [[Installation art|installations]] and site-relative [[Mod (computer gaming)|gaming modifications]] ("mods"), replicate real-world places (often the art gallery in which they are displayed) to explore similarities and differences between real and virtual worlds. An example is ''What It Is Without the Hand That Wields It'', where blood from kills in Counterstrike manifests and spills into a real life gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=8/23/06 4:15pm 8/23/06 4:15pm |url=http://kotaku.com/375624/a-counter+strike-game-that-spills-real-fake-blood |title=People Actually Lamer Than Stuart Scott Rip On Stuart Scott |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real-time performance instruments===
Video games can be incorporated into live audio and visual performance using a variety of instruments and computers such as keyboards embedded with music chips.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} See also [[chiptune]] and the [[Fijuu]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fijuu.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017041501/http://fijuu.com/ |archivedate=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generative art mods===
Generative art mods exploit the real-time capabilities of game technologies to produce ever-renewing autonomous artworks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Examples include [[Julian Oliver]]'s ''[[ioq3apaint]]'', a generative painting system that uses the actions of software agents in combat to drive the painting process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver |first=Julian |url=http://julianoliver.com |title=Julian Oliver |publisher=Julian Oliver |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://selectparks.net/~julian/ioq3apaint ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512053311/http://selectparks.net/~julian/ioq3apaint |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alison Mealy]]'s ''[[UnrealArt]]'' which takes the movements of game entities and uses them to control a drawing process in an external program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=風紀委員 posted by alisonmealey.com on 2014年2月20日 |url=http://alisonmealey.com |title=色々な風俗がありますが全部が魅力的すぎます |publisher=Alisonmealey.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrealart.co.uk |title=will be back online soon |publisher=Unreal Art |date=2014-01-16 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kent Sheely]]'s "Cities in Flux," a [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] mod that glitches and distorts the game's world in real-time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentsheely.com/dpad2012 |title=Viewer-generated screenshots: "Cities in Flux" – D-Pad Toronto 2012 // kent sheely |publisher=Kentsheely.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[RetroYou]]'s ''[[R/C Racer]]'' a modification of the graphic elements of a racing game which results in rich fields of colour and shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retroyou.org |title=full void |publisher=Retroyou.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retroyou.org/rc.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611041938/http://www.retroyou.org/rc.html |date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Vitruvian Man''''' ({{lang-it|'''Le proporzioni del corpo umano secondo Vitruvio'''}}, which is translated to "The proportions of the human body according to Vitruvius"), or simply '''''L'Uomo Vitruviano''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈlwɔːmo vitruˈvjaːno}}), is a [[drawing]] made by the Italian polymath [[Leonardo da Vinci]] around 1490.&lt;ref&gt;The Secret Language of the Renaissance – Richard Stemp&lt;/ref&gt; It is accompanied by notes based on the work of the architect [[Vitruvius]]. The drawing, which is in ink on paper, depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square. The drawing and text are sometimes called the ''Canon of Proportions'' or, less often, ''Proportions of Man''. It is kept in the Gabinetto dei disegni e stampe of the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], under reference 228. Like most works on paper, it is displayed to the public only occasionally, so it is not part of the normal exhibition of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leonardodavinci.stanford.edu/submissions/clabaugh/history/leonardo.html |title=The Vitruvian man |publisher=Leonardodavinci.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://witcombe.sbc.edu/davincicode/leonardo-vitruvian-man.html |title=Da Vinci's Code |publisher=Witcombe.sbc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drawing is based on the correlations of ideal human [[body proportions]] with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] in Book III of his treatise ''[[De architectura]]''. Vitruvius described the human figure as being the principal source of proportion among the [[classical order]]s of architecture. Vitruvius determined that the ideal body should be eight heads high. Leonardo's drawing is traditionally named in honor of the architect.

==Subject and title==
This image demonstrates the blend of [[mathematics and art]] during the [[Renaissance]] and demonstrates Leonardo's deep understanding of [[body proportions|proportion]]. In addition, this picture represents a cornerstone of Leonardo's attempts to relate man to nature. [[Encyclopædia Britannica|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' online]] states, "Leonardo envisaged the great picture chart of the human body he had produced through his anatomical drawings and ''Vitruvian Man'' as a ''cosmografia del minor mondo'' ([[cosmography]] of the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]). He believed the workings of the human body to be an analogy for the workings of the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci/Anatomical-studies-and-drawings|title=Leonardo da Vinci|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|first=Ludwig Heinrich|last=Heydenreich|date=2017-04-30|accessdate=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Leonardo's preview in the accompanying text, written in [[mirror writing]], it was made as a study of the proportions of the (male) human body as described in [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]'' 3.1.2–3, which reads:
{{quote|For the human body is so designed by nature that the face, from the chin to the top of the forehead and the lowest roots of the hair, is a tenth part of the whole height; the open hand from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger is just the same; the head from the chin to the crown is an eighth, and with the neck and shoulder from the top of the breast to the lowest roots of the hair is a sixth; from the middle of the breast to the summit of the crown is a fourth. If we take the height of the face itself, the distance from the bottom of the chin to the under side of the nostrils is one third of it; the nose from the under side of the nostrils to a line between the eyebrows is the same; from there to the lowest roots of the hair is also a third, comprising the forehead. The length of the foot is one sixth of the height of the body; of the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth of the breast is also one fourth. The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and it was by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of antiquity attained to great and endless renown.

Similarly, in the members of a temple there ought to be the greatest harmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the general magnitude of the whole. Then again, in the human body the central point is naturally the navel. For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of plane surfaces which are perfectly square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/29239-h.htm#Page_72 |title=Ten Books on Architecture. Book III, Chapter I, "On Symmetry: In Temples And In The Human Body" |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leonardo's drawing combines a careful reading of the ancient text with his own observation of actual human bodies. In drawing the circle and square he observes that the square cannot have the same centre as the circle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/library/weekly/bl_leo_vitruvian_man.htm|title=The Vitruvian Man - Leonardo Da Vinci|website=About.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412011914/http://arthistory.about.com/library/weekly/bl_leo_vitruvian_man.htm|archivedate=12 April 2014|accessdate=20 November 2018|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is centered at the groin.&lt;ref name=secrets&gt;{{cite episode|title=Leonardo: The Man Who Saved Science|series=[[Secrets of the Dead]]|network=PBS|date=5 April 2017|season=16|number=5|minutes=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adjustment is the innovative part of Leonardo's drawing and what distinguishes it from earlier illustrations. He also departs from Vitruvius by drawing the arms raised to a position in which the fingertips are level with the top of the head, rather than Vitruvius's much lower angle, in which the arms form lines passing through the navel.

The drawing itself is often used as an implied symbol of the essential [[Bilateria|symmetry of the human body]], and by extension, the symmetry of the [[universe]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewholeuniversebook.com/2/page2.html |title=Bibliographic reference|publisher=The Whole Universe Book|date=|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be noticed by examining the drawing that the combination of arm and leg positions creates sixteen different poses. The pose with the arms straight out and the feet together is seen to be inscribed in the superimposed square. On the other hand, the "spread-eagle" pose is seen to be inscribed in the superimposed circle.

The drawing was purchased from Gaudenzio de' Pagave by [[Giuseppe Bossi]],&lt;ref name=bossi&gt;Bossi, Giuseppe (1810)[https://books.google.com/books?id=F8IhAQAAMAAJ ''Del Cenacolo di Leonardo da Vinci libri quattro''] (in Italian) Milano: Stamperia Reale p.208''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; who described, discussed and illustrated it in his monograph on Leonardo's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'', ''Del Cenacolo di Leonardo da Vinci libri quattro'' (1810).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ursusbooks.com/item94345.html |title=Bibliographic reference |publisher=Ursusbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he excerpted the section of his monograph concerned with the ''Vitruvian Man'' and published it as ''Delle opinioni di Leonardo da Vinci intorno alla simmetria de'Corpi Umani'' (1811), with a dedication to his friend [[Antonio Canova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3459 |title=Bibliographical notice, no. 319 |publisher=Lib.rochester.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107113208/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3459 |archivedate=7 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bossi's death in 1815 the ''Vitruvian Man'' was acquired in 1822, along with a number of his drawings, by the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, Italy, and has remained there since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.venezia.net/12/09/2013/venice-accademia-gallery-leonardo-da-vinci-universal-man.html |title=LEONARDO DA VINCI.

[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s collaboration with the author of ''[[De divina proportione]]'' (''On the Divine Proportion'')&lt;ref&gt;''Leonardo da Vinci's Polyhedra'', by [[George W.

==Evidence of collaboration==
Many artists attempted to design figures which would satisfy Vitruvius' claim that a human could fit into both a circle and a square.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46204318/ns/technology_and_science-science/|title=Did Leonardo da Vinci copy his famous 'Vitruvian Man'?|last=Wolchover|first=Natalie|date=31 January 2012|website=NBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319004214/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46204318/ns/technology_and_science-science/|archivedate=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smiths&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/The-Other-Vitruvian-Man.html?c=y&amp;story=fullstory|title=The Other Vitruvian Man|last=Lester|first=Toby|publisher=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]|date=1 February 2012|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo may have been influenced by the work of his friend [[Iacomo Andrea|Giacomo Andrea de Ferrara]], a Renaissance architect and an expert on Vitruvius. Andrea's drawing features erasure marks indicating its unique creation.&lt;ref name=smiths/&gt;&lt;ref name=secrets/&gt; As with Leonardo's ''Vitruvian Man'', Andrea's circle is centered on the naval, but only one pose is included. Leonardo's design includes two sets of arms and legs to touch both the circle and the square.&lt;ref name=secrets/&gt;

==Translation of the text==
The text is in two parts, above&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=sopra/&gt; and below&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=sotto/&gt; the image. The upper part paraphrases Vitruvius:
{{quote|Vetruvio, architect, puts in his work on architecture that the measurements of man are in nature distributed in this manner: that is a [[palm (unit)|palm]] is four fingers, a [[foot (unit)|foot]] is four palms, a [[cubit]] is six palms, four cubits make a man, a [[Pace (unit of length)|pace]] is four cubits, a man is 24 palms and these measurements are in his buildings.

If you open your legs enough that your head is lowered by one-fourteenth of your height and raise your hands enough that your extended fingers touch the line of the top of your head, know that the centre of the extended limbs will be the navel, and the space between the legs will be an equilateral triangle.}}

The lower section of text gives these proportions:
{{quote|The length of the outspread arms is equal to the height of a man; from the hairline to the bottom of the chin is one-tenth of the height of a man; from below the chin to the top of the head is one-eighth of the height of a man; from above the chest to the top of the head is one-sixth of the height of a man; from above the chest to the hairline is one-seventh of the height of a man. The maximum width of the shoulders is a quarter of the height of a man; from the breasts to the top of the head is a quarter of the height of a man; the distance from the elbow to the tip of the hand is a quarter of the height of a man; the distance from the elbow to the armpit is one-eighth of the height of a man; the length of the hand is one-tenth of the height of a man; the root of the penis is at half the height of a man; the foot is one-seventh of the height of a man; from below the foot to below the knee is a quarter of the height of a man; from below the knee to the root of the penis is a quarter of the height of a man; the distances from below the chin to the nose and the eyebrows and the hairline are equal to the ears and to one-third of the face.}}

The points determining these proportions are marked with lines on the drawing. Below the drawing is a single line equal to a side of the square and divided into four cubits, of which the outer two are divided into six palms each, two of which have the mirror-text annotation "palmi"; the outermost two palms are divided into four fingers each, and are each annotated "diti".

Until at least the 1960s, this group has dominated American society and culture and dominated in the leadership of the Whig and Republican parties. They usually are very well placed in major financial, business, legal and academic institutions and had close to a monopoly of elite society due to intermarriage and nepotism.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann 2004"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Kaufmann |first=Eric P. |editor=Kaufmann, E.P. |title=Rethinking Ethnicity: Majority Groups and Dominant Minorities |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London, New York |isbn=0-41-531542-5 |pages=61–83 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/Rethinking_Ethnicity.html?id=LotDtx2HUxMC&amp;pg=PA61 |chapter=The decline of the WASP in the United States and Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the latter half of the twentieth century, outsider ethnic and racial groups grew in influence and WASP dominance weakened. Americans are increasingly criticizing the WASP hegemony and disparaging WASPs as the epitome of "[[the Establishment]]". The ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' (1998) says the term is "Sometimes Disparaging and Offensive".&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.dictionary.com/browse/wasps "WASP"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph E.

==Etymology==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2018|reason=section has many unsourced generalizations}}
Historically, "[[Anglo-Saxon]]" referred to the language of indigenous inhabitants of England before 1066, especially in contrast to Norman French influence after that. Since the 19th century it has been in common use in the English-speaking world, but not in Britain itself (in this context), to refer to Protestants of principally English descent.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Kaufmann, "American exceptionalism reconsidered: Anglo-saxon ethnogenesis in the “universal” nation, 1776–1850." ''Journal of American Studies'' 33#3 (1999): 437-457.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "W" and "P" were added in the 1950s to form a humorous epithet with an undertone of "[[:wiktionary:waspishness|waspishness]]" (which means a person who is easily irritated and quick to take offense).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The first published mention of the term "WASP" was provided by political scientist [[Andrew Hacker]] in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hacker|first=Andrew|date=December 1957|title=Liberal Democracy and Social Control|url=|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the class of Americans that held "national power in its economic, political, and social aspects";&lt;ref name="Hacker 1957"/&gt; here the "W" stands for "wealthy" rather than "white":

{{quote |These 'old' Americans possess, for the most part, some common characteristics. First of all, they are {{nowrap|'WASPs'—in the}} cocktail party jargon of the sociologists. That is, they are wealthy, they are Anglo-Saxon in origin, and they are Protestants (and disproportionately [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]).&lt;ref name="Hacker 1957"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Hacker |title=Liberal Democracy and Social Control |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |year=1957 |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=1009–1026 |jstor=1952449}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term was popularized by sociologist and [[University of Pennsylvania]] professor [[E. Digby Baltzell]], himself a WASP, in his 1964 book ''The Protestant Establishment: Aristocracy and Caste in America.'' Baltzell stressed the closed or caste-like characteristic of the group by arguing that "There is a crisis in American leadership in the middle of the twentieth century that is partly due, I think, to the declining authority of an establishment which is now based on an increasingly castelike White-Anglo Saxon-Protestant (WASP) upper class."&lt;ref name="Baltzell 1964 9"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baltzell |title=The Protestant Establishment |year=1964 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used in Australia and Canada for similar elites.&lt;ref name="C.P. Champion 2010 48–49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Anglo-Saxon as a modern term===
The concept of "Anglo Saxon" and especially "Anglo Saxon Protestantism" evolved in the late 19th century, especially among American Protestant missionaries eager to transform the world. Historian Richard Kyle says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Protestantism had not yet split into two mutually hostile camps – the liberals and fundamentalists. Of great importance, evangelical Protestantism still dominated the cultural scene. American values bore the stamp of this Anglo-Saxon Protestant ascendancy. The political, cultural, religious, and intellectual leaders of the nation were largely of a Northern European Protestant stock, and they propagated public morals compatible with their background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Kyle|title=Evangelicalism: An Americanized Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wxAgETGXRaMC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2011|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before WASP came into use in the 1960s the term "Anglo Saxon" filled some of the same purposes. "Anglo-Saxons" by 1900 was often used as a synonym for all people of English descent and sometimes more generally, for all the English-speaking peoples of the world. It was often used in claims for the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race, much to the annoyance of outsiders. For example, [[Josiah Strong]] boasted in 1890:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1700 this race numbered less than 6,000,000 souls. In 1800, Anglo-Saxons (I use the term somewhat broadly to include all English-speaking peoples) had increased to about 20,500,000, and now, in 1890, they number more than 120,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Josiah Strong|title=Our country: its possible future and its present crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2ECAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA161|year=1885|publisher=American Home Missionary Society|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1893 Strong envisioned a future "new era" of triumphant Anglo-Saxonism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not reasonable to believe that this race is destined to dispossess many weaker ones, assimilate others, and mould the remainder until... it has Anglo-Saxonized mankind?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Josiah Strong|title=New era or the coming kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XK3ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA80|year=1893|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like the newer term "WASP," the old term "Anglo-Saxon" was used derisively by writers hostile to an informal alliance between Britain and the U.S. The negative use was especially common among [[Irish Americans]] and writers in France. "Anglo-Saxon", meaning in effect the whole [[Anglosphere]], remains a term favored by the French, used disapprovingly in contexts such as criticism of the [[Special Relationship]] of close diplomatic relations between the US and Britain and complaints about perceived "Anglo-Saxon" cultural or political dominance. It also remains in use in Ireland as a term for the British or English, and sometimes in [[Scottish Nationalist]] discourse. Irish-American humorist [[Finley Peter Dunne]] popularized the ridicule of "Anglo Saxon", even calling President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] one. Roosevelt insisted he was Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas F. Gossett|title=Race : The History of an Idea in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUucYTW6ug0C&amp;pg=PA319|year=1997|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=319, 439}}&lt;/ref&gt; "To be genuinely Irish is to challenge WASP dominance," argues California politician [[Tom Hayden]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hayden, ''Irish on the Inside: In Search of the Soul of Irish America'' (2003) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the Irish in the films of [[John Ford]] was a counterpoint to WASP standards of rectitude. "The procession of rambunctious and feckless Celts through Ford's films, Irish and otherwise, was meant to cock a snoot at WASP or '[[Lace curtain and shanty Irish|lace-curtain Irish]]' ideas of respectability."&lt;ref&gt;Luke Gibbons, Keith Hopper, and Gráinne Humphreys, ''The Quiet Man'' (2002) p 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, "Anglo" or "Anglo-Saxon" refers to people of English descent, while [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|"Anglo-Celtic"]] expands to include people of Irish, Welsh and Scottish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam Dixson|authorlink=Miriam Dixson|title=The Imaginary Australian: Anglo-Celts and Identity, 1788 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXTw9BTUIBMC&amp;pg=PA35|year=1999|publisher=UNSW Press|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, "Anglo-Saxon" refers to the combined impact of Britain and the United States on European affairs. [[Charles de Gaulle]] repeatedly sought to "rid France of Anglo-Saxon influence."&lt;ref&gt;John Newhouse, ''De Gaulle and the Anglo-Saxons'' (1970) pp 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; The term has had more nuanced uses in discussions by French writers on French decline, especially as an alternative model to which France should aspire, how France should adjust to its two most prominent global competitors, and how it should deal with social and economic modernization.&lt;ref name="Chabal 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |url=http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/echabal/ecanglosaxon.pdf |format=PDF |first=Emile |last=Chabal |title=The Rise of the Anglo-Saxon: French Perceptions of the Anglo-American World in the Long Twentieth Century |journal=French Politics, Culture &amp; Society'' |date=2013 |volume=31 |pages=24–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Anglophone countries the term "Anglo-Saxon" and its translations are used to refer to the Anglophone peoples and societies of Britain, the United States, and other countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Variations include the German: "Angelsachsen",&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.buchdienst-hohenrain.de/Sonderangebote-ab--2-/Winkelvoss-Peter-Die-Weltherrschaft-der-Angelsachsen.html Peter Winkelvoß, ''Die Weltherrschaft der Angelsachsen'' &amp;#91;''The world domination of the Anglo-Saxons''&amp;#93; (2014) ]&lt;/ref&gt; French: "le modèle anglo-saxon,"{{sfnp|Chabal|2013|p=35}} Spanish: "anglosajón",&lt;ref&gt;See [http://deconceptos.com/ciencias-sociales/anglosajon "Concepto de anglosajón"]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch: "Angelsaksisch model",&lt;ref&gt;see [[:nl:Angelsaksisch model|"Angelsaksisch model"]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian: "Paesi anglosassoni."&lt;ref&gt;See [[:it:Paesi anglosassoni|"Paesi anglosassoni"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other European ethnicities===

WASPs vary in exact Protestant denomination; they traditionally have been associated with [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] (or [[Anglican]]), [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian]], [[United Methodist Church|United Methodist]], [[United Church of Christ|Congregationalist]], and other [[mainline Protestant]] denominations, but the term has expanded to include various Protestant denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=James D. |last=Davidson |first2=Ralph E. |last2=Pyle |first3=David V. |last3=Reyes |title=Persistence and Change in the Protestant Establishment, 1930-1992 |journal=[[Social Forces]] |volume=74 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=157–175 [p. 164] |doi= 10.1093/sf/74.1.157|jstor=2580627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular usage of the term has sometimes expanded to include not just Anglo-Saxon or [[English-American]] elites but also people of other Protestant [[Northwestern Europe]]an origin, including Protestant [[Dutch Americans]], [[Anglo]]-[[Scottish people|Scottish Americans]],&lt;ref name="Kaufmann 2004"/&gt; [[German Americans]], and [[Scandinavian Americans]].{{refn|name=Glassman Swatos Denison}}&lt;ref name=huguenots&gt;Abraham D. Lavender, ''French Huguenots: From Mediterranean Catholics to White Anglo-Saxon Protestants'' (P. Lang, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist Charles H. Anderson writes, "Scandinavians are second-class WASPs" but know it is "better to be a second-class WASP than a non-WASP"&lt;ref name="Anderson 1970"&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Charles H. |title=White Protestant Americans: From National Origins to Religious Group |date=1970 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |isbn=0-13-957423-9 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/White_Protestant_Americans.html?id=ZhydLVyROPAC&amp;q=%22second-class+WASP%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey noted the expansion of the term's coverage beyond the academic community:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The term ''WASP'' has many meanings. In sociology it reflects that segment of the U.S. population that founded the nation and traced their heritages to...Northwestern Europe.

==WASP culture==
[[File:WashingtonNationalCathedralHighsmith15393v.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Washington National Cathedral]], the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] [[cathedral]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The WASP elite dominated much of politics and the economy, as well as the high culture, well into the 20th century. Anthony Smith argues that nations tend to be formed on the basis of a pre-modern ethnic core that provides the myths, symbols, and memories for the modern nation and that WASPs were indeed that core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p40195_index.html|title=The Decline of the WASP?: Anglo-Protestant Ethnicity and the American Nation-State|website=Allacademic.com|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; WASPs are still prominent at prep schools (expensive private high schools, primarily in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]), [[Ivy League]] universities, and prestigious liberal arts colleges, such as the [[Little Ivies]] or [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Epstein|title=Snobbery: The American Version|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sT2AahBWFIoC&amp;pg=PT73|year=2003|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], WASPs favored the [[University of Michigan]], [[Northwestern University]], and [[University of Chicago]]. In the Detroit area, WASPs dominated the wealth that came from the huge industrial capacity of the automotive industry. After the [[1967 Detroit riot]], they tended to congregate in the [[Grosse Pointe]] suburbs. In Chicago, they are present in the [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore suburbs]], the [[Barrington, Illinois|Barrington]] area in the northwest suburbs, and [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] and [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] in the western suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Richard Higley, ''Privilege, power, and place: The geography of the American upper class'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United State'' by [[Harriet Zuckerman]], a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American [[Nobel Prizes|Nobel Prize]] Laureates, have identified from [[Protestant]] background, compared to about 67% of the general population during that time period.&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HAHCzJfmD5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Scientific+Elite:+Nobel+Laureates+in+the+United+States&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMIxKistOqUxwIVzNUUCh0pGgC-#v=onepage&amp;q=Scientific%20Elite%3A%20Nobel%20Laureates%20in%20the%20United%20States&amp;f=false Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States]'' New York, The Free Pres, 1977, p.68: Protestants turn up among the American-reared laureates in slightly greater proportion to their numbers in the general population.

Like other ethnic groups, WASPs tend live in proximity to each other in close social circles. Neighborhoods and cities with large populations of WASPs are often the most sought after neighborhoods of the city. These areas are largely exclusive and [[upper class]] with top private and public schools, high family incomes, well established Christian church communities, and with high real estate values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Borrelli |first=Christopher |date=December 5, 2010 |title=The modern, evolving preppy |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-12-05/features/ct-sun-1205-preppy-20101205_1_lisa-birnbach-prep-lives-lillie-alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2018}}

===Protestantism and social values===
[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]], a columnist for ''The New York Times'' who attended an Episcopal prep school, writes that WASPs took pride in "good posture, genteel manners, personal hygiene, pointless discipline, the ability to sit still for long periods of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Brooks|title=The Paradise Suite: Bobos in Paradise and On Paradise Drive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGeNl2hYxHgC&amp;pg=PA22|year=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the essayist [[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]], WASPs developed a style of understated quiet leadership.&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{cite news |first=Joseph |last=Epstein |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-late-great-american-wasp-1387586625 |title=The Late, Great American WASP |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] and [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian]] WASPs tend to be considerably wealthier&lt;ref name="THE EPISCOPALIANS"/&gt; and better educated than most other religious groups in America,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American [[business]],&lt;ref name="Hacker 1957"/&gt; law and politics, and for many years were especially dominant in the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="Baltzell 1964 9"/&gt; A number of the [[Old money|wealthiest and most affluent American families]] ("Old Money"), such as the [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], [[Astor family|Astors]], [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], [[Du Pont family|Du Pont]], [[Roosevelt family|Roosevelts]], [[Forbes family|Forbes]], [[Whitney family|Whitneys]], the [[Junius Spencer Morgan|Morgans]] and Harrimans are mostly [[Mainline Protestant]] families in the [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopalian]], [[Presbyterian]], or other similar traditions.&lt;ref name="THE EPISCOPALIANS"/&gt;

A common practice of WASP families is presenting their daughters of marriagable age (traditionally at the age of 17 or 18 years old) at a [[Debutante|débutante ball]], such as [[International Debutante Ball|The International Debutante Ball]] at the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillaway|first=Diana|title=Power Failure: Politics, Patronage, and the Economic Future of Buffalo, New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UukOHtRoi9EC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2006|publisher=Prometheus Books|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ivy League and Seven Sisters===
[[File:HarvardElizaSusanQuincy1836.jpg|thumb|250px|upright=1.2|[[Harvard College]] was a favorite choice; the student body was overwhelmingly WASP well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerome Karabel|title=The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwf-Ofc--toC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2006|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Ivy League]] universities and [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] colleges have strong WASP historical ties, and their influence continues today. Until about World War II, Ivy League universities were composed largely of WASP students. As some of the nation's top colleges and universities, they still continue to be the university of choice for WASP families today. The [[Big Three (colleges)|Big Three]] ([[Harvard]], [[Yale]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] universities) have traditionally been the top three universities of choice for WASP families.

Admission to these colleges and universities is based on academic merit, but there is nonetheless a certain preference for "legacy" alumni. Students can form connections which carry over to the influential spheres of finance, culture, and politics. Many alumni from these schools go on to successful careers, continuing the WASP cultural and economic influence.&lt;ref&gt;Useem (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Register===
The social elite was a small, closed group. The leadership was well known to the readers of society pages, but in larger cities it was impossible to remember everyone, or to keep track of marriages and the new [[debutante]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Karal Ann Marling, ''Debutante: Rites and Regalia of American Debdom'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The solution was the ''[[Social Register]],'' which listed the names and addresses of about 1 percent of the population. Most were WASPs, and they included the families who mingled in the same private clubs, attended the right teas and [[cotillion]]s, worshipped together at prestige churches, funded the proper charities, lived in exclusive neighborhoods, and sent their daughters to finishing schools&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Pressly, "Educating the Daughters of Savannah's Elite: The Pape School, the Girl Scouts, and the Progressive Movement." ''Georgia Historical Quarterly'' (1996) 80#2 pp: 246-275. [http://www.juliettegordonlowbirthplace.org/wp-content/uploads/papeschool-ghq-pressley-1996.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; and their sons away to [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Cookson, Jr. and Caroline Hodges Persell, ''Preparing For Power: America's Elite Boarding Schools'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In the heyday of WASP dominance, the ''Social Register'' delineated high society. Its day has passed. The ''New York Times'' stated in 1997:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Once, the Social Register was a juggernaut in New York social circles....Nowadays, however, with the waning of the WASP elite as a social and political force, the register's role as an arbiter of who counts and who doesn't is almost an anachronism. In Manhattan, where charity galas are at the center of the social season, the organizing committees are studded with luminaries from publishing, Hollywood and Wall Street and family lineage is almost irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/21/style/the-social-register-just-a-circle-of-friends.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Social Register: Just a Circle of Friends | date=21 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Social Registers'' were designed as directories of the social elite in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia,&lt;ref&gt;The Philadelphia volume included [[Wilmington, Delaware]].&lt;/ref&gt; Pittsburgh, Portland (Oregon), Providence, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., as well as ones for "Southern Cities".&lt;ref&gt;examples may be found in [http://digital.library.umsystem.edu/cgi-bin/Ebind2h3/umsl7?seq=2 Page 2 of the 1925 Social Register of St. Louis, Missouri]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion===
In 2007, the ''New York Times'' reported that there was a rising interest in the WASP culture.&lt;ref name="NYTBookreview"/&gt; In their review of Susanna Salk's ''A Privileged Life: Celebrating WASP Style'', they stated that Salk "is serious about defending the virtues of WASP values, and their contribution to American culture."&lt;ref name="NYTBookreview"&gt;Liesl Schillinger, "Why, Bitsy, Whatever Are You Reading?" [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/fashion/10books.html?_r=0 ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, brands such as [[Lacoste]], [[Ralph Lauren Corporation|Ralph Lauren]] and [[Vineyard Vines]] and their logos became associated with the [[preppy]] fashion style which was associated with WASP culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2010/09/the-new-preppy-201009|title=The Official Preppy Reboot|first=Lisa|last=Birnbach|website=Vanityfair.com|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Founding Fathers represented a cross-section of 18th-century Patriot leadership. According to a study of the biographies of signers of the Declaration of Independence by [[Caroline Robbins]]: 
:The  Signers came for the most part from an educated elite, were residents of  older settlements, and belonged with a few exceptions to a moderately  well-to-do class representing only a fraction of the population. Native  or born overseas, they were of British stock and of the Protestant faith.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Robbins,  "Decision in '76: Reflections on the 56 Signers."

Catholics in the Northeast and the Midwest, usually [[Irish-American]], dominated [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] politics in big cities through the ward [[boss system]]. Catholic (or "white ethnic") politicians were often the target of WASP political hostility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838862,00.html "Are The Wasps Coming Back?

==Fading dominance==
Eric Kaufmann argues that "the 1920s marked the high tide of WASP control".{{sfnp|Kaufmann|2004|p=66}} In 1965 Canadian sociologist John Porter, in ''The Vertical Mosaic,'' argued that British origins were disproportionately represented in the higher echelons of Canadian class, income, political power, the clergy, the media etc. However, more recently Canadian scholars have traced the decline of the WASP elite.&lt;ref name="C.P.

In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) denied prominent black singer [[Marian Anderson]] permission to sing in Constitution Hall.

===Post-World War II===
According to Richard Schaeffer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of analysts have suggested that WASP dominance of the institutional order has become a thing of the past. The accepted wisdom is that after World War II, the selection of individuals for leadership positions was increasingly based on factors such as motivation and training rather than ethnicity and social lineage.&lt;ref name="Richard T. Schaefer, ed. 2008 1504"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard T.

It was not until after World War II that the general power of old Protestant establishments began to decline. Many reasons have been given for the decline of WASP power, and books have been written detailing it.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DB153EF934A25752C0A967958260 |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |title=The Decline of a Class and a Country's Fortunes |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=January 17, 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-imposed diversity incentives opened the country's most elite schools.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Zweigenhaft and G. William Domhoff, ''Diversity in the power elite: how it happened, why it matters'' (2006) pp. 242-3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GI Bill]] brought higher education to new ethnic arrivals, who found middle class jobs in the postwar economic expansion. Nevertheless, white Protestants remain influential in the country's cultural, political, and economic elite. Scholars supporting this idea{{Who|date=July 2018}} agree that the group's influence has waned since the end of World War II in 1945, with the growing influence of other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Kaufmann 2004"/&gt;

A notable event{{According to whom|date=July 2018}} within this decline was the election of [[John F. Kennedy]] as President of the United States in 1960, the only Catholic President of the United States. [[John F. Kennedy's election]] was the result of his father [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr]]'s tireless lifelong campaign to break the WASP hold on American society due in particular to their non acceptance of [[Irish Catholic|Irish Catholic Americans]]. John F. Kennedy's election was one of the closest presidential elections in US history and it is likely that Joseph P. Kennedy's great wealth which was funding the campaign was a decisive and essential factor.

In the federal [[civil service]], once dominated by those from a Protestant denomination (WASPs), especially in the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], Catholics and Jews made strong inroads after 1945. [[Georgetown University]], a Catholic school, made a systematic effort to place graduates in diplomatic career tracks. By the 1990s there were “roughly the same proportion of WASPs, Catholics, and Jews at the elite levels of the federal civil service, and a greater proportion of Jewish and Catholic elites among corporate lawyers.”&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman (2004) p 220 citing Lerner et al. ''American Elites,'' 1996）&lt;/ref&gt; The political scientist Theodore P. Wright, Jr. argues that while the Anglo ethnicity of the U.S. presidents from [[Richard Nixon]] through [[George W. Bush]] is evidence for the continued cultural dominance of WASPs, assimilation and social mobility along with the ambiguity of the term has led the WASP class to survive only by "incorporating other groups that it is no longer the same group" that existed in the mid-20th century.{{sfnp|Wright|2004|p=34}}

Prior to the late 20th century, all [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices were of WASP or Protestant [[Germanic Europe|Germanic]] heritage (with the exception of Jewish-American [[Louis Brandeis]], appointed in 1916, and [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], of [[Iberian Jewish]] descent, appointed in 1932.)&lt;ref name="Schmidhauser"&gt;John Richard Schmidhauser, ''Judges and justices: the Federal Appellate Judiciary'' (1979), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, an increasing number of non-WASP justices have been appointed to the Court. For the first time in U.S. history, after the 2010 retirement of [[John Paul Stevens]] (appointed 1975), the U.S. Supreme Court had no Protestant members until the appointment of [[Neil Gorsuch]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Robert. "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704414504575244622954114574 That Bright, Dying Star, the American WASP]." ''Wall Street Journal'' 15 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of California, Berkeley]], once a WASP stronghold, has changed radically: only 30% of its undergraduates in 2007 were of European origin (including WASPs and all other Europeans), and 63% of undergraduates at the University were from immigrant families (where at least one parent was an immigrant), especially Asian.&lt;ref&gt;John Aubrey Douglass, Heinke Roebken, and Gregg Thomson. "The Immigrant University: Assessing the Dynamics of Race, Major and Socioeconomic Characteristics at the University of California." (November 2007) [http://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/publications.php?id=291 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant shift of American economic activity toward the [[Sun Belt]] during the latter part of the 20th century, and an increasingly globalized economy have also contributed to the decline in power held by Northeastern WASPs. While WASPs are no longer solitary among the American elite, members of the Patrician class remain markedly prevalent within the current power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=James D. |last=Davidson |first2=Ralph E. |last2=Pyle |first3=David V. |last3=Reyes |title=Persistence and Change in the Protestant Establishment, 1930-1992 |journal=[[Social Forces]] |volume=74 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=157–175 [p. 164] |doi=10.1093/sf/74.1.157|jstor=2580627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other analysts have argued that the extent of the decrease in WASP dominance has been overstated. In response to increasing claims of fading WASP dominance, James D. Davidson, using data on American elites in political and economic spheres, concludes that, while the WASP and Protestant Establishment has lost some of its earlier prominence, WASPs and Protestants are still vastly overrepresented among America's elite.{{sfnp|Wright|2004|p=34}}&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davidson|first1=James D.|title=Religion Among America's Elite: Persistence and Change in the Protestant Establishment|journal=Sociology of Religion|date=December 1994|volume=55|issue=4|url=https://academic.oup.com/socrel/article-abstract/55/4/419/1625791/Religion-Among-America-s-Elite-Persistence-and|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, "WASP" is often a derogatory criticism based on snobbishness and exclusivity associated with [[social privilege]], such as restrictive membership in private social clubs.&lt;ref name="Richard T. Schaefer, ed. 2008 1504"/&gt; A number of popular jokes exist ridiculing this stereotype.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Holly E. |title=Writing Between Cultures: A Study of Hybrid Narratives in Ethnic Literature of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Writing_Between_Cultures.html?id=8RkzIPlLj90C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=WASP |year=2011 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C. |isbn=978-0-78-646660-3 |at=p. 117 (footnote)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally a writer praises the WASP contribution, as conservative historian [[Richard Brookhiser]] did in 1991 when he said the "uptight, bland, and elitist" stereotype obscures the "classic WASP ideals of industry, public service, family duty, and conscience to revitalize the nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Brookhiser |title=The Way of the WASP: How It Made America and How It Can Save It, So to Speak |publisher=Free Press |date=1991 |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-02-904721-7}}{{page needed |date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Tad Friend]], ''Cheerful Money: Me, My Family, &amp; the Last Days of Wasp Splendor'' (2009)(Author)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==

American films including ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Meet the Parents]]'' have used the conflicts between WASP families and urban Jewish families for potential comedic effect.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmington, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/06/entertainment/ca-47724 'Meet the Parents' Finds Success by Marrying Classic Themes to Modern Tastes], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 6, 2000. Accessed March 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1939 Broadway play ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'', later adapted into a Hollywood [[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|film released in 1944]], ridiculed the old American elite. The play and film depict "old-stock British Americans" a decade before they were tagged as WASPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Furman, Robert |title=Brooklyn Heights: The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of America's First Suburb |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BUfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22arsenic+and+old+lace%22 |year=2015 |publisher=History Press |location=Charleston, S.C. |isbn=978-1-62-619954-5 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=July 2018}}

The playwright [[A. R. Gurney]] (1930-2017), himself of WASP heritage, has written a series of plays that have been called "penetratingly witty studies of the WASP ascendancy in retreat."&lt;ref name="Teachout"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-cocktail-hour-review-anatomy-of-a-wasp-1452207925 |title=‘The Cocktail Hour’ Review: Anatomy of a WASP |first=Terry |last=Teachout |date=7 January 2016 |accessdate=14 December 2017 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Gurney told the ''Washington Post'' in 1982:

{{quote |WASPs do have a culture — traditions, idiosyncrasies, quirks, particular signals and totems we pass on to one another.  But the WASP culture, or at least that aspect of the culture I talk about, is enough in the past so that we can now look at it with some objectivity, smile at it, and even appreciate some of its values. There was a closeness of family, a commitment to duty, to stoic responsibility, which I think we have to say weren’t entirely bad.”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite news |first=Matt |last=Schudel |title=A.R. Gurney, playwright who portrayed the fading WASP culture, dies at 86 |work=The Washington Post |date=June 15, 2017 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ar-gurney-playwright-who-portrayed-the-fading-wasp-culture-dies-at-86/2017/06/15/c9d640ea-51d6-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Gurney's play ''The Cocktail Hour'' (1988), a lead character tells her playwright son that theater critics "don't like us.... They resent us. They think we're all Republicans, all superficial and all alcoholics. Only the latter is true."&lt;ref name="Teachout"/&gt;

'''''Who Speaks for the Negro?''''' is a 1965 book of interviews by [[Robert Penn Warren]] conducted with [[Civil Rights Movement]] activists.  The book was reissued by [[Yale University Press]] in 2014. The Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities at Vanderbilt University created the [https://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/ "''Who Speaks for the Negro?'' Digital Archive,"] featuring digitized versions of the original reel-to-reel recordings that Warren compiled for each of his interviewees as well as print materials related to the project, including the transcripts of those recordings, letters written between Warren and the interviewees, and contemporary reviews of the book.

==Interviews==

==Background==
In preparation for Random House's 1965 publication of his book ''Who Speaks for the Negro?'', Warren traveled throughout the United States in early 1964 and spoke with large numbers of men and women who were involved in the Civil Rights Movement. He interviewed nationally-known figures as well as people working in the trenches of the movement whose names might otherwise be lost to history. In each case, he recorded their conversations on a reel-to-reel tape recorder.

Often, Warren would begin by asking about the speakers' backgrounds, which often prompted them to talk about the inequalities that they had experienced that led to their participation in the Civil Rights Movement. Warren would also often ask the interviewees to respond to works from other writers, mainly [[W. E. B. Dubois]]'s ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'', [[Kenneth Clark (psychologist)|Kenneth Clark]]'s essays about the detrimental effects of segregation on children, [[Gunnar Myrdal]]'s ''The American Dilemma'', and [[James Baldwin]]'s ''[[Nobody Knows My Name]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=David W.|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=xvii-xviii|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Warren would ask his interviewees their opinion on a number of key historical American figures, including [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], and [[Robert E. Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=David W.|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=xx|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Warren was able to interview an impressive number of people, there are very few women in the collection, as well as some notable figures missing from the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] ([[Ralph Abernathy]], [[James Bevel]], [[Dorothy Cotton]], and [[Fred Shuttlesworth]]), the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] ([[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], [[Diane Nash]], [[Bernard Lafayette]], and [[Julian Bond]]), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=David W.|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=xx-xxi|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The published volume contains sections of transcripts from the conversations as well as Warren’s reflections on the individuals he interviewed and his thoughts on the state of the Civil Rights Movement. In the foreword to the volume, Warren insists on the book being a record of his desire to find out more about the Civil Rights Movement rather than an unbiased or comprehensive volume. Warren states in the foreword, {{quote | This book is not a history, a sociological analysis, an anthropological study, or a ''Who's Who'' of the Negro Revolution. It is a record of my attempt to find out what I could find out. It is primarily a transcript of conversations, with settings and commentaries. That is, I want to make my reader see, hear, and feel as immediately as possible what I saw, heard, and felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=Robert Penn|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an oral history of the Civil Rights Movement, ''Who Speaks'' may be compared to, among others, ''The New World of Negro Americans'' by [[Harold Isaacs]], ''My Soul is Rested: Movement Days in the Deep South Remembered'' by [[Howell Raines]], and ''My Soul Looks Back in Wonder: Voices of the Civil Rights Experience'' by [[Juan Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Isaacs|first1=Harold R.|title=The New World of Negro Americans|date=1964|publisher=Phoenix House|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raines|first1=Howell|title=My Soul Is Rested: Movement Days in the Deep South Remembered|date=1977|publisher=Putnam|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Juan|title=My Soul Looks Back in Wonder: Voices of the Civil Rights Experience|date=2004|publisher=AARP/Sterling|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''Who Speaks for the Negro?'' was reviewed widely by newspapers, cultural critics, and the general public. The tenor of the reviews varied greatly. Many news reviews—including those from the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''—gave the book very positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolbier|title=Review|first1=Maurice|journal=New York Herald Tribune|date=May 28, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coughlin|first1=Francis|title=Review|journal=Chicago Tribune|date=June 4, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Atlantic Monthly|date=July 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=Joseph|title=Review|journal=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|date=June 13, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Poore, in the ''New York Times,'' wrote that "a boon this book confers is to remind us that a main thrust in civilization can never cease to be toward decency and courtesy and justice for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poore|first1=Charles|title=Review|journal=New York Times|date=June 1, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Warren received hate-mail from writers accusing him of "Communist 'propaganda' [and] advocacy of 'racial mixing.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=David W.|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=xxvi|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Newsweek]]'' article called Warren "paternalistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Newsweek|date=June 7, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; More moderately, Albert Murray called ''Who Speaks'' the "very best inside report on the Negro Civil Rights Movement by anyone so far" while still acknowledging Warren's segregationist past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blight|first1=David W.|title=Who Speaks for the Negro?|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=xxvi|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though widely and for the most part positively reviewed, ''Who Speaks'' was not a commercial success, which disappointed Warren greatly. The book was out of print for decades until Yale University Press republished it in 2014 based largely on the traffic generated by the ''Who Speaks for the Negro?'' Digital Archive.

==Archive==

Much of the original material related to the book is still in existence, held at the University of Kentucky and Yale University Libraries. [[Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History|The Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]] at the University of Kentucky digitized their portion of the archival collection and provides searchable and streaming access to the online interviews using OHMS ([[Oral History Metadata Synchronizer]]).

===In the Book===

Warren grouped his interviews partly by geography and partly by theme. Each of the chapters consists of both narrativized and transcripted interviews and Warren's descriptions of setting, as well as deeper reflections inspired by the intervewees.

: ''This article is on the Woman's Peace Party, a forerunner of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].''

The '''Woman's Peace Party''' ('''WPP''') was an American [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and [[First-wave feminism|feminist]] organization formally established in January 1915 in response to [[World War I]]. The organization is remembered as the first American peace organization to make use of [[direct action]] tactics such as public demonstration. The Woman's Peace Party became the American section of an international organization known as the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace later in 1915, a group which later changed its name to the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].

==American pacifist forerunners==


Prior to the establishment of the Woman's Peace Party, the three leading American pacifist organizations of national stature were essentially [[conservatism|conservative]] enterprises, viewing the peace movement's mission as one of extending stability, order, and the expansion of venerable American institutions.&lt;ref name="Marchand182"&gt;C. Roland Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1972; pg. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Peace Society]] (BBC), established in 1828, was the oldest of the previously existing pacifist organizations and suffered from what one historian has called "over seven decades of accumulated [[Victorian America|Victorianism]].&lt;ref name="Marchand5"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Typified by the detached conservative nobility of corporate attorney [[Elihu Root]], the APS was dedicated to demonstrating the incompatibility between war and [[Christianity]] and throughout its existence had remained small, impoverished, and ineffectual.&lt;ref name="Marchand5" /&gt; By the time of World War I, it had been reduced in status to that of a veritable subsidiary of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].

The Carnegie Endowment was launched by [[industrialist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]] in 1910 with a $10 million endowment.&lt;ref name="Marchand101"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Endowment became effectively a university publishing house for the peace movement, concentrating on academic research and the printed word rather than oratory.&lt;ref name="Marchand102"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third of the primary American peace organizations of the first decade of the 20th Century was the [[World Peace Foundation]] (WPF), a group established in 1909 by millionaire Boston publisher [[Edwin Ginn]] as "Edwin Ginn's International School for Peace."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; This organization was launched with a $1 million endowment and carried on publishing activities, changing its name to the WPF in 1911.&lt;ref name="Marchand101" /&gt; As with the Carnegie Foundation, the WPF limited its activities largely to research and publication, attempting to influence political decision-makers with ideas rather than to stir the fires of popular sentiment.

Much like the [[trust (monopoly)|trustified]] world of big business of the day, the peace movement was characterized by [[interlocking directorate]]s of the various organizations, with a very few men and no women wielding decisive influence over the movement by virtue of the power of the pocketbook.&lt;ref name="Marchand102" /&gt; The American peace movement was, in short, part of the [[political establishment]], with dinner meetings of the New York Peace Society likened by one contemporary to "a banquet of the [[Chamber of Commerce]]."&lt;ref&gt;The words are those of Frederick Lynch, 1911, cited in Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Woman's Peace Parade==

[[File:Fanny Garrison Villard.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Fanny Garrison Villard, daughter of [[William Lloyd Garrison]], chair of the August 1914 Woman's Peace Parade Committee, and initiator of the Woman's Peace Party]]
Although the establishment of a permanent organization did not follow for more than four months, the roots of the Woman's Peace Party lay in a protest march of 1500 women in [[New York City]] on August 29, 1914.&lt;ref name="Marchand182" /&gt; This "Woman's Peace Parade" was organized less than a month after the outbreak of hostilities in World War I and featured a silent procession down [[Fifth Avenue]] behind a white banner bearing a dove in front of somber crowds lining the streets.&lt;ref name=Marchand182 /&gt;

The chair of the Woman's Peace Parade committee was [[Fanny Garrison Villard]], a 70-year-old veteran of the peace movement.&lt;ref name="Marchand189"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Her son, [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], later recalled the scene:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There were no bands; there was dead silence and the crowds watched the parade in the spirit of the marchers, with sympathy and approval. The President had also approved, for the organizers, in complete sympathy with his public statements of the early days of the conflict, had courteously asked him for his consent. He was especially pleased by the decision of the paraders to carry no flags except the peace flag and to have no set speeches at the conclusion of the parade, but brief informal addresses were made to all who would listed....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"The silence, the dignity, the black dresses of the marchers — those who did not have black dresses wore black arm bands — the solemnity of the crowds, all of these produced a profound effect on the beholders."&lt;ref&gt;Oswald Garrison Villard, ''Fighting Years: A Memoir.'' New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1939; pg. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Woman's Peace Parade marked a change of methods of the peace movement. Older American peace organizations limited themselves to working behind the scenes, attempting to influence policy through regular political channels.&lt;ref name=Marchand183&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peace Parade, on the other hand, made use of [[direct action]], attempting to build popular support for peace through public demonstration in the same way that [[trade union|labor organizations]] had historically fought for policies and settlements which were important to them.&lt;ref name="Marchand183" /&gt; With this tactical shift, the Woman's Peace Parade and the organization which emerged from it, the Woman's Peace Party, effectively marked the beginning of the modern peace movement.&lt;ref name="Alonso1993"&gt;{{cite book|author= Harriet Hyman Alonso |title=Peace As a Women's Issue: A History of the U.S. Movement for World Peace and Women's Rights|year=1993|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-0269-9 |chapter= Partial Chronology of the Metropolitan New York Branch of WILPF |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=FZJxg8gQThoC&amp;pg=PA279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the march, Fanny Garrison Villard sought to transform the temporary organization constructed to coordinate the march into a permanent group. Villard called upon one of her old rivals in the women's movement, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], President of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] to help in this regard.&lt;ref name="Marchand189" /&gt; Catt, a former associate of [[Susan B. Anthony]], was fixated upon the struggle for women's right to vote and did not see the peace march as a likely vehicle for a change of public sentiment or national policy.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pp. 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Catt was won over to the idea that the American suffrage movement stood to gain in support and stature if women could gain a prominent role in the noble struggle for an end to the European bloodbath.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of December 1914, Catt was finally persuaded to give full effort for the launch of a national women's peace organization.&lt;ref name="Marchand193"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote to [[settlement house|settlement worker]] [[Jane Addams]] of [[Hull House]] in Chicago, attempting to bring her into the forthcoming organization as its leader.&lt;ref name="Marchand193" /&gt; Addams had long believed in a close interrelationship between international peace, domestic humanitarian reform, and women's right to vote and was won over to the idea of a national women's peace movement.&lt;ref name="Marchand193" /&gt; The stage was set for a formal launch of the new organization — a group to be called the Woman's Peace Party.

==Foundation convention==

The Woman's Peace Party was established at an organizational convention held in [[Washington, DC]] on January 9–10, 1915.&lt;ref name="Survey150123"&gt;"A Woman's Peace Party Full Fledged for Action," ''The Survey,'' vol. 33, no. 17 (January 23, 1915), pp. 433-434.&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering was attended by more than 100 delegates representing women's organizations from around the United States.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt;

Jane Addams was elected President of the new organization by the convention and given the power to select a Secretary and Treasurer for the group, which was to be headquartered in Addams' home city of [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; Membership in the new organization was open to all groups willing to repurpose themselves also as a "peace circle" and to any woman paying a $1 annual membership fee.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; Officers ultimately included [[Lucia Ames Mead]] as National Secretary, [[Harriet P. Thomas]] as Executive Secretary, [[Sophonisba Breckinridge|Sophonisba P. Breckinridge]] as Treasurer, and [[Elizabeth Glendower Evans]] as National Organizer.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Eleanor Barr, [http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/DG026-050/dg043wilpf/Part%20I-WPPhistory.htm "Woman's Peace Party, 1915-20 Finding Aid: Historical Introduction,"] Women's International League for Peace and Freedom Collection DG043, Swarthmore College Library, Swarthmore, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention approved a platform calling for the immediate convocation of "a convention of [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] nations in the interest of an early peace," the limitation of armaments, organized opposition to [[militarism]] (or [[military intervention]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/04/06/examining-american-peace-movement-prior-world-war-i&lt;/ref&gt; in America, democratization of foreign policy, removal of the economic motivation for war, and the expansion of the [[woman suffrage|electoral franchise for women]].&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; The right of women to vote was seen by the female participants in the organization as part-and-parcel of the cause for peace, based on the presumption that women were inclined by nature to be oriented towards the nurturing of human life.&lt;ref name=Marchand186&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding convention also approved a supplemental "Program for Constructive Peace" which demanded that the American government to call a conference of neutral nations and declared that, failing that, "the party itself will call an unofficial conference of pacifists from the world over" to determine a course of action.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; To ensure that the current war was not merely a prelude for another, the program called for a peace based upon no transfers of territory without the will of the involved people, no [[indemnity|indemnities]] to be assessed outside those in accordance with international law, and no treaties between nations to be established without ratification of representatives of the people.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt;

Activities concluded with a mass meeting held in the ballroom of the New Willard Hotel on Sunday, January 10, which was filled to capacity.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; An additional overflow meeting was held in another room but still some 500 interested people had to be turned away for lack of space.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; Speeches were delivered to this gathering by Jane Addams, and [[feminism|feminist]] activists [[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence]] of England, [[Rosika Schwimmer]] of Hungary, among others.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt;

==1915 International Congress of Women==

[[File:Noordam-delegates-1915.jpg|thumb|right|Delegates to the April 1915 Women's International Congress for Peace and Freedom aboard the ''MS Noordam'' with their blue and white "PEACE" banner]]
The ongoing war in Europe forced the cancellation of the scheduled biennial convention of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]], which had been slated for [[Berlin]] in 1915.&lt;ref name=Garrison88&gt;Dee Garrison, ''Mary Heaton Vorse: The Life of an American Insurgent.'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1989; pg. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation of the German gathering provided an opportunity for the women's peace movement to hold an international gathering of their own, and a call was issued for a convention to be held in the neutral [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt; Jane Addams, President of the Woman's Peace Party and arguably the most respected and influential woman in America was invited to preside over the conclave.&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt;

In April 1915, 47 women, including many members of the Woman's Peace Party along with representatives of other organizations, boarded the Dutch cruise ship the ''MS Noordam'' for the dangerous journey to [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name="Alonso66"&gt;Harriet Hyman Alonso, ''Peace as a Women's Issue: A History of the US Movement for World Peace and Women's Rights.'' Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1993; pg. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those making the trip through mine-strewn waters were social worker [[Grace Abbott]], [[epidemiologist]] [[Alice Hamilton]], radical trade unionist [[Leonora O'Reilly]], and academic and future [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Emily Balch]].&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt;

The trip was not without controversy, despite America's formally neutral status, with former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] declaring the women's mission "silly and base"" and calling the women cowards who sought peace "without regard to righteousness."&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt; The American women were not dissuaded, sailing into danger with a homemade blue and white banner that bore the single word, "PEACE."&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt;

The ''Noordam'' was held up for four days in the [[English Channel]] by the [[Royal Navy]] but was ultimately allowed to proceed to The Hague, which it arrived barely in time for the start of the three-day congress on the evening of April 28, 1915.&lt;ref name="Garrison91"&gt;Garrison, ''Mary Heaton Vorse,'' pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decision of some combatant nations, such as Great Britain, to deny its citizens passports which would have allowed them to participate in the Congress, the gathering still proved to be a massive event, bringing together 1,136 delegates and more than 2,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="Garrison91" /&gt;

The congress drafted a series of resolutions detailing plans for a just peace, calling for general [[disarmament]] and the removal of the profit motive through nationalizing the production of armaments, and asserting the benefits of [[free trade]] and [[freedom of navigation]] on the high seas.&lt;ref name="Garrison92"&gt;Garrison, ''Mary Heaton Vorse,'' pg. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; A resolution calling for continuous [[mediation]] of disputes by a conference of neutral nations was passed, but ultimately failed to come to fruition.&lt;ref name=Garrison92 /&gt; A delegation headed by Addams was dispatched to the capitals of the belligerent powers but it, too, proved ineffectual.&lt;ref name="Garrison92" /&gt;

Before adjourning, the congress established a new international organization called the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; The Woman's Peace Party came to regard itself as the American section of this organization.

==Name change==

In 1921 the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace formally changed its name to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.
