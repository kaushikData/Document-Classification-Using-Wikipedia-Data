The '''American Museum of Natural History''' (abbreviated as '''AMNH'''), located on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], is one of the largest [[museum]]s in the world. Located in Theodore Roosevelt Park across the street from [[Central Park]], the museum complex comprises 28 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls, in addition to a planetarium and a library. The museum collections contain over 33 million specimens&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Jaclyn (September 13, 2016).

==History==
[[File:The American Museum journal (c1900-(1918)) (17973760300).jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of the AMNH south façade]]
{{See also|List of castles in the United States}}

===Founding===
Before construction of the present complex, the museum was housed in the [[Arsenal (Central Park)|Arsenal building]] in [[Central Park]]. [[Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.]], the father of [[Theodore Roosevelt|the 26th U.S. President]], was one of the founders along with John David Wolfe, [[William Tilden Blodgett|William T. Blodgett]], [[Robert L. Stuart]], [[Andrew Haswell Green|Andrew H. Green]], Robert Colgate, [[Morris Ketchum Jesup|Morris K. Jesup]], Benjamin H. Field, D. Jackson Steward, [[Richard M. Blatchford (attorney)|Richard M. Blatchford]], [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Adrian G Iselin|Adrian Iselin]], [[Moses H. Grinnell]], Benjamin B. Sherman, [[Anson Dodge|A. G. Phelps Dodge]], William A. Haines, [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]], [[Joseph Hodges Choate|Joseph H. Choate]], [[Henry G. Stebbins]], Henry Parish, and [[Howard Potter]]. The founding of the museum realized the dream of naturalist Dr. [[Albert S. Bickmore]]. Bickmore, a one-time student of [[Harvard]] [[zoologist]] [[Louis Agassiz]], lobbied tirelessly for years for the establishment of a natural history museum in New York. His proposal, backed by his powerful sponsors, won the support of the [[Governor of New York]], [[John Thompson Hoffman]], who signed a bill officially creating the American Museum of Natural History on April 6, 1869.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline: The History of the American Museum of Natural History|url=http://amnh.org/museum/history/|accessdate=February 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211111505/http://amnh.org/museum/history/|archivedate=February 11, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
[[File:The American Museum journal (c1900-(1918)) (17971745188).jpg|thumb|right|This building was built in 1874, and it opened in 1877. Currently, this building houses the [[American Museum of Natural History#Hall of Northwest Coast Indians|Hall of Northwest Coast Indians]], [[American Museum of Natural History#Hall of African Peoples|Hall of African Peoples]], the [[American Museum of Natural History#Sanford Hall of North American Birds|Sanford Hall of North American Birds]], and [[American Museum of Natural History#Fossil halls|Hall of Vertebrate Origins]].]]
In 1874, the cornerstone was laid for the museum's first building, which is now hidden from view by the many buildings in the complex that today occupy most of Manhattan Square. The original [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Gothic]] building, which was opened in 1877,&lt;ref name="dedication"/&gt; was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] and [[J. Wrey Mould]], both already closely identified with the architecture of Central Park.&lt;ref name="preston"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dinosaurs in the Attic: An Excursion into the American Museum of Natural History|last=Preston|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Preston|year=1986|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=0-312-10456-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19–20}}

===Expansion===
The original building was soon eclipsed by the south range of the museum, designed by [[J. Cleaveland Cady]], an exercise in rusticated brownstone [[Richardsonian Romanesque|neo-Romanesque]], influenced by [[Henry Hobson Richardson|H. H. Richardson]].&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Christopher|title=The Face Will Still Be Forbidding, But Much Tighter and Cleaner|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 29, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/realestate/29scap.html |accessdate=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It extends {{convert|700|ft|m}} along West 77th Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Glenn|title=Shoring Up a Castle Wall|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 2, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/nyregion/02wall.html|accessdate=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with corner towers {{convert|150|ft|m}} tall. Its pink brownstone and granite, similar to that found at [[Grindstone Island]] in the [[St. Lawrence River]], came from quarries at Picton Island, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newland|first=D. H.|title=The Quarry Materials of New York—Granite, Gneiss, Trap and Marble|journal=New York State Museum Bulletin|issue=181|page=75|date=January 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entrance on [[Central Park West]], the New York State Memorial to Theodore Roosevelt, completed by [[John Russell Pope]] in 1936, is an overscaled [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Goldberger|title=Natural History Museum Plans Big Overhaul|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 27, 1995|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/nyregion/natural-history-museum-plans-big-overhaul.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It leads to a vast Roman basilica, where visitors are greeted with a cast of a skeleton of a rearing ''[[Barosaurus]]'' defending her young from an ''[[Allosaurus]]''. The museum is also accessible through its 77th street foyer, renamed the "Grand Gallery" and featuring a fully suspended [[Haida people|Haida]] canoe. The hall leads into the oldest extant exhibit in the museum, the hall of [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Permanent Exhibitions|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/culture/northwest.html|accessdate=March 4, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301053340/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/culture/northwest.html|archivedate=March 1, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later additions, restorations, and renovations===
Since 1930, little has been added to the exterior of the original building. The architect [[Kevin Roche]] and his firm [[Roche-Dinkeloo]] have been responsible for the master planning of the museum since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Collins 1991"/&gt; Various renovations to both the interior and exterior have been carried out. Renovations to the Dinosaur Hall were undertaken starting in 1991,&lt;ref name="Collins 1991"&gt;{{cite web | last=Collins | first=Glenn | title=Clearing a New Path for T. Rex and Company | website=The New York Times | date=1991-12-01 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/01/arts/clearing-a-new-path-for-t-rex-and-company.html | access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the museum also restored the mural in Roosevelt Memorial Hall in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Barron | first=James | title=Teddy Is Restored. In Paint, at Least. | website=City Room | date=2010-06-20 | url=//cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/teddy-is-restored-in-paint-at-least/ | access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the Roche-Dinkeloo firm designed the eight-story AMNH Library.{{cn|date=May 2018}} However, the entirety of the master plan was ultimately not fully realized, and by 2015, the museum consisted of 25 separate buildings that were poorly connected.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-DesignExpansion-2015/&gt;

The museum's south façade, spanning 77th Street from Central Park West to [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus Avenue]] was cleaned, repaired and re-emerged in 2009. Steven Reichl, a spokesman for the museum, said that work would include restoring 650 black-cherry window frames and stone repairs. The museum's consultant on the latest renovation is [[Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.]], an architectural and engineering firm with headquarters in [[Northbrook, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt;

In 2014, the museum published plans for a $325 million, {{convert|195000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} annex, the [[Richard Gilder]] Center for Science, Education, and Innovation, on the Columbus Avenue side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pogrebin | first=Robin | title=American Museum of Natural History Plans an Addition | website=The New York Times | date=2014-12-11 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/arts/design/american-museum-of-natural-history-plans-an-addition.html | access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by Studio Gang, Higgins Quasebarth &amp; Partners and landscape architects Reed Hilderbrand, the new building's pink [[Milford, Massachusetts|Milford]] [[granite]] facade will have a textural, curvilinear design inspired by natural topographical elements showcased in the museum, including "geological strata, glacier-gouged caves, curving canyons, and blocks of glacial ice," as a striking contrast to the museum's predominance of [[High Victorian Gothic]], [[Richardson Romanesque]] and [[Beaux arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] architectural styles. The interior itself would contain a new entrance from Columbus Avenue north of 79th Street; a multiple-story storage structure containing specimens and objects; rooms to display these objects; an insect hall; an "interpretive" "wayfinding wall", and a theater.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-DesignExpansion-2015&gt;{{cite web | title=Museum of Natural History Reveals Design for Expansion | website=The New York Times | date=2015-11-05 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/arts/design/museum-of-natural-history-reveals-design-for-expansion.html | access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archpaper-Expansion-2016/&gt; This expansion was originally supposed to be located to the south of the existing museum, occupying parts of Theodore Roosevelt Park. The expansion was relocated to the west side of the existing museum, and its footprint was reduced in size, due to opposition to construction in the park. The annex would instead replace three existing buildings along Columbus Avenue's east side, with more than 30 connections to the existing museum, and it would be six stories high, the same height as the existing buildings. The plans for the expansion were scrutinized by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes-DesignExpansion-2015/&gt; On October 11, 2016, the Landmarks Preservation Commission unanimously approved the expansion. Construction of the Gilder Center, which was expected to break ground the next year following design development and [[Environmental Impact Statement]] stages, would entail demolition of three museum buildings built between 1874 and 1935.&lt;ref name=Archpaper-Expansion-2016&gt;{{cite web | last=Wachs | first=Audrey | title=Landmarks Commission approves Natural History Museum expansion | website=Archpaper.com | date=2016-10-11 | url=https://archpaper.com/2016/10/landmarks-commission-approves-natural-history-museum-expansion/ | access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum formally filed plans to construct the expansion in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Natural History Museum files plans for Gilder Center expansion | website=Real Estate Weekly | date=2017-08-14 | url=http://rew-online.com/2017/08/14/natural-history-museum-files-super-sized-plans-for-gilder-center-expansion/ | access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is expected to be complete by 2019 or 2020.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-DesignExpansion-2015/&gt;

===Presidents===
The museum's first two presidents were John David Wolfe (1870–1872) and Robert L. Stuart (1872–1881), both among the museum's founders. The museum was not put on a sound footing until the appointment of the third president, [[Morris Ketchum Jesup|Morris K. Jesup]] (also one of the original founders), in 1881. Jesup was president for over 25 years, overseeing its expansion and much of its golden age of exploration and collection. The fourth president, [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], was appointed in 1906 on the death of Jesup. Osborn consolidated the museum's expansion, developing it into one of the world's foremost natural history museums. [[F. Trubee Davison]] was president from 1933 to 1951, with [[A. Perry Osborn]] as Acting President from 1941 to 1946. [[Alexander M. White]] was president from 1951 to 1968. [[Gardner D. Stout]] was president from 1968 to 1975. [[Robert G. Goelet]] from 1975 to 1988. [[George D. Langdon, Jr.]] from 1988 to 1993. [[Ellen V. Futter]] has been president of the museum since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline: The History of the American Museum of Natural History|url=http://www.amnh.org/about-us/history/history-1991-present|accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated names===
Famous names associated with the museum include the [[paleontologist]] and [[geologist]] [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]; the dinosaur-hunter of the [[Gobi Desert]], [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] (one of the inspirations for [[Indiana Jones]]);&lt;ref name="preston"/&gt;{{rp|97–8}} [[George Gaylord Simpson]]; biologist [[Ernst Mayr]]; pioneer [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] [[Franz Boas]] and [[Margaret Mead]]; [[explorer]] and [[geographer]] [[Alexander H. Rice, Jr.]]; and [[ornithologist]] [[Robert Cushman Murphy]]. J. P. Morgan was also among the famous benefactors of the museum.

[[File:Akeley Hall.JPG|thumb|Akeley Hall of African Mammals, American Museum of Natural History| Akeley Hall]]
Named after taxidermist [[Carl Akeley]], the Akeley Hall of African Mammals is a two-story hall located directly behind the Theodore Roosevelt rotunda. Its 28 dioramas depict in meticulous detail the great range of ecosystems found in Africa and the mammals endemic to them. The centerpiece of the hall is a pack of eight [[African elephants]] in a characteristic 'alarmed' formation.&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/general53amer/general53amer_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "General guide to the exhibition halls of the American Museum of Natural History" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the mammals are typically the main feature in the dioramas, birds and flora of the regions are occasionally featured as well. In the 80 years since Akeley Hall’s creation, many of the species within have become endangered, some critically, and the locations deforested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsrEOKzxL5A#t=0 |title=Revisiting Akeley's Gorillas |publisher=YouTube |date=February 16, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, none of the species are yet extinct, in part thanks to the work of Carl Akeley himself (see [[Virunga National Park]]). The hall connects to the Hall of African Peoples.

=====History=====

The Hall of African Mammals was first proposed to the museum by [[Carl Akeley]] around 1909.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peabody.yale.edu/james-perry-wilson/chapter-5-joining-the-american-museum-of-natural-history |title=Painting Actuality: Chapter 5: 1934: Joining the American Museum of Natural History |publisher=Peabody.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original concept contained forty dioramas which would present the rapidly vanishing landscapes and animals of Africa. The intent was that a visitor of the hall, “may have the illusion, at worst, of passing a series of pictures of primeval Africa, and at best, may think for a moment that he has stepped {{convert|5000|mi|km|spell=in}} across the sea into Africa itself.” Akeley’s proposal was a hit with both the board of trustees and then museum president, [[Henry Fairfield Osborne]]. To fund its creation, Daniel Pomeroy, a trustee of the museum and partner at J.P. Morgan, offered interested investors the opportunity to accompany the museum’s expeditions in Africa in exchange for funding.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"/&gt; [[File:Akeley6.jpg|thumb|Carl Akeley preparing lions for "lions" diorama| [[Carl Akeley]] mounts specimens for the "Lions" diorama]]

Akeley began collecting specimens for the hall as early as 1909, famously encountering [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the midst of the [[Theodore Roosevelt#Smithsonian-Roosevelt African expedition (1909-1910)|Smithsonian-Roosevelt African expedition]] (two of the elephants featured in the museum’s center piece were donated by Roosevelt, a cow, shot by Roosevelt himself, and a calf, shot by his son Kermit).&lt;ref&gt;Pollak, Michael (October 26, 2012). [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/nyregion/theodore-roosevelts-elephant.html "Roosevelt’s Elephant"]. nytimes.com&lt;/ref&gt; On these early expeditions, Akeley would be accompanied by his former apprentice in taxidermy, [[James L. Clark]], and artist, [[William Robinson Leigh|William R. Leigh]].&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"/&gt;

When Akeley returned to Africa to collect gorillas for the hall’s first diorama, Clark remained behind and began scouring the country for artists to create the backgrounds. The eventual appearance of the first habitat groups would have a huge impact on the museum. Akeley and Clark’s skillful taxidermy paired with the backgrounds painted under Leigh’s direction created an illusion of life in these animals that made the museum’s other exhibits seem dull in comparison (the museum’s original style of exhibition can still be seen in the small area devoted to birds and animals of New York). Plans for other diorama halls quickly emerged and by 1929 Birds of the World, the Hall of North American Mammals, the Vernay Hall of Southeast Asian Mammals, and the Hall of Oceanic Life were all in stages of planning or construction.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"/&gt; [[File:Plains Diorama.JPG|thumb|left|"Plains" diorama Akeley Hall of African Mammals, American Museum of Natural History| the "Plains" diorama in Akeley Hall]]

After Akeley’s unexpected death during the Eastman-Pommeroy expedition in 1926, responsibility of the hall’s completion fell to James L. Clark. Despite being hampered by the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, Clark’s passion for Africa and his dedication to his former mentor kept the project alive. In 1933, Clark would hire architectural artist James Perry Wilson to assist Leigh in the painting of backgrounds. More technically minded than Leigh, Wilson would make many improvements on Leigh’s techniques, including a range of methods to minimize the distortion caused by the dioramas’ curved walls.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"/&gt;
[[File:Amnh fg03.jpg|thumb|Gorilla diorama in Akeley Hall of African Mammals]]

In 1936, [[William Durant Campbell]], a wealthy board member with a desire to see Africa, offered to fund several dioramas if allowed to obtain the specimens himself. Clark agreed to this arrangement and shortly after Campbell left to collect the okapi and black rhinoceros specimens accompanied by artist Robert Kane. Campbell would be involved, in one capacity or another, with several other subsequent expeditions. Despite setbacks including malaria, flooding, foreign government interference, and even a boat sinking, these expeditions would succeed in acquiring some of Akeley Hall’s most impressive specimens.&lt;ref name="peabody.yale.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wolfgang Saxon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/25/obituaries/wd-campbell-88-promoted-scouting-in-the-third-world.html |title=W.D. Campbell, 88; Promoted Scouting In the Third World - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=October 25, 1995 |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Back in the museum, Kane would join Leigh and Wilson, along with a handful of other artists in completing the hall’s remaining dioramas. Though construction of the hall was completed in 1936, the dioramas would gradually open between the mid-1920s and early 1940s.&lt;ref name="amnh.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/mammal-halls/akeley-hall-of-african-mammals |title=Akeley Hall of African Mammals |publisher=Amnh.org |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hall of Asian Mammals====
[[File:Vernay-Faunthorpe Hall.JPG|thumb|left|Vernay-Faunthorpe Hall of Asian Mammals]]
The Hall of Asian Mammals, sometimes referred to as the Vernay-Faunthorpe Hall of Asian Mammals, is a one-story hall located directly to the left of the Theodore Roosevelt Rotunda. It contains 8 complete dioramas, 4 partial dioramas, and 6 habitat groups of mammals and locations from [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Burma]], and [[Malaysia]]. The hall opened in 1930 and, similar to Akeley Hall, is centered around 2 [[Asian elephants]]. At one point, a [[giant panda]] and [[Siberian tiger]] were also part of the Hall's collection, originally intended to be part of an adjoining Hall of North Asian Mammals (planned in the current location of Stout Hall of Asian Peoples). These specimens can currently be seen in the Hall of Biodiversity.&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/mammal-halls/hall-of-asian-mammals |title=Hall of Asian Mammals |publisher=Amnh.org |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====History=====
Specimens for the Hall of Asian Mammals were collected over six expeditions led by [[Arthur Stannard Vernay|Arthur S. Vernay]] and Col. [[John Faunthorpe]] (as noted by stylized plaques at both entrances). The expeditions were funded entirely by Vernay, a wealthy, British-born, New York antiques dealer. He characterized the expense as a British tribute to American involvement in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%2010/Kingston%20NY%20Daily%20Freeman/Kingston%20NY%20Daily%20FreeMan%201923%20Grayscale/Kingston%20NY%20Daily%20Freeman%201923%20b%20Grayscale%20-%200082.pdf "Explorers hunt for pink duck"]. Kingston Daily Freeman. October 11, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Indian Rhinoceros diorama.JPG|thumb|The Indian rhinoceros diorama at Vernay-Faunthorpe Hall]]
The first Vernay-Faunthorpe expedition took place in 1922. At the time, many of the animals Vernay was seeking, such as the [[Sumatran rhinoceros]] and [[Asiatic lion]], were already rare and facing the possibility of extinction. To acquire these specimens, Vernay would have to make many appeals to regional authorities in order to obtain hunting permits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19240117&amp;id=xOFiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-3gNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3239,5737529 Explorer Embarks on Long Journey to Search for Rare Wild Animals] Lawrence Journal- January 17, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; The relations he would forge during this time would assist later museum related expeditions headed by Vernay in gaining access to areas previously restricted to foreign visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nina Gregorev |url=http://anthro.amnh.org/vernay_collection |title=Vernay-Hopwood Chindwin Expedition &amp;#124; Anthropology |publisher=Anthro.amnh.org |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Artist Clarence C. Rosenkranz accompanied the Vernay-Faunthorpe expeditions as field artist and would later paint the majority of the diorama backgrounds in the hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Diorama+diversity.-a0184799158 |title=Diorama diversity. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expeditions were also well documented in both photo and video, with enough footage of the first expedition to create a feature-length film, ''Hunting Tigers in India'' (1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall |first=Mordaunt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803E7DF143BE23ABC4852DFB4678382639EDE |title=Movie Review - Hunting Tigers in India - THE SCREEN |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=December 10, 1929 |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals====
[[File:Alaska Moose at the American Museum of Natural History.jpg|thumbnail|[[Alaska moose]] diorama in the Hall of North American Mammals]]

The Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals features 43 dioramas of various mammals of the American continent, north of tropical Mexico. Each diorama places focus on a particular species, ranging from the largest megafauna to the smaller rodents and carnivorans. Notable dioramas include the [[Alaska Peninsula brown bear|Alaskan brown bears]] looking at a salmon after they scared off an otter, a pair of [[Gray wolf|wolves]], a pair of [[Sonora]]n [[North American jaguar|jaguars]], and dueling bull [[Alaska moose]].

The Hall of North American Mammals opened in 1942 with only ten dioramas, including those of the larger North American mammals. In 1948, the wolf diorama was installed, but further progress on the hall was halted as World War II broke out. After the war the hall ceased completion in 1954. Since that time, the hall had remained the much the same and the majority of the mounts were weathering and bleaching. A massive restoration project began in late 2011 due to a large donation from Jill and Lewis Bernard. Taxidermists were brought in to clean the mounts and skins and artists restored the diorama backdrops. In October 2012 the hall was reopened as the Bernard Hall of North American Mammals and included scientifically-updated signage for each diorama.

=====Hall of Small Mammals=====
The Hall of Small Mammals is an offshoot of the Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals. There are several small dioramas featuring small mammals found throughout North America, including [[collared peccaries]], [[Abert's squirrel]], and a [[wolverine]].

==Birds, reptiles, and amphibian halls==

===Sanford Hall of North American Birds===
[[File:Cuthbert Rookery Diorama.JPG|thumb|left|The Cuthbert Rookery Diorama contains many of the birds once endangered by plume hunting]]
The Sanford Hall of North American birds is a one-story hall located on the third floor of the museum, above the Hall of African Peoples and between the Hall of Primates and Akeley Hall’s second level. Its 25 dioramas depict birds from across North America in their native habitats. Opening in 1909, the dioramas in Sanford Hall were the first to be exhibited in the museum and are, at present, the oldest still on display. At the far end of the hall are two large murals by ornithologist and artist, [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]]. In addition to the species listed below, the hall also has display cases devoted to large collections of [[warblers]], [[owls]], and [[raptor (bird)|raptors]].

====History====
[[File:Fuertes Flamingo Mural.JPG|thumb|left|Mural of flamingo nesting grounds by [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]].]]
Conceived by museum ornithologist [[Frank Chapman (ornithologist)|Frank Chapman]], construction began on dioramas for the Hall of North American Birds as early as 1902. The Hall is named for Chapman's friend and amateur ornithologist [[Leonard Cutler Sanford|Leonard C. Sanford]], who partially funded the hall and also donated the entirety of his own bird specimen collection to the museum.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peabody.yale.edu/james-perry-wilson/chapter-7-francis-lee-jaques-and-the-bird-halls |title=Painting Actuality: Chapter 7: Francis Lee Jaques and the American Museum of Natural History Bird Halls |publisher=Peabody.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Guide leaflet (1901) (14579611617).jpg|thumb|[[Great egret]] diorama, c.1901]]
Although Chapman was not the first to create museum dioramas, he was responsible for many of the innovations that would separate and eventually define the dioramas in the American Museum. Whereas other dioramas of the time period typically featured generic scenery, Chapman was the first to bring artists into the field with him in the hopes of capturing a specific location at a specific time. In contrast to the dramatic scenes later created by Carl Akeley for the African Hall, Chapman wanted his dioramas to evoke a scientific realism, ultimately serving as a historical record of habitats and species facing a high probability of extinction.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

At the time of Sanford Hall's construction, plume-hunting for the [[millinery]] trade had brought many coastal bird species to the brink of extinction, most notably the [[great egret]]. Frank Chapman was a key figure in the conservation movement that emerged during this time. His dioramas were created with the intention of furthering this conservationist cause, giving museum visitors a brief glimpse at the dwindling bird species being lost in the name of fashion. Thanks in part to Chapman's efforts, both inside and outside of the museum, conservation of these bird species would be very successful, establishing refuges, such as [[Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge]], and eventually leading to the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/pelicanisland/history.html |title=Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge |publisher=Fws.gov |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hall of Birds of the World===
The global diversity of bird species is exhibited in this hall. 12 dioramas showcase various ecosystems around the world and provide a sample of the varieties of birds that live there. Example dioramas include [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] featuring [[king penguin]]s and [[skua]]s, the East African plains featuring [[secretarybird]]s and [[bustard]]s, and the Australian outback featuring [[honeyeater]]s, [[cockatoo]]s, and [[kookaburra]]s.

===Whitney Memorial Hall of Oceanic Birds===
This particular hall has undergone a complicated history over the years since its founding in 1953. Frank Chapman and Leonard C. Sanford, originally museum volunteers, had gone forward with creation of a hall to feature birds of the [[Oceania|Pacific islands]]. In the years up to its founding, the museum had engaged in various expeditions to [[Fiji]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Mariana Islands|the Marianas]] (among other locations) to collect birds for the exhibit. The hall was designed as a completely immersive collection of dioramas, including a circular display featuring [[Bird-of-paradise|birds-of-paradise]]. In 1998, The Butterfly Conservatory was installed inside the hall originally as a temporary exhibit, but as the popular demand of the exhibit increased, the Hall of Oceanic Birds has more or less remained closed by the museum.

===Hall of Reptiles and Amphibians===
The Hall of Reptiles and Amphibians serves as an introduction to [[herpetology]], with many exhibits detailing reptile evolution, anatomy, diversity, reproduction, and behavior. Notable exhibits include a [[komodo dragon]] group, an [[American alligator]], [[Lonesome George]], the last [[Pinta island tortoise]], and [[poison dart frog]]s.

===Hall of North American Forests===
[[File:Mixed Deciduous Forest, Hall of North American Forests, AMNH.JPG|thumb|The Mixed Deciduous Forest diorama]]
The Hall of North American Forests is a one-story hall located on the museum’s ground floor in between the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall and the Warburg Hall of New York State Environments. It contains ten dioramas depicting a range of forest types from across North America as well as several displays on forest conservation and tree health. Constructed under the guidance of noted botanist Henry K. Svenson (who also oversaw Warburg Hall’s creation) and opened in 1959, each diorama specifically lists both the location and exact time of year depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/general53amer/general53amer_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "General guide to the exhibition halls of the American Museum of Natural History"|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees and plants featured in the dioramas are constructed of a combination of art supplies and actual bark and other specimens collected in the field. The entrance to the hall features a cross section from a 1,400-year-old [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|sequoia]] taken from the King's River grove on the west flank of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Mountains]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/biodiversity-and-environmental-halls/hall-of-north-american-forests|title=Hall of North American Forests|work=AMNH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warburg Hall of New York State Environments===
[[File:Warburg Hall of New York State Environments.JPG|thumb|"Spring" display in Warburg Hall]]
Warburg Hall of New York State Environments is a one-story hall located on the museum’s ground floor in between the Hall of North American Forests and the Grand Hall. Based on the town of [[Pine Plains (town), New York|Pine Plains]] and near-by [[Thompson Pond|Stissing Mountain]] in [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]],&lt;ref name="rootsweb.ancestry.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nylnphs/V2/mh.htm|title=The Felix M. Warburg Memorial Hall of the American Museum of Natural History, New York City: (Pine Plains: Its Unique Natural Heritage)|work=ancestry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hall gives a multi-faceted presentation of the eco-systems typical of New York. Aspects covered include soil types, seasonal changes, and the impact of both humans and nonhuman animals on the environment. It is named for the German-American philanthropist, [[Felix M. Warburg]]. Originally known as the "Hall of Man and Nature", Warburg Hall opened in 1951.&lt;ref name="rootsweb.ancestry.com"/&gt; It has changed little since and is now frequently regarded for its retro-modern styling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithjam.com/mad-men-design-a-museum-exhibit/|title=Mad men design a museum exhibit|work=Joseph Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hall shares many of the exhibit types featured throughout the museum as well as one display type, unique to Warburg, which features a recessed miniature diorama behind a foreground of species and specimens from the environment depicted.

===Milstein Hall of Ocean Life===

[[File:Blue Whale Nat'l Hist Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Model of a blue whale in the Milstein Family Hall of Ocean Life]]
The Milstein Hall of Ocean Life focuses on [[marine biology]], [[marine botany|botany]] and [[marine conservation]]. The hall is most famous for its {{convert|94|ft|m|adj=on}}-long&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/ocean/ Retrieved October 2, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218051108/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/ocean/ |date=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[blue whale]] model, suspended from the ceiling behind its dorsal fin.

The upper level of the hall exhibits the vast array of ecosystems present in the ocean. Dioramas compare and contrast the life in these different settings including [[polar sea]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s, [[coral reef]]s and the [[bathypelagic]]. It attempts to show how vast and varied the oceans are while encouraging common themes throughout. The lower, and arguably more famous, half of the hall consists of several large dioramas of larger marine organisms. It is on this level that the famous "Squid and the Whale" diorama sits, depicting a hypothetical fight between the two creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Milstein Hall of Ocean Life|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/biodiversity-and-environmental-halls/milstein-hall-of-ocean-life/sperm-whale-and-giant-squid/|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|accessdate=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable exhibits in this hall include the Andros Coral Reef Diorama, which is the only two-level diorama in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/ocean/01_dioramas/ Retrieved October 2, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208150245/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/ocean/01_dioramas/ |date=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous icons of the museum is a life-sized fiberglass model of a ninety-four foot (29 m) long Atlantic [[blue whale]]. The whale was redesigned dramatically in the 2003 renovation: its flukes and fins were readjusted, a navel was added, and it was repainted from a dull gray to various rich shades of blue.

====History====
In 1910, museum president [[Henry F. Osborn]] proposed the construction of a large building in the museum's southeast courtyard to house a new Hall of Ocean Life in which "models and skeletons of whales" would be exhibited. This proposal to build in the courtyard marked a major reappraisal of the museum's original architectural plan. [[Calvert Vaux]] had designed the museum complex to include four open courtyards in order to maximize the amount of natural light entering the surrounding buildings. In 1969, a renovation gave the hall a more explicit focus on [[Megafauna|oceanic megafauna]] in order to paint the ocean as a grandiose and exciting place. The key component of the renovation became the addition of a lifelike blue whale model to replace a popular steel and papier-mâché whale model that had hung in the Biology of Mammals hall. [[Richard Van Gelder]] oversaw the creation of the hall in its current incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Hall of Ocean Life|url=http://www-v1.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/ocean/04_history/|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106172418/http://www-v1.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/ocean/04_history/|archivedate=January 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall was renovated once again in 2003, this time with [[environmentalism]] and [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] being the main focal points. [[Paul Milstein]] was a real estate developer, business leader and philanthropist and Irma Milstein is a long-time Board member of the American Museum of Natural History. The 2003 renovation included refurbishment of the famous blue whale, suspended high above the 19,000 square foot (1,750 m²) exhibit floor, and updating of the 1930s and 1960s dioramas. New displays were linked to schools via technology.&lt;ref&gt;"Rescuing the Diorama From the Fate of the Dodo", by Glenn Collins, New York Times, February 3, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stout Hall of Asian Peoples====
The Stout Hall of Asian Peoples is a one-story hall located on the museum’s second floor in between the Hall of Asian Mammals and Birds of the World. It is named for Gardner D. Stout, a former president of the museum, and was primarily organized by Dr. Walter A. Fairservis, a longtime museum archaeologist. Opened in 1980, Stout Hall is the museum’s largest anthropological hall and contains artifacts acquired by the museum between 1869 and the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Swan |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/1113/111357.html |title=Hall of Asian People; Orienting the Americans |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many famous expeditions sponsored by the museum are associated with the artifacts in the hall, including the Roy Chapman Andrews expeditions in Central Asia and the Vernay-Hopwood Chindwin expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bgc.bard.edu/images/content/1/4/14863.pdf |title=Confluences: An American Expedition to Northern Burma, 1935 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416210339/http://www.bgc.bard.edu/images/content/1/4/14863.pdf |archive-date=April 16, 2014 |work=AMNH |date=April 4, 2013 |access-date=January 22, 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stout Hall has two sections: Ancient Eurasia, a small section devoted to the evolution of human civilization in [[Eurasia]], and Traditional Asia, a much larger section containing cultural artifacts from across the Asian continent. The latter section is organized to geographically correspond with two major trade routes of the [[Silk Road]]. Like many of the museum’s exhibition halls, the artifacts in Stout Hall are presented in a variety of ways including exhibits, miniature dioramas, and 5 full scale dioramas. Notable exhibits in the Ancient Eurasian section include reproductions from the archaeological sites of [[Teshik-Tash]] and [[Çatalhöyük]], as well as a full size replica of a [[Code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi Stele]]. The Traditional Asia section contains areas devoted to major Asian countries, such as [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Tibet]], and [[India]], while also including a vast array of smaller Asian tribes including the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Semai people|Semai]], and [[Yakuts|Yakut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/human-origins-and-cultural-halls/gardner-d.-stout-hall-of-asian-peoples |title=Gardner D.

The Hall of African Peoples is located behind Akeley Hall of African Mammals and underneath Sanford Hall of North American Birds. It is organized by the four major ecosystems found in [[Africa]]: River Valley, Grasslands, Forest-[[Woodland]], and [[Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/human-origins-and-cultural-halls/hall-of-african-peoples |title=Hall of African Peoples |publisher=Amnh.org |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each section presents artifacts and exhibits of the peoples native to the ecosystems throughout Africa. The hall contains three dioramas and notable exhibits include a large collection of spiritual costumes on display in the Forest-Woodland section. Uniting the sections of the hall is a multi-faceted comparison of African societies based on [[hunter-gather|hunting and gathering]], [[horticulture|cultivation]], and [[animal husbandry|animal domestication]]. Each type of society is presented in a historical, political, spiritual, and ecological context. A small section of [[African diaspora]] spread by the slave trade is also included. Below is a brief list of some of the tribes and civilizations featured:

====Hall of Mexico and Central America====
[[File:Zapotec Burial Urns.JPG|thumb|left|Zapotec burial urns from Monte Albán]]
The Hall of Mexico and Central America is a one-story hall located on the museum’s second floor behind Birds of the World and before the Hall of South American Peoples. It presents archaeological artifacts from a broad range of pre-Columbian civilizations that once existed across Middle America, including the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Olmec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], and [[Aztec]]. Because most of these civilizations did not leave behind recorded writing or have any contact with Western civilization, the overarching aim of the hall is to piece together what it is possible to know about them from the artifacts alone.

The museum has displayed pre-Columbian artifacts since its opening, only a short time after the discovery of the civilizations by archaeologists, with its first hall dedicated to the subject opening in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientmex00amer|title=Ancient Mexico and Central America|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the museum’s collection grew, the hall underwent major renovations in 1944 and again in 1970 when it re-opened in its current form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/reomexic00amer|title=The reopening of the Mexican and Central American hall, February 25, 1944, The American museum of natural history|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/about-us/history/history-1961-1990|title=History 1961-1990|work=AMNH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable artifacts on display include the Kunz Axe and a full-scale replica of Tomb 104 from the [[Monte Albán]] archaeological site, originally displayed at the [[1939 World’s Fair]].

=====Hall of Northwest Coast Indians=====
[[File:Kwakwaka’wakw House Post.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Kwakwaka'wakw House Posts]]
The Hall of Northwest Coast Indians is a one-story hall located on the museum's ground floor behind the Grand Gallery and in between Warburg and Spitzer Halls. Opened in 1900 under the name "Jesup North Pacific Hall", it is currently the oldest exhibition hall in the museum, though it has undergone many renovations in its history.The hall contains artifacts and exhibits of the tribes of the North Pacific Coast cultural region (Southern Alaska, Northern Washington, and a portion of British Columbia). Featured prominently in the hall are four "House Posts" from the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] nation and murals by William S. Taylor depicting native life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=T0050|title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana - Taylor, Will S.|work=brown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======History======
Artifacts in the hall originated from three main sources. The earliest of these was a gift of [[Haida people|Haida]] artifacts (including the now famous Haida canoe of the Grand Gallery) collected by [[John Wesley Powell]] and donated by Herbert Bishop in 1882. This was followed by the museum’s purchase of two collections of [[Tlingit]] artifacts collected by Lt. [[George T. Emmons]] in 1888 and 1894.&lt;ref name="Indians of the Northwest Coast"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/northwe10godd|title=Indians of the Northwest Coast|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nuxalk Masks.jpg|upright|thumb|Nuxalk Masks]]
The remainder of the hall’s artifacts were collected during the famed [[Jesup North Pacific Expedition]] between 1897 and 1902. Led by influential anthropologist [[Franz Boas]] and financed by museum president [[Morris Ketchum Jesup]], the expedition was the first for the museum’s Division of Anthropology and is now considered the, “foremost expedition in American anthropology”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthro.amnh.org/jesup_collection Jesup North Pacific Expedition | Anthropology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many famous ethnologists took part, including [[George Hunt (ethnologist)|George Hunt]], who secured the Kwakwaka’wakw House Posts that currently stand in the hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.amnh.org/finding_aids_Jesup/biographical_notes/index.html|title=AMNH Special Collections — Jesup North Pacific Exhibition|work=amnh.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its opening, the Hall of Northwest Coast Indians was one of four halls dedicated to the native peoples of United States and Canada. It was originally organized in two sections, the first being a general area pertaining to all peoples of the region and the second a specialized area divided by tribe. This was a point of contention for Boas who wanted all artifacts in the hall to be associated with the proper tribe (much like it is currently organized), eventually leading to the dissolution of Boas’ relationship with the museum.&lt;ref name="Indians of the Northwest Coast"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Glenn (November 14, 2006). [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/14/nyregion/14canoe.html?fta=y&amp;_r=0 "Canoe Goes Upriver, Without Its Paddlers"]. nytimes.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tribes featured in the hall include: [[Coast Salish peoples|Coastal Salish]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth]] (listed as Nootka), [[Tsimshian]], and [[Nuxalk]] (listed as Bella Coola)

=====Hall of Plains Indians=====
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
The primary focus of this hall is the North American Great Plains peoples as they were at the middle of the 19th Century, including depictions of [[Piegan Blackfeet|Blackfeet]] (''see also: [[Blackfoot Confederacy]]''), [[Hidatsa]], and [[Dakota people|Dakota]] cultures. Of particular interest is a [[Folsom point]] discovered in 1926 New Mexico, providing valuable evidence of [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|early American colonization of the Americas]].

=====Hall of Eastern Woodlands Indians=====
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
This hall details the lives and technology of [[Indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands|traditional Native American peoples]] in the woodland environments of eastern North America. Particular cultures exhibited include [[Cree]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]], [[Ojibwe]], and [[Iroquois]].

The [[Bernard Spitzer|Bernard and Anne Spitzer]] Hall of Human Origins, formerly The Hall of Human Biology and Evolution, opened on February 10, 2007.&lt;ref name="timeline2"/&gt; Originally known under the name "Hall of the Age of Man", at the time of its original opening in 1921 it was the only major exhibition in the United States to present an in-depth investigation of human evolution.&lt;ref name="Osborn 236–240"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/107236a0|last=Osborn|first=Henry Fairfield|authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn|title=The Hall of the Age of Man in the American Museum|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=107|pages=236–240|date=April 21, 1921|issue=2686|bibcode = 1921Natur.107..236O }}&lt;/ref&gt; The displays traced the story of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', illuminated the path of human evolution and examined the origins of human creativity.

Many of the celebrated displays from the original hall can still be viewed in the present expanded format. These include life-size dioramas of our human predecessors ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', [[Neanderthal]], and [[Cro-Magnon]], showing each species demonstrating the behaviors and capabilities that scientists believe they were capable of. Also displayed are full-sized casts of important fossils, including the 3.2-million-year-old [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] skeleton and the 1.7-million-year-old [[Turkana Boy]], and ''[[Homo erectus]]'' specimens including a cast of [[Peking Man]].

The hall also features replicas of [[ice age]] art found in the [[Dordogne]] region of southwestern [[France]]. The [[limestone]] carvings of horses were made nearly 26,000 years ago and are considered to represent some of the earliest artistic expression of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilford|first=John Noble|authorlink=John Noble Wilford|title=Meet the Relatives.

===Harry Frank Guggenheim Hall of Gems and Minerals===
{{Main article|Harry Frank Guggenheim Hall of Gems and Minerals}}
The [[Harry Frank Guggenheim]] Hall of Minerals houses hundreds of unusual geological specimens. It adjoins the Morgan Memorial Hall of [[gemstone|Gems]] showcasing many rare, and valuable gemstones.
The exhibit was designed by the architectural firm of Wm. F. Pedersen and Assoc. with Fred
Bookhardt in charge. Vincent Manson was the curator of the Mineralogy Department.
The exhibit took six years to design and build, 1970–1976. ''The New York Times'' architectural critic, Paul Goldberger, said, "It is one of the finest museum installations that New York City or any city has seen in many years".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Goldberger (April 14, 1977). [https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/14/archives/design-notebook.html "Design Notebook"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On display are many renowned samples that are chosen from among the museum's more than 100,000 pieces. Included among these are the Patricia Emerald, a 632 [[Carat (unit)|carat]] (126 g), 12 sided stone. It was discovered during the 1920s in a [[mining|mine]] high in the [[Andean Region of Colombia|Colombian Andes]] and was named for the mine-owner's daughter. The Patricia is one of the few large gem-quality emeralds that remains uncut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Patricia Emerald|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/earth-and-planetary-sciences-halls/morgan-memorial-hall-of-gems/patricia-emerald|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also on display is the 563 carat (113 g) [[Star of India (gem)|Star of India]], the largest, and most famous, star sapphire in the world. It was discovered over 300 years ago in [[Sri Lanka]],{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} most likely in the sands of ancient river beds from where [[star sapphires]] continue to be found today.

=== David S. and Ruth L. Gottesman Hall of Planet Earth ===
The [[David Gottesman|David S. and Ruth L. Gottesman]] Hall of Planet Earth is a permanent hall devoted to the history of Earth, from [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] to the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] and contemporary [[Human impact on the environment|human impacts]] on the planet. Several sections also discuss the studies of Earth systems, including [[geology]], [[glaciology]], [[atmospheric sciences]], and [[volcanology]].

The exhibit is famous for its large, touchable rock specimens. The hall features striking samples of [[Banded iron formation|banded iron]] and [[Metaconglomerate|deformed conglomerate rocks]], as well as [[granite]]s, [[sandstone]]s, [[lava]]s, and three [[Hydrothermal vent|black smokers]].

The north section of the hall, which deals primarily with [[plate tectonics]], is arranged to mimic the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's structure]], with the [[Inner core|core]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] at the center and [[Orogeny|crustal features]] on the perimeter.

Most of the museum's collections of mammalian and dinosaur [[fossil]]s remain hidden from public view. They are kept in numerous storage areas located deep within the museum complex. Among these, the most significant storage facility is the ten story [[Childs Frick]] Building which stands within an inner courtyard of the museum. During construction of the Frick, giant cranes were employed to lift steel beams directly from the street, over the roof, and into the courtyard, in order to ensure that the classic museum façade remained undisturbed. The predicted great weight of the fossil bones led designers to add special steel reinforcement to the building's framework, as it now houses the largest collection of fossil mammals and dinosaurs in the world. These collections occupy the basement and lower seven floors of the Frick Building, while the top three floors contain laboratories and offices. It is inside this particular building that many of the museum's intensive research programs into vertebrate paleontology are carried out.

Other areas of the museum contain repositories of life from the past. The [[Whale]] Bone Storage Room is a cavernous space in which powerful winches come down from the ceiling to move the giant fossil bones about. The museum attic upstairs includes even more storage facilities, such as the [[Elephant]] Room, while the [[tusk]] vault and [[boar]] vault are downstairs from the attic.&lt;ref name="preston"/&gt;{{rp|119–20}}

The great fossil collections that are open to public view occupy the entire fourth floor of the museum as well as a separate exhibit that is on permanent display in the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall, the museum's main entrance. The fourth floor exhibits allow the visitor to trace the evolution of vertebrates by following a circuitous path that leads through several museum buildings. On the 77th street side of the museum the visitor begins in the Orientation Center and follows a carefully marked path, which takes the visitor along an evolutionary [[tree of life (science)|tree of life]]. As the tree "branches" the visitor is presented with the familial relationships among vertebrates. This evolutionary pathway is known as a [[cladogram]].

To create a cladogram, scientists look for shared physical characteristics to determine the relatedness of different [[species]]. For instance, a cladogram will show a relationship between [[amphibian]]s, mammals, [[turtle]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[bird]]s since these apparently disparate groups share the trait of having 'four limbs with movable joints surrounded by muscle', making them [[tetrapod]]s. A group of related species such as the tetrapods is called a "[[clade]]". Within the tetrapod group only lizards and birds display yet another trait: "two openings in the skull behind the eye". Lizards and birds therefore represent a smaller, more closely related clade known as [[diapsid]]s. In a cladogram the evolutionary appearance of a new trait for the first time is known as a "node". Throughout the fossil halls the nodes are carefully marked along the evolutionary path and these nodes alert us to the appearance of new traits representing whole new branches of the evolutionary tree. Species showing these traits are on display in alcoves on either side of the path. A video projection on the museum's fourth floor introduces visitors to the concept of the cladogram, and is popular among children and adults alike.

Many of the fossils on display represent unique and historic pieces that were collected during the museum's golden era of worldwide expeditions (1880s to 1930s).&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; On a smaller scale, expeditions continue into the present and have resulted in additions to the collections from [[Vietnam]], [[Madagascar]], [[South America]], and central and eastern [[Africa]].

The 4th floor includes the following halls:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fossil Halls|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/fossil-halls|website=AMNH|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossils on display===
[[File:Amnh fg08.jpg|thumb|''[[Anatotitan]]'' fossil skeletons.]]
The many outstanding fossils on display include, among others:
* ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'': Composed almost entirely of real fossil bones, it is mounted in a horizontal stalking pose beautifully balanced on powerful legs. The specimen is actually composed of fossil bones from two ''T. rex'' skeletons discovered in [[Montana]] in 1902 and 1908 by famous dinosaur hunter [[Barnum Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fossil Halls|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/fossilhalls/vertebrate/specimens/trex.php|accessdate=March 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312055038/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/fossilhalls/vertebrate/specimens/trex.php|archivedate=March 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Mammuthus]]'': Larger than its relative the [[woolly mammoth]], these fossils are from an animal that lived 11,000 years ago in [[Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fossil Halls|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/fossilhalls/vertebrate/specimens/mammuthus.php|accessdate=March 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225201815/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/fossilhalls/vertebrate/specimens/mammuthus.php|archivedate=February 25, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' or ''[[Brontosaurus]]'': This giant specimen was discovered at the end of the 19th century. Although most of its fossil bones are original, the skull is not, since none was found on site. It was only many years later that the first ''Apatosaurus'' skull was discovered, and so a plaster cast of that skull was made and placed on the museum's mount. A ''[[Camarasaurus]]'' skull had been used mistakenly until a correct skull was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fossil Halls|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/fossilhalls/vertebrate/specimens/apatosaurus.php|accessdate=March 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325011628/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/fossilhalls/vertebrate/specimens/apatosaurus.php|archivedate=March 25, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not entirely certain whether this specimen is a ''Brontosaurus'' or an ''Apatosaurus'', and therefore it is considered an "unidentified [[Apatosaurinae|apatosaurine]]", as it could also potentially be an ''[[Amphicoelias]]'' or ''[[Atlantosaurus]]'' specimen.
* ''[[Brontops]]'': Extinct mammal distantly related to the [[horse]] and [[rhinoceros]]. It lived 35 million years ago in what is now [[South Dakota]]. It is noted for its magnificent and unusual pair of horns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fossil Halls|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/fossilhalls/vertebrate/specimens/brontops.php|accessdate=March 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204083040/http://amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/fossilhalls/vertebrate/specimens/brontops.php|archivedate=February 4, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A skeleton of ''[[Edmontosaurus annectens]]'', a large [[herbivorous]] [[ornithopod]] dinosaur. The specimen is an example of a "mummified" dinosaur fossil in which the soft tissue and skin impressions were imbedded in the surrounding rock. The specimen is mounted as it was found, lying on its side with its legs drawn up and head drawn backwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Ornithischian Dinosaurs|url=http://www.amnh.org/join-support/naming-opportunities/name-a-fossil/hall-of-ornithischian-dinosaurs|website=AMNH|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On September 26, 2007, an 80-million-year-old, {{convert|2|ft|cm|adj=on}} diameter fossil of an [[ammonite]], which is composed entirely of the gemstone [[ammolite]], made its debut at the museum. Neil Landman, curator of fossil [[invertebrates]], explained that ammonites (shelled [[cephalopod]] [[mollusk]]s in the subclass Ammonoidea) became extinct [[KT event|66 million years ago]], in the same [[extinction event]] that killed the dinosaurs.

The [[Hayden Planetarium]], connected to the museum, is now part of the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]], housed in a glass cube containing the spherical Space Theater, designed by [[James Stewart Polshek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Goldberger|title=Stairway to the Stars|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=January 17, 2000|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2000/01/17/2000_01_17_072_TNY_LIBRY_000020017|accessdate=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway]] is one of the most popular exhibits in the Rose Center, which opened February 19, 2000.&lt;ref name="timeline2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline: The History of the American Museum of Natural History |url=http://www.amnh.org/museum/history/index4.html |accessdate=March 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310030550/http://www.amnh.org/museum/history/index4.html |archivedate=March 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Hayden Planetarium was founded in 1933 with a donation by philanthropist [[Charles Hayden (banker)|Charles Hayden]]. Opened in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Christopher|title=A Remnant of the 1930's, and Its Sky, Will Fall|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 16, 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/18/realestate/a-remnant-of-the-1930-s-and-its-sky-will-fall.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was demolished and replaced in 2000 by the $210 million Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space. Designed by James Stewart Polshek, the new building consists of a six-story high glass cube enclosing a {{convert|87|ft|m|adj=on}} illuminated sphere that appears to float—although it is actually supported by truss work. James Polshek has referred to his work as a "cosmic cathedral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glancey|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Glancey|title=A cosmic cathedral on 81st Street|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 8, 2000|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/may/08/artsfeatures1|accessdate=March 18, 2009| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rose Center and its adjacent plaza, both located on the north facade of the museum, are regarded as some of Manhattan's most outstanding recent architectural additions. The facility encloses {{convert|333500|sqft|m2}} of research, education, and exhibition space as well as the Hayden planetarium. Also located in the facility is the Department of [[Astrophysics]], the newest academic research department in the museum. [[Neil DeGrasse Tyson]] is the director of the Hayden Planetarium. Further, Polshek designed the {{convert|1800|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Weston Pavilion, a {{convert|43|ft|m|adj=on}} high transparent structure of "water white" glass along the museum's west facade. This structure, a small companion piece to the Rose Center, offers a new entry way to the museum as well as opening further exhibition space for astronomically related objects. The planetarium's former magazine, ''The Sky'', merged with "The Telescope", to become the astronomy magazine ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=

==Exhibitions Lab==
{{Main article|AMNH Exhibitions Lab}}
Founded in 1869, the AMNH Exhibitions Lab has since produced thousands of installations. The department is notable for its integration of new scientific research into immersive art and multimedia presentations. In addition to the famous dioramas at its home museum and the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]], the lab has also produced international exhibitions and software such as the [[Digital Universe Atlas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMNH Education Exhibition|url=http://rggs.amnh.org/pages/school_overview/amnh_education_exhibition|accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibitions team currently consists of over sixty artists, writers, preparators, designers and programmers. The department is responsible for the creation of two to three exhibits per year. These extensive shows typically travel nationally to sister [[natural history museums]]. They have produced, among others, the first exhibits to discuss [[Darwinian evolution]],&lt;ref name="Osborn 236–240"/&gt; [[Climate change|human-induced climate change]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In the Hall of Biodiversity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/01/opinion/in-the-hall-of-biodiversity.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=June 4, 2013|date=June 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[KT Boundary|mesozoic mass extinction]] via [[asteroid]].

==Research Library==
The Research Library is open to staff and public visitors, and is located on the fourth floor of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/our-research/research-library |title=Research Library |publisher=Amnh.org |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library collects materials covering such subjects as [[mammalogy]], [[earth science|earth]] and [[planetary science]], [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]], [[anthropology]], entomology, [[herpetology]], [[ichthyology]], paleontology, [[ethology]], ornithology, [[mineralogy]], [[invertebrate]]s, [[systematics]], [[ecology]], [[oceanography]], conchology, exploration and travel, [[history of science]], [[museology]], [[bibliography]], [[genomics]], and peripheral [[biological sciences]].

===History===
In its early years, the Library expanded its collection mostly through such gifts as the John C. Jay [[conchology|conchological]] library, the [[Carson Brevoort]] library on fishes and general zoology, the ornithological library of [[Daniel Giraud Elliot]], the [[Henry Edwards (entomologist)|Harry Edwards]] [[Entomology|entomological]] library, the [[Hugh Jewett]] collection of voyages and travel and the [[Jules Marcou]] [[geology]] collection. In 1903 the [[American Ethnological Society]] deposited its library in the museum and in 1905 the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] followed suit by transferring its collection of 10,000 volumes.

Today, the Library's collections contain over 550,000 volumes of [[monographs]], [[periodical publication|serials]], [[pamphlets]], [[reprints]], [[microform]]s, and original illustrations, as well as film, photographic, archives and manuscripts, fine art, memorabilia and rare book collections.

The new Library was designed by the firm [[Roche-Dinkeloo]] in 1992. The space is 55,000-sq ft and includes five different 'conservation zones', ranging from the 50-person reading room and public offices, to temperature and humidity controlled rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/07/nyregion/handling-fragile-story-man-with-care-museum-natural-history-library-moves-its.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|first=Glenn|last=Collins|title=Handling the (Fragile) Story of Man With Care; Museum of Natural History Library Moves Its Million-Item Collection to a New Home|date=November 7, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities offered==

===Research activities===
[[File:Matrix barcode AMNH PBI 00388325.png|thumb|A [[matrix barcode]] that uniquely identifies a specimen in the museum's entomology collection.]]
The museum has a scientific staff of more than 225, and sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year. Many of the fossils on display represent unique and historic pieces that were collected during the museum's golden era of worldwide expeditions (1880s to 1930s). Examples of some of these expeditions, financed in whole or part by the AMNH are: [[Jesup North Pacific Expedition]], the [[Whitney South Seas Expedition]], the [[Roosevelt–Rondon Scientific Expedition]], the [[Crocker Land Expedition]], and the expeditions to Madagascar and New Guinea by [[Richard Archbold]]. On a smaller scale, expeditions continue into the present. The museum also publishes several peer-reviewed journals, including the ''[[Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.amnh.org/scientific-publications AMNH Scientific Publications], American Museum of Natural History, Retrieved January 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, animal rights activist [[Henry Spira]] led a campaign against vivisection on cats that the American Museum of Natural History had been conducting for 20 years, intended to research the impact of certain types of mutilation on the sex lives of cats. The museum halted the research in 1977.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Surroundings==
The museum is located at 79th Street and Central Park West, accessible via the {{NYCS trains|Eighth center local day}} of the [[New York City Subway]]. There is a low-level floor direct access into the museum via the [[81st Street – Museum of Natural History (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|81st Street – Museum of Natural History]] subway station on the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] at the south end of the upper platform (where uptown trains arrive).

On a pedestal outside the museum's [[Columbus Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus Avenue]] entrance is a stainless steel [[time capsule]], which was created after a design competition that was won by [[Santiago Calatrava]]. The capsule was sealed at the beginning of 2000, to mark the beginning of the 3rd millennium. It takes the form of a folded saddle-shaped volume, symmetrical on multiple axes, that explores formal properties of folded spherical frames. Calatrava described it as "a flower". The plan is that the capsule will be opened in the year 3000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Design Is Selected for Times Capsule|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 2, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/02/arts/design-is-selected-for-times-capsule.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is situated in a {{convert|17|acre|m2|adj=on}} city park known as "Theodore Roosevelt Park". The park extends from Central Park West to Columbus Avenue, and from West 77th Street to West 81st Street. Theodore Roosevelt Park contains park benches, gardens and lawns, and also a [[dog run]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Roosevelt Park, City of New York Parks &amp; Recreation [http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/M053/history] Accessed April 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barda Balka''' is an [[archeological site]] near the [[Little Zab]] and [[Chamchamal]] in the north of modern-day [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="Braidwood"&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc31.pdf Braidwood, Robert., &amp; Howe, Bruce., Prehistoric Investigations in Iraqi Kurdistan, The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, Studies in Ancient Oriental CIvilization, No. 31, University of Chicago Press, 1960.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was discovered on a hilltop in 1949 by Sayid Fuad Safar and Naji al-Asil from the [[Directorate General of Antiquities, Iraq]]. It was later excavated by [[Bruce Howe (archaeologist)|Bruce Howe]] and [[Herbert E. Wright]] in 1951. Stone tools were found amongst a particular layer of [[Pleistocene]] [[gravel]]s that dated to the late [[Acheulean]] period. The tools included [[pebble tool]]s, [[biface]]s and [[lithic flake]]s that were suggested to be amongst the oldest evidence of human occupation in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Braidwood"/&gt; They were found comparable with tools known to have been made around eighty thousand years ago.&lt;ref name="Roux1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Georges Roux|title=Ancient Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klZX8B_RzzYC&amp;pg=PT72|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=27 August 1992|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193825-7|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Neolithic]] [[megalith]] is also located at the centre of the site around which the tools were found.&lt;ref name="Roux1992"/&gt;

A '''blackout gag''' is a kind of joke in broad, rapid-fire [[slapstick]] comedy. The term is derived from [[burlesque]] and [[vaudeville]], when the lights were quickly turned off after the punchline of a joke to accentuate it and/or allow for audience laughter. It may use a shock value to define the joke, and may not be initially noticeable to all viewers if it is a very fast joke.

It is distinguished from an [[iris shot]], frequently used in the [[silent film]] era, where a black circle closes to end a scene.

The term "blackout gag" can also apply to fast-paced TV or film comedy, such as ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'', where there may not literally be a blackout, but a quick cut to the next gag.

'''''Break Away''''' is a national nonprofit organization that promotes the development of quality [[alternative break]] programs through training, assisting, and connecting campuses and communities. The organization has chapters on about 200 college campuses throughout the United States. Break Away holds training sessions for directors at each chapter school, who then train the student leaders and participants. 
An alternative break consists of a group of college students who serve a community with a focus on a specific social issue for a specific amount of time, whether it is a weekend or a week. Most trips are weeklong trips, with the majority over college spring breaks. 60% of trips occur over spring breaks and 15% occur over winter breaks. The social issue pertains to the community to which the group goes. Break Away emphasizes service-learning in which group members learn about the community they will be serving and how to avoid [[voluntourism]]. Break Away encourages student leaders, with each trip consisting of student leaders, student participants, a partner organization, and most of the time, a learning partner. By emphasizing the Active Citizenship Continuum and the Eight Components of a Quality Alternative Break, Break Away hopes to produce valuable alternative breaks, which will then lead participants to become more aware and active in their community. Break Away has about 200 chapter schools, more than 500 nonprofit partnerships, and thousands of participants and alumni worldwide. Just in 2014, there were a total of 1,551 trips with over 20,000 participants, which equates to over 1 million hours of service. Of the 1,551 trips in 2014, 1,334 were domestic and 251 were international.

== History ==
Two students, Michael Magevney and Laura Mann, founded Break Away in June 1991 at Vanderbilt University after the creation of Alternative Spring Break on the campus in 1987. While still at Vanderbilt University, the organization was funded by the chancellor’s discretionary fund. In 2000, the organization expanded to Florida State University where it was housed by the Center for Civic Education and Service. In 2007, Break Away headquarters moved to Atlanta, Georgia where it shared a space with Hands On Network/Points of Light, which also had a goal of creating volunteer opportunities but for recent college graduates and alternative break alumni. The growth of Break Away accelerated considerably, around 20%, in the mid-2000s after Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast. In 2010, the organization saw another acceleration, this time in terms of international trips. With the early 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the organization created the Haiti Compact with five American colleges – American University, the College of William and Mary, Indiana University, Loyola Marymount University, and the University of Maryland – which organized trips to the country. The Compact sought to develop the best practice for international alternative breaks, specifically in aiding participants in overcoming potential harm to the community, while also increasing service-learning. The College of William and Mary originally committed to serving in Haiti for four years following the 2010 earthquake, but since they have extended it to eight.

The organization has an annual budget of $160,000, which is mainly funded through chapter membership dues. Each year, the organization holds about 20 two-day retreats on college campuses to educate on fundraising, conflict resolution, and group building, which are attended by chapter directors and leaders. They also hold Alternative Break Citizen Schools, ABCs, which are weeklong leadership training sessions for students who lead their college’s Break Away chapter.

== Active Citizenship ==
The Active Citizen Continuum is the driving force behind Break Away. The goal for each person is to become an Active Citizen, which is achieved by going through each of the steps. Every person begins as a Member, someone who is not concerned with their role in social problems. A Member then becomes a Volunteer, someone who is well intentioned but not well educated about social issues, through exposure. That Volunteer starts to get an understanding for a particular social issue and becomes a Conscientious Citizen, someone who is concerned with discovering root causes and asks why. Finally, that Conscientious Citizen begins to take action and becomes an Active Citizen, someone who prioritizes the community and social issue into their values and life choices. The aim for the Active Citizen Continuum is to create citizens that are aware of social issues in the world and who commit to resolving those issues.

== Eight Components of a Quality Alternative Break ==
All components are equally important in order to create the best alternative break trips as possible.
#Strong Direct Service: Trips provide an opportunity for interaction and hands-on activities with a community.
#Alcohol and Drug-Free: This allows for group cohesion and development.
#Diversity and Social Justice: Not only do the communities in which the trips will occur embody diversity, the students who make up the groups do as well. 
#Orientation: Before leaving for their trip, each group discusses the issue and learns about the community and the organization that they will be working with.
#Education: To go along with the emphasis of service-learning, members are educated on the social issue of their community and how their community and lives are associated to it as well.
#Training: Members learn basic skills to complete the tasks given to them by the organizations they work with in the community, such as learning how to use a handsaw.
#Reflection: This piece occurs during the trip, when leaders and members are encouraged to discuss their experiences to promote group cohesion and understanding.
#Reorientation: This piece occurs after the trip, in which group members are encouraged to take what they learned from their experiences on their trip and put them into place in their own community by finding organizations that relate to the social issue of their trip.

== Voluntourism ==
{{see also|International volunteering#Critiques and challenges}}
One of Break Away’s goals is to avoid voluntourism or volunteer tourism, which is a form of tourism in which travelers participate in volunteer work. By incorporating the service-learning aspect of alternative breaks, participants are able to learn about the community they will be serving prior to their arrival, which decreases the chances of tourism. Voluntourism can have the opposite effect of its intended purpose of helping a community, instead, it has been shown to generate potential harm to a community. For instance, in an orphanage in Cambodia, the presence of wealthy volunteers has slowed the market for adopting the orphans in the town. Through Break Away, participants are able to learn about the culture and the social issues within a specific community before their departure, which allows them to understand the community better.

== Membership ==
With around 200 chapters countrywide, Break Away has two levels of membership. The first level of membership is Associate, which has an annual fee of $350 and includes SiteBank access, ongoing Break Away consultation, access to resources, listing as an Associate Chapter, forum access, and 10% discount on trainings and products. The highest level of membership is Advantage, which is $700 per year and includes everything that Associate offers, as well as listing as an Advantage Chapter, 20% discount on trainings and products and one free Alternative Break Citizen School registration.

==The number of letters==

Although Byron's life was cut short at the age of only 36, almost 3000 letters of his are known.{{sfn|Marchand|1981|p=1}}  There are three main reasons why that number is so large: one is simply the pleasure Byron took in composing them; another is the fact that Byron spent many years in self-imposed exile in Italy and Greece, which made it necessary for him to write to keep in touch with his friends in England; and finally, the sensational success of ''Childe Harold's Pilgrimage'' when Byron was only 23 turned him into a national and then international celebrity, making his letters valuable relics to be collected rather than thrown away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1927 |editor1-last=Collins |editor1-first=V. H. |title=Lord Byron in His Letters: Selections from His Letters and Journals |location=London |publisher=John Murray |page=vi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correspondents==

Byron's correspondents can be divided up into successive groups.  As a boy he wrote to his mother, his half-sister [[Augusta Leigh|Augusta]], and the family lawyer John Hanson.  At [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]] there were John Pigot and his sister [[Elizabeth Bridget Pigot|Elizabeth]].  Byron's friends at college included Scrope Davies, [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|John Cam Hobhouse]] and [[Francis Hodgson]].  With the publication of ''Childe Harold'' he became known to a new circle, the poets [[Robert Charles Dallas]], [[Thomas Moore]] and [[Samuel Rogers]], along with his banker [[Douglas Kinnaird]] and his publisher [[John Murray (1778–1843)|John Murray]].  Then there were the women who fell in love with him: [[Lady Caroline Lamb]], [[Frances Caroline Wedderburn-Webster|Lady Frances Webster]], [[Jane Harley, Countess of Oxford and Countess Mortimer|Lady Oxford]], and his future wife [[Lady Byron|Annabella Milbancke]]; also his confidante [[Lady Melbourne]].  A new group of friends in Switzerland included the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], Shelley's wife [[Mary Shelley|Mary]] and sister-in-law [[Claire Clairmont]].  Members of the Shelley circle with whom Byron corresponded included [[Thomas Medwin]], [[Edward Ellerker Williams|Edward Williams]] and his common-law wife [[Jane Williams|Jane]], [[Edward John Trelawny]], and the poet [[Leigh Hunt]].  In Venice there were Byron's lover [[Teresa, Contessa Guiccioli|Teresa Guiccioli]], her brother Gamba and husband Count Guiccioli, the British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, and Alexander Scott&lt;ref&gt;The Morgan Library, [https://www.themorgan.org/literary-historical/81465 Collection of autograph letters signed : Ravenna, to Alexander Scott, 1819 June 10 - Oct. 2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Bradbury, [https://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/BJ.2001.6 "Come back to Venice, My Lord" : Alexander Scott's Letters to Lord Byron, in The Byron Journal, n° 29, 2001, p. 47-61].&lt;/ref&gt;.  Finally, Byron's Greek adventure brought him into contact with a new circle: the rebel leader [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos|Prince Mavrokordatos]], the banker [[Samuel Barff]], and members of the [[London Philhellenic Committee]], including Colonel [[Leicester Stanhope, 5th Earl of Harrington|Leicester Stanhope]].{{sfn|Maurois|1936|pp=x-xi}}

==Editions==

In 1830, 6 years after his death, about 560 of Byron's letters were published by his friend Thomas Moore under the title ''Letters and Journals of Lord Byron: With Notices of his Life''.{{sfn|Lansdown|2015|p=xi}}  The next edition of the letters and journals appeared in six volumes in 1898-1901, edited by [[Rowland Prothero, 1st Baron Ernle|R. E. Prothero]] as part of a 13-volume ''Works''.  Prothero included nearly 1200 letters, conscientiously edited, though like Moore he excised all passages likely to offend 19th-century sensibilities.  A collection of about 350 unpublished letters was bequeathed by John Hobhouse's daughter Lady Dorchester to John Murray, who published them as ''Lord Byron’s Correspondence'' in 1922, in two volumes, though yet again in a bowdlerized form.  In 1950 [[Peter Quennell]] produced a selection of the letters, called ''Byron: A Self-Portrait'', of which 50 letters had not up to that point been published.{{sfn|Marchand|1973|p=24}}   In 1966 the American literary scholar [[Leslie A. Marchand]], having written a magisterial biography of Byron, began work on editing his letters.  The result, ''Byron's Letters and Journals'', appeared in 11 volumes plus an index volume between 1973 and 1982, with a final supplementary volume in 1994.  He was assisted in his work by the edition's publisher, John Murray VI, grandson of the earlier editor and great-great-grandson of Byron's own publisher.  Marchand's work included about 3000 letters, and it remains the reference edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.nls.uk/jma/who/marchand/index.html |title=Leslie A Marchand (1900-1999) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=The John Murray Archive |publisher=National Library of Scotland |access-date=27 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two volumes won the [[Modern Language Association]]'s [[James Russell Lowell Prize]] for 1974, the judges calling it "an outstanding achievement in humane editing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674089419 |title=Byron's Letters and Journals, Volume II: ‘Famous in My Time’, 1810-1812 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |publisher=Harvard University Press |access-date=27 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674089440&amp;content=reviews |title=Byron's Letters and Journals, Volume IV: 'Wedlock's the Devil', 1814-1815 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |publisher=Harvard University Press |access-date=27 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1982 he followed this up with a one-volume selection of Byron's letters and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burt |first1=Daniel S. |author-link1=Daniel Burt (author) |year=2001 |title=The Biography Book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jpFrgSAaKAUC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Marchand+has+chosen%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizgrSNs6rYAhXSKlAKHamNBhsQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Marchand%20has%20chosen%22&amp;f=false |location=Westport, CT |publisher=Oryx Press |page=54 |isbn=1573562564 |access-date=27 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 Richard Lansdown published  another selection, which differed from Marchand's in being about twice the size and in attempting to cover Byron's whole life rather than just picking out the best letters.  Jeffery Vail called it "engrossing, moving, hilarious, and sometimes heartbreaking", and preferred it to the Marchand selection.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |last=Markovits |first=Benjamin |date=10 May 2015 |title=Review of ''Byron's Letters and Journals: A New Selection'' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/11591857/Byrons-Letters-and-Journals-aNewSelection-ed-by-Richard-Lansdown-review.html |work=The Telegraph |location=London |access-date=27 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last1=Vail |first1=Jeffery |date=2016 |title=Review of ''Byron's Letters and Journals: A New Selection'' |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/673669 |journal=Keats-Shelley Journal |volume=65 |page=173 |access-date=27 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5492">'''Californians for Population Stabilization''' (CAPS) is a non-profit California organization founded in 1986 which works to "preserve California's future through the stabilization of our state's [[human population]]." CAPS was the former branch of the [[Zero Population Growth]] (ZPG) organization. It supports "replacement-level" immigration, and does so "without regard to race, ethnicity, or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;Coates A. Peter. ''American Perceptions of Immigrant and Invasive Species: Strangers on the Land'', Univ. of Calif. Press (2006) p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Its aim is to help advance state policies and programs designed to stabilize the population at a level which they feel "will preserve a good [[quality of life]] for all Californians."&lt;ref name=CAPS&gt;CAPS website [http://www.capsweb.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It asserts that the current growth of population is "[[sustainability|unsustainable]]," and contributes to a growing strain on the environment and infrastructure. CAPS is listed in the annual ''Conservation Directory'', published by the [[National Wildlife Federation]], as among the numerous organizations supporting conservation and preserving the natural environment in California.&lt;ref&gt;''2002 Conservation Directory: The Guide to Worldwide Environmental Organizations'', National Wildlife Federation, Island Press (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration==
The high [[unemployment rate]] in California is one of CAPS's key worries. Dick Schneider, Chairman of the Board of CAPS, has stated that the national government is "admitting more new, legal immigrants every month than the number of new jobs our economy is creating." According to CAPS, more legal immigrants settle in California than any other state, despite having unemployment rates as high as 18% in some parts of the state.&lt;ref name=PRNW/&gt; 

CAPS is equally concerned with the cost of educating immigrants. They stated, "California cannot be expected to educate millions of children brought here by untold numbers of illegal aliens and millions of legal immigrants. Schools have reached the crisis point."&lt;ref&gt;Schrag, Peter. ''California: America's High-Stakes Experiment'', Univ. of California Press (2008) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also supports work by groups such as "English First," whose 140,000 members oppose costly bilingual education.&lt;ref&gt;Tottie, Gunnel. ''An Introduction To American English'', Wiley-Blackwell p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization stresses its belief that both legal and [[illegal immigration]] are the cause of "California's runaway [[population growth]]." According to author Edward C. Hartman, CAPS is "determined to fill the gap created by the failure of conventional environmental organizations" that do not actively oppose population growth in America. The organization is unique in that many of its board members have held leadership positions in national environmental organizations. It relies on various sources to reach the public, including television and radio ads, public events with notable speakers, articles and commentaries, and at various speaking engagements.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Edward C. ''The Population Fix: Breaking America's Addiction to Population Growth'', Think Population Press, (published by Californians for Population Stabilization) (2006) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; A CAPS-sponsored TV ad ran on [[MSNBC]] during the Republican presidential debate in September, 2011.&lt;ref name=PRNW&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/california-group-to-run-tv-ad-in-presidential-debate-calling-for-less-legal-immigration-to-open-more-jobs-129303973.html "California Group to Run TV Ad in Presidential Debate Calling for Less Legal Immigration to Open More Jobs"], Press Release, ''Californians for Population Stabilization'', Sept. 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

CAPS supports [[immigration reduction]]. In 1993, CAPS filed a lawsuit against [[Hewlett Packard]] alleging that HP was violating California labor laws and paid residents of India who came to the U.S. below-market wages as contract programmers. The lawsuit was first publicized on CBS's "[[60 Minutes]]," and CAPS claimed that such wage practices would drive down wages for U.S. workers.&lt;ref&gt;''Computerworld'', Oct. 11, 1993 p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; CAPS ultimately lost the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1389802.html |litigants=Californians for Population Stabilization v.

The '''conservation and restoration of insect specimens''' is the process of caring for and preserving insects as a part of a collection. Conservation concerns begin at collection and continue through preparation, storage, examination, documentation, research and treatment when restoration is needed.

== Collection ==
[[File:Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay with Ernst Hackel 1866.jpg|left|thumb|261x261px]]
[[Insect collecting]] can be done in many different ways depending on the kind of insects being collected and from which habitats. Both hobbyists and professional entomologist have found particular ways to collect with minimal damage to their specimens. Following established techniques helps begin the conservation of insect specimens from the beginning by eliminating as much potential damage as possible. It must be done delicately to ensure that neither the collector nor the live insect itself will cause harm to the distinctive features such as wings, legs and antennae that give purpose to the collection. Special collection nets, traps and techniques must be utilized in consideration of how easily breakage can happen. A [[kill jar]] is often used to immediately immobilize the insect before it can damage itself.

== Preparation ==
The way an insect specimen is prepared is often the first step in their conservation. They have to be carefully prepared with the appropriate methods depending on their size, anatomy, and potentially delicate features to ensure they will not break before they begin their role as a specimen available for study, research and display. Some specimens must be prepared using a dry method and others with liquid to preserve. The choice made will preserve key features necessary for identification and represent the insect's living form as closely as possible.

=== Pinning ===
[[File:Neduba morsei, female, lateral view.jpg|thumb]]
The process of '''pinning''' insect specimens is a dry method to preserve and display collections and requires special [[Entomological equipment for mounting and storage|entomological equipment]] to accomplish effectively. It is used primarily for hard-bodied, medium to large specimens and is beneficial for easier study and color preservation. Flies and butterflies, though they are partially soft-bodied, are also best preserved through pinning because when preserved in fluid their hairs and/or scales will either clot or fall off.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 20 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; Some smaller specimens may still be pinned use minuten pins, which are much thinner, to avoid breakage. Insects are pinned on foam block or specialized pinning blocks that provide support for the limbs while drying and may be moved to another specialized, protected display case after they have dried completely, at which point they will be more brittle. The pin is most often driven through the thorax of the insect just to the right of the mid-line to preserve the appearance of at least one side should any damage occur from pinning. The exception is butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies, which are pinned through the middle of the thorax.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Enough of the pin must be left both above and below the specimen to allow for labeling below and handling.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StagedandCardedInsects.jpg|left|thumb]]

=== Carding ===
'''Carding''' is used when pinning would destroy too much of the specimen because its size is quite small.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; A triangular point is cut from acid free card to ensure best conservation practice because it comes in direct contact with the specimen. A pin is then driven through the broad side of the point for mounting. A soluble glue that can be removed with solvents when necessary is used to adhere the right side of the thorax of the specimen to the point opposite the pinned side. The point is sometimes bent to allow the specimen to present in the same position as normally pinned specimens.

=== Wet specimen ===
A '''wet specimen''' is a specimen preserved in fluid, often 70% alcohol. Specimens that would receive this preservation technique are usually soft-bodied, such as caterpillars, larva, and spiders because of their soft abdomens. This is done to minimize shriveling allowing the identifying characteristics to be preserved as true to life as possible. Hard-bodied insects may also be preserved temporarily in alcohol before pinning.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slides ===
Slides of very small insects are also kept as part of insect collections.

== Core aspects of conservation ==
The [[American Institute for Conservation]] (AIC) describes in their [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice.pdf?sfvrsn=9 Code of Ethics] the aspects of conservation to include: preventive conservation, examination, documentation, treatment, research and education. Each of these areas also apply to the conservation and restoration of insect specimens.

=== Preventive conservation ===
Insect collections may suffer multiple types of degradation including fading colors from light exposure, mold growth from improper humidity and temperature levels, and infestations from pests that feed on dried insect,&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M Agrilife Extension, (n.d.) [http://bughunter.tamu.edu/preservation/preservationconsider/ Bug hunter: Preservation considerations] Retrieved 2017-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; but much of this is avoidable when proper [[preventive conservation]] practices are followed.

==== Routine cleaning ====
In addition to maintaining a clean storage environment for specimens, it is sometimes necessary to clean the specimens themselves. Cleaning incredibly delicate and brittle dry insect specimens is done carefully and methodically. The conservator chooses the appropriate method based on the kind of insect that needs cleaning and how robust it is. Cleaning tools vary widely, but generally clean watercolor brushes are used to gently dust the specimens, sometimes with a [[stereo microscope]] for very small specimens, warm water and/or alcohol baths used with or without an ultrasonic cleaner, and lens blowers to gently blow away dust, or dry the specimen after a cleansing bath.&lt;ref&gt;Ingles-LeNobel, Johan, J. (March, 2017). [http://extreme-macro.co.uk/cleaning-insects/ How to clean insects] Retrieved 2017-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proper storage ====
A common way to prevent damage from pests intent to feed on insect specimens and dust accumulation in a collection is to keep them in sealed boxes or cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, [http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_zoological_specimens.pdf Care and conservation of zoological specimens] Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; When properly sealed, they can also aid in preventing damages cause by [[relative humidity]] (RH)  and temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Szczepanowska, H., Shockley, F., Furth, D. G., Gentile, P., Bell, D., DePriest, P. T., Mecklenburg, M., Hawks, C. Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections. (2013). Effectiveness of entomological collection storage cabinets in maintaining stable relative humidity and temperature in a historic museum building. ''Collection Forum, 27(1-2),'' 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Wet specimens are kept in separate vials or jars and in a secure cabinet, tray or shelf. Fluid levels are regularly monitored to ensure specimens are completely immersed in fluid, though a well-sealed jar or vial will prevent excessive evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Safe handling ====
Proper handling for insect specimens prevents the excessive breaking of legs, antennae and other body parts that could then easily be lost. Curved forceps may be used to allow more precision and less chance of the brittle specimen coming in contact with the handler. The handler picks up the specimen by the pin, which is placed with enough space below the specimen for the handler to put in the pinning block and enough space above to grip without touching the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Integrated pest management ====
'''[[Integrated Pest Management (for museums)|Integrated pest management]]''' (IPM) is a specialized modern pest control used in museums.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R. A., &amp; Allman Gilmore, J. (2010). ''Museum registration methods 5th edition''. Washington, DC: The AAM Press&lt;/ref&gt; All IPM systems begin with regular sanitation and  monitoring of collections to detect castings from various pests, and checking insect traps laid out to capture and identify which pests are present. Some pests, such as carpet beetles and flour beetles, feed on dried insects.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 27 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; When an infestation is present, treatment may be necessary. Freezing is commonly used to rid insect collections of pests.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Conservation Institute, (1997), [https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/ccinotesicc/3-3_e.pdf Controlling insect pests with low temperature] ''CCI Notes'' Retrieved 2017-04-08&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[inert gases]] may be used for an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] [[fumigation]] - depriving the pests of oxygen to exterminate, and in extreme cases chemical fumigation proven to be safe for collections and people may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, D., Dec. 1995, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN10-Dec1995.pdf Pest control in entomological collections] ''Insect collection news No. 10'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examination  ===
[[File:Isoparce cupressi sjh.JPG|left|thumb|322x322px|Verdigris is present near the pin and an antennae is missing.]]
Assessing the condition of an insect collection is done regularly and the results are recorded accordingly. The conservator observes the specimens in high detail remarking all areas of damage, or altered states of the specimen. Tools used during this process may include a strong light source, magnifying glass and handling tools that allow the conservator to pick up the specimen from the pin without touching it. The observations made during the examination process result in the conclusions drawn for a treatment plan if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, B. (2010). ''Conservation treatment methodology.'' San Bernardino, CA. {{ISBN|1453682112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservator is knowledgeable of the kinds of deterioration to look for specific to insect specimens.

==== Common agents of deterioration ====
* Pests - Evidence of pests are recognized in castings of insects, their droppings or the damages they have caused from chewing on specimens.
* Mold - Mold is most likely to grow when humidity is high. 
* Verdigris - A blue-green hair-like crystallization caused by reaction to copper and brass entomological pins and the fats from the insects internal organs.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, [http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_zoological_specimens.pdf Care and conservation of zoological specimens] Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentation ===
The documentation of insect specimens is carried out in many different aspects of a specimen's existence. Documented information begins with the capture of an insect. The collector records information about capture method, place and date of capture and any relevant habitat information in field notes. This information is then transferred to labels and collection records. The documentation path then continues with every recorded observation or treatment the specimen receives. Killing agents, preservation agents, rehydrating agents, and fumigants are all important to record.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, J., Dec. 1992, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN8_Nov1992.pdf Insect collection conservation] ''Insect collection news No. 8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; This then informs any future decisions for conservation actions.

==== Labeling ====
As a minimum, labels contain the place and date of collection, and the identification of genus and species. On pinned insects, the labels are likewise pinned with the space left under the specimen on the same pin.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways to write the information on labels, but an ink that will not fade or come off in liquid is generally used. The paper is ideally 100% cotton or linen rag to avoid yellowing or embrittlement of the paper as it ages.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, J., Dec. 1992, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN8_Nov1992.pdf Insect collection conservation] ''Insect collection news No. 8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 3289 A pinned Australian sheep blowfly.jpg|left|thumb|145x145px]]

==== Photographing and digitization ====
With improvements in [[digital photography]] and web resources, many natural history museums have begun a new kind of documentation through digitization, bringing high quality images and associated information to anyone with access to the Internet. Large databases can hold vast amounts of information improving research efforts.

[[File:Odonata aeshnidae adult.jpg|thumb|Pen and ink scientific illustration of a dragonfly.]]

==== Illustrating ====
[[Scientific illustration]] of insects is an older technique used to preserve information about collected insects. It visually documents insects, and unlike photography, can add intellectual ideas about anatomy and behavior of the insect through artists' renditions. Scientifically informed observation of specimens combined with technical and aesthetic skill yields the highly detailed illustrations necessary for the documentation of each species that is illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, E. R. S. (2003). ''The guild handbook of scientific illustration: Second edition.'' Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Description of the state of the specimen and treatments ====
This area of insect specimen documentation comes after the close examination of specimens by conservators. The conservator records all of the visual information about the specimen that can be gleaned from detailed inspection. Conclusions are drawn from inspection and potential treatments are also documented to inform researchers and future conservators.

=== Research ===
Researching the collections of insects provides important information that develops knowledge about ecology, human health and crops.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; Well-kept records aid the researcher in identifying whether there are differences in an observed specimen because of damages, treatments or deterioration. Research of the insect collections in museums can lead to new discoveries of species,&lt;ref&gt;Entomology Today, July, 2106, [https://entomologytoday.org/2016/07/12/new-assassin-bug-species-discovered-in-museum-collections-and-in-the-field/ New assassin bug species discovered in museum collections and in the field] ''Entomology Today'' Retrieved 2017-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; and provide an important historical resource.&lt;ref&gt;Entomological Society of America, Jan. 2016, [http://www.entsoc.org/PDF/2016/ESA-PolicyStatement-EntomologicalCollections.pdf ESA position statement on the importance of entomological collections] Retrieved 2017-04-09&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment === 
Once a close observation reveals what issues are present in insect collections, the conservator makes a decision on actions to be taken. It is highly preferable that any treatment applied be reversible or done with little risk to the specimen. For example, broken limbs may be glued back on, which has traditionally been done with white glue. The advantage to white glue being that it is removable in warm water.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Another common problem is pest infestation. When dried insect collections have suffered an infestation, the affected specimens can be frozen or sealed with inert gases to kill the pests without harming the specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, D., Dec. 1995, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN10-Dec1995.pdf Pest control in entomological collections] ''Insect collection news No. 10'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Other treatments might include simply refilling wet specimens' jars with alcohol to ensure the specimens are completely submerged, cleaning specimens of dust and debris, or repositioning specimens for display or research. In the case that a specimen needs to be repositioned, the conservator will "relax" the specimen in a jar with a rehydrating substrate to move the limbs without breaking them. The technique used will vary among conservators. Some use a relaxing jar that the specimen is left in for days with the substrate of choice, others may choose to use a warm water bath with a drop of detergent. Whatever treatments are used are diligently documented.

=== Education ===
Conservation of insect specimens is done in large part to preserve the information for the public. The display of collections in museums and their interpretation offer one avenue that accomplishes this effort. However, websites offer a unique opportunity to disseminate information to a broad audience with layers of information to give general information or to provide depth where desired. These websites are often also provided by museums and their collections. Below is a list of some major educational endeavors with interests in insect specimens.

Oxford: Blackwell. p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Discussed further in this article are particular subcategories of CLI—transfer, attrition, the complementarity principle, and additional theories.

== History ==
The question of how languages influence one another within a bilingual individual can be addressed both with respect to mature bilinguals and with respect to bilingual language acquisition. With respect to bilingual language acquisition in children, there are several hypotheses that examine the internal representation of bilinguals' languages. Volterra and Taeschner proposed the ''Single System Hypothesis,''&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; which states that children start out with one single system that develops into two systems. This hypothesis proposed that bilingual children go through three stages of acquisition.
* In Stage I there is a single lexicon that contains words from both languages, and there is a single syntactic system. Children in this stage will never have a translation equivalent for a word in the other language. Translation equivalents are two corresponding words in two separate languages with the same meaning. Also, it is common for the child to use two different languages in a single utterance. The syntactic rules are hard to define because of the lack of two-word and three-word utterances by the bilingual child.
* In Stage II there are two lexicons, but there is one syntactic system. In addition, there is evidence for language separation because at this stage children become less likely to mix their languages. Across both languages, the same syntactic rules are applied. For example, Japanese has subject-object-verb word order (SOV), and English has subject-verb-object word order (SVO). An English-Japanese bilingual might apply only one of these word orders to all utterances, regardless of what language the utterance is in.
* In Stage III there are two lexicons and two syntactic systems, with adult-like separation of the languages. When a child reaches this stage they are considered fully "bilingual."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volterra|first=Virginia|last2=Taeschner|first2=Traute|year=1978|title=The acquisition and development of language by bilingual children|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Virginia_Volterra/publication/296194110_113_Volterra_V_Taeschner_T_1978_The_acquisition_and_development_of_language_by_bilingual_children_Journal_of_Child_Language_5_pp_311-326_Reprinted_2007_in_In_L_Wei_ed_The_bilingual_reader_301_-_320_Ne/links/56d2f48608ae4d8d64a76693/113-Volterra-V-Taeschner-T-1978-The-acquisition-and-development-of-language-by-bilingual-children-Journal-of-Child-Language-5-pp-311-326-Reprinted-2007-in-In-L-Wei-ed-The-bilingual-reader-301.pdf|journal=Journal of Child Language|volume=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to the ''Single System Hypothesis'', a different hypothesis developed regarding the idea of two separate language systems from the very beginning. It was based on evidence of monolinguals and bilinguals reaching the same milestones at approximately the same stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;Cantone, K. (1999). Das Genus im Italienischen und Deutschen: Empirische Untersuchung zum bilingualen Erstspracherwerb. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Hamburg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Natascha (1990). "Developing two gender assignment systems simultaneously". ''J. Meisel''. Two first languages. Early grammatical development in bilingual children: 194-243.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, bilingual and monolingual children go through identical patterns of grammar development. This hypothesis, called the ''Separate Development Hypothesis'', held the notion that the bilinguals acquiring two languages would internalize and acquire the two languages separately. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from lack of transfer and lack of acceleration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Paradis, Johanne; Genessee, Fred (1996). "Syntactic acquisition in bilingual children: Autonomous or interdependent?". ''Studies in Second Language Acquisition.'' '''18''': 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Transfer is a grammatical property of one language used in another language. Acceleration is the acquisition of a feature in language A facilitating the acquisition of a feature in language B.&lt;ref&gt;Mishina-Mori, Satomi (2005). "Autonomous and interdependent development of two language systems in Japanese/English simultaneous bilinguals: Evidence from question formation". ''First Language''. '''25''': 292-293&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of Dutch-English bilingual children, there were no instances of transfer across elements of morphology and syntactic development, indicating that the two languages developed separately from each other.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;De Houwer, Annick (1990). ''The acquisition of two languages from birth'': ''A case study''. Cambridge: CUP&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in a study of French-English bilingual children, there were no instances of acceleration because [[Finite verb|finiteness]] appeared much earlier in French than it did in English, suggesting that there was no facilitation of the acquisition of finiteness in English by acquisition in French.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under this hypothesis, bilingual acquisition would be equivalent to monolingual children acquiring the particular languages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In response to both the previous hypotheses mentioned, the ''Interdependent Development Hypothesis'' emerged with the idea that there is some sort of interaction between the two language systems in acquisition. It proposed that there is no single language system, but the language systems are not completely separate either.  This hypothesis is also known as the ''Crosslinguistic Hypothesis'', developed by Hulk and Müller. The ''Crosslinguistic Hypothesis'' states that influence will occur in bilingual acquisition in areas of particular difficulty, even for monolingual native language acquisition. It re-examined the extent of the differentiation of the language systems due to the interaction in difficult areas of bilingual acquisition.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hulk, Aafke; Müller, Natascha (2000). "Bilingual first language acquisition at the interface between syntax and pragmatics". ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition''. '''3''': 227-244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Natascha; Hulk, Aafke (2001). "Crosslinguistic influence in bilingual language acquisition: Italian and French as recipient languages". ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition''. '''4''': 1-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this hypothesis comes from delay, acceleration, and transfer in particular areas of bilingual language acquisition. Delay is the acquisition of a property of language A later than normally expected because of the acquisition of language B.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; CLI is seen when the child has a dominant language, such as Cantonese influencing English when Cantonese is the dominant language,&lt;ref&gt;Yip, Virginia; Matthews, Stephen (2006). "Assessing Language Dominance in Bilingual Acquisition: A Case for Mean Length Utterance Differentials". ''Language Assessment Quarterly''. '''3''': 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; and it will only occur in certain domains. Below are the two proposals represented in the ''Crosslinguistic Hypothesis'' where CLI may occur.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Simultaneous Language Acquisition|last=Yip|first=Virginia|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It may occur where there is an interface.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  An interface, for example, could be between syntax and pragmatics of [[Dislocation (syntax)|dislocations]].  Dislocations are a grammatical option in French under certain pragmatic conditions (e.g. ''Je l'aime, ça'' 'I like it, that'), which have been studied in French-English bilinguals positioning of the word ''that''. French-English bilinguals make use of this device when they move ''that'' to a dislocated position of the periphery of the sentence in English. The placement of ''that'' was dislocated in English sentences because of the influence from French on English syntax. For example, French-English bilingual children may produce ''Is a big one this?'' instead of meaning to say ''Is this a big one?''  The children produced significantly more of these dislocations in English than monolingual English children.&lt;ref&gt;Notley, Anna (2005).  ''Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory 2005''. Benjamins. pp. 231-234.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It may occur where is an overlap between two languages with language A allowing only one option and language B allowing two options. One option of language B overlaps with an option in language A.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, French allows adjectives before and after a noun, but English only allows adjectives before the noun.  There is an overlap in the correct placement of adjectives between these two languages, and there will be transfer, especially with postnominal adjectives in French. For example, French-English bilinguals might produce ''un blanc chien'' "a white dog" instead of ''un chien blanc'' "a dog white."&lt;ref&gt;Nicoladis, Elena (2006). "Cross-linguistic transfer in adjective-noun strings by preschool bilingual children". ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition''. '''9''': 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the development of the ''Crosslinguistic Hypothesis'', much research has contributed to the understanding of CLI in areas of structural overlap, directionality, dominance, interfaces, the role of input, and the role of processing and production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Transfer==

In linguistics, [[language transfer]] is defined by behaviorist psychologists as the subconscious use of behaviors from one language in another. In the Applied Linguistics field, it is also known as exhibiting knowledge of a native or dominant language (L1) in one that is being learned (L2).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cross-linguistic Influences in the Second Language Lexicon|last=Arabski|first=Janusz|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2006|isbn=9781853598562|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transfer occurs in various language-related settings, such as acquiring a new language and when two languages or two dialects come into contact. Transfer may depend on how similar the two languages are and the intensity of the conversational setting. Transfer is more likely to happen if the two languages are in the same language family.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It also occurs more at the beginning stages of L2 acquisition, when the grammar and lexicon are less developed. As the speaker's L2 proficiency increases, they will experience less transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=T.|year=2016|title=Dominant Language Transfer in the comprehension of L2 learners and heritage speakers|url=|journal=International Journal of Applied Linguistics|volume=26|pages=190–210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacquelyn Schachter]] (1992) argues that transfer is not a process at all, but that it is improperly named. She described transfer as "an unnecessary carryover from the heyday of behaviorism." In her view, transfer is more of a constraint on the L2 learners' judgments about the constructions of the acquired L2 language. Schachter stated, "It is both a facilitating and a limiting condition on the hypothesis testing process, but it is not in and of itself a process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Acquisition and Language Disorders : Language Transfer in Language Learning : Revised edition.|last=Gass|first=Susan|last2=Selinker|first2=Larry|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9789027224682|location=Amsterdam, NL|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language transfer can be positive or negative. Transfer between similar languages often yields correct production in the new language because the systems of both languages are similar.  This correct production would be considered positive transfer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; An example involves a Spanish speaker (L1) who is acquiring Catalan (L2). Because the languages are so similar, the speaker could rely on their knowledge of Spanish when learning certain Catalan grammatical features and pronunciation. However, the two languages are distinct enough that the speaker’s knowledge of Spanish could potentially interfere with learning Catalan properly.

Negative transfer ([[language transfer|Interference]])&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; occurs when there are little to no similarities between the L1 and L2. It is when errors and avoidance are more likely to occur in the L2. The types of errors that result from this type of transfer are underproduction, overproduction, miscomprehension, and production errors, such as substitution, calques, under/overdifferentiation and hypercorrection.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Transfer – Cross-linguistic Influence in Language Learning.|last=Odlin|first=Terence|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=1989|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underproduction (Avoidance) ===

[[Avoidance speech|Underproduction]] as explained by Schachter (1974),&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Schachter, J. (1974), AN ERROR IN ERROR ANALYSIS1. Language Learning, 24: 205–214. doi:10.1111/j.1467-1770.1974.tb00502.x&lt;/ref&gt; is a strategy used by L2 learners to avoid producing errors when using structures, sounds, or words which they are not confident about in the L2. Avoidance is a complex phenomenon and experts do not agree on its causes or exactly what it is.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title='A second language classic reconsidered--the case of Schachter's avoidance'.  Second Language Research 8: 231-77|last=Kamimoto|first=T.|last2=Shimura|first2=A.|last3=Kellerman|first3=E.|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=231–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition|last=Ellis|first=Rod|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=0194371891|location=Walton Street, Oxford|pages=304–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Hebrew speakers acquiring English, may understand how the passive voice, 'a cake is made', works, but may prefer active voice, 'I make a cake,' thus avoiding the passive construction. Kellerman (1992) distinguishes three types of avoidance: (1) learners of the L2 make anticipations or know there is a problem with their construction and have a vague idea of the target construction, (2) the target is known by the L1 speaker, but it is too difficult to use in given circumstances; such as conversational topics that the L1 speaker may have a deficiency in or (3), the L1 speaker has the knowledge to correctly produce and use the L2 structure but is unwilling to use it because it goes against the norms of their behavior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Overproduction ===

Overproduction refers to an L2 learner producing certain structures within the L2 with a higher frequency than native speakers of that language. In a study by Schachter and Rutherford (1979), they found that Chinese and Japanese speakers who wrote English sentences overproduced certain types of cleft constructions:   
* 'It is very unfortunate that...'   
and sentences that contained ''There are''/''There is'' which suggests an&lt;nowiki/&gt; influence of the topic marking function in their L1 appearing in their L2 English sentences.

=== Production errors ===

Substitution is when the L1 speaker takes a structure or word from their native language and replaces it within the L2.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Odlin (1989) shows a sentence from a Swedish learner of English in the following sentence.
* Swedish Structure on English:
** But sometimes I must go bort.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; 
Here the Swedish word ''bort'' has replaced its English equivalent ''away''.
* Polish learner of English:
** English ''think'' pronounced as [''fink''] because of the influence of the Polish accent on English pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
A [[Calque]] is a direct "loan translation" where words are translated from the L1 literally into the L2.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Cassell's French Dictionary: French-English, English-French|last=|first=|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company|year=1962|isbn=|location=New York|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* English ''skyscraper'' literally translates in French as ''gratte-ciel'' ("scrapes-sky")&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* Polish ''palec'' ''srodkowy'' literally translates to a ''finger'' ''middle'' in English.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* [[Scottish Gaelic]] "a' coimhead air adhart" (literal translation of "looking forwards"), c.f. native expression, "Tha fiughair agam ris" ("I have anticipation of it")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamb|first1=William|title=Scottish Gaelic (2nd Edition)|url=https://www.academia.edu/2488427/Scottish_Gaelic_2nd_Edition_|accessdate=18 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Overdifferentiation occurs when distinctions in the L1 are carried over to the L2.
* An English L1 learner of Polish applies different vowel lengths of English (e.g. /i/ and /i:/) to their Polish due to the use of vowel distinctions in English.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Underdifferentiation occurs when speakers are unable to make distinctions in the L2.
* A Polish learner of English assumes the words ''borrow'' and ''lend'' are equivalent in meaning, since both correspond to ''posyzyc'' in Polish.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* [[Scottish Gaelic]] learners whose first language was English pronounce the phonemes /l̪ˠ/, /l/, and /ʎ/ identically, since English has only one lateral phoneme.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Hypercorrection is a process where the L1 speaker finds forms in the L2 they consider to be important to acquire, but these speakers do not properly understand the restrictions or exceptions to formal rules that are in the L2, which results in errors, such as the example below.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics|last=Bussmann|first=H|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=London:Routledge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish speakers of English may say: potato pronounced as [pota:to] paralleled tomato [toma:to]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Attrition ==
Also related to the idea of languages interfering with one another is the concept of language attrition. [[Language attrition]], simply put, is language loss. Attrition can occur in an L1 or an L2.  According to the ''Interference Hypothesis'' (also known as the ''Crosslinguistic Influence Hypothesis''), language transfer could contribute to language attrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardovi-Harlig|first=Kathleen|last2=Stringer|first2=David|year=2010|title=Variables in Second Language Attrition: Advancing the State of the Art|url=|journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition|volume=32|pages=1–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a speaker moved to a country where their L2 is the dominant language and the speaker ceased regular use of their L1, the speaker could experience attrition in their L1. However, [[Second-language attrition|second language attrition]] could just as easily occur if the speaker moved back to a place where their L1 was the dominant language, and the speaker did not practice their L2 frequently. Attrition could also occur if a child speaker’s L1 is not the dominant language in their society. A child whose L1 is Spanish, but whose socially dominant language is English, could experience attrition of their Spanish simply because they are restricted to using that language in certain domains.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Much research has been done on such speakers, who are called [[Heritage language learning|heritage language learners]]. When discussing CLI, attrition is an important concept to keep in mind because it is a direct result of two or more languages coming into contact and the dominance of one over the other resulting in language loss in a speaker.

==Complementarity principle==
Grosjean (1997) explained the complementarity principle as the function of language use in certain domains of life leading to language dominance within that domain for a given speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Grosjean, F. (1997). The bilingual individual. Interpreting, 2(1/2), 163-187&lt;/ref&gt; This dominance in certain domains of life (e.g. school, home, work, etc.) can lead to apparent Crosslingusitic Influence within a domain. One study found that CLI was occurring within the speech of the studied bilinguals, but the intensity of influence was subject to the domains of speech being used.&lt;ref&gt;Auer, Peter, and Li Wei. Handbook of Multilingualism and Multilingual Communication. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Argyri and Sorace (2007) found, much like many other researchers, that language dominance plays a role in the directionality of CLI.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Argyri, Efrosyni; Sorace, Antonella (2007).Crosslinguistic influence and language dominance in older bilingual children. Bilingualism: Language and Cognition. 10(1), 79-99.&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers found that the English dominant bilinguals had an influence of English on their Greek (concerning preverbal subjects specifically, but also the language in general), but not from their Greek to their English. On the other hand, the Greek dominant bilinguals did not show evidence of Greek influence on their English.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

This supports the notion that bilinguals who do not receive sufficient exposure to both languages acquire a "weaker language" and a "dominant language," and depending on similarities or differences between the languages, effects can be present or absent like that of the Greek-English example above. The effect of CLI can be primarily seen as a unidirectional occurrence, in that the L2 is likely to be affected by the L1, or simply the dominant language is more likely to affect the weaker, than the reverse. This supports the idea of individuals' susceptibility to crosslinguistic influences and the role of dominance. Take for example bilinguals who use different languages for different domains in their life; if a Spanish-English bilingual primarily uses Spanish in the home, but English in school you would expect to see English influences while speaking about school topics in Spanish and similarly you would expect Spanish influences on English when speaking about the home in English because in both instances the language being used is weaker in that domain. This is to say that not only do you see CLI from one language to another, but depending on the domains of use and the degree of proficiency or dominance, CLI can be a significant influence on speech production.

==Additional theories==
Some researchers believe that CLI may be a result of "contact-modified input," or linguistic input modified or affected by some other source such as another language.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Hauser-Grüdl, N., Guerra, L. A., Witzmann, F., Leray, E., &amp; Müller, N. (2010). Cross-linguistic influence in bilingual children: Can input frequency account for it? Lingua, 120(11), 2638-2650. doi:10.1016/j.lingua.2010.06.008&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say that the environment surrounding the learning of another language can influence what is actually being learned. Take for example the fact that most L2 learners are receiving input or teachings from similarly speaking bilinguals; Hauser-Grüdl, Guerra, Witzmann, Leray, and Müller (2010) believe that the language being taught has already been influenced by the other in the teachers' minds and, therefore, the input the learner is receiving will exhibit influence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These L2 learners will replicate influences because their input of the L2 is not as pure as input from a monolingual; meaning, what appears as CLI in the individual isn't really CLI of their L1 on their L2, but the effects of acquiring input that has already been modified. This theory has led some people to believe that all input for L2 learning will be affected and resemble CLI; however, this is not a well-supported theory of CLI or its function in L2 acquisition.

Other researchers believe that CLI is more than production influences, claiming that this linguistic exchange can impact other factors of a learner’s identity. Jarvis and Pavlenko (2008) described such affected areas as experiences, knowledge, cognition, development, attention and language use, to name a few, as being major centers for change because of CLI.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Jarvis, S., &amp; Pavlenko, A. (2008). Crosslinguistic influence in language and cognition. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas suggest that crosslinguistic influence of syntactic, morphological, or phonological changes may just be the surface of one language’s influence on the other, and CLI is instead a different developmental use of one’s brain.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Future research==
CLI has been heavily studied by scholars, but there is still much more research needed because of the multitude of components that make up the phenomenon. Firstly, the [[Linguistic typology|typology]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;of particular language pairings needs to be researched to differentiate CLI from the general effects bilingualism and bilingual acquisition.

Also, research is needed in specific areas of overlap between particular language pairings and the domains that influence and discourage CLI.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For example, most of the research studies involve European language combinations, and there is a significant lack of information regarding language combinations involving non-European languages, indigenous languages, and other minority languages.

More generally, an area of research to be further developed are the effects of CLI in [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] acquisition of three or more languages.  There is limited research on this occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the genesis and development of L3 research, multilingualism and multiple language acquisition|last=Aronin|first=Larissa|last2=Hufeisen|first2=Britta|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahbar is regarded as accomplished essayist, poet,&lt;ref&gt;Husain, Intizar. "Point of View: Dawood Rahbar as a poet" in ''Dawn Magazine''. December 2001&lt;/ref&gt; composer, short story writer, translator, philosopher, contributor to inter-civilization dialogue, musicologist, drummer, singer and guitarist.&lt;ref name="books_amazon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-author=Daud%20Rahbar&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3ADaud%20Rahbar | title=Books by Daud Rahbar | accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He translated his own Urdu works to English, such as ''The Cup of Jamshid: A Collection of Ghazal Poetry'' and then translated the ''[[Letters of Ghalib|Urdu letters of Mirzā Asadu'lldh Khān Ghālib]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Khaled. "Tracking Down Daud Rahbar," in ''The Friday Times'' vol 12, no. 18, 30 June – 6 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

After a teaching career in England, Canada, [[Turkey]] and the United States, he retired as Professor Emeritus of [[Comparative religions]] from [[Boston University]] in 1991.

== Early life ==
Daud Rahbar grew up in [[Model Town, Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] between 1929 and 1949. The town was the first cooperative society in the Indian subcontinent, a suburb based on the design of a Hindu architect, Divan Khem Chand. The town was autonomous from Lahore City's jurisdiction, and sectioned into blocks. Each block was populated by either [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]] or [[Hindus]] (where the Hindus constitute the largest community). He remarked that his close association with Hindus "made the love of Hindu communities a natural condition of [his] soul."{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=87}} His childhood was spent writing poetry (he took the pen name 'Rahbar' at the age of eight), gardening and walking with his father while discussing [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] and [[Persian literature]]. He was an excellent tennis player.

== Family ==
Rahbar's father, Dr. Muhammad Iqbal (1894–1948), was named after [[Sir Muhammad Iqbal]].&lt;ref name="other_iqbal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jul2011-weekly/nos-31-07-2011/lit.htm#3 |title=The other Iqbal |publisher=The News International |author=Mohyeddin, Zia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620235743/http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jul2011-weekly/nos-31-07-2011/lit.htm#3 |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with an [[Master of Arts|M.A]] in [[Arabic]] and was the recipient of a State scholarship from the [[University of Cambridge]]. He studied under Arabist professors [[Edward G. Browne]], [[Reynold A. Nicholson|R.A. Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Ashley Bevan]]. After receiving his PhD, Iqbal was appointed Professor of [[Persian language]] at the [[University of the Punjab]] in 1922 and remained for 26 years. He was later appointed President of [[Oriental College, Lahore]].

Rahbar had five siblings. Rahbar married Sabiha Ahmed on 9 April 1950. The couple had two daughters, Sameera and Anisa. Sabiha's father Aga Ghiassudin Ahmed, was a lawyer and botanist and President of Agricultural College in [[Faisalabad|Lyallpur]] (now [[University of Agriculture, Faisalabad]]). Sabiha was a poet as well, although she never received recognition.

His first cousin, [[Zia Mohyeddin]],&lt;ref name="other_iqbal" /&gt; is a well-known media personality and artist from [[Pakistan]], who played the lead role in ''[[Passage to India]] on Broadway'' and in several British television specials and movies.

== Education ==
Rahbar graduated from the [[Government College, Lahore]] with an M.A in Arabic in 1947. He received the McLeod Research Scholarship and was hired on to teach [[Arabic literature]] at [[Oriental College, Lahore]], where his father was President. In 1949, Rahbar went to [[Cambridge University]] and completed his PhD dissertation entitled ''Studies in the Ethical Doctrine of the Qur'an'' under the supervision of [[Reuben Levy]]. After a short time in [[Lahore]], Rahbar accepted the position of Senior Teaching Fellow at [[McGill University]], Canada, in 1954, at the invitation of [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]]. In 1956 he was appointed to the chair of Urdu and [[Pakistan studies]] at [[Ankara University]], Turkey, where he stayed until 1959. In 1959, he began lecturing in [[Islamic studies]] as well as enrolling in [[Christian theology]] seminars at the [[Hartford Seminary Foundation]], Connecticut, USA.

In 1962, he was appointed Visiting Professor of Urdu and Pakistan studies at [[Hartford Seminary Foundation]] and was awarded tenure from 1962 to 1966. In 1964, he took a two-year leave to teach at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], where he began a systematic study of Indian and Western classical music, concentrating on achieving mastery of Indian classical vocal genres. In that same period, he began writing English poetry with the encouragement of [[David McCord]] and [[Louis Untermeyer]].

In 1967, Rahbar joined the faculty of [[Boston University]] where he taught until his retirement in 1991: initially at the School of Theology and from 1975 onwards at the Department of Religion in the College of Liberal Arts, where he was one of the department's most popular teachers, his courses on eastern religions enrolling hundreds of students each semester.

== Lahore International Islamic Colloquium ==
On 2 January 1958, he presented a paper to the International Islamic Colloquium in Lahore,&lt;ref name="colloquium_lhr"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1958.tb02570.x/abstract | title=The International Islamic Colloquium | author=Dodge, Bayard | journal=The Muslim World | year=1958 | doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1958.tb02570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second of its kind that brought scholars of Islamic subjects together from across the world. Rahbar's paper, entitled ''The Challenge of Muslim Ideas and Social Values to Muslim Society'' produced criticism from conference attendees, to the point that he was not allowed to return to the platform to explain his points. Rahbar maintains that it was "an innocent and mild statement" that he did not perceive to be "radically unorthodox."{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=303}} The opposing members of the conference asked the paper to be withdrawn later that day, but eventually agreed that an amended edition should be written. In the October 1958 issue of ''The Muslim World'',&lt;ref name="colloquium_lhr" /&gt; the paper was published with an introductory note outlining the objections of the council and the amendments made thereafter. In his introductory note, Rahbar explained that much of the controversy was due to the inherent brevity of the statements. Therefore, he hoped that the expanded treatment would clarify those objections raised at the colloquium.

== Contributor to inter-civilizational and interfaith dialogue ==
Rahbar was raised as Muslim but converted to Christianity as a professor at [[Ankara University]]. He records in his memoir that he was baptised as a Christian by a Protestant United States Air Force Chaplain, Meredith Smith, in Ankara, on 6 July 1959.{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=385}} Rahbar noted that his conversion was not a result of the 1958 Colloquium, but was more closely related to the memories of [[Partition of India]] and the then environment in Turkey. He stated that the "categorical mercy" of the [[New Testament]] and the "Christian world seemed to...offer a spiritual home"{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=343}} from his growing pessimism. A couple of months later, Rahbar wrote ''A letter to Christian and Muslim Friends'' as a confession of faith.

This confession, however, was not fully accepted by some Muslim intellectuals. [[Khaled Ahmed (journalist)|Khaled Ahmed]], a Pakistani political and cultural analyst, stated that Rahbar's supposed conversion to Christianity was nothing more than a "myth created in Lahore"&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Khaled. "Tracking Down Daud Rahbar," in ''The Friday Times'' vol 12, no. 18, 30 June – 6 July 2000. Khaled Ahmed has republished this article in his book ''Pakistan: Behind the Ideological Mask (Facts about Great Men we don't want to know)'', p. 176-186. Lahore: Vanguard, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; by those who did not fully understand "what he really stood for."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ahmed, Khaled. 30 June – 6 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained  that Rahbar's "entire career has been a defence of Islam"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and that "anyone who has read his ''Kalchar Kay Ruhani Anasir'' (Spiritual Elements of Culture)"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; will no longer need to question his faith, but rather realise that "he is tolerant of all faiths because he known the essence of them all."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His continued respect and appreciation for the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and [[Islam]] is demonstrated in his published writings.&lt;ref&gt;Rahbar, Daud. "Muhammad and All Men." In {{cite book|author=John Robert Nelson|title=No man is alien: Essays on the Unity of Mankind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdEUAAAAIAAJ|pp=64–84|year=1971|publisher=Brill Archive|id=GGKEY:P577BDY9T76 |location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the published version of his dissertation, ''God of Justice: A Study in the Ethical Doctrine of the Qur'an'' published by E. J. Brill in 1960, Rahbar advanced the position that God's mercy is always subordinate to justice, so mercy is only available to believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God, Muhammad and the unbelievers: a Qur'anic study |last=Marshall |first=David |pages=79–85 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-7007-1086-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to poetry and classical music theory &amp; composition ==
Throughout his academic career, Rahbar continued to make significant contributions to [[Urdu literature]] and music. He performed in concerts and poetry readings both in the United States and Pakistan. His love was for classical South Asian music, particularly the Agra School. His flair for poetic expression is infused throughout his autobiography, ''Memories and Meanings.'' "Music has been my solace for the last forty years," he wrote. "Without it I perhaps could not have been a friend to myself and to others. Music and poetry have made life easier for me everywhere and at every stage of my adult life.".{{sfn|Rahbar|1985|p=454}} His published works in the field of [[Urdu literature]] include:

* ''Salaam o Payaam.'' Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 1996 – Letters to his friends and associates. Subsequent volumes were published in 2004 and 2009.
* ''Kalcar ke Ruhani Anasir.'' Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 1998 – Culture and Religion.
* ''Pragandah Taba' Log.'' Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2000 – Short stories.

== Death ==
Daud Rahbar died at a nursing home in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]] on 5 October 2013.&lt;ref name="ppf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pakistanpressfoundation.org/obituaries/73245/scholar-writer-daud-rahbar-passes-away-in-us/ | title=Scholar, writer Daud Rahbar passes away in US | publisher=Pakistan Press Foundation | accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3366">'''Dead baby jokes''' are a [[joke#Joke_cycles|joke cycle]] reflecting [[black comedy]]. The joke is presented in [[riddle]] form, beginning with a what question and concluded with a grotesque [[punch line]] answer.&lt;ref name="dundes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Dead Baby Joke Cycle|author=Alan Dundes|journal=Western Folklore|volume=38|issue=3|date=July 1979|pages=145&amp;ndash;157|doi=10.2307/1499238|jstor=1499238|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to the folklorist scholar [[Alan Dundes]], the dead baby joke cycle likely began in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="dundes"/&gt; Dundes theorizes that the origin of the dead baby joke lies in the rise of [[second-wave feminism]] in the U.S. during that decade and its rejection of the traditional societal role for women, which included support for legalized [[abortion]] and [[Birth control|contraceptives]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Jokes are a serious, 'psychic' business |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19880901&amp;id=cRYpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DYQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7115,359359 |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 December 1987 |title=That's Not Funny - That's Sick // Folklorist Alan Dundes looks at the serious side of sick jokes |url= |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the jokes emerged in response to images of graphic violence, often involving infants, from the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="bronner"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHfVZFl4JTIC | title=American Children's Folklore | publisher=august house | author=Bronner, Simon J. | year=1988 | pages=127 | isbn=9780874830682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twenty-first century, the popularity of the joke cycle has led to the creation of a number of websites dedicated to dead baby jokes.&lt;ref name="warner"/&gt;

The '''Department of [[African American Studies]]''' (AAS) at Syracuse University is an academic department supporting [[Africana studies]]. It is located at [[Syracuse University]] in [[Syracuse, New York]]. It is a  prominent independent department at Syracuse University that has had a long history of activism and scholarship in Black and Pan African Studies. The Department supports an external community based unit that is a part of the department and has played a central role in shaping culture and arts in the [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] city community - Community Folk Art Center (CFAC). It has also supported the Paul Robeson Performing Arts Company (PRPAC) in the past. These are both independent units that were housed or founded by the department&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mugo, Micere, "Message from the Chair", ''Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter'', 2007-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The department also houses the award-winning library, the [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Memorial Library. It currently oversees the internationally recognized university wide initiative "Africa Initiative". Its other projects include the nationally recognized "[[Janis Mayes|Paris Noir]]" and the [[Ford Foundation]] Environmental Justice and Gender Project.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  It has had a long history of activism within the university, surrounding community, and abroad through its strong international network. The AAS department has housed many renowned scholars in [[Africa]]n, [[Afro-Caribbean]], [[African-American]], [[Afro-Latin American]], and [[Afro-European]] studies.

==History==
The AAS department was created in the spirit of revolutionary thinking.&lt;ref&gt;''Pan African Studies Newsletter'', "history", Department of African American studies, Syracuse University, 2004, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Syracuse students were among the first in the United States to rebel against institutionalized injustices in education in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Davis, Barbara Sheklin, ''Syracuse African Americans''. Arcadia Publishing. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Ernie Davis]] became the first Black football player to win the [[Heisman trophy]] in 1961, it was a major landmark for progress for African Americans in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbhe.com/features/53_blackhistory_timeline.html "JBHE Chronology of Major Landmarks in the Progress of African Americans in Higher Education"], ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Syracuse alumnus [[Joe Biden]] noted in a tribute speech in 2011, that [[Ernie Davis]] "gave a whole group of people hope".&lt;ref&gt;Wes Cheng, [http://sujuiceonline.com/2011/12/10/ernie-davis-heisman-floyd-little-joe-biden-syracuse-football/ "Friends, Teammates Honor Anniversary of Ernie Davis Winning Heisman"]. ''The Juice'', December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, racial discord in the football program began to be highlighted, which resulted in an increase in racial tension.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This tension began in 1969 when a group known as the "[[Syracuse 8]]" highlighted the discrimination they faced in football by coach Floyd "Ben" Schwartzwalder. By the opening pre-game of the season, tensions were so high that they resulted in a confrontation between nearly 100 policemen and at least 400 students at the football stadium at Syracuse University.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/syracuse-8-commitment-change "The 'Syracuse 8,' A Commitment For Change"], African American Registry, April 9, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to increasing racial tension and in response to the civil rights movement, in 1968, Black students at Syracuse University staged a protest outside of [[S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]], demanding that the university offer Black Studies classes that highlighted and included the intellectual, historical and cultural contributions of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Karla, "A Look Back through Our struggles", ''Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter'', Special -Edition, 2004/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The administration at Syracuse University subsequently began to make concessions by offering Black Studies classes as an elective.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas.syr.edu/about/history.html |title=History |publisher=Aas.syr.edu |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Greene, Syracuse University: [https://books.google.com/books?id=kd2MsADwS14C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=syracuse+university+Black+Studies&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mc6wTqWVMLH02wXv6I2tAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=syracuse%20university%20Black%20Studies&amp;f=false Eggers Years], 1998, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; African American Studies (AAS) began as a program in 1972 and then became a department as part of the [[Syracuse University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis, Deborah R 2004"&gt;Davis, Deborah R. ''Black Students' Perceptions: the complexity of persistence to graduation at an American University'', NY: Peter Lang Publishing, 2004, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s student protests also resulted in an Afro-American Cultural center and marked the beginning of the MLK library collection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The first conference on Critical Issues in Afro-American and African Studies was held at Syracuse University in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yale Journal of Law and Liberation'', Vol. 1, p. 92, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, Syracuse students again advocated the administration to widen the pool of African American faculty applicants, hire a department chairperson and in order to increase the staff in the AAS department.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, "Black Students' Perceptions" (2004, 2007), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The department has stayed without a chair and other key positions for more than a year. Members of the Syracuse African-American Students Association (SAS) were at the forefront of this movement.&lt;ref name="Davis, Deborah R 2004, p16"&gt;Davis, ''Black Students' Perceptions'' (2004, 2007), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, 120 SAS member students confronted Chancellor [[Melvin A. Eggers|Melvin Eggers]] at a round table meeting in order to air their grievances. The group's efforts led to a 400-student protest in 1990 led by SAS President Quentin Stith. The students also advocated for a program that allowed all students (not just those of African-American descent) to learn about the contribution of African Americans in American history.&lt;ref name="Davis, Deborah R 2004"/&gt; The students were concerned with preserving Black identity and saw their dedication towards African studies as a collective struggle.&lt;ref name="Davis, Deborah R 2004, p16"/&gt; Throughout the 1980s, students continued to play an active role on the university campus.

It has now grown into a national and international renowned program that explores linkages between [[Africa]] and the [[African Diaspora]].  It continues to pioneer revolutionary thinking in its projects, programs, and academics.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Academics==
AAS offers students opportunities for academic study, research, community involvement and study abroad.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;"Syracuse University's Department of African American Studies Receives Major For Grant for 'Gender, Environmental Justice' Project", US Fed News Service, Including US State News. Washington, D.C.: April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The department's interdisciplinary curriculum enables students to engage, analyze and create knowledge involving African Americans, and make linkages with areas of Latin America, the Caribbean and continental Africa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Gender and Environmental Justice Focus===
The Department received a Ford Foundation grant in order to support the development of gender and [[environmental justice]] in Africana studies nationally.&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"&gt;Carty, Linda, "AAS Gets Ford Foundation Grant", ''Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter'', 2007-2008, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The project is entitled "Gender and Environmental Justice," and makes AAS the only department of its kind in the nation to recognize the importance of environmental justice in its curriculum.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The Ford Foundation also awarded support towards a postdoctoral program focusing on civic engagement in the arts, public humanities, architecture and the media.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The Ford Foundation grant facilitated a Black feminist lecture series "Black Feminism and Environmental Justice" lecture series, research grants, Community Mapping and Photovoice Research project, and symposiums for Black women and other minorities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Undergraduate Studies - African American Studies===
The department offers a major and minor in African American studies that is interdisciplinary and focuses on international studies.&lt;ref&gt;Simson, Renate, &amp; Holly K. Norton, "Conversations with the Director of Undergraduate Studies", ''Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter'', 2007-2008, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The undergraduate studies program focuses on community involvement and on building an international experience for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas.syr.edu/ |title=African American Studies |publisher=Aas.syr.edu |date=2011-01-30 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has pioneered groundbreaking study abroad programs like "Paris Noir", "Beyond the Beach:The Caribbean as a Place, Not just Playground", and a study abroad programs centered on Black [[Austria]] ([[University of Graz]]) and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diverseeducation.com/cache/print.php?articleId=2842 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611030134/http://diverseeducation.com/cache/print.php?articleId=2842 |archivedate=2012-06-11 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Monique, [http://search.proquest.com/docview/217146569 "Paris Noir: A Syracuse University Study Abroad Experience in Paris"], Contempora2 (October 31, 2001): 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduate Studies - Pan African Studies===
The Masters in [[Africana studies|Pan African Studies]] Program began as a unique program in Black Studies in the United States in both its design and delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Carty, Linda, ''Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter'', Special Edition, 2004/2005, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It began in 2005 as a uniquely innovative program that has an emphasis in the area studies of Africa, the Caribbean and the United States. Whereas most programs concentrate on history and biographies, it focuses on the linkages between Africa and the African Diaspora from a multi-disciplinary approach involving cultural, social scientific, political, economic and environmental perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas.syr.edu/about/index.html |title=Mission Statement |publisher=Aas.syr.edu |date= |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also provides for intellectual inquiry into philosophy of [[Pan Africanism]] and Pan Africanism as a historical, cultural, and contemporary movement. It is the only masters program in Pan African studies that focuses on field research and theory.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, David, "Crossing Borders", ''Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter'', Special Edition, 2004/2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Program has an experiential component through affiliations that the department has with institutions abroad that leads to all students studying in Africa, the Caribbean, Canada, or African American sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas.syr.edu/graduate/index.html |title=The Master's Degree in Pan African Studies |publisher=Aas.syr.edu |date= |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa Initiative==
The AAS department views Africa as an integral part of its scholarly vision and mission. The Africa Initiative (AI) is located in the department of African American studies and was launched in 2001 with a goal of focusing on Africa. AI aims at spearheading revitalized interest in Africa, which has declined in many United States institutions of higher learning since the end of the "[[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africainitiative.syr.edu/ |title=Africa Initiative |publisher=Africainitiative.syr.edu |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to also address Africa's silencing, marginalization and stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;Makuja, Darius Rev., "The Africa Initiative Statement", ''Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter'', Special Edition, 2004/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It also aims to revitalize interest in Africa as an area of study after the decline of the East African Studies Program at Syracuse University which initiated projects including the [[Eduardo Mondlane]] Lecture Series. The East African program had also been instrumental in spearheading an east African library collection at Syracuse's Bird Library that includes the Kenyan and Tanzanian national archives (one of the few collections of these archives in the United States).

===Eduardo Mondlane Brown Bag Lecture Series===
AI administers the "[[Eduardo Mondlane]] Memorial Lecture Series".  The lecture series was named after the founder of Front for the Liberation of Mozambique ([[FRELIMO]]), [[Eduardo Mondlane]], who was also a former professor at Syracuse University. In recent years, it has become more important in keeping a focus on topical issue on Africa in academia.  The lecture series was originally administered by the East African Studies Program at Syracuse University that is now dissolved&lt;ref name="historyisaweapon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/cabralnlac.html |title=Amilcar Cabral National Liberation and Culture |publisher=Historyisaweapon.com |date= |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, this interactive series has brought scholars, students, and the community together to discuss pertinent issues concerning Africa to the university. It is during one of these lecture series on February 20, 1970, that [[Guinea-Bissau]] nationalist [[Amílcar Cabral]] delivered his famous speech "National Liberation and Culture" at Syracuse University.&lt;ref name="historyisaweapon1"/&gt;  Other notable speakers in the series have included UN Ambassador to Rwanda [[Stanilas Kamanzi]](2003), Ethiopian Ambassador [[Kasshun Ayele]], and writer [[Veronique Tadjo]], Dr. Efemini Andrew, and [[Jerome Verdier]], the chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in [[Liberia]].

===Symposia and conferences===
AI periodically hosts major symposia and conferences.  In the past, this included the WEB Du Bois and The Crisis Magazine Symposia and International Human Rights Celebration.

==Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library==
The MLK library was founded by the Syracuse student organization SAAS (Student African American Society) in 1968. It is currently one of the few university libraries in the country that has an entire library with a dedicated African-American collection&lt;ref&gt;Baker, David  'Multicultural Resources', ''Pan African Studies at Syracuse University Newsletter'', Special Edition, 2004/2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Miriam A.

[[File:Gesar Gruschke.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mural depicting Gesar]]

The '''Epic of King Gesar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɛ|z|ər|,_|ˈ|ɡ|ɛ|s|-}}; {{bo|t=གེ་སར་རྒྱལ་པོ་|w=ge sar rgyal po}}, "King Gesar"; {{lang-mn|Гэсэр Хаан}}, {{lang|mn-latn|Geser [[Khagan]]}}, "King Geser", {{lang-ru|Гесар-хан}} or Кесар), also spelled '''Geser''' (especially in Mongolian contexts) or '''Kesar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|z|ər|,_|ˈ|k|ɛ|s|-}}), is an epic cycle, believed to date from the 12th century, that relates the heroic deeds of the [[culture hero]] Gesar,{{sfn|Samuel|1993|pp=68–9}} the fearless lord of the legendary kingdom of Ling ({{bo|w=gling}}). It is recorded variously in poetry and prose, [[Aucassin and Nicolette|chantefable]] or [[shuochang]] being the style of traditional performance,{{sfn|Samuel|2005|p=166}} and is sung widely throughout [[Central Asia]] and North East of [[South  Asia]]. Its classic version is to be found in central Tibet.{{sfn|Chadwick|Chadwick|1968|pp=48–9,215–6}} Some 100 [[bard]]s of this epic ({{bo|w=sgrung}}, "tale"){{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=372}} are still active today in the Gesar belt of China.{{sfn|Jiàngbiān Jiācuò|1998|p=222}} [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]], [[Mongols|Mongolian]], [[Buryats|Buryat]], [[Balti people|Balti]], [[Ladakh]]i and [[Monguor people|Monguor]] singers maintain the oral tradition and the epic has attracted intense scholarly curiosity as one of the few oral epic traditions to survive as a performing art.  Besides stories conserved by such [[Chinese minorities]] as the [[Bai people|Bai]], [[Nakhi people|Naxi]], the [[Pumi people|Pumi]], [[Lisu people|Lisu]] and [[Yugur]],{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=373}} versions of the epic are also recorded among the [[Balti people|Balti]] of [[Baltistan]], the [[Burusho people]] of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Gilgit]],{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=373}} and the [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] and [[Ladakh]]i peoples,{{sfn|Penick|2009|p=vii}}{{sfn|Herrmann|1990|p=485}} in [[Sikkim]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], and among various [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burmese]], Turkish, and [[Tungusic peoples|Tunghus]] tribes.{{sfn|Harvilahti|1996|p=40}} The first printed version was a Mongolian text published in Beijing in 1716.{{sfn|Harvilahti|1996|p=43}}

The epic is composed of a very large body of versions, each with many variants, and is reputed by some to be the longest in the world.{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=372}} Although there is no one definitive text, the Chinese compilation so far of just its Tibetan versions has filled some 120 volumes, more than one million verses,{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=372}} divided into 29 "chapters".{{sfn|Harvilahti|1996|p=42}} Western calculations speak of more than 50 different books edited so far in China, India and Tibet.{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=372}}

A Tibetan scholar has written:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like the outstanding Greek epics, Indian epics and [[Kalevala]], King Gesar is a brilliant pearl in the world's cultural treasure and is an important contribution made by our country to human civilization.{{sfn|'Jam-dpal rgyal-mtsho|1990|p=472}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology of the name==
It has been proposed on the basis of phonetic similarities that the name ''Gesar'' reflects the Roman title ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],'' and that the intermediary for the transmission of this imperial title from Rome to Tibet may have been a Turkic language, since ''kaiser'' (emperor) entered Turkish through contact with the [[Byzantine Empire]], where Caesar (''Καῖσαρ'') was an imperial title. Some think the medium for this transmission may have been via Mongolian ''Kesar''. The Mongols were [[Byzantine–Mongol alliance|allied with the Byzantines]], whose emperor still used the title.{{sfn|Kornman|2005|pp=360,367}} Numismatic evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vohra|1996|p=217}} writes that these coins with the title ''Fromo Kesaro'' appear to refer to the successor of Sahi Tegin (700-738 CE:Chinese:烏散特勤灑: [[Middle Chinese|MC]]:''uo-sân d'ɘk-g'iɘn ṣai''=*Horsān tegin šāhi 'Tegin, king of Khurasan'), ruler of the Second Turki Śāhi dynasty at [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa-Udyana]], whose reign was between 738 and 745 C.E., and who is identified with the 'Frōm Kēsar' (拂菻罽婆: ''Fúlǐn jìpó'': [[Middle Chinese|North Western Tang]] ''pfvyr-lḭum-kḭe-sâ'') of the [[Old Book of Tang|Tang shu]]. See{{harvnb|Harmatta|Litvinsky|1999|pp=376,380}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and some accounts speak of a [[Bactria]]n ruler ''Phrom-kesar'',{{sfn|Samuel|2005|p=177}} specifically the [[Kabul Shahi]] of [[Gandhara]], which was ruled by a Turkish ''From Kesar'' ("Caesar of Rome"),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2011|p=127}}:"He received this laudatory epithet because he, like the Byzantines, was successful at holding back the Muslim conquerors."&lt;/ref&gt; who was father-in-law of the king of the [[Kingdom of Khotan]] around the middle of the 8th century CE.{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=374}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vohra|1996|pp=216–17}} writes that Gesar is mentioned in a [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] text, the Tibetan ''Li-yul-lung-bstan-pa'', ("Prophecy of the Li Country") of the 9th-10th century, and ''Phrom'' long identified with a country northeast of [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]]. Recent opinion identifies the land either with the Turkish Küūsen or the [[Kushan]] territories of Gandhāra and Udayana. Gesar may be either someone of Turkish stock or a non-Tibetan dynastic name. The Khotan king Vijaya Sangrama's consort Hu-rod-ga (Hu-rong-ga) was Phrom Gesar's daughter. The ''Padma-thang-yig'' records a Tibetan army subduing Gesar, something also mentioned in the ''Rygal-po'i-bka'i-than-yig'' ("Pronouncements concerning Kings").&lt;/ref&gt; In early [[Bon]] sources, ''From Kesar'' is always a place name, and never refers, as it does later, to a ruler.{{sfn|Martin|2011|p=127}} In some Tibetan versions of the epic, a king named  ''Phrom'' Ge-sar or ''Khrom'' Ge-sar figures as one of the [[Four Heavenly Kings|kings of the four directions]] – the name is attested in the 10th century{{sfn|Samuel|2005|pp=170,177}} and this ''Phrom''/''Khrom'' preserves an Iranian form (*''frōm-hrōm'') for ''Rūm''/''Rome''.  This eastern Iranian word lies behind the [[Middle Chinese]] word for [[Byzantine Empire|(Eastern) Rome]] (拂菻:''Fúlǐn''), namely [[Byzantium]] (''phrōm-from&lt;*phywət-lyəm&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beyer|1992|pp=139–40}}: 'There is an enormous amount of history in the simple fact that the epic hero of Tibet bears a name derived from that of Caesar of Rome.'&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Needham|1988|p=186 note g}}

[[August Hermann Francke (Tibetologist)|A. H. Francke]] thought the Tibetan name Gesar derived from [[Sanskrit]]. [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji|S.K. Chatterji]], introducing his work, noted that the Ladakh variant of Kesar, ''Kyesar'', in [[Classical Tibetan]] ''Skye-gsar'' meant 'reborn/newly born', and that ''Gesar/Kesar'' in Tibetan, as in Sanskrit signify the '[[Stamen|anther]] or [[pistil]] of a flower', corresponding to Sanskrit ''kēsara,'' whose root 'kēsa' (hair) is [[Indo-european languages|Indo-European]].{{sfn|Francke|2010|p=xxii}}

==Gesar and the Kingdom of Ling==
In Tibet, that Gesar was an historical figure is rarely questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Samuel|p=365}}; {{harvnb|Lǐ Liánróng|2001|p=334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars there argued he was born in 1027, on the basis of a note in a 19th-century chronicle, the ''Mdo smad chos 'byung'' by Brag dgon pa dkon mchog bstan pa rab.{{sfn|Lǐ Liánróng|2001|p=328}} Certain core episodes seem to reflect events recorded at the dawn of Tibetan history: the marriage to a Chinese princess is reminiscent of legends concerning [[Songtsän Gampo]]'s alliance marriage with [[Princess Wencheng]] in 641, for example.{{sfn|Samuel|2005|p=175}} Legends variously place  him in [[Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Golok]],&lt;ref&gt;A [[Xinhua News Agency]] report in 2002 registers that Han and Sino-Tibetan scholars had confidently pinned down the mythical Gesar's roots in Axu town in the [[prairie]] of [[Dege County]] located in the [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] of southwest [[Sichuan Province]]. In this interpretation, Gesar's 'soul mountain' would be the [[Amne Machin|famous snow peak of Golog]] in modern [[Qinghai Province]]. [[Xinhua News Agency]] [http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/36509.htm 'Birthplace of Tibetan Hero Gesser Confirmed], 8 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; between Dotō and Domé,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shakabpa|2010|pp=192–95}}, discusses the great confusion in Tibetan sources over Gesar, identified as a magical lord named Lingjé Gesar Kyechok Norbu Dradül and his putative birthplace, but placing his year of birth in 1053 or 1060(=1081). See note 1 p.194.&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[Markam County|Markham]], [[Kongpo]], Tanak, Öyuk or the village of Panam on the [[Nyang River]].{{sfn|Shakabpa|2010|p=193}} Given that the mythological and allegorical elements of the story defy place and time, the historicity of figures in the cycle is indeterminate. Though the epic was sung all over Tibetan-speaking regions, with [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] long regarded as the centres for its diffusion,&lt;ref&gt;Maconi, ibid. p.472.&lt;/ref&gt; traditions do connect Gesar with the former Kingdom of Ling ({{bo|w=gling}}).  In Tibetan, ''gling'' means "island" but can have, as with the Sanskrit word [[Dvipa|dvīpa]], the secondary meaning of "continent".{{sfn|Zahler|Hopkins|1997|p=39}} Ling was a petty kingdom located in Kham between the [[Yangtze]] and [[Yalong River]]. An historical kingdom of [[Kingdom of Lingtsang|Lingtsang]] ({{bo|w=gling tshang}}) existed until the 20th century.

==Growth of the Epic==
The success of the Turk ''Fromo Kesaro'', whose name is a Persian pronunciation of "Rome (Byzantium) Caesar", in overwhelming an intrusive Arab army in [[Gandhara]] sometime between 739-745, may have formed the historic core behind the Gesar epic in Tibet.{{sfn|Harmatta|Litvinsky|1999|p=382}} In the records of the earliest rulers of Ladakh, Baltistan and Gilgit, whose countries were later overrun by incursive Tibetans, royal ancestry is connected to the Bactrian Gesar.{{sfn|Vohra|1996|pp=218–219}}

In its distinctive Tibetan form, the epic appears to date from the time of the second transmission of Buddhism to Tibet marked by the formation of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] or "new schools" of Tibetan Buddhism, although the story includes early elements taken from [[History of India|Indian]] [[Vajrayana|tantricism]]. The [[oral tradition]] of this epic is most prominent in the two remote areas associated with the pre-Buddhist [[ethnic religion]] known as Bon ([[Ladakh]] and [[Zanskar]] in the far west of Tibet and [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] in the east), strongly suggesting that the story has native roots. However, the oral versions known to us today are not, according to R. A. Stein, earlier than the written versions, but rather depend on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herrmann|1990|p=499}}: 'die mündlichen Versionen, die wir heute kennen, sind nicht ursprünglicher, sondern hängen sicher von den geschriebenen Fassungen ab.'&lt;/ref&gt;

As an oral tradition, a large number of variants have always existed, and no canonical text can be written. However, the epic narrative was certainly in something similar to its present form by the 15th century at the latest as shown by the mentions in the ''rLangs-kyi Po-ti bSe-ru'' by ''Byang chub rgyal mtshan.'' Despite the age of the tradition, the oldest extant text of the epic is actually the Mongolian woodblock print commissioned by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] of [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] in 1716. None of the Tibetan texts that have come down to us are earlier than the 18th century, although they are likely based on older texts that have not survived. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries a [[woodblock printing]] of the story was compiled by a scholar-monk from Ling-tsang, a small kingdom northeast of [[Derge]], with inspiration from the prolific Tibetan philosopher [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]].

The wide variety of cultures in which the Gesar epic is encountered means that the name for the hero varies. In Tibetan legends Gesar is variously called ''Gesar of Ling'', ''Ling Gesar'', ''Gesar Norbu Dradul''. Among the Buryat he is known as ''Abai Geser Khubun''. The Khalkha oral version calls him ''Altan Bogdo khan.'' [[Altaic languages|An Altai version]] calls him ''Sädängkäi Käsär'' and ''Sartaktai Käsär''.{{sfn|Stein|1959|p=64}}. Among the [[Balti people|Balti]] and [[Ladakh]]i people  he is most famously known as Gyalpo Kaiserr.

===Story and narrative motifs===
The epic has a vast number of variants in plot and motifs, but while there is little point in looking for a consistent picture, the core of the story, similar to that of many legendary cycles, has been summed up as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;King Ge-sar has a miraculous birth, a despised and neglected childhood, and then becomes ruler and wins his (first) wife 'Brug-mo through a series of marvellous feats.  In subsequent episodes he defends his people against various external aggressors, human and superhuman.  Instead of dying a normal death he departs into a hidden realm from which he may return at some time in the future to save his people from their enemies.{{sfn|Samuel|2005|p=165}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Samuels, the Gesar epic lies towards the [[Shamanism|shamanic]] pole in the continuum  of Tibetan culture and religion, which he sees as evincing a constant tension between 'clerical' and 'shamanic' [[Buddhism]], the latter grounded in its earlier [[Bön]] substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Samuel|1993|pp=7–23}};{{harvnb|Samuel|2005|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The received versions of the Ge-sar cycle are thickly overlaid with Buddhist ideas and motifs, and detecting the original 'heroic' form is difficult.{{sfn|Chadwick|Zhirmunsky|1968|p=263}} Historical analysis to sift out an ancient core narrative winnows the archaic folkloric [[leitmotif]]s from features that show distinct and historically identifiable Buddhist influences. Samuel, comparing three Gesar traditions, Mongolian, Eastern Tibetan and Ladakhi, that developed relatively autonomously, postulates the following core narrative shared by all three:

* (1) The ''Lha gling'' episode.
* (2) The ''′Khrungs gling'' episode.
* (3) The ''rTa rgyugs'' episode.
* (4) The ''bDud 'dul'' episode.
* (5) The ''Hor gling'' episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|1959|pp=188–9}} says 'Hor' was an ethnonym that originally referred to the [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghurs]], and from the 12th century CE to the Mongols.&lt;/ref&gt;
* (6) The China journey episode.

to which one might add
* (7) The ''Srid pa'i le'u'' cosmogenic prelude.{{sfn|Samuel|2005|p=173}}

===Tibetan versions===
Tibetan versions differ very greatly in details.{{sfn|David-Néel|Yongden|2004|pp=2–3}} Often Buddhist motifs are conspicuous, with episodes on the creation of the world and Tibet's cosmic origins. In other variants, [[Gautama Buddha]] is never mentioned, or a certain secular irony is voiced against the national religion. According to [[Samten Karmay]], Gesar arose as the hero of a society still thinly permeated by Buddhism and the earlier myths associate him with pre-Buddhist beliefs like the mountain cult. While in most episodes, Gesar fights against the enemies of ''dharma'', an old warrior ethos, where physical power, courage, a combative spirit and things like cunning and deceit, prevail.{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=376}}

* Cosmic prelude and Tibet's early history: One motif explains how the world collapsed into anarchy: numerous demon kings (Tib.:''bdud'') had avoided subjection. As a result, hordes of cannibalistic demons and goblins, led by malignant and greedy rulers of many kingdoms, wreak havoc. Tibet's conversion from barbarity to [[Buddhism]] under the three great Dharma Kings often features. Episodes relate how [[Padmasambhava|Padmasambhāva]] subdued Tibet's violent native spirits.
* His miraculous or mundane birth: In one account, he was fatherless, like [[Padmasambhava|Padmasambhāva]], who assists his celestial creation by creating a [[Nāga|nāginī]] who then serves the king of Ling, and is impregnated by drinking a magic potion, and is born from his mother's head, like [[Athena]] in [[Greek mythology]].{{sfn|David-Néel|Yongden|2004|pp=73–99}} In another version he is conceived by his mother after she drinks water impressed with his image.{{sfn|Young|2004|pp=72–3}} Alternatively, he is born from the union of a father, who is simultaneously skygod and holy mountain, and of a mother who is a goddess of the watery underworld, or he is born, Chori, in the lineage of Ling in the Dza Valley, to the king Singlen Gyalpo and his spouse Lhakar Drönma of Gog.{{sfn|Penick|1996|p=xi}}
* Relatives: He has a half-brother, and two uncles: one is the "old hawk" ({{bo|w=spyi dpon rong tsha}}), the wise elder of Ling, who supports the child; the other, the cowardly and greedy Khrothung, sees the child as a threat and tries to do him ill. Khrothung fulfils a comic role in the epic, but his role as provocateur is absolutely central.
* His early years: Gesar's mission as a divine emissary is to vanquish powerful demons on earth.{{sfn|David-Néel|Yongden|2004|p=101}} Until his adolescence he is depicted as black, ugly, nasty, snotty&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|1959|p=545}} remarks on this as a notable feature in [[Khalkha Mongol]] versions.&lt;/ref&gt; and troublesome. His paternal uncle, or the king's brother Todong, banishes both son and mother to the rMa plateau, where he grows up living a feral life, with the child clothed in animal skins and wearing a hat with antelope horns. He comes first in a horserace whose trophy consists of the kingship of Ling. His victory marks his [[Rite of passage|coming of age]]; as consecrated king, he proclaims himself "the Great Lion, Wish-fulfilling Jewel, Subduer of Foes". He also assumes the name Gesar. Mounted on his miraculous steed ''Kyang Go Karkar,'' he subsequently wages military campaigns, together with 30 companions, against the frontier countries that represent evil.{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=376}}{{sfn|Penick|1996|pp=xi–xii}}
* Horse race and kingship: When he is 12, a horse race is held to determine who will become the king of Ling and who will marry the beautiful daughter, 'Brugmo, of a neighbouring chieftain. Returning to Ling, Gesar wins the race, marries 'Brugmo, and ascends the golden throne. He thenceforth assumes the title "Gesar".
* The kidnapping of 'Brugmo: His first campaign as king is against [[Nagaraja|Klu btsan]], the man-eating demon of the north. While away, his wife is kidnapped by Gurdkar (literally: "white tent"), the King of Hor. On his return, Gesar undertakes a second campaign, and uses magic to infiltrate the king of Hor's palace, kills him and retrieves his wife.
* Two further campaigns: Gesar wages war against King Sadam of 'Jang (sometimes located in [[Yunnan]]), and king Shingkhri of Mon (Mon is often located in the southern [[Himalayas]] and remained the term for "barbarian borderlands" until recently).
* The 18 fortresses ({{bo|w=rdzong chen bco brgyad}}): Gesar sets out to conquer the 18 great forts ({{bo|w=rdzong}}). They are listed differently according to singers and texts, but these battles nearly always include [[Tajiks]] ({{bo|w=stag gzig}})&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Papas|2011|p=268}} Papas writes that ''Stag-gzig'', 'the mythical region of the origin of [[Bon|Bon-po]],' was often conflated with 'Ol-mo-lung-ring, which modern scholars locate somewhere between northern Persia and Tibet's western borders.'it refers apparently... to the Persian-speaking part of Central Asia, that is, the land of the Tajiks according to Islamic sources, including present-day [[Tajikistan]] and Southern [[Uzbekistan]], more precisely the [[Bukhara]] and the [[Samarkand]] areas. Apart from the question of the origin of Bon-po, one can perceive the name ''Stag-gzig''/Tajik as a memory, in Tibetan culture, of its Central Asian roots.'&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tibetan Muslims|Khache Muslim]] adversaries.
* [[Lhasa]]: Some versions say that, aged 39 he made a retreat on Red Hill ({{bo|w=dmar po ri}}), where the [[Potala Palace]] was later built.{{sfn|Chayet|2003|p=44}}
* Old age: When Gesar reaches his eighties, he briefly descends to Hell as a last episode before he leaves the land of men and ascends once more to his celestial paradise.

===Mongolian version (1716)===
* Opens with a heavenly prologue, Ge-ser's birth, youth, marriage to ''Rogmo'' and his obtaining the kingship of Ling.
* Geser defeats a black striped tiger.
* Geser's voyage to China where he marries a Chinese princess.
* Geser's defeat of the demon king, with the help of the latter's wife.
* Geser's war against the three kings of ''Sharaigol'' (Hor)
* Geser's defeat of a demon who assumed the guise of a lama.
* Geser's descent to hell to rescue his mother.{{sfn|Samuel|2005|p=171}}

There is a 2017 version of this translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Rachewiltz, Igor De And Li Narangoa. 2017. Joro's Youth: The first part of the Mongolian epic of Geser Khan. Australian National University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Buryat version===
Buryat versions of the epic focus mainly on Gesar's battles with various demons, rather than on military campaigns. They also contain  a detailed and drastically different prologue to Gesar's exploits. According to these versions, the great [[Tengri]] Khormusta (Turmas, Khorbustu, Hormust) [[Khan (title)|khan]] of the celestial tribes of the West waged war with Atai Ulan, khan of the malicious gods of the east. After his victory, Khormusta dismembers Atai Ulan to prevent his resurrection and throws his body parts to Earth, where they become demons and monsters. The act almost causes the extinction of humanity; the middle son of Khormusta (''Bukhe Belligte'' or ''Uile Butelegcji'') was sent from the realm of heaven to undo the damage.

The Buryat version contains 9 branches or song episodes (''uliger''), each devoted to tell how Gesar defeats an enemy.
* First branch: Gesar's youth. In this branch, Gesar, called Nyurgai (''Stinker'') and while still in his infancy, defeats three giant rats, human-sized mosquitos and steel ravens (compare [[Heracles]] and [[Cú Chulainn]]) and marries two princesses, whereupon he assumes his true name.
* Second branch: He marries princess ''Alma Mergen'', daughter of a water deity. He then hunts demonic beasts, born from Atai Ulan's drops of blood. These include a mountain-sized dragon, the keeper of a silver mountain.
* Third branch: He undertakes combat with the great Lord of the [[Taiga]], the giant tiger Orgoli, which was born from Atai Ulan's right hand.
* Fourth branch: He kills a great beast, ''Arkhan'' the Sun-Eater, who was born from Atai Ulan's severed head.
* Fifth branch: He wars against ''Gal Dulme'', the personification of volcanic activity, who was born from Atai Ulan's corpse. Because of his youth Gesar is unable to defeat Gal Dulme by himself, and the deed is performed with assistance from his elder brother.
* Sixth branch: He wars against ''Abarga Sasen'', a 15-headed demon born from Atai Ulan's right leg.
* Seventh branch: He wars against ''Shiram Minata'', a demon from the 'Country betwixt Life and Death', who was born from Atai Ulan's left leg.
* Eighth branch: He wages war against three ''Shirai-Gol'' khans. This branch seems to be closely related to the Tibetan song about Gesar and three kings of the kingdom of Hor.
* Ninth branch: He campaigns against ''Lobsogoi'', a [[trickster]] demon, who was born from Atai Ulan's backside.{{sfn|Сахаровска|Солоухин|1986}}

There are a number of stories not connected with the foregoing nine branches described above; for example, a story in which Gesar shames ''Gume-Khan'' of [[China]], or one in which he exterminates the Four Recklings of Evil, demonic beings whose nature is not quite clear.

Distinctive features of these versions of the Gesar epic has led some scholars to the view that the Buryat and Mongolian versions are not directly dependent on a Tibetan original. Setsenmunkh has argued, and the idea was shared by C. Damdinsuren and B. Vladimirtsev, that the written Mongolian versions stem from one source which has not survived.{{sfn|Сэцэнмунх|2004}}

===Balti and Ladakhi version===
This version contains the following seven episodes:
* The ancestor Dong-gsum Mi-la sngon-mo, born miraculously, kills a nine-headed ogre, from whose body the land of Ling is born. He fathers eighteen heroes who arrive in gLing.
* [[Indra|dBang-po rgya-bzhin]] chooses his youngest son, Don-grub, to rule gLing. Dying, he is reborn as a bird, and then as Gog-bzang lha-mo, and is called Kesar/Kyesar.
* Kesar married 'Brug-gu-ma (lit. "a fragment of grain"){{sfn|Francke|2010|p=xxii}} and becomes king of gLing.
* Kesar journeys to China, where he marries the emperor's daughter, g.Yu'i dKon-mchog-ma.
* Kesar defeats the giants of the north, assisted by the giant's wife, Dze-mo.
* While he is away, the King of Hor kidnaps his wife 'Brug-gu-ma.
* On his return, Kesar vanquishes the King of Hor and brings his wife back to gLing.{{sfn|Samuel|2005|p=169}}{{sfn|Francke|2010|p=xxii}}

===Salar version===
The [[Salar language]] is used to recite some portions of Gesar.{{sfn|Dwyer|2007|pp=75–76}}

===Similarities with motifs in Turkic heroic poetry===
Chadwick and Zhirmunsky consider that the main outlines of the cycle as we have it in Mongolia, Tibet and Ladakh show an outline that conforms to the pattern of [[Epic poetry|heroic poetry]] among the [[Turkic peoples]]. (a) Like the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]] hero Bolot, Gesar, as part of an [[Rite of passage|initiation]] descends as a boy into the underworld. (b) The gateway to the underworld is through a rocky hole or cave on a mountain summit. (c) He is guided through the otherworld by a female [[Tutelary deity|tutelary spirit]] (''Manene''/grandmother) who rides an animal, like the Turkish shamaness ''kara Chach''. (d) Like kara Chach, Gesar's tutelary spirit helps him against a host of monstrous foes in the underworld. (e) Like Bolot, Gesar returns in triumph to the world, bearing the food of immortality and the water of life. (f) Like the Altai shamans, Gesar is borne heavenward on the back of a bird to obtain herbs to heal his people. They conclude that the stories of the Gesar cycle were well known in the territory of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]].{{sfn|Chadwick|Zhirmunsky|2010|pp=263–4}}

===The Bhutan versions===
The versions of the Gesar epic collected in Bhutan, in publication since 1979, are projected to run into some 31 volumes.{{sfn|Herrmann|1990|p=486}}{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=372}} [[Jigme Wangchuck]], second [[Druk Gyalpo]] (Dragon King) of [[Bhutan]], had individuals read the ''Epic of Gesar'' to him nightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Oral transmission and performance===
According to Lǐ Liánróng,
{{quote|By narrowing the period of its creation to the tenth and eleventh centuries, the dynamic of literary composition is erroneously attributed to an oral epic. Furthermore, the epic reflects Tibetan society during the sixth to ninth centuries rather than the tenth century. Thus a satisfactory conclusion about the epic's origins cannot be drawn based on the lifespans of historical heroic figures.{{sfn|Lǐ Liánróng|2001|p=335}}}}
Jiangbian pointed out that the foundation for the origin of epic is ethnic folk culture. He conjectured that before epics came into being, the Tibetan people "already had a corpus of stories that described the formation of the heavens and the earth, their ethnic origin, and ethnic heroes; these stories provided a foundation for creating the character Gesar, also known as ''Sgrung'' in early history. After further polishing by the oral poets, especially the ballad singers, Gesar became a great epic" (1986:51).{{sfn|Lǐ Liánróng|2001|pp=332}}
Many performers recite episodes from memory or books, while others chant the legendary tales in a state of [[trance]]. This last mode bears strong similarities with shamanic practitioners like the [[pawo]] [[Mediumship|mediums]] and ''mig mthong'' [[Divination|diviners]].{{sfn|Samuel|2005|p=178}}

As an heroic song composed or recited by oral bards, the epic of Gesar has been, for centuries, improvised on, and there is therefore no canonical or monumental version, as one finds in, for example, Greek epic. A given Gesar singer would know only his local version, which nonetheless would take weeks to recite. It has been responsive to regional culture and folklore, local conflicts, religious trends, and even political changes on the world stage. For example, in modern times, when news of [[World War II]] trickled into Tibet, additional episodes on how ''Gesar Conquers the Kingdom of Phyigling 'Jar'' were composed by [[Khamtrul Rinpoche#The Seventh Khamtrul Rinpoche Mipham Sangye Tenzin (1909–1929)|8th Khamthrül Rinpoche (1929–1980)]], in which Gesar appears, according to some interpretations, to travel to Germany to vanquish the demon-king, perhaps alluding to [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Lopez Jr.|1997|p=372}}{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=372}}

===Religious dimension===
Tibetan history has often swung between centralized and stateless poles, and the epic of Gesar reflects the tensions between central authority, as embodied in religious orthodoxy, and the wild, nomadic forces of the [[Autarky|autarkic]] periphery. There are versions that adopt Gesar as a lama showing him as a tamer of the wild, but, in so far as his epic retains his old lineaments as a maverick master of shamanic powers, he represents the stateless, anarchic dimension of Tibet's margins, and is rather a tamer of corrupt monastic clerics and, thus, it is not coincidental that the epic flourished on the outlying regions of Kham and Amdo. His wars are campaigns of defence against hostile powers intent on subduing the kingdom of gLing, which are often construed as anti-Buddhist. But his vanquishing of the ''dzongs'' or fortresses preserves an ambiguity, since these were potential outposts of the state.{{sfn|Samuel|1993|pp=571–2}}

Until recently,{{When|date=August 2016}} the tale was forbidden reading in many Tibetan monasteries.{{sfn|Maconi|2004|p=376}} In some monasteries, however, rituals invoking Gesar as a major spiritual force are performed.{{sfn|Samuel|2005|p=166}} Given the central role the epic played over the centuries in Tibetan folk culture, Tibetan Buddhism has incorporated elements from it and interpreted them in religious terms. The [[Gelug]] school disapproved of the epic, while the [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools generally favoured it, seeing it as an expression of the activity of [[Padmasambhava]] and as a vehicle for Buddhist teachings, especially of the [[Dzogchen]] school.{{sfn|Samuel|1993|p=293}} Consequentially, the question of whether ''babdrung'' (visionary Gesar bards) should be regarded as religious practitioners ({{bo|w=chos pa|chöpa}}) will be answered differently by those who favor and those who oppose the epic; the ''babdrung''  themselves, however, generally emphasize the connection of the epic with the [[Dharma]] ({{bo|w=chos|s=chö}}) and see themselves as a kind of religious practitioner.{{sfn|Samuel|1993|p=293}}

[[Orgyen Tobgyal]] explained that in the Nyingma perspective, "the real nature of the manifestation we know as Ling Gesar is actually that of Guru Rinpoche himself appearing in the form of a ''[[Shambhala Training#The Four Dignities, Drala and the Lhasang ritual|drala]]''" (Wylie: dgra bla, "protective warrior spirit").{{sfn|Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche|2005|p=333}}

[[Chögyam Trungpa]], who represented both Kagyu and Nyingma lineages and founded [[Shambhala Buddhism]] in the [[diaspora]], inspired by the Greek philosophers of the [[polis]], used the Gesar epic's detailed tales about an idealized nomadic government formed by the Mukpo clan, which constructed a nomadic confederation of imperial reach, to develop a model of a Tibetan polity.{{sfn|Kornman|2005|pp=347–8}}

The government of [[China]] strongly supports the cult of Gesar and its practice among [[Han Chinese]], according to some as a counter-force to Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny. ''Religion and Biography in China and Tibet''. Routledge, 2013. {{ISBN|1136113940}}. pp. 185–187&lt;/ref&gt;

In the region of [[Baltistan]] the King Kesar's saga was told in homes, especially in winter but now it is at the verge of distinction due to availability of the media devices. The region being inhabited by 100% [[Muslim]] population, the story was told only for recreational purposes and people would consider that the Kesar was not a human being but "hla hlu", special creatures of God who are given special command and ability by God. According to some scholars believing in Kesar saga is un-Islamic. According to them the Kesar is [[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal|Dajjal]] or Muslim [[Antichrist]] who will oppose [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Imam Mehdi]]  in apocalyptic battle. &lt;ref&gt;https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=28148257&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History of Gesar studies==
The first printed edition of the Gesar epic was published in Beijing in 1716 in a Mongolian version. It was this text which formed the basis for the first Western-language translation, a Russian version published by the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionary [[Isaac Jacob Schmidt]] in 1836.{{sfn|Herrmann|1990|p=485}} A German translation followed in 1839. Another Moravian missionary, [[August Hermann Francke (Tibetologist)|August Hermann Francke]], collected and translated a version from Lower Ladakh between 1905 and 1909. In 1942 George Roerich made a comprehensive survey of the literature of Gesar (Roerich 1942;277-315)

In the 20th century, other Mongolian Geser texts were edited by scientists like [[Nicholas Poppe]] and [[Walther Heissig]].

The first three volumes of the version known as the Lingtsang-Dege woodblock, which was composed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was published with a very faithful though incomplete French translation by [[Rolf Stein]] in 1956.{{sfn|Stein|1956}} Stein followed this publication with his 600-page magnum opus on the Tibetan Epic entitled ''Recherches sur l'Epopee et le Barde au Tibet''.{{sfn|Stein|1959}} This remains the most in-depth study of the Tibetan Gesar tradition.

Another version has been translated into German by [[Matthias Hermanns]] (1965).{{sfn|Hermanns|1965}} This translation is based on manuscripts collected by Hermanns in [[Amdo]]. This book also contains extensive study by Hermanns explaining the epic as the product of the Heroic Age of the nomads of North-eastern Tibet and their interactions with the many other peoples of the Inner Asian steppe. Hermanns believed the epic to pre-date Buddhism in Tibet, and saw in it an expression of the ancient Tibetan archetype of the "heaven-sent king", as found also in the myths of the founders of the Yarlung Dynasty, who founded the Tibetan Empire (7th-9th centuries CE).

The most accessible rendering of Gesar in English is by [[Alexandra David-Néel]] in her "Superhuman Life of Gesar of Ling", published in French in 1933.{{sfn|David-Néel|Yongden|2004}}

===In occultism===
In the occult system of [[Nicholas Roerich]], Gesar is presented as a hero who is believed to accept his physicality in [[Shambhala]]. It's told that he would appear with an invincible army to set general justice. Thunderous arrows will be its weapon.&lt;ref&gt;N.Roerich. ''The Squad of King Gesar''. 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Gesar also has a number of magic attributes: white horse, saddle, horseshoe, sword and lock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48529">[[Promiscuity]] tends to be frowned upon by many societies, expecting most members to have [[Committed relationship|committed, long-term relationships]] with single partners.

Most societies have historically been more critical of women's promiscuity than of [[heterosexual]] men's. Among women, as well as men, inclination for sex outside committed relationships is correlated with a high [[libido]],&lt;ref name="Baumeister" /&gt; but social and cultural factors have also been observed to influence sexual behavior and opinion.&lt;ref name="Lippa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Regan&amp;Atkins2006" /&gt;

{{See also|Hormones and sexual motivation|Sexual desire#Sex differences in sexual desire|Libido#Factors}}

Studies have related [[sociosexual orientation]] to [[sex drive]], especially in women, where the higher the sex drive the less restricted the sociosexual orientation, or interest in sex outside [[committed relationship]]s.&lt;ref name="Baumeister"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister |first1=RF |title=Gender and erotic plasticity: Sociocultural influences on the sex drive |doi=10.1080/14681990410001691343 |journal=Sexual and Relationship Therapy |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=133–139 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, pertaining to the [[nature and nurture]] debate, there is some data emphasizing cultural factors, more so for women than for men.&lt;ref name="Lippa2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lippa | first1 = R.

Men tend to have higher sociosexuality scores and be more unrestricted than women across a variety of cultures.&lt;ref name="FirstSchmitt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmitt |first1=DP |year=2005 |title=Sociosexuality from Argentina to Zimbabwe: A 48-nation study of sex, culture, and strategies of human mating |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=247–311 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000051 |pmid=16201459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmitt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmitt |first1=DP |year=2007 |title=Sexual strategies across sexual orientations: How personality traits and culture relate to sociosexuality among gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and heterosexuals |journal=Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality |volume=18 |issue=2–3 |pages=183–214 |doi=10.1300/J056v18n02_06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is more variability in scores within each gender than between men and women, indicating that although the average man is less restricted than the average woman, individuals may vary in sociosexual orientation regardless of gender.&lt;ref name="Gangestad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad |first1=SW |last2=Simpson |first2=JA |year=2000 |title=The evolution of human mating: Trade-offs and strategic pluralism |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=573–587 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0000337X |pmid=11301543|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/GangestadSimpson2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===

Contrary to popular belief, [[Body image|body esteem]] in women showed a significant positive correlation with sociosexual unrestrictedness.&lt;ref name="predict" /&gt; So did [[Waist–hip ratio|hip-to-waist ratio]] and two measures of [[virilization]].&lt;ref name="predict" /&gt; Finally, still in the same study, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption correlated, too, but it is unclear whether the latter promoted the former or vice versa, or if a third variable was at play.&lt;ref name="predict"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clard |first=AP |url=http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~psapc/pdfs/Clark%282004%29.pdf |format=PDF |title=Self-perceived attractiveness and masculinization predict women's sociosexuality |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=25 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=113–124 |doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(03)00085-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130054024/http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~psapc/pdfs/Clark%282004%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bisexuality|Bisexual]] women tend to be less restricted in their sociosexual attitudes than both homo- and heterosexual women. In sociosexual behavior also, bisexual women reported being more unrestricted, followed by homo- and then heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="Schmitt" /&gt;

[[Power (social and political)|Social power]] has been popularly associated with sexual [[wiktionary:infidelity|infidelity]] among men; experimental psychologists have linked power with sexual infidelity among women also. A Dutch study involving a large survey of 1,561 professionals, concluded that "The relationship between power and infidelity was the same for women as for men, and for the same reason. These findings suggest that the common assumption (and often-found effect) that women are less likely than men to engage in infidelity is, at least partially, a reflection of traditional gender-based differences in power that exist in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lammers |first1=J |last2=Stoker |first2=JI |last3=Jordan |first3=J |last4=Pollmann |first4=MMH |last5=Stapel |first5=DA |year=2011 |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/9/1191.short |title=Power increases infidelity among men and women |journal=Psychological Science |doi=10.1177/0956797611416252 |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1191–7 |pmid=21771963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Church (building)|Church]]-attending women score lower on promiscuity than other women, while men appear to lack this correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fagan |first1=PF |last2=Nicholas |first2=Z |url=https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF11L30.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Benefits of Religious Attendance |journal=Marri Research |date=December 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study published in ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family]]'' found that there was a correlation between female pre-marital promiscuity and higher rates of divorce.  The research, conducted by Jay Teachman, found that women with 16 or more sexual partners prior to marriage had an 80% rate of subsequent divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Teachman, Jay, "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00444.x/abstract Premarital Sex, Premarital Cohabitation, and the Risk of Subsequent. Marital Dissolution Among Women]", ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family]]'', September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biology ===

Men and women leading [[polyandrous]] lifestyles have higher levels of [[testosterone]]. However, it is unclear whether higher levels of testosterone cause increased sex drive and in turn multiple partners or whether sexual activity with multiple partners causes the increase in testosterone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Anders |first1=SM |last2=Hamilton |first2=LD |last3=Watson |first3=NV |title=Multiple partners are associated with higher testosterone in North American men and women |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=454–459 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.01.002 |pmid=17316638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociosexuality in women is positively correlated with two measures of [[prenatal]] exposure to [[androgens]]—right [[digit ratio]], and scores on the [[Mental rotation#Vandenburg and Kuse|Vandenberg Mental Rotation test]]—providing some limited support to the [[virilization]] hypothesis of female promiscuity&lt;ref name="predict" /&gt; (see also [[Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation]]). The aforementioned hypothesis is not at all mutually exclusive with other hypotheses.

Libido is correlated with the [[menstrual cycle]] so that many women experience an increase in sexual desire several days immediately before [[ovulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bullivant |first1=SB |last2=Sellergren |first2=SA |last3=Stern |first3=Kathleen |title=Women's sexual experience during the menstrual cycle: identification of the sexual phase by noninvasive measurement of luteinizing hormone |journal=Journal of Sex Research |date=February 2004 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=82–93 (in online article, see pp.14–15, 18–22) |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_1_41/ai_n6032944 |pmid=15216427 |doi=10.1080/00224490409552216 |last4=Spencer |first4=Natasha A. |last5=Jacob |first5=Suma |last6=Mennella |first6=Julie A. |last7=McClintock |first7=Martha K. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923001735/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_1_41/ai_n6032944 |archivedate=2007-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Testosterone levels rise gradually from about the 24th day of a woman's menstrual cycle until ovulation on about the 14th day of the next cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=28 Days: What Your Cycle Reveals about Your Love Life, Moods, and Potential |last=Lichterman |first=Gabrielle |isbn=978-1-59337-345-0}}{{incomplete short citation|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the high-testosterone period before ovulation, a woman typically feels more attracted to masculine facial features and is more likely to pursue short-term mating.

It is common for sex drive to diminish dramatically after [[menopause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarrel |first=PM |title=Psychosexual effects of menopause: role of androgens |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=180 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=S319–24 |year=1999 |pmid=10076172 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(99)70727-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies, including [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s, have concluded that the average age group in which women are the most active sexually is their mid-thirties, one study liberally estimating 27-45 as the limits of the age group (the average man peaks earlier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easton |first1=JA |last2=Confer |first2=JC |last3=Goetz |first3=CD |last4=Buss |first4=DM |url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/students/easton/PAID_RE_final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Reproduction expediting: Sexual motivations, fantasies, and the ticking biological clock |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=49 |issue=5 |year=2010 |pages=516–520 |place=The University of Texas at Austin |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616102925/http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/students/easton/PAID_RE_final.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in this age group typically report having sexual fantasies greater in number and intensity, engaging in sexual activity more frequently, and being more interested in casual sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloud |first=John |title=The Science of Cougar Sex: Why Older Women Lust |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2007422,00.html |magazine=Time Magazine |date=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study in [[sexual antagonism]] suggested a possible genetic link between female [[Androphilia|androphilic]] promiscuity and [[Homosexuality|male androphilia]]: [[Samoa]]n tribal women exhibited a correlation between reproductive output and the likeliness of having androphilic grandsons, though not nephews (see also [[Fa'afafine]]).&lt;ref name="fa'afafine"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=VanderLaan |first1=DP |last2=Forrester |first2=DL |last3=Petterson |first3=LJ |last4=Vasey |first4=PL |year=2012 |title=''Offspring Production among the Extended Relatives of Samoan Men and ''Fa'afafine |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036088 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=4 |page=e36088 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0036088 |editor1-last=Vitzthum |editor1-first=Virginia J|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...736088V |pmid=22558342 |pmc=3338633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rate of molecular evolution of the seminal protein gene [[SEMG2]] correlates with levels of female promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dorus |first1=S |last2=Evans |first2=PD |last3=Wyckoff |first3=GJ |last4=Choi |first4=SS |last5=Lahn |first5=BT |title=Rate of molecular evolution of the seminal protein gene SEMG2 correlates with levels of female promiscuity |journal=Nat.

[[Bateman's principle]] implies that females are choosy because there is little evolutionary advantage for them to mate with multiple males. However, observation of many species, from [[rabbit]]s to [[tephritidae|fruit flies]], has shown that females have more offspring if they mate with a larger number of males. This seemingly contradicts Bateman's theory, specifically his conclusion that "while males had more children the more partners they mated with, females did not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judson |first=Olivia |author-link=Olivia Judson |title=Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice To All Creation |place=New York |publisher=Metropolitan Books |year=2002 |isbn=0-8050-6331-5 |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exceptions to Bateman's principle abound, as do hypotheses explaining the evolution of female promiscuity. Females in fact have a lot to gain, depending on the species (see [[Bateman's principle#Females can be promiscuous|here]]).

Many species once thought monogamous, including such birds as [[swan]]s, are now known to engage in [[Promiscuity#Extra-pair copulation in non-humans|extra-pair copulations]].

== Society and culture ==

[[Evolutionary psychologist]]s have theorized that taboos against female promiscuity evolved on the basis of [[Non-paternity event|paternity anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson |first1=Margo |last2=Daly |first2=Martin |url=http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/themanwho.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Chattel |year=1992 |place=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA test]]s being yet to be invented, it was impossible to accurately determine paternity, unlike maternity. A male risked spending [[paternal investment]] on offspring who carried genetic material of another male rather than of his own. Evolutionarily, this translated into [[sexual jealousy]] and complex preventive customs (e.g., [[female genital mutilation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html |title=Female genital mutilation |publisher=World Health Organization |date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[menstrual taboos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strassman |first=BI |year=1992 |title=The function of menstrual taboos among the Dogon: defense against cuckoldry? |journal=Human Nature |volume=3 |pages=89–131 |doi=10.1007/BF02692249 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Pre-Modern ===

Female promiscuity is a recurring theme in mythologies and religions. In the Middle East, [[sacred prostitution]], usually in honor of Goddess [[Astarte]], had been prevalent before the 4th century when Emperor [[Constantine I]] attempted to replace pagan traditions with [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="3.55"&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', {{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html |title=3.55}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html |title=3.58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], [[nymph]]s are portrayed as dangerous nature spirits sexually uninhibited with humans; hence, the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] medical term ''[[Wiktionary:nymphomania|nymphomania]]''. [[Imperial Rome]] is popularly seen as being sexually profligate,&lt;ref&gt;Beert C. Verstraete and Vernon Provencal, introduction to ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition'' (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 5. For an extended discussion of how the modern perception of Roman sexual decadence can be traced to early [[Christian polemic]], see Alastair J.L. Blanshard, "Roman Vice," in ''Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), pp. 1–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and certain Roman empresses—such as [[Theodora I]], [[Messalina]] and [[Julia the Elder]]—gained in their lifetime a reputation of extreme promiscuity.
{{Quote|text=
On the field of pleasure she [Empress Theodora] was never defeated. Often she would go picnicking with ten young men or more, in the flower of their strength and virility, and dallied with them all, the whole night through. … and even thus found no allayment of her craving … And though she flung wide three gates to the ambassadors of [[Cupid]], she lamented that nature had not similarly unlocked the straits of her bosom, that she might there have contrived a further welcome to his emissaries.|

The [[Bible]] features many female personages identified as being promiscuous, among them the [[Whore of Babylon]], [[Jezebel|Princess Jezebel]], [[Thyatira|Prophetess Jezebel]], [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]], [[Rahab]], [[Salome]], and [[Zuleika (legendary)|Potiphar's unnamed wife]].

Female genital mutilation is found in many African and a few Asian societies.

The development of [[chastity belts]], apparently in the 14th century, proved handy to men worried about the prospect of their wives committing [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;Tannahill, Reay. ''Sex in history'' (1980). New York: Stein and Day. p.276.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern ===
[[File:Catherine II (Rotari type, GIM) by shakko.jpg|thumb|150px|Empress [[Catherine the Great]], a crucial figure at the time of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], is popularly remembered for [[Legends of Catherine the Great|her sexual promiscuity]].]]

Many cultures have historically laid much restriction on sexuality, most emphatically against immoderate expression of sexuality by women. In contrast, some recent ethical philosophies—both secular (coming from [[individualism]] and [[sex-positive feminism]]) and religious (e.g., [[Wicca]], [[Thelema]], [[LaVeyan Satanism]])—either tolerate it or outright celebrate it.
{{Quote|text=
We believe that it is fundamentally a radical political act to deprivatize sex. So much oppression in our culture is based on shame about sex: the oppression of women, of cultural minorities, oppression in the name of the (presumably asexual) family, oppression of sexual minorities. We are all oppressed. We have all been taught, one way or another, that our desires, our bodies, our sexualities, are shameful. What better way to defeat oppression than to get together in communities and celebrate the wonders of sex?|

Public opinion has fluctuated over the centuries, with such downturns as [[Puritan#Family life|New England Puritanism]] (1630—1660) and the [[Victorian era]] (1837—1901), when [[hypersexuality]] was often treated as an exclusively female disorder, diagnosed on the grounds of as little as masturbation alone (see [[Hypersexuality#Nymphomania in the Victorian age|here]]).&lt;ref name=Frick&gt;{{cite web|last=Frick |first=Katie L. |title=Women's Mental Illness: A Response to Oppression |url=http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~ulrich/femhist/madness.shtml#spinsters |publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |accessdate=26 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330061024/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~ulrich/femhist/madness.shtml |archivedate=30 March 2010 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the late 20th century, women could be incarcerated for promiscuous behavior in so-called [[Magdalene asylum]]s, the last of which was closed in Ireland in 1996.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/world/europe/25iht-abuse25.html?_r=3 |title=Irish Church's Forgotten Victims Take Case to U.N. |last=Ryan |first=Carol |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-archer.co.uk/history/magdalene1.htm |title=The Magdalene Laundry |author=Alison Roberts |year=2003 |publisher=The-archer.co.uk |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Institutionalised |author=Garth Toyntanen |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-9558501-0-3 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1897 to 1958, [[Ontario]] used the [[Velma Demerson|Female Refuges Act]] to incarcerate women felt to be "incorrigible".

Following the [[Industrial Revolution]] (1760~1840), as Western countries underwent [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]], education and employment opportunities were increasing for women. This environment gave rise in the late 19th century to the feminist ideal called "the [[New Woman]]"—a personification of female economic, sexual and other autonomy—which had a profound influence on feminism well into the 20th century. It wasn't until the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]] that female British citizens were no longer legally compelled, upon marriage, to transfer all their property to their husbands. The [[Women's Movement]] was closely [[Free love#Free love and the women's movement|allied]] with the [[free love]] movement, whose advocates had a strong belief that a woman ought to be herself [[Self-ownership|sovereign over her body]].

{{Quote|text=Laws against adultery [were] [[Adultery#Historical context|based]] upon the idea that woman is a chattel, so that to make love to a married woman is to deprive the husband of her services. It is the frankest and most crass statement of a slave-situation. To us, every woman … has …  an absolute right to travel in her own orbit. There is no reason why she should not be the ideal [[Wiktionary:hausfrau|hausfrau]], if that chance to be her will. But society has no right to insist upon that standard. It was, for practical reasons, almost necessary to set up such taboos in small communities, savage tribes, where the wife was nothing but a general servant, where the safety of the people depended upon a high birth-rate. But to-day woman is economically independent, becomes more so every year. The result is that she instantly asserts her right to have as many or as few men or babies as she wants or can get; and she defies the world to interfere with her. More power to her!|

The 1950s in America is stereotyped to have been sexually repressed, though not as severely as the Victorian era. Female promiscuity in particular became substantially more accepted in [[Western world|Western]] culture after the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, which resonated with the [[hippie movement]]. It also became more prevalent a theme in [[mass media]], including cinema (e.g., ''[[Sex and the City (film)|Sex and the City]]'') and music (e.g., ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]).

[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has been at the forefront of the [[gender neutrality|gender neutrality]] movement in terms of promiscuity since becoming a globally recognized entertainer in the 1980’s. In addition to her sexually explicit song lyrics and occasional nude self exposures during live performances and almost being arrested in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, on May 29, 1990 for simulating masturbation in public &lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6582939/madonna-masturbation-like-a-virgin-controversy-toronto-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;, her book [[Sex (book)|Sex]] released on Oct 21, 1992 was a commercially successful nude pictorial of her and various famous celebrities engaging in scenes of purported promiscuity, further enhancing her vision of gender equality in this regard.

Although [[polygyny]] is more common, some tribal societies are traditionally [[polyandrous]].

== Statistics ==

The use of [[demographical]] methods in [[sexological]] research was pioneered by the American zoologist [[Alfred Kinsey]], who published two books—''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' (1948) and ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' (1953)—collectively known as the [[Kinsey Reports]]. The reports defied the expectations of the public and paved the way for the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s.

Accurately assessing people's sexual behavior is difficult, since there are strong social and personal motivations, depending on social [[Social control|sanctions]] and [[taboo]]s, for either minimizing or exaggerating reported sexual activity. Women tend to undervalue the number of their sex partners whereas men tend to overestimate the number of theirs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In a 1994 study in the United States, almost all married heterosexual women reported having sexual contact only with their husbands, and unmarried women almost always reported having no more than one sexual partner in the past three months. [[Lesbian]]s who had a long-term partner reported having fewer outside partners than heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM199410063311407 |last1=Friedman |first1=RC |last2=Downey |first2=JI |year=1994 |title=Homosexuality |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society |volume=331 |issue=October 6, 1994, Number 14 |pages=923–930 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/331/14/923#R10 |pmid=8078554}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research, however, contradicts the assertion that heterosexual women are largely [[monogamous]]. A 2002 study estimated that 45% to 55% of married heterosexual women engage in sexual relationships outside their marriage.&lt;ref name="Atwood"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atwood |first=JD |last2=Schwartz |first2=L |title=Cyber-Sex  The New Affair Treatment Considerations |journal=Journal of Couple &amp; Relationship Therapy: Innovations in Clinical and Educational Interventions |year=2002 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=37–56 |doi=10.1300/J398v01n03_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the estimates for heterosexual males in the same study were greater (50%–60%), the data indicates that a significant portion of married heterosexual women have or have had sexual partners other than their spouse as well.&lt;ref name="Atwood" /&gt;

One international study found women to be more variable than men in their sex drive.&lt;ref name="Lippa2009" /&gt; International measurements of promiscuity are inconsistent from study to study, varying by the methodology used. Due to practical reason—the inability to survey a country's entire population—all studies of this class are [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], generalizing about the general population based on assessments of sample groups supposed to be representative of the larger population being studied.

For example, in a non-scientific study conducted by the condom-making company [[Durex]], British women reported fewer partners than British men, while the only country where women reported more sex partners than men did was [[New Zealand]] (20.4 versus 16.8), which was also the country where women reported more sex partners than did women from all other countries surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/10/13/1191696214489.html |title=New Zealand women most promiscuous |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further complicate matters, a well-known study in general sociosexuality that surveyed 14,059 people across 48 countries, placed New Zealand, which came right before [[Slovenia]], second to [[Finland]]; the [[United States]], in the unisex scores of the same study, came in 22nd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmitt |first=David |title=Sociosexuality from Argentina to Zimbabwe: a 48-nation study of sex, culture, and strategies of human mating |journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=28 |pages=247–75; discussion 275–311 |year=2005 |pmid=16201459 |issue=2 |url=http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/commentary_schmitt.pdf |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000051 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226234624/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/commentary_schmitt.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
[[File:Order-cuckoldry-ca1815-French-satire.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ca. 1815 French satire on [[cuckoldry]], which shows both men and women wearing horns.]]
Sexual relations with multiple males are termed ''[[polyandry]]''. It has a more specific meaning in zoology, where it refers to a type of [[mating system]], and in anthropology, where it refers to a type of [[marriage]]. Sexual relations with multiple females are termed ''[[polygyny]]'', but in zoology it can only be applied to heterosexual relations. [[Polyamory]] is sometimes defined as [[non-monogamy]] with consent of all parties involved, if within or without [[committed relationship]]s. Attitudinal differences concerning sex outside committed relationships are referred to under the term ''[[sociosexual orientation]]'' or simply ''sociosexuality''.

Since at least 1450, the word ''[[slut]]'' has been used, often pejoratively, to describe a sexually promiscuous woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|slut}}&lt;/ref&gt; In and before the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era]]s, terms like "strumpet" and "whore" were used to describe women deemed promiscuous, as seen for example in [[John Webster]]'s 1612 play ''[[The White Devil]]''.

Discrimination targeting individuals, specifically women, for sexual behavior deemed excessive, has been referred to, since at least spring of 2010, with the [[neologism]] ''[[slut shaming]]'' (also hyphenated, as ''slut-shaming'').&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

''[[Cuckold]] fetish'' is colloquial for a [[paraphilia]] in which sexual gratification is gained from maintenance or observation of sexual relations by a woman with a man or a number of men besides her husband, boyfriend or long-term male sex partner.

The popular slang ''[[Cougar (slang)|cougar]]'' refers to a woman who seeks sexual relations with considerably younger men.

The term ''[[fallen woman]]'' was used to describe a woman who has "lost her innocence", and fallen from the grace of God. In [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain especially, the meaning came to be closely associated with the "loss or surrender of a woman's chastity". Its use was an expression of the belief that to be socially and morally acceptable a women's sexuality and experience should be entirely restricted to marriage, and that she should also be under the supervision and care of an authoritative man.

'''''First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers''''' is a 2000 non-fiction book written by [[Loung Ung]], a [[Cambodia]]n author and childhood survivor of [[Democratic Kampuchea]]. It is her personal account of her experiences during the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|communist years]].

Until the age of five, Loung Ung lived in Phnom Penh, one of seven children of a high-ranking government official. She was a precocious child who loved the open city markets, fried crickets, chicken fights and sassing her parents. While her beautiful mother worried that Loung was a troublemaker—that she stomped around like a thirsty cow—her beloved father knew Loung was a clever girl.

When [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Khmer Rouge]] army [[Cambodian Civil War#Fall of Phnom Penh|stormed into Phnom Penh]] in April 1975, Ung's family fled their home and moved from village to village to hide their identity, their education, their former life of privilege. Eventually, the family dispersed in order to survive. Because Loung was resilient and determined, she trained as a child soldier in a work camp for orphans whilst other siblings were sent to labour camps. As the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War#Invasion of Kampuchea|Vietnamese penetrated Cambodia]], destroyed the Khmer Rouge, the surviving siblings were slowly reunited. Bolstered by the shocking bravery of one brother, the vision of the others and sustained by her sister's gentle kindness amid brutality, Loung forged herself a new life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First They Killed My Father (Ung)|url=http://www.litlovers.com/reading-guides/14-non-fiction/331-first-they-killed-my-father-ung|website=LitLovers|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was criticized by Bunkong Tuon for being inaccurate and, therefore, not being useful for historical research by Sody Lay, an American Cambodian reviewer. Reflecting on this negative review, Bunkong Tuon considers Sody Lay's review right and, at the same time, defends the memoirs as an emotional truth instead of a historical truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tuon |first1=B. |title=Inaccuracy and Testimonial Literature: The Case of Loung Ung's First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers |journal=MELUS: Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States |date=5 June 2013 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=107–125 |doi=10.1093/melus/mlt032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film adaptation ==
{{main|First They Killed My Father (film)}}
The book has been adapted into [[First They Killed My Father (film)|a movie]] that was produced and directed by [[Angelina Jolie]]. The film premiered on February 18, 2017 in Siem Reap, Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Angelina Jolie Pitt to Direct Netflix Original Film 'First They Killed My Father'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/07/24/angelina-jolie-pitt-to-direct-netflix-original-film-first-they-killed-my-father/|journal=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The heart of it is Loung's story", Jolie states on the film. "It's the story of a war through the eyes of a child, but it is also the story of a country". To construct an accurate portrait of the genocide and war, Jolie used only Cambodian actors who speak their native language, Khmer. She gathered hundreds of survivors and their children to re-create their stories. The movie was filmed in Cambodia.

The '''Foot in Mouth Award''' is presented each year by the [[Plain English Campaign]] for "a baffling comment by a public figure".&lt;ref name="thevine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thevine.com.au/entertainment/top10/top-10-weirdest-awards-ceremonies/ |title=Top 10 weirdest awards ceremonies |work=TheVine.com.au |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |location=Sydney |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was first made in 1993, when it was given to [[Ted Dexter]], the chairman of selectors for the [[England cricket team]]. It was awarded again the following year, and, after a two-year break, annually from 1997.&lt;ref name="past"/&gt;

The Plain English Campaign was set up in 1979 when the founder, [[Chrissie Maher]], shredded hundreds of jargon-filled forms and documents in [[Parliament Square]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/Graduation/114808.htm |title=Chrissie Maher |publisher=[[Liverpool John Moores University]] |last=Grant |first=Neil |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022175452/http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/Graduation/114808.htm |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group made their first awards the next year, rewarding those organisations that used plain English, and highlighting those that did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/awards/about-the-awards.html |title=About the awards |publisher=Plain English Campaign |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Foot in Mouth award was first made in 1993, a specific acknowledgment was made to a comment by [[Dan Quayle]], [[Vice President of the United States]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="past"/&gt;

The award has been presented 20 times, and only [[Rhodri Morgan]] and [[Boris Johnson]] have received it more than once. The Welsh politician won in both 1998 and 2005, and made a light-hearted response to his second win, claiming that the first award had "made [his] name."&lt;ref name="past"/&gt; Politicians have been recipients of the award more times than any other group of people, collecting it on 14 occasions; people from the world of sport have won four times. The 43rd President of the United States, [[George W. Bush]], received the award in 2008, with the subtitle "Lifetime Achievement Award", given not for a single quote, but for his continued "services to gobbledygook".&lt;ref name="past"/&gt;

The '''Gorgoroth name dispute''' refers to a legal dispute between musicians from Norwegian [[black metal]] band [[Gorgoroth]] over who had ownership of the band's name, which was derived from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]]. The parties to the dispute were band founder [[Infernus]] (Roger Tiegs) and members [[Gaahl]] (Kristian Espedal) and [[King ov Hell]] (Tom Cato Visnes). It began in October 2007, when it was announced that Gaahl and King had decided to part ways with Infernus, although the former two claimed to have "fired" the latter.&lt;ref name="Blabsplit"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH To Split Up? |date=2007-10-21 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BlabberMouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83227 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022112108/http://roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83227 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-22 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roadrunnerrecords2007"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Vocalist, Bassist Vow To Carry On Following Split With Guitarist |date=2007-10-21 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83230 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421205803/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83230 |archivedate=2008-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blabflame"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Frontman: 'We Will Raise The Flame Higher And Brighter Than Ever' |date=2007-10-23 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83230 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421205803/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83230 |archivedate=2008-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was concluded in March 2009 when a court verdict recognising Infernus as the legitimate user of the name was announced, and the outcome of the dispute also established a [[precedent]] in Norway for subsequent similar disputes.&lt;ref name="imhotep2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imhotep.no/?did=9088703|title=imhotep.no|website=imhotep.no|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Background===
{{main article|Gorgoroth}}
Gorgoroth was formed in 1992 by guitarist [[Infernus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gorgoroth.info/band.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413004943/http://www.gorgoroth.info/band.htm |archivedate=2009-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 1998, the band released one demo - ''[[A Sorcery Written in Blood]]'' (1993), three studio albums - ''[[Pentagram (Gorgoroth album)|Pentagram]]'' (1994), ''[[Antichrist (Gorgoroth album)|Antichrist]]'' (1996) and ''[[Under the Sign of Hell]]'' (1997), and one EP - ''[[The Last Tormentor]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorgoroth.info/sorcery.htm Gorgoroth - Albums] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331141646/http://www.gorgoroth.info/sorcery.htm |date=2009-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infernus wrote much of the material on ''Pentagram'' and the entirety of ''Antichrist'' and ''Under the Sign of Hell'', and he performed the bass lines on the latter two albums. This period saw several line-up changes - as would happen throughout the band's history - as well as extensive live performances which included two European tours. The band was signed to the major German [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] record label [[Nuclear Blast]] after being approached by them on their headlining European tour in 1997. This would be crucial for Gorgoroth to earn the attention of a wider audience through Nuclear Blast's distribution facilities in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
[[File:Gorgoroth live in Bergen 20102000.jpg|thumb|300px|Gorgoroth live in Bergen, Norway - October 20, 2000. Gaahl and Infernus]]
Vocalist Gaahl joined Gorgoroth in 1998, and was heard on the title track of ''[[Destroyer (Gorgoroth album)|Destroyer]]'' (1998). Bassist King ov Hell joined the band in 1999 and made his studio debut on ''[[Incipit Satan]]'' (2000), which was also the first Gorgoroth album to feature Gaahl as the main vocalist. Between 2002 and 2004, King composed the Gorgoroth songs that would comprise the majority of those on ''[[Twilight of the Idols (album)|Twilight of the Idols]]'' (2003) and the entirety of those on ''[[Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam]]'' (2006), the only Gorgoroth releases between 2000 and 2007. Gaahl wrote lyrics for two songs ''Incipit Satan'', the majority of those on ''Twilight of the Idols'' and the entirety of those on ''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam''. By the summer of 2007, three songs written by King and five songs with lyrics written by Gaahl were played in live performances.&lt;br&gt; 
Although Infernus contributed little material to ''Twilight of the Idols'' and none to ''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam'', he conceived the titles of the albums, rooted in his [[Satanism]] and his influences by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He also continued to participate in the production and mastering of Gorgoroth albums. His songs also continued to comprise the majority of the material performed live. He reportedly had begun work on new material for a new album in October 2006 and was first reported writing it in March 2007, the title for which he revealed to be ''[[Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt]]'' in October 2007.&lt;ref name="writingoctober"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mortemzine.net/show.php?id=992 |title=MORTEM ZINE Interview with Infernus |publisher=Mortemzine.net |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530074743/http://www.mortemzine.net/show.php?id=992 |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Update"&gt;[http://gorgoroth.org/news/archive.html Update]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226192520/http://gorgoroth.org/news/archive.html |date=December 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt; Furthermore, Infernus continued to promote the band and its releases in interviews and by other means such as the ''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam'' listening session in Berlin, May 2006, as did King through interviews and seminars in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gorgoroth.info/news.htm Gorgoroth official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414155041/http://www.gorgoroth.info/news.htm |date=2009-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prominence of each Infernus and King was further reinforced through their statuses as official band contacts as well as by the sleeves of albums such as ''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam'' - Infernus in particular was emphasised as "Satan's Minister on Earth" and he was largely responsible for negotiations with [[Regain Records]].

More controversy surrounded the band in this period, which resulted from a [[Black Mass Krakow 2004|controversial performance in Kraków, Poland]] in 2004 after which the relations with Nuclear Blast ceased, Gaahl and Infernus receiving prison sentences for excessive violence and gross negligent rape respectively, and appearances made by Gaahl in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Gorgoroth/723/|title=Tartarean Desire - Gorgoroth - Black metal band from Norway|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in part because of some of these events that ''Twilight of the Idols'' and ''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam'' were the only Gorgoroth releases in this time period.&lt;ref name="vds1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/gorgoroth.htm|title=www.voicesfromthedarkside.de|first=|last=www.voicesfromthedarkside.de|website=www.voicesfromthedarkside.de|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of Gaahl and King ov Hell to the name===
Publicly, Gaahl and King cited multiple reasons behind their decision to exclude founding member Infernus and work under the name Gorgoroth. The claims most frequently iterated throughout the dispute were allegations of Infernus investing no interest in promoting Gorgoroth or participating creatively, and that he was abusive and disrespectful towards promoters, session members and other working partners, while Gaahl and King had "creatively defined" Gorgoroth throughout a period of eight years.&lt;ref name="Blabflame" /&gt; Other claims also included Gaahl's apparent objection to Infernus' support of the late [[Euronymous]]' ''Never Stop the Madness'' campaign through his now-defunct [[Deathlike Silence Productions]] label, while King felt averse to being with Infernus in the wake of rape allegations (resulting in his eventual conviction for 'gross negligent rape') against the latter, despite having also expressed in regards to Gaahl's convictions for assault that "If Gaahl had been in America and attacked in his own house and he decided to defend himself and punish the attacker, the aggressor, he would get a medal."&lt;ref name="revolver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/content/gorgoroth |title=Infernal Affairs |quote=Why the most dangerous true Norwegian black-metal band of the decade turned on itself |publisher=[[Future US]] |work=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] |date=21 October 2007 |first=Kory |last=Grow |accessdate=13 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515141650/http://www.revolvermag.com/content/gorgoroth |archivedate=15 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their decision had been made by summer 2007, and it was in September that King - with the assistance of [[Anders Odden]] - filed a trademark application to [[Norwegian Industrial Property Office|Patentstyret]] for the name and logo of Gorgoroth.&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingapplication"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dbsearch.patentstyret.no/Vis_patent.aspx?idappl=200710859&amp;domene=V&amp;version=1&amp;tyapplication= |title=Information on King's Gorgoroth trademark application |publisher=Dbsearch.patentstyret.no |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response of Infernus===
Although Infernus declared he would not defend himself against any accusations about him raised throughout the dispute and did not directly counter the claims of Gaahl and King outside of formal environments, he nevertheless stated that he could be "difficult to work with", and stated that Gaahl and King should have decided to adopt a new name instead.&lt;ref name="Blabback"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Guitarist INFERNUS: 'I Promise For Satan That I Will Come Back' |date=2007-10-31 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83837 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67LxEhSeA?url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83837 |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fifteenyears"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83446 |title=Gorgoroth Guitarist Infernus: 'My Intention Is to Continue for Another 15 Years!' |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=24 October 2007 |accessdate=13 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422030945/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83446 |archivedate=22 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pretrialinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femforgacs.hu/interju/405/Gorgoroth_interview |title=Gorgoroth interview |publisher=Fémforgács |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Infernus' work on ''Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt'' had been reported various times in the media.&lt;ref name="writingoctober" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Update"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt;

====Claims====
Select clauses of the '''Patentstyret Trademark Act''', such as § 2. and § 14. 7., were cited in Infernus' favour throughout the dispute and determined the eventually concluded illegality and invalidity of King's trademark application, which also failed to satisfy § 8.:&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roadrunnerrecords1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=115817 |title=Infernus Claims Victory in Gorgoroth Name Dispute |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929160959/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=115817 |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hordaland1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Roy Hilmar Svendsenroy.hilmar.svendsen@nrk.no |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.6517787 |title=Retten: - Infernus er Gorgoroth - Hordaland - NRK Nyheter |publisher=Nrk.no |date=10 March 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lovdata.no/all/hl-19610303-004.html |title=LOV 1961-03-03 nr 04: Lov om varemerker |publisher=Lovdata.no |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814174248/http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19610303-004.html |archivedate=August 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;§ 2. The exclusive right to a trademark may also be acquired without registration when the trademark is established by use.

A trademark is considered to be established by use when it is well known within the circle of trade concerned in this country as a distinctive sign for someone's goods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;§ 14. A trademark may not be registered if:

7. it is liable to be confused with a trademark which someone else has started to use before the applicant, and the applicant was aware of this use when he filed his application for registration;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;§ 8. Even though a registered trademark is liable to be confused with a sign which has an earlier right, it shall be allowed to co-exist validly with the latter, provided the application for registration was filed in good faith and the holder of the earlier right has knowingly tolerated the use of the later trademark in this country for five consecutive years from the date of registration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Misconceptions===
Frequent misconceptions throughout the dispute - perpetuated by various media outlets such as ''[[Terrorizer Magazine]]'' - were that the acceptance of King's trademark application by Patentstyret in December 2007-January 2008 was a court verdict, and that at least one lawsuit had taken place prior to the one Infernus filed in September 2008, which reached [[Oslo District Court]] (Norwegian:''Oslo tingrett'') in January 2009.&lt;ref name="imhotep2009" /&gt;

==History==

===Prelude (September 2007)===
Whatever the motives were of bassist King ov Hell and vocalist Gaahl in claiming the use of the band name Gorgoroth for themselves and excluding founding member Infernus, the first move was made when King - with the assistance of [[Anders Odden]] - filed a trademark application to Patenstyret for the name and logo of Gorgoroth.&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingapplication"/&gt;

===Departure from Infernus (October - November 2007)===
In October 2007, Infernus announced on the band's official [[Myspace]] page that "a decision to split up the band" had been made with him on one side, and Gaahl and King on the other.&lt;ref name="Blabsplit"/&gt; The statement explained that the members were unable to continue working together any longer and further noted that both sides intended to continue under the band's name.&lt;ref name="Blabsplit"/&gt; A statement from Gaahl and King was also issued on the same day.&lt;ref name="roadrunnerrecords2007"/&gt; Gaahl issued another statement two days later claiming that the band had not split up but "continued on in a different form."&lt;ref name="Blabflame"/&gt; The statement further claimed that Infernus had not been a creative force throughout the course of eight years and had "shown no interest in the art [of] defining Gorgoroth during that same period of time."&lt;ref name="Blabflame"/&gt; Infernus responded on the following day with a statement noting that he claimed the legal right to band's name as "the founder and only original member of the band."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Guitarist INFERNUS: 'My Intention Is To Continue For Another 15 Years!' |date=2007-10-24 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83446 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422030945/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83446 |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaahl and King announced that [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]] (Jan Axel Blomberg) of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and [[Dimmu Borgir]] would join them on drums from the beginning of 2008, however this never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MAYHEM Drummer HELLHAMMER Joins GAAHL-Fronted Version Of GORGOROTH |date=2007-10-25 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83492 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308075044/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83492 |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teloch of Nidingir (who had also previously been a live session member for Gorgoroth) and [[Nicholas Barker]] (formerly of [[Cradle of Filth]] and Dimmu Borgir) were also revealed as members of their touring line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Recruits Drummer NICK BARKER For European Tour |date=2007-10-29 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83715 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422012908/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=83715 |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gorgoroth 201107 Paris 01.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Gaahl (left) and King ov Hell (right) performing in November 2007.]]

Another statement (intended to be the 'last in a line of short open letters to the media') from Infernus arrived a week later claiming that Gaahl had "been considering quitting the band numerous times" while King had left the band the previous year "due to difficulties combining playing in a clear-cut Satanic metal band as Gorgoroth with the fact that he is full-time employed as a primary school teacher."&lt;ref name="Blabback"/&gt; Infernus further noted that as the band's founding member, he would "not agree on giving away the name [he] rightfully own to [their] third vocalist and sixth or seventh (!) bass player for whatever reasons they might have."&lt;ref name="Blabback"/&gt; Furthermore, he said that he was in the process of finishing and preparing the material he reportedly started in October 2006 and was first reported writing when he was released on parole in March 2007, declaring the title to be ''Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt''.&lt;ref name="writingoctober"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blabback"/&gt;

King's trademark application was revealed by Infernus to the public, and that this was done without the latter's knowledge.&lt;ref name="Kingapplication"/&gt; Infernus' attorney Egil Horstad of Vogt &amp; Wiig warned Gaahl and King that this application was in abrogration of select sections of the Patentstyret Trademark Act.&lt;ref name="Blabback" /&gt;  On their November European tour - which Gorgoroth had been scheduled to embark on several months before the split, Gaahl and King frequently used the name "The Force Gorgoroth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=xtinemp3|url=http://www.mp3.com/hard-rock-metal/genre/359/show_site_blog_entry.html?genre_id=359&amp;topic_id=1773035&amp;print=1 |title=Interview with The force Gorgoroth |publisher=MP3.com |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.metal-hammer.de/archive/index.php/t-19009.html |title=Tour diary |publisher=Forum.metal-hammer.de |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224230128/http://forum.metal-hammer.de/archive/index.php/t-19009.html |archive-date=2008-12-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wacken.com/en/woa2008/main-news/news/archiv/archiv-single/article/gorgoroth-is-back/ |title=Wacken Open Air announcement |publisher=Wacken.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there also existed a King ov Hell/Gaahl trademark application for this band name.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dbsearch.patentstyret.no/Vis_patent.aspx?idappl=200715620&amp;domene=V&amp;version=1&amp;tyapplication= |title=Information on King and Gaahl's The Force Gorgoroth trademark application |publisher=Dbsearch.patentstyret.no |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2009-03-13 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceptance of King's trademark application by Patentstyret (December 2007 - January 2008)===
In December, [[Regain Records]] issued a press release announcing their decision to "continue the co-operation with the band's original member Infernus with a new line-up" and that the label recognised "Infernus as the rightful owner of the bands name, logo and trademark" as well as their preparation "to take any legal steps necessary to prevent any third party from exploiting it, artistically and commercially."&lt;ref name="regainsupport"&gt;{{cite web |title=Record Label Takes Guitarist's Side In GORGOROTH Name Dispute |date=2007-12-13 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=86725 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422005419/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=86725 |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Gaahl and King delivered a statement claiming that it had been "legally determined" by the [[Norwegian Industrial Property Office|Norwegian patent office]] that they retained "the rightful ownership and use of the name and logo, now and in the future."&lt;ref name="Blabretain"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH's GAAHL, KING Retain Ownership Of Band's Name And Logo |date=2007-12-19 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=87015 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6515uXtRb?url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=87015 |archivedate=2012-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Patent Office's first department had thus accepted King's Gorgoroth trademark application, King and Gaahl withdrew their application for the trademark of "The Force Gorgoroth".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The statement also declared that Gaahl and King had severed ties with Regain Records for "their disloyal acts" and were "carefully choosing a new label for the release of their next full-length album."&lt;ref name="Blabretain"/&gt; Infernus subsequently declared that the Norwegian patent office decision would be appealed by Regain Records and himself.&lt;ref name="blaborb"&gt;{{cite web |title=ORGOROTH Guitarist INFERNUS Says New Lineup Will Include Members Of OBITUARY, DISSECTION |date=2007-12-26 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=87333 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67M1pRJEO?url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=87333 |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-negotiable offer (March 2008)===
In March 2008, Infernus announced that he hired an additional lawyer - Kate I Lohren of Onsagers AS - and made a non-negotiable offer to Gaahl and King with a three-day deadline.&lt;ref name="marchoffer"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH's INFERNUS Makes 'Non-Negotiable' Offer To Estranged Bandmates |date=2008-03-04 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=92162 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308222721/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=92162 |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer was not accepted and Infernus then declared that his attorney would appeal the Norwegian Patent Office decision and "commence legal proceedings in order to have the matter handled by the courts."&lt;ref name="blableg"&gt;{{cite web |title=GORGOROTH Guitarist Says He Will Commence 'Legal Proceedings' Against Estranged Bandmates |date=2008-03-11 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=92734 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325225750/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=92734 |archivedate=2008-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the bulletin, Regain Records had "illegally removed King's bass tracks and mixed the recordings without the knowledge of Gaahl and King". King and Gaahl claimed that Regain Records thus broke their contract with them. The bulletin also announced that they planned on taking further action against Regain Records.&lt;ref name="haltalbum1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=101702 |title=GORGOROTH's GAAHL, KING Force REGAIN RECORDS To Stop Distribution Of 'Live In Greighallen' - July 27, 2008 |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331091026/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=101702 |archivedate=March 31, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Regain Records released a response to the announcement, stating that the ceasing and sales of marketing was "only an interemistic decision made by the court to stop all actions in regards of the album" until "the case is settled and there's no verdict made on the matter yet".&lt;ref name="haltalbum2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=101801 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - REGAIN RECORDS Issues Statement Regarding GORGOROTH 'Live In Grieghallen' Dispute |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221153714/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=101801 |archivedate=2008-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2008, Infernus issued a statement saying that the Gorgoroth trademark matter would not be decided until a verdict was made in a yet to be announced trial in [[Oslo]], Norway, and that the conflict between Regain Records and Gaahl/King ov Hell about ''True Norwegian Black Metal - Live in Grieghallen'' would be decided in another to-be-announced trial in [[Malmö]], Sweden; until then, a [[temporary injunction]] has stopped Regain Records from promoting and distributing the album.&lt;ref name="augustupdate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=102676 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - Guitarist Infernus Vows to Continue Fightover Gorgoroth Name |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221153359/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=102676 |archivedate=2008-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaahl and King ov Hell stated that they would be entering the studios on August 25 to record a new album featuring Teloch as well as Ice Dale of [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]] on guitars, and [[Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad|Frost]] of [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]] and [[1349 (band)|1349]] (who was also at different points a full-time and session member of Gorgoroth) on drums.

By October 2008, everything except the vocals had been recorded for the new album of Gaahl and King that in the aftermath of the name dispute was expected to materialise into the debut God Seed album. At certain points in time it was publicly stated by Gaahl and/or other parties that he had begun working on lyrics and vocal arrangements, but apparently on none of these occasions did Gaahl fulfil these, and his lack of enthusiasm would contribute to his decision to retire from metal in July 2009.&lt;ref name="gaahlretire"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=125599 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - GAAHL On Decision To Retire From Metal: 'For Me, It's Not Heartfelt Anymore' |access-date=2009-09-15 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Yw7XlSu?url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=125599 |archive-date=2012-02-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, studio times were allocated so Gaahl could begin work, prompting the cancellation of a tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=103412 BLABBERMOUTH.NET - GAAHL-Fronted GORGOROTH Cancels Dates Due To Recording Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330202442/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=103412 |date=2009-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 2008 when interviewed by Faceculture, Gaahl implied that he had not yet worked on lyrics and vocal arrangements and intended to do so somepoint after the completion of his band's European tour with Cradle of Filth.&lt;ref name="faceculture"&gt;[http://faceculture.nl/artist.php?id=666 Gaahl / Video interview / Artists / FaceCulture - Online Multimedia Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230153807/http://faceculture.nl/artist.php?id=666 |date=2009-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009, Gaahl and his partner Robin went on vacation in Spain for two months.&lt;ref name="gaahlretire" /&gt; While Gaahl was abroad, King claimed that he was using this time to work on lyrics and vocal arrangements, but after Gaahl returned from Spain it was stated by King that these had still yet to be done:&lt;ref name="gaahlspain2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imhotep.no/?did=9088770|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724180242/http://www.imhotep.no/?did=9088770|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 July 2011|title=From Imhotep to Eternal Terror|date=24 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have recorded everything in the studio and are just waiting for Gaahl to put on vocals on it. So we have only vocals and the final mix to go before it's all done. It's sometimes a nightmare to work with him in the studio because of the pride he puts into the smallest details. If he is not in the right mood or doesn't find the correct words we get nothing done. At times I've spent days in the studio counting seconds with nothing happening. It's the same way now, but I know in the end the result will be unique and powerful. We have to wait till Gaahl is done writing his lyrics to choose the title for the album. When the whole concept of this album is done lyrically we’ll decide which title to use.&lt;ref name="gaahlreturnspain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=44120&amp;comments=1|title=King Ov Hell Discusses New Band God Seed|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Infernus files lawsuit against Gaahl and King (September 2008 - March 2009)===
On December 1, 2008, it was announced on Infernus' official Gorgoroth website that a trial date was scheduled in Oslo, Norway and would take place in the last week of January 2009.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorgoroth.info/menu.html |title=Gorgoroth official website |publisher=Gorgoroth.info |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730205323/http://www.gorgoroth.info/menu.html| archivedate = July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial took place between January 28–30, 2009, and on March 10, 2009, Infernus announced the verdict had been reached:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Oslo City District Court has today delivered a verdict on the main question in the Gorgoroth trademark case, which took place at the end of January 2009. The court has decided that King ov Hell's trademark registration # 243365 of the band name Gorgoroth is NOT valid and shall therefore be deleted. The court states that King ov Hell and Gaahl excluded themselves from the band Gorgoroth when they tried to fire Infernus in October 2007. The court further states that Infernus cannot be excluded from Gorgoroth, unless he himself decides to quit. Infernus is very pleased, but not surprised, by this verdict. The remaining issues concerning financial matters and such are yet to be decided upon."&lt;ref name="roadrunnerrecords1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name was considered to have already been trademarked by use before Gaahl and King joined the band in 1998 and 1999 respectively.&lt;ref name="hordaland1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avis2.no/musikk_og_film/Dom_fastslaar:_Infernus_er_Gorgoroth |title=Dom fastslår: Infernus er Gorgoroth - AVIS2 |publisher=Avis2.no |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320160011/http://www.avis2.no/musikk_og_film/Dom_fastslaar%3A_Infernus_er_Gorgoroth |archive-date=2009-03-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Infernus' lawyer Erik Rødsand, Gaahl and King are prohibited from choosing band names that are "confusingly alike to" Gorgoroth. This would also include their previously registered "The Force Gorgoroth".&lt;ref name="hordaland1"/&gt; The domain name gorgoroth.org which had been under their control was redirected to the official website at www.gorgoroth.info until the lease eventually expired in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorgoroth.org |title=Gorgoroth |publisher=Gorgoroth |date= |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaahl and King assumed the name [[God Seed]] after the verdict, although the lineup was to dissolve in July 2009 after having had performed at two festivals following Gaahl's decision to leave and retire from metal music.&lt;ref name="godseed"&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=116645 BLABBERMOUTH.NET - Former GORGOROTH Members Launch GOD SEED] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327031540/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=116645 |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gorgoroth DA and other subsequent events (April - May 2009)===
In early April 2009, Infernus revealed to the public that Gaahl and King had opened a small business called "Gorgoroth DA", apparently intended to be in connection with the Gorgoroth band name, and that the business was to be ordered to be shut down.&lt;ref name="gorgorothda1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/interviews/730/Gorgoroth.html|title=Gorgoroth html - The Gauntlet|website=www.thegauntlet.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 2009, an article in the Norwegian financial newspaper [[Dagens Næringsliv]] revealed that the remaining issues in Infernus' lawsuit had been agreed upon by the two parties, and that a settlement had been made. The details of the settlement are confidential, but Infernus commented that he was content with the outcome. In the same article, King and Gaahl's lawyer, Lars Christian Fjeldstad, confirmed that the verdict concerning the trademark registration was final - meaning it cannot be appealed - and that a settlement had been made regarding the remaining issues of the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Anders W. ''Forlikte satanister'', [[Dagens Næringsliv]], 02.06.2009, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

We are not taking sides on their legal situation, but it would be very disingenuous of me to say that we did not enjoy our time on the road. If we have the chance, we will appear with them again regardless of the disputed name.''|date= 2008-12-03|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gudiyam Caves''' are rock shelters in South India and known for prehistoric stone tools and culture. They were first identified by British geologist [[Robert Bruce Foote]]. This ancient site is situated in the [[Thiruvallur district]] near the [[Poondi reservoir]], {{convert|60|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]].

Archaeological evidence suggests that the caves were used by [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic Man]].  The site has been excavated by the Archaeological Survey of India in 1963 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;( Ref: IAR 1963-64, p.&amp;nbsp;19)&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic paleolithic studies in this region indicate these sites suggest extensive movement of early hominids across the landscape about '''200,000 years''' ago. Sixteen such shelters have been identified by the Archaeological Survey of India in Allikulli Hill ranges near [[Poondi]].

An '''independent medical examination''' (IME) occurs when a [[Physician|doctor]], [[psychologist]], or other licensed healthcare professional conducts an examination of an individual to help answer specific legal or administrative questions related to a variety of situations, e.g., a disability claim; workers' compensation case; a personal injury lawsuit (tort claim); impaired professionals program; or sexual harassment in the workplace.{{efn|The preceding is not an exhaustive list of situations where healthcare professionals might be asked to conduct an independent medical examination.}}

==Limited doctor-patient relationship==

Conducting an IME does not establish a typical doctor/therapist-patient relationship as exists when a clinician treats a patient in the hospital or at an outpatient clinic. However, the independent, objective (unbiased) nature of the examination does not absolve the doctor from all professional responsibilities. For example, in most IMEs the clinician should assess for possible psychiatric disorders and ask the individual if he or she has been thinking of hurting or killing themselves or someone else. If upon further questioning after an affirmative response it becomes apparent that the evaluee poses a significant risk of imminent harm to self or others, the examiner must take steps to prevent such harm and to facilitate referral to appropriate treatment and psychosocial support. Thus, a "limited doctor-patient relationship" exists when conducting IMEs.&lt;ref&gt;Ky, P., Hameed, H., &amp; Christo, P. J. (2009). Independent medical examinations: Facts and fallacies. ''Pain Physician, 12''(5), 811-818. [http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/current/pdf?article=MTI2MQ%3D%3D&amp;journal=51 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workers' compensation and long-term disability insurance ==

IMEs may be conducted to determine the cause, extent and medical treatment of a work-related or other injury where liability is at issue; whether an individual has reached maximum benefit from treatment; and whether any permanent impairment remains after treatment. An IME may be conducted at the behest of an employer or an insurance carrier to obtain an independent opinion of the clinical status of the individual. [[Workers' compensation]] insurance carriers, auto insurance carriers, and self-insured employers have a legal right to this request. Should the doctor/therapist performing the IME conclude that a patient’s medical condition is not related to a compensable event, the insurer may deny the claim and refuse payment.

[[Image:Guatemala-Peten-around-Flores.png|thumb|Map of Lake Petén Itzá, showing location of '''Ixlu''' on the eastern shore]]
'''Ixlu''' ({{IPA|/iʃˈluː/}}) is a small [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site that dates to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic and Postclassic Periods]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.618. Valdés &amp; Fahsen 2005, pp.151-152.&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the isthmus between the [[Petén Itzá]] and Salpetén lakes, in the northern [[Petén Department]] of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="Aguilar"&gt;Aguilar 2000, p.259.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was an important port with access to Lake Petén Itzá via the Ixlu River.&lt;ref name="Aguilar" /&gt; The site has been identified as '''Saklamakhal''', also spelt '''Saclemacal''', a capital of the [[Kowoj]] Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.618. Aguilar 2000, p.259.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has over 150 structures, the majority of which in the site core display typically Postclassic characteristics.&lt;ref name="SanchezPolo"&gt;Sánchez Polo ''et al'' 1995, p.592.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was briefly investigated by Don and Prudence Rice in 1980.&lt;ref name="SanchezPolo" /&gt;

Ixlu is located approximately {{convert|23|km|abbr=on}} east of the departmental capital of [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]] and {{convert|275|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Guatemala City]]. Ixlu is approximately {{convert|28|km|abbr=on}} south of the ruins of the major Classic Period city of [[Tikal]].

==Occupation==
Archaeological investigations have uncovered potsherds dating as far back as the early Middle Preclassic (1000 BC&amp;ndash;800 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar 2000, p.261. Sánchez Polo ''et al'' 1995, p.593. Castellanos Cabrera 2008, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Postclassic potsherds are widely distributed in the upper levels of the site to a depth of {{convert|30|to|40|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Aguilar_a"&gt;Aguilar 2000, p.261.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from the Temple of the Hidden Jars indicates a continuous occupation from the Preclassic right through the Classic (AD 200&amp;ndash;900) to the Postclassic Period (AD 900&amp;ndash;1525), with occupation continuing until approximately 1700, well after the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Conquest]] of most of Guatemala, according to [[ethnohistory|ethnohistoric]] sources.&lt;ref name="Aguilar_a" /&gt; The Petén Lakes region finally fell to the Spanish Crown in 1697,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.776-778.&lt;/ref&gt; at which time Ixlu was in disputed territory between the mutually hostile [[Itza]] and Kowoj kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2009, p.62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==
Fifty structures have been mapped at Ixlu by the Central Peten Historical Ecology Project.&lt;ref name="BeyHanson"&gt;Bey, Hanson &amp; Ringle 1997, p.247.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of these are C-shaped bench superstructures and two are L-shaped.&lt;ref name="BeyHanson" /&gt;

Ixlu has two [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] and is one of only two Postclassic sites in the central Petén lakes region to have a recognisable ballcourt.&lt;ref name="Valdes"&gt;Valdés &amp; Fahsen 2005, pp.151-152.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both ballcourts at Ixlu apparently date to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Valdes" /&gt; The site possesses a [[twin pyramid complex]], a feature that is rare outside of Tikal and probably indicates the political influence of that great city.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture at Ixlu resembles that at the Late Classic site of [[Seibal]] on the [[Pasión River]].&lt;ref&gt;chele &amp; Freidel 1990, p.389.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Temple of the Hidden Jars===
The Temple of the Hidden Jars (''Templo de las Vasijas Escondidas'') has been labelled as Structure 2034.&lt;ref name="Aguilar" /&gt; It is bordered by Structure 2041 on the south side, Structure 2036 to the west and Structure 2035 to the north, its eastern side faces onto Patio B.&lt;ref name="Aguilar" /&gt; The temple measures {{convert|13.9|by|9.6|m|ft}} and consisted of a two-level platform, the first level was {{convert|1.15|m|ft}} high and the second level had a height of {{convert|1.2|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Aguilar_b"&gt;Aguilar 2000, pp.259-260.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple has been dated to the Late Postclassic Period (AD 1200-1525).&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar 2000, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt; A stairway ascended the west side of the temple and there was an altar on the summit that measured {{convert|1|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Aguilar_b" /&gt; The temple is named from two hidden niches on the west side of the temple, one at the foot of the stairway and the second under an altar on the temple steps.&lt;ref name="Aguilar_a" /&gt; Each contained a single red-brown ceramic vessel measuring approximately {{convert|16|cm|in}} in diameter and {{convert|14|cm|in}} high, each with its respective concave lid.&lt;ref name="Aguilar_a" /&gt; The vessels have four handles spaced equidistantly around the circumference, with the lids also possessing a handle.&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar 2000, pp.261, 273.&lt;/ref&gt; The jars contained only brown soil.&lt;ref name="Aguilar_a" /&gt; This style of hidden niche is similar to niches associated with ceremonial structures in distant [[Mayapan]] in the north of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Aguilar_a" /&gt;

==Monuments==
{{double image|right|Ixlu Altar 1, Flores central park.JPG|250|Ixlu Stela 2, Flores central park.JPG|250|Altar 1 from Ixlu, which contains a section of text comprising eight [[glyph]]s that are identical to a phrase on the Dos Pilas [[Maya stelae|Stela]] 8.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel 1990, p.390.&lt;/ref&gt;|Stela 2 from Ixlu}}
Four Classic Period sculpted monuments were recovered from the site, two [[stela]]e and two [[altars]].&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez Polo ''et al'' 1995, p.593.&lt;/ref&gt; Ixlu Stela 1 bears the date 879 AD, in the Late Classic Period, and depicts a ruler who used the [[Tikal]] [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|Emblem Glyph]] and the ''K'ul Mutul Ahaw'' title ("holy lord of Tikal").&lt;ref&gt;Valdés &amp; Fahsen 2005, pp.9, 151. Drew 1999, p.352.&lt;/ref&gt; The stelae at Ixlu resemble traditional Classic Period stelae such as those at Tikal.&lt;ref name="Schele"&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel 1990, p.389.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stelae 1 and 2 show bloodletting rituals and the materialisation of the [[Maya religion|Paddler Gods]].&lt;ref name="Schele" /&gt; Ixlu Stela 2 is now located in the main plaza of [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monuments of Ixlu bear some hieroglyphic texts that closely resemble texts from the site of [[Dos Pilas]], suggesting that the lords of Ixlu may have been refugees from the collapse of that state in the [[Petexbatún]] region of the [[Petén Basin]],&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel 1990, pp.389-390, 505n20.&lt;/ref&gt; a state that itself professed to have a legitimate claim to the rulership of Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Webster 2002, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish views on slavery''' are varied both religiously and historically. [[Judaism]]'s ancient and medieval religious texts contain numerous laws governing the ownership and treatment of slaves. Texts that contain such regulations include the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), the [[Talmud]], the 12th century [[Mishneh Torah]] by rabbi [[Maimonides]], and the 16th century [[Shulchan Aruch]] by rabbi [[Yosef Karo]].  The original Israelite slavery laws found in the Hebrew Bible bear some resemblance to the 18th century BCE slavery laws of [[Hammurabi]].&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 619"&gt;Hastings, p 619&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}} The regulations changed over time.  The Hebrew Bible contained two sets of laws, one for [[Canaan]]ite slaves, and a more lenient set of laws for Hebrew slaves.  From the time of the Pentateuch, the laws designated for Canaanites were applied to all non-Hebrew slaves. The Talmud's slavery laws, which were established in the second through the fifth centuries CE,&lt;ref name="BBC Religion"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Talmud|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/texts/talmud.shtml|website=BBC Religion|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; contain a single set of rules for all slaves, although there are a few exceptions where Hebrew slaves are treated differently from non-Hebrew slaves.  The laws include punishment for slave owners that mistreat their slaves.  In the modern era, when the [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement sought to outlaw slavery, supporters of slavery used the laws to provide religious justification for the practice of slavery.

Historically some Jewish people owned and traded slaves.&lt;ref name="Reiss p 85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Reiss|title=The Jews in Colonial America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQEyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85|date=2 January 2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1730-8|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were important players in the [[Slavery in medieval Europe|medieval slave trade in Europe]] up to about the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Trade|title=YIVO {{!}} Trade|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholarly works have been published to rebut the [[antisemitic canard]] of Jewish domination of the slave trade in Africa and the [[Americas]] in the later centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews and the American Slave Trade|author=Saul Friedman|pages=250–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finkelman&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1051402 Reviewed Work: Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight by Eli Faber] by Paul Finkelman.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refutations&gt;Refutations of charges of Jewish prominence in slave trade:
* "Nor were Jews prominent in the slave trade. Of the 40 slave merchants in South Carolina, only 1 minor trader was a Jew." [paragraph goes on to list similar breakdowns for other US states] - Marvin Perry, Frederick M. Schweitzer: ''Antisemitism: Myth and Hate from Antiquity to the Present'', p. 245. Palgrave Macmillan, 2002; {{ISBN|0-312-16561-7}}
* "In no period did Jews play a leading role as financiers, shipowners, or factors in the transatlantic or Caribbean slave trades. They possessed far fewer slaves than non-Jews in every British territory in North America and the Caribbean. Even when Jews in a handful of places owned slaves in proportions slightly above their representation among a town's families, such cases do not come close to corroborating the assertions of The Secret Relationship." - Wim Klooster (University of Southern Maine): [http://oieahc.wm.edu/wmq/Jan00/FaberJan00.pdf Review of ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'' by Eli Faber]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (2000).

* "Medieval Christians greatly exaggerated the supposed Jewish control over trade and finance and also became obsessed with alleged Jewish plots to enslave, convert, or sell non-Jews... Most European Jews lived in poor communities on the margins of Christian society; they continued to suffer most of the legal disabilities associated with slavery. ... Whatever Jewish refugees from Brazil may have contributed to the northwestward expansion of sugar and slaves, it is clear that Jews had no major or continuing impact on the history of New World slavery." - Professor David Brion Davis of Yale University in ''Slavery and Human Progress'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 89 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])
* "The Jews of Newport seem not to have pursued the [slave trading] business consistently ... [When] we compare the number of vessels employed in the traffic by all merchants with the number sent to the African coast by Jewish traders ... we can see that the Jewish participation was minimal. It may be safely assumed that over a period of years American Jewish businessmen were accountable for considerably less than two percent of the slave imports into the West Indies" - Professor Jacob R. Marcus of Hebrew Union College in ''The Colonial American Jew'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1970), Vol. 2, pp. 702-703 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])

American mainland colonial Jews imported slaves from Africa at a rate proportionate to the general population.  As slave sellers, their role was more marginal, although their involvement in the Brazilian and Caribbean trade is believed to be considerably more significant.&lt;ref name=ColumbiaHistory&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JIBM5JEYM1gC&amp;pg=PA43 ''The Columbia History of Jews and Judaism in America'', p. 43], by Rabbi Marc Lee Raphael, (Columbia University Press, February 12, 2008); {{ISBN|978-0231132220}}.

==The Exodus==

The story of the [[Exodus from Egypt]], as related in the [[Torah]], has shaped the Jewish people throughout history.  Briefly outlined, the story recounts the experience of the [[Israelites]] under Egyptian enslavement, God's promise to redeem them from slavery, God's punishment of the Egyptians, and the Israelite redemption and departure from Egypt.  The Exodus story has been interpreted and reinterpreted in every era and in every location to suit or challenge cultural norms.&lt;ref&gt;Kushner, 332.&lt;/ref&gt; The result over time has been a steady increase in governance of masters in favor of slaves' rights and eventually the complete prohibition of slavery.&lt;ref name="Kushner457" /&gt;

==Biblical era==

Ancient Israelite society allowed slavery; however, total domination of one human being by another was not permitted.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 6"&gt;Hezser, p 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potok, 457-459.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, slavery in antiquity among the Israelites was closer to what would later be called [[indentured servitude]].&lt;ref name="Kushner457"&gt;Kushner, 457.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were seen as an essential part of a Hebrew household.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 382"&gt;Hezser, p 382&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there were cases in which, from a slave's point of view, the stability of servitude under a family in which the slave was well-treated would have been preferable to economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Tigay, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It is impossible for scholars to quantify the number of slaves that were owned by Hebrews in ancient Israelite society, or what percentage of households owned slaves, but it is possible to analyze social, legal, and economic impacts of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser p 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains two sets of rules governing slaves:  one set for Hebrew slaves (Lev 25:39-43) and a second set for [[Canaan]]ite slaves (Lev 25:45-46).&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 619"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 29"&gt;Hezser, p 29&lt;/ref&gt; The main source of non-Hebrew slaves were prisoners of war.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 382"/&gt;   Hebrew slaves, in contrast to non-Hebrew slaves, became slaves either because of extreme poverty (in which case they could sell themselves to an Israelite owner) or because of inability to pay a debt.&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 6"/&gt;  According to the Hebrew Bible, non-Hebrew slaves were drawn primarily from the neighboring [[Canaan]]ite nations,&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"&gt;Schorsch, p 63&lt;/ref&gt; and religious justification was provided for the enslavement of these neighbors:  the rules governing Canaanites was based on a curse aimed at [[Canaan (Biblical figure)|Canaan]], a son of [[Curse of Ham|Ham]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis p 5&lt;/ref&gt; but in later eras the Canaanite slavery laws were stretched to apply to all non-Hebrew slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch p 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws governing non-Hebrew slaves were more harsh than those governing Hebrew slaves:  non-Hebrew slaves could be owned permanently, and bequeathed to the owner's children,&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 25:45-45&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hebrew slaves were treated as servants, and were released after six years of service or the occurrence of a jubilee year.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potok, 457&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar suggests that the distinction was due to the fact that non-Hebrew slaves were subject to the [[curse of Canaan]], whereas God did not want Jews to be slaves because he freed them from [[The Exodus|Egyptian enslavement]].&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, pp 10, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws governing Hebrew slaves were more lenient than laws governing non-Hebrew slaves, but a single Hebrew word, ''ebed'' (meaning slave or servant, cognate to the Arabic ''[[Abd (Arabic)|abd]]'') is used for both situations.  In English translations of the Bible, the distinction is sometimes emphasized by translating the word as "slave" in the context of non-Hebrew slaves, and "servant" or "bondman" for Hebrew slaves.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Most slaves owned by Israelites were non-Hebrew, and scholars are not certain what percentage of slaves were Hebrew: [[Ephraim Urbach]], a distinguished scholar of Judaism,  maintains that Israelites rarely owned Hebrew slaves after the [[Maccabean]] era, although it is certain that Israelites owned Hebrew slaves during the time of the [[Babylonian exile]].&lt;ref name="Hezser, p 6"/&gt;  Another scholar suggests that Israelites continued to own Hebrew slaves through the Middle Ages, but that the Biblical rules were ignored, and Hebrew slaves were treated the same as non-Hebrews.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The Torah forbids the return of runaway slaves who escape from their foreign land and their bondage and arrive in the Land of Israel. Furthermore, the Torah demands that such former slaves be treated equally to any other resident alien.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 23:16-17&lt;/ref&gt; This law is unique in the Ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;Potok, 1124-1125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Talmudic era==
In the early [[Common Era]], the regulations concerning slave-ownership by Jews underwent an extensive expansion and codification within the Talmud.&lt;ref name="Blackburn, p 68"&gt;Blackburn, p 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The precise issues that necessitated a clarification to the laws is still up for debate. The majority of current scholarly opinion holds that pressures to assimilate during the late Roman to early medieval period resulted in an attempt by Jewish communities to reinforce their own identities by drawing distinctions between their practices and the practices of non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Urbach, pp 3-4, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milikowsky, Collected Writings in Jewish Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  One author however, has forwarded that they could include factors such as ownership of non-Canaanite slaves, the continuing practice of owning Jewish slaves or conflicts with Roman slave-ownership laws.&lt;ref name="Blackburn, p 68"/&gt; Thus, the [[Talmud]] (circa 200–500 CE) contains an extensive set of laws governing slavery, which is more detailed than found in the [[Torah]].

The major change found in the Talmud's slavery laws was that a single set of rules, with a few exceptions, governs both Jewish slaves and non-Jewish slaves.&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39"&gt;Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Another change was that the distinction between Hebrew and non-Hebrew slaves began to diminish as the Talmud expanded during this period. This included an expanded set of obligations the owner incurred to the slave as well as codifying the process for manumission (the freeing from slavery). It also included a large set of conditions that allowed or required manumission to include requirements for education of slaves, expanding disability manumission, and in cases of religious conversion or necessity.&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"&gt;Hastings, p 620&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, "Slaves and Slavery"&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;Ref&gt;Jewish Virtual Library, Slavery in Judaism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kid 24a, Git 38b, Yev 93b&lt;/ref&gt; These restrictions were based on the Biblical injunction to treat slaves well with the reinforcement of the memory of Egyptian slavery which Jews were urged to remember by their scriptural texts.&lt;ref name="Goodman2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdiKEOTphrgC|title=Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations|author=Martin Goodman|date=25 January 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-190637-9|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[Josephus]] wrote that the seven-year automatic release was still in effect if the slavery was a punishment for a crime the slave committed (as opposed to voluntary slavery due to poverty).&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 33&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the notion of Canaanite slaves from the Jewish Bible is expanded to all non-Jewish slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, pp 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant effort is given in the Talmud to address the property rights of slaves. While the Torah only refers to a slave's specific ability to collect gleanings, Talmudic sources interpret this commandment to include the right to own property more generally, and even "purchase" a portion of their own labor from the master. Hezser notes the often confusing mosiac of Talmudic laws distinguishes between finding property during work and earning property as a result of work.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, "Ideas of Slavery from Aristotle to Augustine"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kid 11b, Kid 14b (note 13), Ar. 1:2, Shek. 1:5, Pes. 8:2, 88b, Yev. 66a, Yev. 7:1, BK 11:1, BB 51b–52a, Sanh. 91a, 105a, Ket. 28a, Meg. 16a&lt;/ref&gt; While the Talmud affirmed that self-redemption of slaves (Jewish or not) was always permitted, it noted that conditionless manumission by the owner was generally a violation of legal precept.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p 620, citing Gitten 45b&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}  The Talmud however, also included a varied list of circumstances and conditions that overrode this principle and mandated manumission. Conditions such as ill-treatment, oral promise, marriage to a free-woman, escape, inclusion in religious ceremony, and desire to visit the Holy Land all required the master to provide the slave with a deed of manumission, presented to him with witnesses. Failure to comply would result in excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

It is apparent that Jews still owned Jewish slaves in the Talmudic era because Talmudic authorities tried to denounce the practice&lt;ref&gt;Lev. 25:39&lt;/ref&gt; that Jews could sell themselves into slavery if they were poverty-stricken. In particular, the Talmud said that Jews should not sell themselves to non-Jews, and if they did, the Jewish community was urged to ransom or redeem the slave.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

While Jews did take slaves for granted just as in other ancient societies, slaves in Jewish households could expect more compassionate treatment.&lt;ref name="Goodman20072"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdiKEOTphrgC|title=Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations|author=Martin Goodman|date=25 January 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-190637-9|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female slaves===
The classical rabbis instructed that masters could never marry female slaves. They would have to be [[manumitted]] first;&lt;ref&gt;''Gittin'', 40a&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, male slaves could not be allowed to marry Jewish women.&lt;ref&gt;''Gittin'' 4:5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the biblical instruction to sell thieves into slavery (if they were caught during daylight and could not repay the theft), the rabbis ordered that female Israelites could never be sold into slavery for this reason.&lt;ref name="je"&gt;''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1901), article on ''Slaves and Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Sexual relations between a slave owner and engaged slaves is prohibited in the Torah (Lev. 19:20-22).&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 95"&gt;Abrahams, p 95&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p 61&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Torah allows sex with non-engaged slaves, by clarifying that if she is engaged when the master has sex with her, "they are not to be put to death, since she was not freed" (which implies that a woman's slave status has direct bearing on whether she can be used for sex).&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 95"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freeing a slave===
The [[Tanakh]] contains the rule that Jewish slaves would be released following six years of service, but that non-Jewish slaves (barring a long list of conditions including conversion, or disability) could potentially be held indefinitely. The Talmud codified and expanded the list of conditions requiring manumission to include religious necessity, conversion, escape, maltreatment, and codified slaves' property rights and rights to education.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Gittin'' 1:4, 1:6, and 40b.&lt;/ref&gt; Freeing a non-Jewish slave was seen as a religious conversion, and involved a second immersion in a ritual bath ([[mikveh]]). Jewish authorities of the Middle Ages argued against the Biblical rule that provided freedom for severely injured slaves.&lt;ref&gt;The Bible said a slave should be freed if they had been harmed to the extent that their injury was covered by the [[lex talionis]] - {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:26-27|}}, should actually apply only to slaves who had converted to Judaism; additionally, Maimonides argued that manumission was really punishment of the owner and so that it could only be imposed by a court and required evidence from witnesses. —Jewish Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of slaves===
The Torah and the Talmud contain various rules about how to treat slaves. Biblical rules for treatment of Jewish slaves were more lenient than for non-Jewish slaves&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Leviticus|25:43"&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:43|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Leviticus|25:53"&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:53|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:39|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Talmud insisted that Jewish slaves should be granted similar food, drink, lodging, and bedding, to that which their master would grant to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Furthermore, the Talmud instructed that servants were not to be unreasonably penalised for being absent from work due to sickness. The biblical seventh-year manumission was still to occur after the slave had been enslaved for six years; extra enslavement could not be tacked on to make up for the absence, unless the slave had been absent for more than a total of four years, and if the illness did not prevent light work (such as needlework), the slave could be ill for all six years without having to repay the time.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws existed that specified punishment of owners that killed slaves.&lt;ref&gt;The vague ("Avenger of Blood", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1901.) biblical instruction to ''avenge'' slaves that had died, from punishment by their masters, {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:20-21|}} became regarded as an instruction to view such events as murder, with masters guilty of such crime being [[beheading|beheaded]], see ''[[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]]'', ''Mishpatim'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the other hand, the protection given to fugitive slaves was lessened by the classical rabbis; fugitive Israelite slaves were now compelled to buy their freedom, and if they were recaptured, then the time they had been absent was added on as extra before the usual 7th-year manumission could take effect.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish slaves were often treated as property; for example, they were not allowed to be counted towards the quorum, equal to 10 men, needed for public worship.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakot]]'' 47. [[Sadducees]] went as far as to hold slave owners responsible for any damage caused by their slaves; - ''[[Yadayim]]'' 4:7. By contrast [[Pharisees]] acknowledged that slaves had independent thought - ''Yadayim'' 4:7&lt;/ref&gt;  Maimonides and other [[Halacha|halachic]] authorities forbade or strongly discouraged any unethical treatment of slaves, Jewish or not.&lt;ref&gt;According to the traditional Jewish law, a slave is more like an indentured servant, who has rights and should be treated almost like a member of the owner's family. Maimonides wrote ([[Mishneh Torah|Yad]], [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1363819/jewish/Chapter-Nine.htm ''Avadim'' 9:8]) that, regardless whether a slave is Jewish or not, "The way of the pious and the wise is to be compassionate and to pursue justice, not to overburden or oppress a slave, and to provide them from every dish and every drink. The early sages would give their slaves from every dish on their table. They would feed their servants before sitting to their own meals.... Slaves may not be maltreated of offended&amp;nbsp;— the law destined them for service, not for humiliation. Do not shout at them or be angry with them, but hear them out". In another context, Maimonides wrote that all the laws of slavery are "mercy, compassion and forbearance" - from Encyclopedia Judaica, 2007, vol. 18, p. 670&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Tzvi|title=Torah, Slavery and the Jews|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/305549/jewish/Torah-Slavery-and-the-Jews.htm|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts indicate that Jewish slave-owners were affectionate, and would not sell slaves to a harsh master&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, p 100-101&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} and that Jewish slaves were treated as members of the slave-owner's family.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, p 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are unsure to what extent the laws encouraging humane treatment were followed. In the 19th century, Jewish scholars such as [[Moses Mielziner]] and [[Samuel Krauss]] studied slave-ownership by ancient Jews, and generally concluded that Jewish slaves were treated as merely temporary bondsman, and that Jewish owners treated slaves with special compassion.&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 3-5"&gt;Hezser, pp 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, 20th century scholars such as [[Solomon Zeitlin]] and [[Ephraim Urbach]], examined Jewish slave-ownership practices more critically, and their historical accounts generally conclude that Jews did own slaves at least through the Maccabbean period, and that it was probably more ubiquitous and humane than earlier scholars had maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, pp 5-8&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Catherine Hezser explains the differing conclusions by suggesting that the 19th century scholars were "emphasizing the humanitarian aspects and moral values of ancient Judaism, Mielziner, Grunfeld, Farbstein, and Krauss [to argue] that the Jewish tradition was not inferior to early Christian teachings on slaves and slavery."&lt;ref name="Hezser, pp 3-5"/&gt;

===Converting or circumcising non-Jewish slaves===
The Talmudic laws required Jewish slave owners to try to convert non-Jewish slaves to Judaism.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other laws required slaves, if not converted, to be circumcised and undergo ritual immersion in a bath (''[[mikveh]]'').&lt;ref name="Lewis, p 8-9"&gt;Lewis, p 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 41&lt;/ref&gt; A 4th century Roman law prevented the circumcision of non-Jewish slaves, so the practice may have declined at that time,&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; but increased again after the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 99"&gt;Abrahams, p 99&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Jewish slave owners were not permitted to drink wine that had been touched by an uncircumcised person so there was always a practical need, in addition to the legal requirement, to circumcise slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

Although conversion to Judaism was a possibility for slaves, rabbinic authorities Maimonides and Karo discouraged it on the basis that Jews were not permitted (in their time) to proselytise;&lt;ref name="je" /&gt; slave owners could enter into special contracts by which they agree not to convert their slaves.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt; Furthermore, to convert a slave into Judaism without the owner's permission was seen as causing harm to the owner, on the basis that it would rob the owner of the slave's ability to work during the Sabbath, and it would prevent them from selling the slave to non-Jews.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt;

===Jewish slaves and masters===
[[File:Boleslav of Bohemia and Jewish slave trader.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A Jewish slave trader being presented to [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslas of Bohemia]]]]
[[Christian]] leaders, including Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (served 590-604), objected to Jewish ownership of Christian slaves, due to concerns about conversion to Judaism and the Talmudic mandate to circumcise slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, pp 97, 99&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} The first prohibition of Jews owning Christian slaves was made by [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century. The prohibition was repeated by subsequent councils - [[Fourth Council of Orléans]] (541), Paris (633), [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] (633), the [[Synod of Szabolcs]] (1092) extended the prohibition to Hungary, [[Ghent]] (1112), [[Narbonne]] (1227), [[Béziers]] (1246). It was part of Saint Benedict's rule that Christian slaves were not to serve Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Aronius, "Regesten", No. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prohibition, Jews participated to some extent in slave trading during the Middle Ages. The extent of Jewish participation in the medieval slave trade has been subject to ongoing discourse among the historians. [[Michael Toch]] noted that the idea of a Jewish dominance of or even monopoly over the slave trade of medieval Christian Europe, while present in some older historical works, is generally unfounded.&lt;ref name="studio2000"&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Toch |agency= Istituto internazionale di storia economica F.

Most European Jews lived in poor communities on the margins of Christian society; they continued to suffer most of the legal disabilities associated with slavery.&lt;ref&gt;David Brion Davis. ''Slavery and Human Progress'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p. 89 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])&lt;/ref&gt; Jews participated in routes that had been created by Christians or Muslims but rarely created new trading routes.&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], Jews acted as slave-traders in Slavonia&lt;ref&gt;Graetz, Heinrich, ''History of the Jews'', vol iii, p 305 (Engl. translation by P. Bloch)&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} North Africa,&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Baltic States,&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, p 111&lt;/ref&gt; Central and Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt; Spain and Portugal,&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt; and Mallorca&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, p 52&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant Jewish involvement in the slave-trade was in Spain and Portugal during the 10th to 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="Hastings, p 620"/&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Drescher, p 107"/&gt;

Jewish participation in the slave trade was recorded as beginning in the 5th century, when [[Pope Gelasius I|Pope Gelasius]] permitted Jews to introduce slaves from [[Gaul]] into Italy, on the condition that they were non-Christian.&lt;ref name=JE_STO&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=849&amp;letter=S Slave Trade]. [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 8th century, [[Charlemagne]] (ƒ 768-814) explicitly allowed Jews to act as intermediaries in the slave trade.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 98"&gt;Abrahams, p 98&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} In the 10th century, Spanish Jews traded in [[Slavonia]]n slaves, whom the Caliphs of [[Andalusia]] purchased to form their bodyguards.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 98"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} In [[Bohemia]], Jews purchased these Slavonian slaves for exportation to Spain and the west of Europe.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 98"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} [[William the Conqueror]] brought Jewish slave-traders with him from [[Rouen]] to England in 1066.&lt;ref name="Abrahams, p 99"/&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} At [[Marseilles]] in the 13th century, there were two Jewish slave-traders, as opposed to seven Christians.&lt;ref&gt;"R. E. J." xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle Ages historical records from the 9th century describe two routes by which Jewish slave-dealers carried slaves from west to east and from east to west.&lt;ref name=JE_STO/&gt; According to [[Abraham ben Jacob|Abraham ibn Yakub]], [[Byzantine]] Jewish merchants bought [[Slavs]] from [[Prague]] to be sold as slaves.  Similarly, the Jews of [[Verdun]], around the year 949, purchased slaves in their neighborhood and sold them in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Aronius, "Regesten", No. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews continued to own slaves during the 16th through 18th centuries, and ownership practices were still governed by Biblical and Talmudic laws.&lt;ref name="Schorsch, p 63"/&gt; Myriad Hebrew and other sources indicate that owning slaves—particularly women of Slavic origin—was uniquely prevalent during this period among the Jewish households of the urban centres of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ben-Naeh|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halachic developments===

====Treatment of slaves====
Jewish laws governing treatment of slaves were restated in the 12th century by noted rabbi [[Maimonides]] in his book [[Mishneh Torah]], and again in the 16th century by Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] in his book [[Shulchan Aruch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, p 619-620&lt;/ref&gt;{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

The legal prohibition against Jews owning Jewish slaves was emphasized in the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, p 97, who cites Shulchan Aruch, Yore Deah, 267 sec 14&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} yet Jews continued to own Jewish slaves, and owners were able to bequeath Jewish slaves to the owner's children, but Jewish slaves were treated in many ways like members of the owner's family.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, p 97&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}}

====Redeeming Jewish slaves====
The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains instructions to redeem (purchase the freedom of) Jewish slaves owned by non-Jews (Lev. 25:47-51).  Following the suppression of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|66AD rebellion in Judea]] by the Roman army, many Jews were taken to Rome as prisoners of war.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Annals'', 2:85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Tiberius'', 36&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Talmud contained guidance to emancipate Jewish slaves, but cautioned the redeemer against paying excessive prices since that may encourage Roman captors to enslave more Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, p 43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephus]], himself a former 1st century slave, remarks that the faithfulness of Jewish slaves was appreciated by their owners;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews''&lt;/ref&gt; this may have been one of the main reasons for freeing them.&lt;ref name="je" /&gt;

In the Middle Ages, redeeming Jewish slaves gained importance and—up until the 19th century—Jewish congregations around the Mediterranean Sea formed societies dedicated to that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, p 96&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Jewish communities customarily ransomed Jewish captives according to a Judaic [[mitzvah]] regarding the redemption of captives ([[Pidyon Shvuyim]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/GemilutHasadim/Social_Welfare/PidyonShvuyim.htm Ransoming Captive Jews. An important commandment calls for the redemption of Jewish prisoners, but how far should this mitzvah be taken?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184438/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/GemilutHasadim/Social_Welfare/PidyonShvuyim.htm |date=2007-09-27 }} by Rabbi David Golinkin&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''A History of the Jews'', [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote, "Jews were particularly valued as captives since it was believed, usually correctly, that even if they themselves poor, a Jewish community somewhere could be persuaded to ransom them.  ... In Venice, the Jewish Levantine and Portuguese congregations set up a special organization for redeeming Jewish captives taken by Christians from Turkish ships, Jewish merchants paid a special tax on all goods to support it, which acted as a form of insurance since they were likely victims."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]]: ''A History of the Jews''. 1987. p.240&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==

===Latin America and the Caribbean===
Jews participated in the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and owned slaves in Latin America and the Caribbean, most notably in [[Brazil]] and [[Suriname]], but also in [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;"Suriname", ''The Historical Encyclopaedia of world slavery, Volume 1'', by Junius P. Rodriguez, p 622&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, p 60&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in Suriname, Jews owned many large plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, p. 622&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ethnic Jews in the New World, particularly in Brazil, were "[[New Christian]]s" or ''[[converso]]s'', some of which continued to practice Judaism, so the distinction between Jewish and non-Jewish slave owners is a difficult distinction for scholars to make. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Mediterranean slave trade===
{{further|Jewish pirates|Barbary slave trade}}
The [[Algerian Jews|Jews of Algiers]] were frequent purchasers of Christian slaves from [[Barbary corsairs]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Jewish brokers in [[Livorno]], Italy, were instrumental in arranging the ransom of Christian slaves from Algiers to their home countries and freedom. Although one slave accused [[History of the Jews in Livorno|Livorno's Jewish]] brokers of holding the ransom until the captives died, this allegation is uncorroborated, and other reports indicate Jews as being very active in assisting the release of English Christian captives.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, an exceptionally poor year for ransoming captives, the few slaves freed were ransomed largely by Jewish factors in Algiers working with Henry Draper.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, p. 163, No 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic slave trade===
[[Image:Triangle trade2.png|right|thumb|200px|Triangular slave trade.]]
The Atlantic slave trade transferred African slaves from Africa to colonies in the New World.  Much of the slave trade followed a [[Triangular trade|triangular route]]: slaves were transported from Africa to the Caribbean, sugar from there to North America or Europe, and manufactured goods from there to Africa.  Jews and descendants of Jews participated in the slave trade on both sides of the Atlantic, in the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal on the eastern side, and in Brazil, Caribbean, and North America on the west side.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, p 107: "A small fragment of the Jewish diaspora fled ... westward into the Americas, there becoming entwined with the African slave trade"....they could only prosper by moving into high risk and new areas of economic development.  In the expanding Western European economy after the Columbus voyages, this meant getting footholds within the new markets at the fringes of Europe, primarily in overseas enclaves.  One of these new 'products' was human beings.  It was here that Jews, or descendants of Jews, appeared on the rosters of Europe's slave trade."&lt;/ref&gt;

After Spain and Portugal [[Alhambra Decree|expelled many of their Jewish residents]] in the 1490s, many Jews from Spain and Portugal migrated to the Americas and to the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Austen, p 134"&gt;Austen, p 134&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish participation in the Atlantic slave trade increased through the 17th century because Spain and Portugal maintained a dominant role in the Atlantic trade and peaked in the early 18th century, but started to decline after the [[Peace of Utrecht]] in 1713 when Britain obtained the right to sell slaves in Spanish colonies, and Britain and France started to compete with Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST (p 451): "Jewish mercantile influence in the politics of the Atlantic slave trade probably reached its peak in the opening years of the eighteenth century....the political and the economic prospects of Dutch Sephardic [Jewish] capitalists rapidly faded, however, when the British emerged with the asiento [permission to sell slaves in Spanish possessions] at the Peace of Utrecht in 1713".&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the worldwide slave trade and European sugar-growing reached its peak in the 18th century, Jewish participation was dwarfed by the enterprise of British and French planters who did not allow Jews among their number.  During the 19th century, some Jews owned some cotton plantations in the southern United States.&lt;ref name="Austen, p 134" /&gt;

====Brazil====
[[File:NavioNegreiro.gif|right|thumb|200px|Slave ship used in Brazilian trade.]]
{{See also|Slavery in Brazil}}
The role of Jewish converts to Christianity (New Christians) and of Jewish traders was momentarily significant in Brazil&lt;ref name="Drescher p 455"&gt;Drescher: JANCAST: p 455: "only in the Americas&amp;nbsp;— momentarily in Brazil, more durably in the Caribbean&amp;nbsp;— can the role of Jewish traders be described as significant." p 455.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Christian inhabitants of Brazil were envious because the Jews owned some of the best plantations in the river valley of [[Pernambuco]], and some Jews were among the leading slave traders in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert I. Bloom. "The Christian inhabitants [of Brazil] were envious because the Jews owned some of the best plantations in the river valley of Pernambuco and were among the leading slave-holders and slave traders in the colony", p 133 of ''The Economic Activities of the Jews in Amsterdam in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries''&lt;/ref&gt;{{obsolete source|date=July 2018}} Some Jews from Brazil migrated to [[Rhode Island]] in the American colonies, and played a significant but non dominant role in the 18th-century slave trade of that colony; this sector accounted for only a very tiny portion of the total human exports from Africa.&lt;ref name="Austen135"&gt;Austen, p 135: "Jews of Portuguese Brazilian origin did play a significant (but by no means dominant) role in the eighteenth-century slave trade of Rhode Island, but this sector accounted for only a very tiny portion of the total human exports from Africa."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Caribbean and Suriname====
The New World location where Jews played the largest role in the slave-trade was in the Caribbean and [[Suriname]], most notably in possessions of the Netherlands, that were serviced by the [[Dutch West India Company]].&lt;ref name="Drescher p 455"/&gt; The slave trade was one of the most important occupations of Jews living in Suriname and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;"Slave trade [sic] was one of the most important Jewish activities here [in Surinam] as elsewhere in the colonies", p 159, same book 2. ''The Economic Activities of the Jews of Amsterdam in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'' (Port Washington, New York/London: Kennikat Press, 1937), p. 159{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews of Suriname were the largest slave-holders in the region.&lt;ref name="Roth, p 292"&gt;Roth, p 292&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Austen, "the only places where Jews came close to dominating the New World plantation systems were Curaçao and Suriname."&lt;ref&gt;Austen* p 135: "but the Dutch territories were small, and their importance shortlived."&lt;/ref&gt; Slave auctions in the Dutch colonies were postponed if they fell on a Jewish holiday.&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"&gt;Raphael, p 14&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish merchants in the Dutch colonies acted as middlemen, buying slaves from the Dutch West India Company, and reselling them to plantation owners.&lt;ref&gt;Kritzler, p 135: ''While the [Dutch West India] Company held a monopoly on the slave trade, and made a 240 percent profit per slave, Jewish merchants, as middlemen, also had a lucrative share, buying slaves at the Company auction and selling them to planters on an installment plan&amp;nbsp;— no money down, three years to pay at an interest rate of 40-50 percent.  ... With their large profits&amp;nbsp;— slaves were marked up by 300 percent ... - they built stately homes in [[Recife]], and owned ten of the 166 sugar plantations, including "some of the best plantations in the river valley of [[Pernambuco]]"''. [Herbert Bloom quoted in the last sentence]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of buyers at slave auctions in the Brazil and the Dutch colonies were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Wiznitzer, Arnold, ''Jews in Colonial Brazil'', Columbia University Press, 1960, p 70; quoted by Schorsch at p 59: The West India Company, which monopolized imports of slaves from Africa, sold slaves at public auctions against cash payment. "It happened that cash was mostly in the hands of Jews. The buyers who appeared at the auctions were almost always Jews, and because of this lack of competitors they could buy slaves at low prices. On the other hand, there also was no competition in the selling of the slaves to the plantation owners and other buyers, and most of them purchased on credit payable at the next harvest in sugar. Profits up to 300 percent of the purchase value were often realized with high interest rates"&lt;/ref&gt; Jews allegedly played a "major role" in the slave trade in Barbados&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsh, p 60&lt;/ref&gt; and Jamaica,&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"/&gt; and Jewish plantation owners in Suriname helped suppress several slave revolts between 1690 to 1722.&lt;ref name="Roth, p 292"/&gt;

In Curaçao, Jews were involved in trading slaves, although at a far lesser extent compared to the Protestants of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Schorsch. ''Jews and blacks in the early modern world'', p. 61&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jews imported fewer than 1,000 slaves to Curaçao between 1686 and 1710, after which the slave trade diminished.&lt;ref name="Raphael, p 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch p 62: In Curaçao: "Jews also participated in the local and regional trading of slaves"&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1630 and 1770, Jewish merchants settled or handled "at least 15,000 slaves" who landed in [[Curaçao]], about one-sixth of the total Dutch slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, JANCAST, p 450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cnaan|first1=Liphshiz|last2=Tzur|first2=Iris|title=How culpable were Dutch Jews in the slave trade?|url=http://www.jta.org/2013/12/26/news-opinion/world/dutch-rabbi-confronts-jews-with-ancestors-complicity-in-slavery#ixzz326RoIrWQ|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Slavery in the colonial United States}}
The Jewish role in the American slave trade was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Jacob R. Marcus of Hebrew Union College in The Colonial American Jew (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1970), Vol. 2, pp. 702-703&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian and rabbi [[Bertram Korn]], there were Jewish owners of plantations, but altogether they constituted only a tiny proportion of the industry.&lt;ref name="Korn"&gt;Bertram W. Korn, "Jews and Negro Slavery in the Old South, 1789-1865", in ''The Jewish Experience in America'', ed. Abraham J. Karp (Waltham, MA: American Jewish Historical Society, 1969), Vol. 3, p. 180 &lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;:&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830 there were only four Jews among the 11,000 Southerners who owned fifty or more slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Facts vs. Antisemitic Fictions: The Truth About Jews, Blacks, Slavery, Racism and Civil Rights'' (prepared under the auspices of the Simon Wiesenthal Center by Dr. Harold Brackman and Professor Mary R. Lefkowitz; 1993)&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the shipping ports in Colonial America, only in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] did Jewish merchants play a significant part in the slave-trade.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, EAJH. Vol 1 (p 415), Newport, RI: "Newport [Rhode Island] was the leading African slaving port during the eighteenth century and the only port in which Jewish merchants played a significant part. At the peak period of their participation in slaving expeditions (the generation before the Am. Revolution), Newport's Jewish merchants handled up to 10 percent of the Rhode Island slave trade. Incomplete records for other eighteenth-century ports in which Jews participated in the slave trade in any way show that for a few years they held at least partial shares in up to 8 percent of New York's small number of slaving voyages, usually from African to Caribbean ports.&lt;/ref&gt;

A table of the commissions of brokers in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], shows that one Jewish brokerage accounted for 4% of the commissions. According to Bertram Korn, Jews accounted for 4 of the 44 slave-brokers in Charleston, three of 70 in Richmond, and 1 of 12 in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, EAJ. Vol 1 (p 415): internal traffic within US (Korn 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; However the proportion of Jewish residents of Charleston who owned slaves was similar to that of the general white population (83% versus 87% in 1830).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Susanna Ashton | title = Slaves of Charleston | newspaper = [[The Forward]] | date = September 12, 2014 | url = http://forward.com/articles/205455/slaves-of-charleston/?p=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosworth, 1853&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information on Jacob Levin found at ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'', by Saul S. Friedman, p 157&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historian [[Seymour Drescher]] emphasized the problems of determining whether or not slave-traders were Jewish.  He concludes that [[New Christian]] merchants managed to gain control of a sizeable share of all segments of the Portuguese Atlantic slave trade during the Iberian-dominated phase of the Atlantic system. Due to forcible conversions of Jews to Christianity many New Christians continued to [[Crypto-Jews|practice Judaism in secret]], meaning it is impossible for historians to determine what portion of these slave traders were Jewish, because to do so would require the historian to choose one of several definitions of "Jewish".&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, p 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST: p 447: "New Christian merchants managed to gain control of a sizeable, perhaps major, share of all segments of the Portuguese Atlantic slave trade during the Iberian-dominated phase of the Atlantic system. I have come across no description of the Portuguese slave trade that estimates the relative shares of the various participants in the slave trade by the racial-religious designation, but New Christian families certainly oversaw the movement of a vast number of slaves from Africa to Brazil during its first-century period [1600-1700]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Common criticisms included the fact that the book used selective quotes, made "crude use of statistics",&lt;ref name="Austen, p 134"/&gt; and was purposefully trying to exaggerate the role of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, pp 133-34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) criticized the NOI and the book.&lt;ref name="adl.org"/&gt; [[Henry Louis Gates Jr]] criticized the book's intention and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;"Black Demagogues and Pseuo-Scholars", ''New York Times'', July 20, 2002, p A15.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Antisemitism}}
Historian Ralph A. Austen heavily criticized the book and said that although the book may seem fairly accurate, it is an anti-Semitic book.  However, he added that before the publication of ''The Secret Relationship'', some scholars were reluctant to discuss Jewish involvement in slavery because of fear of damaging the "shared liberal agenda" of Jews and African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, pp 131-135&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, Austen found the book's aims of challenging the myth of universal Jewish benevolence throughout history to be legitimate even though the means to that end resulted in an anti-Semitic book.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, p. 131: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[[John Hope Franklin]] and I ... were condoning a benign historical myth: that the shared liberal agenda of twentieth-century Blacks and Jews has a pedigree going back through the entire remembered past. ... Jewish students of Jewish history have known it was untrue and ... have produced a significant body of scholarship detailing the involvement of our ancestors in the Atlantic slave trade and Pan-American slavery.  [The scholarship] had never been synthesized in a publication for non-scholarly audience.  A book of this sort has now appeared, however, written not by Jews but by an anonymous group of African Americans associated with the Reverend Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later assessments====
The publication of ''The Secret Relationship'' spurred detailed research into the participation of Jews in the Atlantic slave trade, resulting in the publication of the following works, most of which were published specifically to refute the thesis of ''The Secret Relationship'':
* 1992 - Harold Brackman, ''Jew on the brain: A public refutation of the Nation of Islam's The Secret relationship between Blacks and Jews''
* 1992 - [[David Brion Davis]], "Jews in the Slave Trade", in ''Culturefront'' (Fall 1 992) pp 42–45
* 1993 - [[Seymour Drescher]], "The Role of Jews in the Atlantic Slave Trade", ''Immigrants and Minorities'', 12 (1993), pp 113–25
* 1993 - Marc Caplan, ''Jew-Hatred As History: An Analysis of the Nation of Islam's "The Secret Relationship"'' (published by the [[Anti Defamation League]])
* 1998 - Eli Faber, ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'',  New York University Press
* 1999 - Saul S. Friedman, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'', Transaction

Most post-1991 scholars that analysed the role of Jews only identified certain regions (such as Brazil and the Caribbean) where the participation was "significant".&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST:  p 455: "only in the Americas&amp;nbsp;— momentarily in Brazil, more durably in the Caribbean&amp;nbsp;— can the role of Jewish traders be described as significant." .. but elsewhere involvemnent was modest or minimal p 455.&lt;/ref&gt; Wim Klooster wrote: "In no period did Jews play a leading role as financiers, shipowners, or factors in the transatlantic or Caribbean slave trades. They possessed far fewer slaves than non-Jews in every British territory in North America and the Caribbean. Even when Jews in a handful of places owned slaves in proportions slightly above their representation among a town's families, such cases do not come close to corroborating the assertions of ''The Secret Relationship''".&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt;

David Brion Davis wrote that "Jews had no major or continuing impact on the history of New World slavery."&lt;ref&gt;"Medieval Christians greatly exaggerated the supposed Jewish control over trade and finance and also became obsessed with alleged Jewish plots to enslave, convert, or sell  non-Jews ... Most European Jews lived in poor communities on the margins of Christian society; they continued to suffer most of the legal disabilities associated with slavery. ... Whatever Jewish refugees from Brazil may have contributed to the northwestward expansion of sugar and slaves, it is clear that Jews had no major or continuing impact on the history of New World slavery." - Professor David Brion Davis of Yale University in ''Slavery and Human Progress'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), p 89 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob R. Marcus wrote that Jewish participation in the American Colonies was "minimal" and inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;"The Jews of Newport seem not to have pursued the [slave trading] business consistently ... [When] we compare the number of vessels employed in the traffic by all merchants with the number sent to the African coast by Jewish traders ... we can see that the Jewish participation was minimal. It may be safely assumed that over a period of years American Jewish businessmen were accountable for considerably less than two percent of the slave imports into the West Indies" - Professor Jacob R. Marcus of Hebrew Union College in ''The Colonial American Jew'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1970), Vol. 2, pp. 702-03 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts Shofar FTP Archive File: orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertram Korn]] wrote "all of the Jewish slavetraders in all of the Southern cities and towns combined did not buy and sell as many slaves as did the firm of [[Franklin and Armfield Office|Franklin and Armfield]], the largest Negro traders in the South."&lt;ref&gt;"None of the major slavetraders was Jewish, nor did Jews constitute a large proportion in any particular community. ... probably all of the Jewish slavetraders in all of the Southern cities and towns combined did not buy and sell as many slaves as did the firm of Franklin and Armfield, the largest Negro traders in the South." - Bertram W. Korn. ''Jews and Negro Slavery in the Old South, 1789–1865'', in ''The Jewish Experience in America'', ed. Abraham J. Karp (Waltham, Massachusetts: American Jewish Historical Society, 1969), Vol 3, pp 197-98 (cited in [http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/american/wiesenthal.center/ftp.py?orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts] Shofar FTP Archive File at [http://orgs/american/wiesenthal.center//web/historical-facts]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a review in ''[[The Journal of American History]]'' of both ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight''  and ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'': "Faber acknowledges the few merchants of Jewish background locally prominent in slaving during the second half of the eighteenth century but otherwise confirms the small-to-minuscule size of colonial Jewish communities of any sort and shows them engaged in slaving and slave holding only to degrees indistinguishable from those of their English competitors."&lt;ref&gt;"Eli Faber takes a quantitative approach to Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade in Britain's Atlantic empire, starting with the arrival of Sephardic Jews in the London resettlement of the 1650s, calculating their participation in the trading companies of the late seventeenth century, and then using a solid range of standard quantitative sources (Naval Office shipping lists, censuses, tax records, and so on) to assess the prominence in slaving and slave owning of merchants and planters identifiable as Jewish in Barbados, Jamaica, New York, Newport, Philadelphia, Charleston, and all other smaller English colonial ports. He follows this strategy in the Caribbean through the 1820s; his North American coverage effectively terminates in 1775.

Friedman. ''[[The Journal of American History]]'' Vol 86. No 3, December 1999&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Seymour Drescher]], Jews participated in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], particularly in [[Brazil]] and [[Suriname]],&lt;ref&gt;Drescher: JANCAST:  p 455:&lt;/ref&gt; however in no period did Jews play a leading role as financiers, shipowners, or factors in the transatlantic or Caribbean slave trades.&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt; He said that Jews rarely established new slave-trading routes, but rather worked in conjunction with a Christian partner, on trade routes that had been established by Christians and endorsed by Christian leaders of nations.&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, EAJH&amp;nbsp;— Vol  1. "The available evidence indicates that the Jewish network probably counted for little in Atlantic slaving. The few cases of long-term Jewish participation in the eighteenth-century slave trades offer evidence of cross-religious networks as keys to their success. In case after case, Jews who participated in multiple slaving voyages ... linked themselves to Christian agents or partners. It was not as Jews, but as merchants, that traders ventured into one of the great enterprises of the early modern world." Drescher, in Ency Am. J. Hist. p 416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, pp 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) issued a statement, together with Drescher, condemning "any statement alleging that Jews played a disproportionate role in the Atlantic slave trade".&lt;ref name="ajh"&gt;Encyclopedia of American Jewish history, Volume 1, p 199&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a review in ''[[The Journal of American History]]'' of ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'' (Faber) and ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'' (Friedman), "Eli Faber takes a quantitative approach to Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade in Britain's Atlantic empire, starting with the arrival of Sephardic Jews in the London resettlement of the 1650s, calculating their participation in the trading companies of the late seventeenth century, and then using a solid range of standard quantitative sources (Naval Office shipping lists, censuses, tax records, and so on) to assess the prominence in slaving and slave owning of merchants and planters identifiable as Jewish in Barbados, Jamaica, New York, Newport, Philadelphia, Charleston, and all other smaller English colonial ports."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jah/86.3/br_19.html Book Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011182743/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jah/86.3/br_19.html |date=2008-10-11 }} of ''Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight'' (by Faber), and ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'' (by Friedman), at ''The Journal of American History'', Vol 86, No 3 (December 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Ralph Austen, however, acknowledges "Sephardi Jews in the New World had been heavily involved in the African slave trade."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph A.

===Jewish slave ownership in the southern United States===
Slavery historian Jason H. Silverman describes the part of Jews in slave trading in the southern United states as "minuscule", and wrote that the historical rise and fall of slavery in the United States would not have been affected at all had there been no Jews living in the south.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt; Jews accounted for only 1.25% of all Southern slave owners.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt;

[[Image:Aaron Lopez.png|right|thumb|120px|Aaron Lopez]]
Jewish slave ownership practices in the southern United States were governed by regional practices, rather than Judaic law.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"&gt;Rodriguez, p 385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg, p 110"&gt;Greenberg, p 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reiss, p 88"&gt;Reiss, p 88&lt;/ref&gt; Many southern Jews held the view that blacks were subhuman and were suited to slavery, which was the predominant view held by many of their non-Jewish southern neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, p 84&lt;/ref&gt; Jews conformed to the prevailing patterns of slave ownership in the South, and were not significantly different from other slave owners in their treatment of slaves.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt; Wealthy Jewish families in the American South generally preferred employing white servants rather than owning slaves.&lt;ref name="Reiss, p 88"/&gt; Jewish slave owners included [[Aaron Lopez]], [[Francis Salvador]], [[Judah Touro]], and [[Haym Salomon]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade;; pp xiii, 123-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish slave owners were found mostly in business or domestic settings, rather than on plantations, so most of the slave ownership was in an urban context&amp;nbsp;— running a business or as domestic servants.&lt;ref name="Greenberg, p 110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reiss, p 88"/&gt; Jewish slave owners freed their black slaves at about the same rate as non-Jewish slave owners.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt; Jewish slave owners sometimes bequeathed slaves to their children in their wills.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, p 385"/&gt;

===Abolition debate===

A significant number of Jews gave their energies to the antislavery movement.&lt;ref name="whiteman"&gt;Maxwell Whiteman, "Jews in the Antislavery Movement", Introduction to The Kidnapped and the Ransomed: The Narrative of Peter and Vina Still (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1970), pp 28, 42&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many 19th century Jews, such as [[Adolphe Crémieux]], participated in the moral outcry against slavery. In 1849, Crémieux announced the abolition of slavery throughout the French possessions.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;

In England there were Jewish members of the abolition groups. [[Granville Sharp]] and [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]], in his "A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade," employed Jewish teachings as arguments against slavery. Rabbi G. Gottheil of Manchester, and Dr. L. Philippson of Bonn and Magdeburg, forcibly combated the view announced by Southern sympathizers, that Judaism supports slavery. Rabbi M. Mielziner's anti-slavery work "Die Verhältnisse der Sklaverei bei den Alten Hebräern", published in 1859, was translated and published in the United States.&lt;ref name="am"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1606&amp;letter=A ANTISLAVERY MOVEMENT AND THE JEWS, Max J.

[[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]] rabbis, including Einhorn and [[Michael Heilprin]], concerned that Raphall's position would be seen as the official policy of American Judaism, vigorously rebutted his arguments, and argued that slavery&amp;nbsp;– as practiced in the South&amp;nbsp;– was immoral and not endorsed by Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strangers &amp; neighbors: relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States|first=Maurianne|last=Adams|pages=190–94|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1999|isbn=1-55849-236-4}}. Adams writes that Raphall's position was "accepted by many as the Jewish position on the slavery question. ... Raphall was a prominent Orthodox rabbi and so the sermon was used in the South to prove the Biblical sanction of slavery and the American Jews' sympathy with the secession movement."&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Yellis, writing in ''[[The Forward]]'', has suggested that "the majority of American Jews were mute on the subject, perhaps because they dreaded its tremendous corrosive power.  Prior to 1861, there are virtually no instances of rabbinical sermons on slavery, probably due to fear that the controversy would trigger a sectional conflict in which Jewish families would be arrayed on opposite sides.  ... America’s largest Jewish community, New York’s Jews were overwhelmingly pro-southern, pro-slavery, and anti-Lincoln in the early years of the war." However, as the war progressed, "and the North’s military victories mounted, feelings began to shift toward[s] ... the Union and eventually, emancipation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yellis|first1=Ken|title=Jews Mostly Supported Slavery&amp;nbsp;— Or Kept Silent&amp;nbsp;— During Civil War|url=http://forward.com/articles/179441/jews-mostly-supported-slavery-or-kept-silent-d/?p=all#ixzz326OPEy5Q|publisher=The Forward Association|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary affairs, Jews and African-Americans have cooperated in the Civil Rights movement, motivated partially by the common background of slavery, particularly the story of the Jewish enslavement in Egypt, as told in the Biblical story of the [[Book of Exodus]], which many blacks identified with.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, pp 3, 268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seymour Siegel]] suggests that the historic struggle against prejudice faced by Jews led to a natural sympathy for any people confronting discrimination. Joachim Prinz, president of the [[American Jewish Congress]], spoke from the podium at the Lincoln Memorial during the famous [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in 1963 where he emphasized how Jews identify deeply with African American disenfranchisement "born of our own painful historic experience," including slavery and [[ghettoization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joachimprinz.com/civilrights.htm Joachim Prinz March on Washington Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/mowprog.htm Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement - March on Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, according to the [[Orthodox Union]],  ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', and the ''[[Jewish Quarterly]]'', slavery (as defined as the total subjugation of one human being over another) is absolutely unacceptable in Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is little doubt that in terms of the Torah’s value system the exercise of power by one person over another, without their consent, is a fundamental assault against human dignity. ... So slavery is to be abolished. ... [God] wanted slavery abolished but he wanted it to be done by free human beings coming to see of their own accord the evil it is and the evil it does. The God of history, who taught us to study history, had faith that eventually we would learn the lesson of history: that freedom is indivisible. We must grant freedom to others if we truly seek it for ourselves."&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Jonathan Sacks|Sacks, Jonathan]].

LSU Press. 444 pages.]&lt;/ref&gt; Patriots used Johnny Reb and his [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] counterpart [[Billy Yank]] to symbolize the common soldiers in the American Civil War of the 1860s.

Johnny Reb is usually pictured in gray wool uniform with the typical [[kepi]]-style [[forage cap]] made of wool [[broadcloth]] with a rounded, flat top, cotton lining, and leather visor. He is often shown with his weapons and with the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Confederate flag|Confederate flag]].

== Summary ==
The first essay by Pankaj Mishra describes that Kashmiris want true democracy and questions the disregard of the hardships faced by the Kashmiris and evasiveness of the Indian intellectuals on this issue. Tariq Ali in his essay "Story of Kashmir" explains how the valley which was once considered a paradise changed into a disputed region. Arundhati Roy in "Azadi: The only thing Kashmiris want" discusses [[Jawahar Lal Nehru]]'s stance on the Kashmir issue by referring to his speeches, letters, telegrams and quotes under the header "Seditious Nehru." Moreover, Roy elucidates what ''freedom'' means to Kashmiris.&lt;ref name="Manisha Gangahar"/&gt; While questioning India's liberal democracy, she criticises journalists for not raising their voice against the human right abuses against the Kashmiri people by Indian security forces. According to Roy Kashmir was never an integral part of India.&lt;ref name="Shahid Anwar"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kashmir: Flashpoint in Pak-India relations|url=http://images.thenews.com.pk/23-03-2012/Special_Report/Kashmir.htm?id=1226&amp;magId=1|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=The News|date=23 March 2012|author=Shahid Anwar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hilal Bhatt shares his experience of a train journey, which was marred by the violence that erupted after the Babri Mosque debacle. Bhatt who lost his friends in the violence during the journey, expresses how the announcement at reaching [[Aligarh railway station]] made him realise the meaning of the word ''freedom''.&lt;ref name="Manisha Gangahar"/&gt; The essay also includes poem by the sixteenth Queen of Kashmir, Habbah Khatun.&lt;ref name="Arifa Akbar"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kashmir, By Tariq Ali|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/kashmir-by-tariq-ali-et-al-6263569.html|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=18 November 2011|author=Arifa Akbar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angana P. Chatterji discusses how the militarisation has affected the lives of the people in the valley in her piece "The Militarised Zone", while Tariq Ali describes his views in "Afterword".&lt;ref name="Manisha Gangahar"/&gt;

== Reviews ==
According to Manisha Gangahar, the book states the ground reality of the Kashmir region.&lt;ref name="Manisha Gangahar"/&gt; Arifa Akbar for [[The Independent]] writes: "This collection speaks urgent truths about the disputed Kashmir region and its struggle for independence (azadi)."&lt;ref name="Arifa Akbar"/&gt;

==Plot==
In 1981, after delivering a speech at the [[Washington Hilton Hotel]] on March 30, President Reagan is [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|shot]] by [[John Hinckley, Jr.]]. Near death, Reagan's life is in the balance in the hands of doctors at [[George Washington University Hospital]]. At the [[White House]] however, there is chaos as [[Reagan's cabinet]] is led by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Alexander Haig]].

==Adaptation==

On September 26, 2015, about a week after the book's release, [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] announced that a [[television film]] adaptation is in the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2015/09/24/National-Geographic-Channel-adapting-Killing-Reagan-as-a-TV-movie/1571443089768/|title=National Geographic Channel adapting 'Killing Reagan' as a TV Movie|publisher=[[UPI.com]]|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, it was announced that [[Tim Matheson]] and [[Cynthia Nixon]] would play Ronald and Nancy Reagan respectively in the upcoming television film.&lt;ref name="Reagancast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/06/killing-reagan-tim-matheson-cynthia-nixon|title=Tim Matheson and Cynthia Nixon join Killing Reagan as Ronald and Nancy|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=May 6, 2016|date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming began in late May.&lt;ref name="Reagancast"/&gt;  It premiered Sunday, October 16 at 8 PM.

== Criticism ==
Following the release of '''''Killing Reagan: The Violent Assault That Changed a Presidency,''''' Reagan biographers [[Craig Shirley]], [[Steven Hayward]], [[Paul Kengor]], and [[Kiron Skinner]], along with a handful of former Reagan aides, immediately began to challenge the book on its factual inaccuracies and historical fabrications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Killing Bill: Reagan aides assail O'Reilly's book, 'Total B.S.'|url = http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/killing-bill-reagan-aides-assail-oreillys-book-total-b.s./article/2573723#.VhbMdKdiyO8.twitter|website = Washington Examiner|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those four Reagan biographers, who had written 19 biographies on Ronald Reagan among them, penned an op-ed for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on October 16 that highlighted what they claimed to be major historical inaccuracies and outright fabrications used in O'Reilly's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = What Bill O'Reilly's new book on Ronald Reagan gets wrong about Ronald Reagan|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/16/what-bill-oreillys-new-book-on-ronald-reagan-gets-wrong-about-ronald-reagan/?postshare=7181445002710500|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-10-16|access-date = 2015-10-22|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = Craig Shirley, Kiron K. Skinner, Paul|last = Kengor|first2 = Steven F.|last2 = Hayward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional criticisms surfaced from officials that served in the Reagan Administration, who were present at the events discussed in the book, yet dispute what actually happened. [[Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr.|A. B. Culvahouse]], who served as Counsel to the President from 1987 to 1989, calls one of the key anecdotes of O'Reilly's book describing a meeting focused on President Reagan's fitness to hold office "a debunked myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A.

In response, O'Reilly took to the airwaves on October 19, responding to the criticism and calling his critics "zealots and jealous people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = O'Reilly Fires Back at Killing Reagan Critics: They Don't Want Us Telling Truth|url = http://www.mediaite.com/tv/oreilly-fires-back-at-killing-reagan-critics-they-dont-want-us-telling-truth/|website = www.mediaite.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called the criticisms "comical," to which Reagan historian Shirley responded "So far, I've written four books on Ronald Reagan, written dozens of articles, given dozens of lectures, am a trustee of [[Eureka College]], taught a course there [titled] Reagan 101, and have lectured at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|Reagan Library]] and the [[Rancho del Cielo|Reagan Ranch]]. [I]t is fair to say we probably know a little bit more about Ronald Reagan than Bill O'Reilly. We certainly know the facts of Ronald Reagan."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reagan experts to O'Reilly: You don't know what you're talking about|url = http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/reagan-experts-to-oreilly-you-dont-know-what-youre-talking-about/article/2574518|website = Washington Examiner|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, [[Edwin Meese|Ed Meese]], who served as Counselor to the President (1981–1985) and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] (1985–1988), penned a joint op-ed with Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation Executive Director [[John Heubusch]] detailed more inaccuracies in O'Reilly's book, saying "we believe that ''Killing Reagan'' does a real disservice to our 40th president and to history itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = O'Reilly's &amp;quot;Killing Reagan&amp;quot;: Fiction, Posing as Biography {{!}} RealClearPolitics|url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/10/21/oreillys_killing_reagan_fiction_posing_as_biography.html|website = www.realclearpolitics.com|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, [[Frank Donatelli]], President Reagan's Assistant for Political and Intergovernmental Affairs, also penned an op-ed for ''[[The Washington Times]]'' disputing O'Reilly's key thesis as another discredited "senility myth" about Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FRANK DONATELLI: Another Ronald Reagan senility myth|url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/20/frank-donatelli-another-ronald-reagan-senility-myt/|website = The Washingtion Times|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More criticisms came from reporters at ''The Washington Post'', who looked into O'Reilly's claim to have "double-sourced everything" in his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = O'Reilly Responds To Critics Of 'Killing Reagan': 'We Just Portrayed Him As A Man,' Not 'As God'|url = http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/28/oreilly-responds-to-critics-of-killing-reagan-we-just-portrayed-him-as-a-man-not-as-god/|website = The Daily Caller|date = 2015-09-29|accessdate = 2015-10-22|first = Jamie|last = Weinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, 2015, about a month ''after'' the book was published, O'Reilly's researcher first reached out to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to obtain a document that O'Reilly himself called a "key part of the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = O’Reilly’s ‘Killing Reagan’ co-author still fishing for key 1987 memo|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/10/20/oreillys-killing-reagan-co-author-still-fishing-for-key-1987-memo/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-10-20|access-date = 2015-10-22|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = Erik|last = Wemple}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, it was reported that Annelise Anderson, the fact-checker that O'Reilly and Dugard commissioned to research and fact-check the manuscript for ''Killing Reagan'', pulled out of the project after realizing that the authors were "distorting" material, in her opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = After reading manuscript, scholar bailed on 'Killing Reagan' project|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/10/21/after-reading-manuscript-scholar-bailed-on-killing-reagan-project/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-10-21|access-date = 2015-10-22|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = Erik|last = Wemple}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[National Review]]'' she further stated, "Why the authors want to present this distorted 'witch and wimp' view of [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy [Reagan]]] and the 40th president is puzzling, especially since an alternative view of the effect of Reagan's near-death experience is so readily available."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Killing the Reagan Legacy|url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/424663/killing-reagan-legacy-annelise-anderson|website = www.nationalreview.com  |publisher = National Review Online|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Will]] called the book a work of "nonsensical history and execrable citizenship." He added that it "should come with a warning: 'Caution—you are about to enter a no-facts zone.'"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/opinion/roger-ailes-fox-news-wrecked-conservatism.html?ref=opinion&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kisan Mazdoor Bahujan Party''' (Peasants and Workers Majority Party) was a splinter group of the [[Jantantrik Bahujan Samaj Party]] in [[India]]. The leader of KMBP was Narendra Singh. In the state elections in [[Uttar Pradesh]] in 2002, KMBP was an ally of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), and launched two BJP-supported candidates. KMBP was part of the state government in Uttar Pradesh around 2002. KMBP joined the [[Indian National Congress]] ahead of the [[Lok Sabha]] elections 2004.

The '''microburin technique''' is a special procedure for cutting up [[lithic blade]]s which yields fragments that can be used in the manufacture of utensils. The usable fragments are basically geometric [[microlith]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Inizan, Marie-Louise; Reduron, Michel; Roche, Héléne y Tixier, Jacques
| title = Technología de la pierre taillée
| year = 1995
| publisher = CREP - CNRS, Paris
| id =  (pages 84-86)
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has been recorded through the [[Old World]], from at least the [[Mesolithic]]. It has also been recorded from the later phases of the [[Upper Paleolithic]], as triangular and [[trapezoid|trapeze shaped]] microliths have been found from the end of the French [[Magdalenian]] although they are very rare. The microburin blow technique has not been found, at present, in the [[New World]].
The technique consists of taking a blade (a [[Lithic flake|flake]] can also be used) and placing its upper end against a support with a sharp edge (as occurs in the use of an [[anvil]]). A notch is then made and enlarged using light blows or by pressing the edge of the piece against the angled edge of the support. The notch is enlarged until the lithic blade snaps with a gentle but positive action ('''[[:wikt:flection|flection]]''').&lt;ref&gt;It is thought that the microburin blow technique was born from the repetition of an accident that occurs when forming laminar microliths. The accident, which causes the unwanted breaking of the microlith, can occur when the blade is subjected to abrupt [[retouch (lithics)|retouches]] on one of its sides.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the technique is carried out effectively, the break should be oblique to the axis of the blade and near to its proximal zone, giving two different pieces: which are called respectively the proximal '''[[microburin]]''', which is the smaller of the two pieces and which retains the heel and conchoidal flakes from the original piece; and the ''trihedral apex'', that is the larger part of the blade. The flexion break is also slightly curved and oblique to the faces of the blade: the plane of the break is curved such that it can be seen in the upper face of the ''trihedral apex'' and its negative can be seen in the lower face of the ''microburin''.&lt;div&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Microburil 1.png|&lt;center&gt;Notch in the proximal zone of the blade, just before the microburin flection&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Microburil 2.png|&lt;center&gt;Product of the microburin flection: a proximal microburin and a trihedral apex&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Microburil 3.png|&lt;center&gt;Creation of a second distal notch by the same technique already described&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Microburil 4.png|&lt;center&gt;Second flection resulting in a double trihedral apex and a distal microburin&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The microburin is a ''«characteristic waste product»'' of this technique, such that no function can be attributed to it (although some authors do not discount that these waste pieces were not later put to some use, this has not been demonstrated irrefutably&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| author = Tixier, Jacques
| title = Typologie de l’Epipaléolithique du Maghreb
| year = 1963
| publisher = Mémories du centre de recherches anthropologiques, préhistoriques et ethnographiques
| volume = n 2 
| number = página 42
| id = Argelia-París, A. M. G.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;), on the other hand the ''trihedral apex'' is the raw material used for the manufacture of microliths, such as '''backed edge blades'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Tixier, Jacques
| title = Le campement préhistorique de Bordj Mellala, Ouargla, Algérie
| year = 1976
| publisher = Paris, Éditions du CREP
| id =  (page 32)
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the trihedral apex is subjected to the technique again until another flection yields another two pieces, known as the ''distal microburin'' (another characteristic waste product) and the central part of the worked piece that possesses a double trihedral apex, with converging fracture lines.
&lt;/div&gt;
This '''«double trihedral apex»''' can then be used to form [[geometric microliths]] (''triangles'', ''trapezes'' or ''lunate-shaped'') following abrupt retouching of both worked edges. Often the retouching does not cover the whole edge and it is possible to see part of the fracture plain on these microliths. This has allowed us to reconstruct with a great deal of certainty the actions of the artisans who made these microliths

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Microburil 5.png|&lt;center&gt;It is possible to form many types of microliths from the same blade&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Microlito Trapecio.png|&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[Trapeze]]&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Microlito Triángulo.png|&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triangle&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Microlito Segmento de-círculo.png|&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[Lunate]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The same microburin blow technique can be used to form other types of non-geometric microliths, such as, for example, the [[tardenoisian|Tardenois tips]].

'''One World Archaeology''' is a book series focussing on archaeology and education about the past. 

==About the Series==
One World Archaeology is one of five book series associated with the [[World Archaeological Congress]] (WAC). Editors and contributors to these series waive any royalties, allowing all royalties to be used to further the work of the WAC. "Publications in the One World Archaeology series contain selections of the papers presented at the WAC Congresses, held every four years. This series developed as an outcome of the inaugural World Archaeological Congress held in Southampton, England in 1986. The subject matter of this series is wide-ranging, reflecting the diverse interests of WAC. WAC gives place to considerations of power and politics in framing archaeological questions and results. WAC also gives place and privilege to minorities who have often been silenced or regarded as beyond capable of making main line contributions to the field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldarch.org/publications/|title=Publications|date=23 May 2015|website=worldarch.org|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other four series are Worlds of Archaeology, Indigenous Archaeologies, Global Cultural Heritage Manual Series, and Research Handbooks in Archaeology

|short_summary =In the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], the mummified body of a black Navy lieutenant is found bolted inside the boiler of a deactivated [[battleship]]. While the cause of death is clear, the officer's identity is not. With nerve raw from the media focus on recent scandals, [[the Pentagon]] bypasses its own investigative service and appoints a commander, Dan Collins, and a civilian, Grace Snow, to conduct an inquiry. Together they resolve to ignore the Navy's political sensitivities and conduct a by-the-book murder investigation. But then they uncover evidence that points back to [[Washington, D.C.]], and a two-year-old unsolved case involving another black Navy lieutenant, who died under violent circumstances. While they search for links between the two deaths, they attract the attention of one Malachi Ward. Cunning, ruthless, well paid, and ferociously resourceful, he will do whatever it takes to protect his hidden client's privilege.&lt;ref name="Official Privilege" /&gt;

|short_summary =In 1961, a [[Navy SEAL]], is dropped off in the Vietnam jungle. Days later, a U.S. [[gunboat]] returns to pick him up, but the boat's young captain, Lt. William Sherman, panics under fire and leaves the SEAL behind. Twenty years later, Sherman is now a Pentagon [[admiral]]. When a woman is found dead in her home, and Admiral Sherman comes under suspicion, Navy Commander Karen Lawrence is assigned to conduct her own inquiry. With the help of a seasoned investigator and ex-Marine, "Train" von Rensel, Karen finds herself confronting a Pentagon hierarchy determined to avoid scandal - even at the cost of the truth. The pressure builds when yet another friend of the admiral is found dead under mysterious circumstances, and it becomes apparent that the SEAL is back, as a sweeper, an intelligence specialist who cleans things up when covert operations go wrong. Only this time, he is on a mission of personal revenge.&lt;ref name="Sweepers" /&gt;

Now, deep within the belly of the U.S. military establishment, one small silver canister of Wet Eye is missing, lost because a career pencil-pusher has cut a million-dollar deal and signed it in blood. For David Stafford, a [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] investigator, finding the missing canister means ripping through layers of cover-ups, bureaucracy, and one man's murderous determination to sell it to an international [[arms dealer]]. But the military would rather silence Stafford than admit a security breach. And now, the only person who can stop a biological [[conflagration]] is an innocent child, who has looked into the face of evil, and seen it with her own two eyes.&lt;ref name="Zero Option" /&gt;

|short_summary =A [[midshipman]]'s six-story fall onto a plaza at the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S Naval Academy]] is initially ruled an accident. The Academy's administration, referred to as the "Dark Side" by the midshipmen, attempts to brush the ensuing controversy under the rug. But a twist complicates what might otherwise be a tidy cover-up, and pulls Midshipman first class Julie Markham into the incident in a highly embarrassing manner. Suddenly there are rumors of [[homicide]]. Her flawless reputation, high academic standing, and athletic achievements make her an unlikely suspect, but her father, Ev Markham, an [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] graduate who is now a professor there, knows the extremes to which the "Dark Side" will go to protect the Academy from scandal. Fearing Julie will be sacrificed to appease the rising public outcry, he hires high-powered attorney Liz DeWinter as [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|NCIS]] begins to investigate. Meanwhile, Jim Hall, the Academy's civilian security officer, finds himself involved in a subterranean mystery of his own.&lt;ref name="Darkside: A Novel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Darkside" /&gt;

|short_summary =When two lowlifes rob a gas station, kill the attendant, and then [[incinerate]] bystanders, the Manceford County, [[North Carolina]], police arrest the killers at a nearby motel. But the judge throws out the case because the suspects were not read their [[Miranda rights|rights]], leaving [[Sheriff]] Bobby Lee Baggett and Lt. Cam Richter to face the victims’ families. Soon thereafter, an [[e-mail]] arrives to the department, in it, a link to a video of one of the killers being executed in a homemade [[electric chair]], ending with a voice announcing, "That’s one." The video spreads across the [[internet]], drawing the attention of local, state, and federal authorities and national media, and putting pressure on the two cops to find the vigilante before he claims his second victim. Assigned to head the search, Cam finds himself resented by some of his fellow officers and threatened by others. His job is further complicated by the fact that the judge is his ex-wife. His questions lead him to a remote mountain area in western North Carolina and a group of [[Stunt performer|daredevils]] who call themselves "the cat dancers"-because they have tracked the last wild [[mountain lion]]s in the area to their dens, where they have photographed the animals, or died trying. Cam must hunt this group and the cats they seek, or become their next target.&lt;ref name="The cat dancers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Cat Dancers" /&gt;

|short_summary =Called upon by a friend, ex-cop Cam Richter agrees to do a favor: investigate the assault of a young woman in a remote area of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. He knows the hills and hollers of the park, and his outdoor skills might break a case that local cops can’t-or maybe don’t want to-solve. He has no idea how dangerous his search will become, because in this part of [[Appalachia]], matriarch Grinny Creigh and her extended family get rid of those who intrude. The Creighs control the [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] trade and own just about everything and everyone in their neck of the woods. But they also operate an enterprise, a dark secret that terrifies any children unfortunate enough to come within their grasp. Blocked by a menacing sheriff with ties to the family, Cam is shut down and sent away, none-the-wiser about why the young woman was attacked or what she saw. He returns, stealthily stalking the Creighs and their secrets, moving ever closer to Grinny’s mountain house and what it might conceal, not knowing that he has been detected, and that the Creighs are hunting him with creatures bred for that purpose and starved into relentless fury.&lt;ref name="Spider Mountain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spider Mountain (reprint)" /&gt;

But when her body sets off [[radiation]] alarms in the [[pathologist]]’s office, suspicion falls on the nearby Helios [[nuclear power plant]], a heavily guarded facility with "supposedly" failsafe security measures. As the FBI, local police, and the plant’s own security investigate, ex-cop Cam Richter, head of the agency that employed the dead woman, begins his own inquiries. He soon finds himself up against powerful forces that will stop at nothing to keep the plant’s problems secret. The most vulnerable part of the plant is its "moonpool"—the radioactive storage pond that cools spent, yet still volatile reactor fuel rods and must be kept full. Racing against time, Cam discovers an inside threat, which will use the plant’s own systems to begin an unstoppable, disastrous sequence of events.&lt;ref name="The Moonpool" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moonpool A Novel" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9360">In social sciences, '''participation inequality''' consists of difference between levels of participation of various groups in certain activities. Common examples include:
* differing levels of participation in democratic, electoral politics, by social class, race, gender, etc.
* differing levels of participation in online communities as described by [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen |first=Jakob |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/participation_inequality.html |title=Participation Inequality: Encouraging More Users to Contribute |publisher=Useit.com |date=2006-10-09 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics, participation inequality typically affects "the kinds of individuals, such as the young, the poor and those with little formal education"&lt;ref name="enumtoNRE"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irpp.org/choices/archive/vol9no7.pdf|format=PDF|title=From Enumeration to the National Register of Electors: An Account and an Evaluation|last=Black|first=Jerome H.|journal=Choices|publisher=Institute for Research on Public Policy|volume=9|number=7|issn=0711-0677|date=7 August 2003|accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who tend to not take the initiative to participate in electoral and related events. State enumeration, such as was done in Canada before the implementation of the [[National Register of Electors]] in 1996, "worked to augment voter turnout among all segments of society and thus mitigated a natural tendency toward participation inequality in electoral politics".&lt;ref name="enumtoNRE" /&gt;

== Political Participation Inequality ==
'''Political participation inequality''' refers to how populations differ in political participation when sorted by various characteristics. Most often these groupings are by social class, race, gender, or ethnicity. Widespread political participation inequality often describes when various groups are left out of the political sphere or excluded from various political rights.

Participation inequality usually helps political theorists determine where democracies fail or when political institutions are not democratically responsive. When political systems are too unequal in terms of political participation, it most generally means that there is a breakdown in the ability of all citizens to politically deliberate to distribute various scarce resources, implement comprehensive public policy, or enact needed social reforms. Nations with high amounts of participation inequality are generally characterized as undemocratic although there are certain nations, like India, where low participation inequality has not helped the democratic responsiveness of Indian institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahuja, Chhibber|first=Amit, Pradeep|date=2012|title=Why the Poor Vote in India: "If I Don't Vote, I Am Dead to the State"|url=|journal=Studies in Comparative International Development|volume=|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Dahl ===
[[File:Robert_Dahl's_Two-Dimensions.png|thumb|Robert Dahl's two dimensions for evaluating democracies/polarchies]]
In his 1971 paper ''Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition'', [[Robert A. Dahl|Robert Dahl]] provided a basic framework to evaluate democracies or polyarchies (nearly/almost full democracies) based on their participation inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition|last=Dahl|first=Robert|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=New Haven and London|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that there are two dimensions: public contestation – the various rights and procedures guaranteed to citizens – and inclusiveness – how accessible these rights are to all citizens. More fully, public contestation describes the necessary functions for a liberal democracy: a competitive political atmosphere, ability to run for office, right to vote, right to assembly, etc. Inclusiveness describes what portion of the population is able to enjoy these rights and procedures.

Participation inequality is usually represented along the dimension of inclusiveness. So, if a nation were to allow only short people to vote, this political system would have a certain level of public contestation – the right to vote being available – and a certain dimension of inclusiveness – only short people being able to enjoy this right. This system of evaluating democracies enables comparisons of political regimes based on participation inequality by comparing inclusiveness between equally publicly contestable political systems.

=== Causes of Political Participation ===

==== Dahlian Causes ====
Using Dahl’s framework, the first cause of participation inequality can be rooted in a political system’s public policy or in the Dahlian dimension of inclusiveness. Policies that exclude groups based on ethnic identity such as old [[Apartheid South Africa|apartheid]] South Africa or Iranian exclusion of Sunni political parties best conveys systemic political exclusion that is rooted in a regime’s citizenship requirements or public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2016/04/29/4452814.htm|title=Political Identity and the Problem of Democratic Exclusion|date=2016-04-29|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Expansion of Dahl ====
[[File:Expansion_of_Dahl's_Theory.png|thumb|An expansion on Robert Dahl's two dimensions by adding a possible third dimension: institutions]]
The more insidious cause of participation inequality stems from a third dimension that has been recently added to Dahl’s two-dimensional evaluation of political systems: institutions. In this framework, '''institutions''' implement political rights and procedures guaranteed by the state. Institutional causes for participation inequality can include literacy tests, extensive citizenship requirements, sparse voting booths in rural or poor areas, and a lack of public transportation. These all affect the ability of citizens to properly exercise guaranteed rights like voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramakrishnan, Espenshade|first=S. Karthick, Thomas J.|date=September 2001|title=Immigrant Incorporation and Political Participation in the United States|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-7379.2001.tb00044.x/full|journal=International Migration Review|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional causes of participation inequality can also be mitigated or exacerbated by cultural norms. Most often high voter turnout usually is hailed as a marker for a democratically responsive nation; however, in [[India]] “the turnout rate among the poor is almost as high as for those who are either middle class or rich. A detailed study of voter participation reported for the 2009 national elections shows that voter participation rates do not seem to vary by income status at all…Recent studies report similar findings from Africa and Latin America (Bratton 2008; Boot &amp; Seligson 2008)”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of these studies conclude that in developing democracies voting acts as a reassurance of social status or worth in the eyes of the state. This cultural norm has not translated to more democratically responsive institutions in that “the governments created by these elections are known to neglect the interests of the poor and treat them disrespectfully compared to other income groups”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nations like India are considered to be exceptions to the general rule that economic status has some bearing on voter participation.

==== Economic and Educational Inequality ====
Economic inequality and educational inequality have often been pointed to as common culprits for political participation inequality. In large part, these two types of inequality are often created and reiterated by political institutions, but most political theorists differentiate these causes for political participation as separate, largely because they are not fully solved by changes in political institutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solt|first=Frederick|date=2008|title=Economic Inequality and Democratic Political Engagement|jstor=25193796|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=52|issue=1|pages=48–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the outcomes of political institutions highly vary from regime to regime, most of the literature finds that high amounts of economic inequality in developed countries depress voter turnout for poorer individuals and increase voter turnout for more affluent individuals (this depends on social cohesion of societies, correlating negatively with affluent political participation when economic inequality is high).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other literature finds that educational inequality depresses voter turnout depending on one’s income level and perceived relative educational status (how one perceives one’s social status and others’ education levels).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persson|first=Mikael|date=March 2010|title=The Effects of Economic and Educational Inequality on Political Participation|url=https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/a47c0359-276e-4a48-9c16-c46bd345968d.pdf|journal=University of Gothenburg Department of Political Science|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polyphony''' ({{lang-ru|полифония}}) is a concept taken up by [[literary theory]], [[speech act]] theory and [[linguistics]] to refer to the simultaneity of points of view and voices within a particular narrative plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belova, King, Sliwa|first1=Olga, Ian, Martyna|title=Introduction: Polyphony and Organization Studies: Mikhail Bakhtin and Beyond|journal=Organizational Studies|date=April 1, 2008|volume=29|issue=4|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0170840608088696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Günthner|first1=Susanne|title=Polyphony and the ‘layering of voices’ in reported dialogues: An analysis of the use of prosodic devices in everyday reported speech|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|date=May 1999|volume=31|issue=5|pages=685–708|doi=10.1016/s0378-2166(98)00093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was introduced by [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], using a metaphor based on the musical term [[polyphony]].

Bakhtin's primary example of polyphony was [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s prose. Bakhtin contended that Dostoevsky, unlike previous novelists, did not provide a 'single vision', or describe situations with a 'monological' authorial voice. Instead, he aimed for fully dramatic [[novel of ideas|novels of ideas]] in which conflicting views and characters are left to develop unevenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saul Morson, Emerson|first1=Gary, Caryl|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: Creation of a Prosaics|date=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakhtin, the chief characteristic of Dostoevsky's novels is "''a plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices''". His major characters are, "by the very nature of his creative design, ''not only objects of authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying discourse.''" (italics in the original)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakhtin|first1=Mikhail|title=Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics|date=1984|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==
;Review of Religious Research
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Sacred Journeys'' is a study of conversion into the Divine Light Mission. It includes follow-up information on persons who remained and those who left the movement. [...] The book represents the work of a well-intentioned, compassionate sociologist living in a town where many important events of the Divine Light Mission were occurring. [...] The book has no great insights, no definitive findings and no challenging hypotheses. [...] He [Downton] skillfully intersperses quotations from the guru with his comments. In doing these things, he achieves more than sometimes in the making of books. ''Review of Religious Research, Vol. 21, No. 3. (Summer, 1980).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1805">A '''secondary predicate''' is a (mostly adjectival) [[predicative expression]] that conveys information about the subject or the object but is not the main [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of the clause. This structure may be analysed in many different ways.

These may be resultative, as in (1) and (2) or descriptive (also called "depictive") as in (3).

:(1) She painted the town '''red'''

:(2) The film left me '''cold'''

:(3) Susan walked around '''naked'''. (Depictive over the subject, or "subject-oriented depictive")

:(4) John ate the meat '''raw'''. (Depictive over the object, or "object-oriented depictive")

:(5) All men are created '''equal'''.

==Alternative views==
Optional depictive secondary predicates are viewed as "predicative [[Adjunct_(grammar)|adjuncts]]" by some linguists. (Huddleston &amp; Pullum 2002)
Within the Role and Reference Grammar framework secondary predicates are not not considered adjuncts because by definition of predication they cannot appear in a periphery. They are treated as connected to the primary predicate via a core juncture with a cosubordinate nexus. (Ullrich 2018)

'''Srivijaya archaeological park''' ({{lang-id|Taman Purbakala Kerajaan Sriwijaya}}), formerly known as '''Karanganyar archaeological site''', is the ancient remnants of a garden and habitation area near the northern bank of [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi river]] within [[Palembang]] vicinity, [[South Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="Indonesia Travel"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Remnants of ancient man-made canals, moats, ponds and artificial islands discovered in this area suggests the site was related with a 9th-century settlement related the [[Srivijaya]] empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = S. Sumatra to hold Sriwijaya Festival | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | location = Palembang | date = June 14, 2014| url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/06/14/s-sumatra-hold-sriwijaya-festival.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several artifacts, such as Buddhist statues, beads, pottery and Chinese ceramics were found in this area, confirming the area was once a dense human habitation.

==Archaeological site==
[[File:Srivijaya Archaeological Park Palembang Indonesia.svg|thumb|left|Srivijaya Archaeological Park located Southwest from [[Palembang]] city center (green). The site forming an axis connecting [[Bukit Seguntang]] and [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]].]] 
The archaeological park is located in Jalan Syakhyakirti, Kelurahan Karanganyar, Kecamatan Gandus, Palembang,&lt;ref name="Indonesia Travel"/&gt; on an alluvial plain of the Musi River near its junction with the Ogan and Kramasan rivers.{{clarify|date=December 2011}} Before the archeological excavation of the site in the late 1980s, the site of Karanganyar was thought to be a potential site for a Srivijayan political power center. However, immediately after the first excavations, the site, with its waterways, reservoirs, and "floating islands" (''balai kambang'') was thought to be more related with the site of [[Mahmud Badaruddin II|Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II]], early 19th-century leader of the [[Palembang Sultanate]]. Mahmud Badaruddin II had acquired the land and had started developing the area, probably to prepare his own burial ground, following a Palembang tradition in which the burial of the members of the royal family were to be done on site surrounded by water flowing into the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]].{{sfn|Manguin|2008|p=4}} Karanganyar site had indeed been occupied in Srivijayan times, mainly in the 9th-century, however the only traces left of this period are a scatter of surface finds of contemporary artifacts e.g. Chinese ceramics, a few layers of ancient brick wall, and possibly one ancient canal. So far, archaeologists has found nothing in the site that can legitimately assign the Karanganyar site to the Srivijayan dynasty instead of to the Palembang Sultanate.{{sfn|Manguin|2008|p=4}} Other archaeological sites to Karanganyar that is related with the 7th - 15th centuries Srivijayan dynasty are the Kambang Unglen, Padang Kapas, Ladang Sirap and [[Bukit Seguntang]], and still for a variety of reasons, identification of confirmed archaeological sites of the Srivijayan period remains ambiguous.{{sfn|Miksic|2001|p=55}}

The Karanganyar site elevation is less than {{convert|2|m|sp=us}} from the surface of Musi river. Located around {{convert|4|km|sp=us}} southwest from Palembang city center or south from Seguntang hill, the site can be accessed with public transportation heading to Tangga Batu.

The site consists of three sub-sites:  Karanganyar 1, 2, and 3. The largest site, Karanganyar 1, takes the plan of a rectangular pond measuring {{convert|623|x|325|m|sp=us}}. In the center of the pond are two artificial islands: Nangka ({{convert|462|x|325|m|sp=us}}) and Cempaka ({{convert|40|x|40|m|sp=us}}). Moats measuring ({{convert|15|x|1190|m|sp=us}}) surround Nangka island. Sub-site Karanganyar 2, southwest of the main pond, takes the plan of a small pond with a small square artificial island measuring ({{convert|40|x|40|m|sp=us}}). Sub-site Karanganyar 3 is a pond located east of Karanganyar 1 measuring {{convert|60|x|60|m|sp=us}}.

Seven canals connected the three sub-sites. Canal 1, identified by locals as Parit Suak Bujang, is the largest and longest, measuring {{convert|3|km|sp=us}} long and {{convert|25|-|30|m|sp=us}} wide with both ends connected to the Musi river. The {{convert|1.6|km|adj=on|sp=us}} long canal 2 is parallel with canal 1, located south of the Karanganyar 1 and 3 sites. The west end of canal 2 ends in the Karanganyar 2 site, while the east end connects to the Musi river. Canal 1 and Canal 2 are connected by the {{convert|700|m|adj=on|sp=us}} long canal 3 that runs along the north-south axis located between sub-sites 1 and 3. Parallel to canal 3 are canal 4 and 5 located west of sub-site 1 with their south ends connecting to canal 2. There are two canals, canal 6 and 7, that connect canal 2 with the Musi river in the south side.

==History==
[[Aerial photograph]]s taken in 1984 revealed the canal network span in the Karanganyar site, confirming some ancient landscape modifications and man-made water structures. The canals compound is located not far from the location where the [[Kedukan Bukit Inscription]] was discovered. Moreover, the Karanganyar site is located not far from [[Bukit Seguntang]], the highest point of Palembang, which is also an important archaeological site containing some archaeological fragments; inscriptions, ancient tombs, as well as an Amaravati-style statue of Buddha.

The government of South Sumatra province renovated the site to create an archaeological park, and the completion of the park construction was overseen on 22 December 1994 by Indonesian president [[Suharto]].&lt;ref name="Indonesia Travel"/&gt; The archaeological park also hosts the [[Srivijaya Museum]], which serves as the information center of Srivijayan history and sites in Palembang.&lt;ref name="BP3 Jambi"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the center of this site there is a pavilion constructed in Limasan Palembang traditional architecture that contains the replica of the [[Kedukan Bukit inscription]] placed in a glass case. The inscription tells the Siddhayatra journey of [[Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa]], considered as the establishment of Srivijayan empire. After having been established for more than a decade, the Srivijaya archaeological park has not fulfilled its expected function as the center of information and education as well as tourist attraction. Because of the lack of information and promotion and poor maintenance, most of the Palembang citizen are unaware of its existence and its function as the center of information about Srivijayan sites in Palembang. All this time both the local government and the people have paid little attention to this archaeological park.&lt;ref name="BP3 Jambi"/&gt; Today, the archaeological park is poorly maintained and only attract a few of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Taman Purbakala Kerajaan Sriwijaya Palembang Sepi Pengunjung | date = 3 May 2016 | newspaper = Sriwijaya Post | language = Indonesian | url = http://palembang.tribunnews.com/2016/05/03/taman-purbakala-kerajaan-sriwijaya-palembang-sepi-pengunjung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological findings==
[[File:Taman Purbakala Kerajaan Sriwijaya - Pulau Cempaka.jpg|thumb|right|Cempaka island, an artificial island in the middle of a pond.]] 
Artifact findings discovered in this area revealed the everyday life of its inhabitants, such as colorful beads, amber, ropes made from [[arenga pinnata]] fibers, brick structure, Chinese ceramics, pottery, and the remnant of a wooden ship. Most of these findings were discovered  during the construction of the archaeological park. Reconstruction of pottery and ceramics fragments revealed daily domestic objects such as a vase, water vessel, bowl, plate, stove, clay pot, and roof. These domestic artifacts suggest the area was once a dense human habitation.

The water structures such as canals, ponds and artificial islands also confirm human habitation for long periods. The people that once inhabited the area probably built these canals for water drainage to prevent flooding as well as water transportation to connect the Musi River with inland areas.

Between 1985 and 1989 archaeological excavation was conducted and discovered fragments of pottery, ceramics, beads, and brick structure. The Chinese ceramics discovered here are dated from [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Song Dynasty|Sung]], [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Qing]] dynasties, spanning the 7th to 19th centuries. Excavation in Cempaka island revealed a brick structure buried {{convert|30|cm}} deep with east-west axis. Other than canals and the small brick structure, there are no significant building or temple ruins discovered on this site. Archaeology experts suggest the lack of building ruins is because the site is located near a large river surrounded by tropical rainforest with no stone quarry near the area. As the result the temple, palace, and houses were probably built from wood and bricks, organic materials that easily decay and were destroyed by frequent flooding of the river and humidity in less than 200 years.&lt;ref name="sumsel.wordpress.com"&gt;

The '''Swedish Emigration Commission''' ({{lang-sv|Emigrationsutredningen}}), was a commission that existed between 1907 and 1913 that was mandated by the Swedish [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] to try to reduce [[Swedish emigration to North America|Swedish emigration to the United States]]. In the 19th century, Sweden had had one of the highest rates of emigration to North America in all of Europe, the third highest after [[Ireland]] and [[Norway]]. By 1910, one fifth of all Swedes had their homes in America.&lt;ref&gt;1.4 million Swedish first and second generation immigrants lived in the US, while Sweden's population at the time was 5.5 million; see Beijbom, "Review."&lt;/ref&gt; The situation alarmed [[conservative]] Swedes, who regarded emigration as a challenge to national solidarity and to the very nation state itself, already seemingly under threat from [[trade unionism]] and the [[international socialism|international socialist]]  movement.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liberalism|liberal]] interest, which had in the 19th century favored emigration as a practical necessity, by now also saw it as a net drain, depriving Sweden of the labor necessary for [[economic development]]. Both camps shared a perception, disturbing in a Europe where the forces of war were gathering, that young, male Swedes were fleeing to America to escape [[military service]].&lt;ref&gt;Kälvemark, 111.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The conservative and [[nationalism|nationalist]] parties proposed dealing with the problem by restrictions, the liberal and [[Social Democrat]] parties by social and economic reform. Despite such ideological faultlines, it was with broad national [[consensus]] that a Parliamentary Emigration Commission was mandated to study the problem in 1907. Led by the liberal academic [[Gustav Sundbärg]], the Commission went to work with "characteristic Swedish thoroughness",&lt;ref name="Barton, 149"&gt;Barton, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; and published its findings in 21 volumes of exhaustive data on social and economic conditions in Sweden and America, together with Sundbärg's analysis and proposals. As Sundbärg put it, to discuss the emigration meant to discuss Sweden in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Barton, 149"/&gt; The conservative parties proposed legal restrictions on emigration propaganda, emigrant agents, and emigration by military [[conscript]]s. In the end, all such authoritarian measures were dismissed by the Commission, which instead went with Sundbärg's goal of bringing the best sides of America to Sweden (unsurprisingly, as Sundbärg himself wrote the conclusions).&lt;ref&gt;Kälvemark, 111, and Barton, 149.&lt;/ref&gt;  First on his list of urgent reforms were [[universal male suffrage]], better housing, general economic development, and a broader [[popular education]] which could counteract "[[social class|class]] and [[caste]] differences."&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is from [[Ernst Beckman]]'s original liberal parliamentary motion for instituting the Commission; quoted by Barton, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Class inequality in the hierarchic Swedish society was a strong theme in the findings of the Commission. It appeared as a major motivating force in the summarized case histories of outbound Swedish emigrants, interviewed in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Liverpool]], which were published in Volume VII. The motif was also typical of the personal documents&amp;mdash;of greater human and research interest today&amp;mdash;which were included in the same volume. Those were narratives submitted by anonymous Swedes in Canada and the US in response to solicitations by the Commission in Swedish-American newspapers. 289 of them were also published in Volume VII, with the individuals identified by initials, state of residence, and year of emigration. Barton warns that, statistically, the response to the Commission's newspaper appeal will be slanted towards individuals with particularly strong views; yet their experiences remain illuminating.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority were enthusiastic over their new homeland, and critical of conditions in Sweden. They describe particularly the grim poverty in the Swedish countryside, the hard work, pitiful wages, and discouraging prospects. One woman wrote from North Dakota of how in her [[Värmland]] home parish, she had had to go out and earn her living in peasant households from the age of eight, starting work at four in the morning and living on "rotten herring and potatoes, served out in small amounts so that I would not eat myself sick." She could see "no hope of saving anything in case of illness, but rather I could see the poorhouse waiting for me in the distance." When she was seventeen, her emigrated brothers sent her a prepaid ticket to America, and "the hour of freedom struck."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Volume VII of the Commission's findings by Barton, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The emigrants also strongly emphasized non-material considerations, such as the exclusion of the poor from the political process, through the restrictive Swedish [[Suffrage|franchise]] before 1907. Bitter experiences of Swedish class snobbery still rankled after sometimes 40&amp;ndash;50 years in America. A man who'd emigrated in 1868 described the disparaging comments he had heard in his youth from the aristocrat in charge of the [[parish]] [[poor relief]], which "gave rise to great bitterness and a large number, among them myself, emigrated to America, which I have never regretted. Here, you are treated like a human being, wherever you are."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Barton, 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the Commission published its last volume, [[World War I]] broke out and reduced emigration to a mere trickle. There was a brief upswing after the war, but from the mid-1920s, there was no longer any Swedish mass emigration. Did the ambitious Emigration Commission have any part in solving the problem? Franklin D. Scott argued in an influential essay in 1965 that it had very little, and that the American [[Immigration Act of 1924]] was the effective cause. Barton, by contrast, points to the rapid implementation of essentially all the Commission's recommendations, from industrialization to an array of social reforms, and maintains that its findings "must have had a powerful cumulative effect upon Sweden's leadership and broader public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8565">'''Taiwan studies''' is a [[multi-disciplinary]] academic division of [[area studies]] (a part of [[East Asian studies]]) focused on studying [[Taiwan]] and the people on/in/of Taiwan both on its own and in comparison with other world areas.

== History of Taiwan Studies ==
As with all area studies, funding and interest in Taiwan studies has largely followed American and other nations' changing political interests. Japanese interest in Taiwan studies preceded significant Western interest in the island and its diverse set of people beginning as a part of maintaining its own [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|colonial interests]] there (Taiwan was a Japanese colony from 1895-1945), and continuing in a post-colonial mode following the handover of Taiwan to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) following its defeat in World War II. An early peak of interest by Western scholars in studying Taiwan occurred following the defeat of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) in the [[Chinese civil war]] and its subsequent retreat to Taiwan beginning in 1947. With [[Communist Party of China|China's Communist Party]] taking power in mainland China, the mainland quickly became off-limits for the vast majority of Western sinologists (exceptions included [[William H. Hinton|William Hinton]], author of Fan Shen). This closing off, in concert with the United States' strong political and military support for Taiwan and British Hong Kong as bulwarks against Communist expansion, ushered in a "golden age" for the study of China beyond China, including increasing studies of "Chinese" in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Following diplomatic shifts of recognition [[Timeline of diplomatic relations of the Republic of China|away from the Taiwan-based ROC]] [[Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China|towards the China-based]] [[PRC]] beginning in the late 1970s and picking up speed with [[Chinese economic reform|China's reform and opening]], academics once again began to shift their focus on China to the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/stevehar/shortCV.html |title=Stevan Harrell |last1=Harrell |first1=Stevan |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Existing reference to Stevan Harrell's CV does not support this claim -- original research?|date=June 2015}} Western academic interest in Taiwan continued at a lower rate with a relatively strong focus on the politics of Taiwan-China-United States relations across the [[Cross-Strait relations|Taiwan Straits]].

Leading up to the [[Martial law in Taiwan|end of martial law]] in Taiwan in 1987, a space began to open up for criticism of KMT authoritarian rule and the beginnings of discussions of a history of the people of the geographic islands of Taiwan. Previous history textbooks that students in martial law Taiwan studied from began history centered on dynastic events in China and only shifted focus to the island the students lived on as the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1947. This [[Taiwanization]] movement suggested instead that it was worthwhile to study the local history of Taiwan itself: a history which included long periods of habitation by [[Taiwanese aborigines|disparate groups of aboriginal peoples]], early colonizations by [[Dutch Formosa|European]] [[Spanish Formosa|powers]], rule by [[Koxinga]] ([[Zheng Chenggong]]), waves of migrations of [[Hoklo people|Hok'lo]] and then [[Hakka]] Chinese people from mainland China, a short period of nominal [[Taiwan under Qing Dynasty rule|Qing "Chinese" Rule]], and a Japanese colonial period all prior to the establishment of Taiwan as the base of power of the ROC in exile. In academia, Taiwanization and [[Taiwan#Democratization|democratization in Taiwan]] brought about a new interest in studying Taiwan and its people without assuming that they are representative of something, or at least of a single something, "Chinese."

Taiwan studies today involves a wide range of disciplines in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] both in Taiwan and beyond it that work to take Taiwan itself as a central subject of analysis. This includes not just work on Taiwanese or Aboriginal groups on Taiwan, but also includes comparative work as well as work that focuses on cross-straits issues and "Chinese" (or Han, Hok'lo, or Hakka) cultures as instantiated on Taiwan. The biggest difference in the latter work is that Taiwan studies scholars who study "Chinese" culture on Taiwan do so with an understanding of the vast range of historical, political, and economic influences on Taiwan's people that have been completely different from those that have influenced "Chinese" heritage peoples in, for example, Hong Kong, Singapore, or the PRC.

'''''The Jurist''''' ({{lang-it|L'Avvocato}}), also known as '''''The Lawyer''''', is an [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas painting]] by Italian artist [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], painted in 1566.

It shows a member of the legal profession, whose facial features are depicted using meat and fish, and whose body is composed of legal documents. Two versions of the painting exist; the first, from 1566, is held by the [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] (Nationalmuseum) in [[Stockholm]] (acquired from a collection at [[Gripsholm Castle]] in 1866), and a later version is held by a private collector in [[Milan]].

Arcimboldo was employed as court painter to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] and was already well established as an artist by the time he created ''The Jurist''. He was known for his innovative style, particularly for his [[portrait]]s in which the subjects were composed of everyday objects. His fantastical and imaginative paintings somewhat foreshadowed the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movement of the 20th century, but were also appreciated as part of the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] tradition of his own time. His series of paintings, ''The Four Seasons'', which depicted the changing seasons as series of portraits composed of seasonal plants, were particularly popular, and he even created a portrait of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] (entitled ''Vertemnus'') in the same style.

The features of the face are represented by the plucked carcasses of poultry and the sneering mouth by fish. It is not known if the subject is a caricature of the legal profession in general or based on a real jurist of the time. The German jurist [[Ulrich Zasius]] is normally suggested as the subject; the Nationalmuseum lists the picture in its catalogue as ''The Lawyer (Ulrich Zasius)'', but [[John Calvin|Calvin]] has also been suggested. Arcimboldo's portrait of ''The Librarian'' (''Il Bibliotecario''), painted the same year, has a more noble aspect, although this portrait too has been interpreted as a parody of librarianship, book collectors, and intellectualism.

'''[[United Nations Security Council Resolution]] 1899''' was unanimously adopted on 16 December 2009.

== Resolution ==
The Security Council today renewed the mandate of the [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force]] (UNDOF), which has supervised the ceasefire between Israel and Syria since 1974, for the next six months until 30 June 2010.

Unanimously adopting resolution 1899 (2009), the Council also called for the implementation of its resolution 338 of 1973, which required immediate negotiations between the parties with the aim of establishing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.

In conjunction with the adoption of the resolution, Council President Michel Kafando (Burkina Faso) read out a statement (to be issued as document S/PRST/2009/34) reiterating that tension in the region would remain until such a just and lasting peace in the region could be reached.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in his latest report on UNDOF (document S/2009/597), recommends extending the Force’s mandate, noting that, while the situation in the Golan Heights has been “generally quiet”, the overall region is tense.  He encourages the parties to resume the indirect peace talks initiated under the auspices of Turkey and aimed at a comprehensive peace, in accordance with the Madrid Conference terms of reference.

He also drew attention to the amount of unpaid assessments for the Force, which stood at $19.1 million on 30 September. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/sc9817.doc.htm|title=Security Council Authorizes Extension of United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Mandate for Six Months, until 30 June 2010|date=December 16, 2009|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic work focussed on ancient Germanic religion, on which he published extensively.

==Personal and political==
Baetke joined the conservative [[German National People's Party]] in 1926 and was a member until 1932.&lt;ref name=Leipzig/&gt; From 1934 until the end of the war, he belonged to the [[National Socialist People's Welfare]] organisation.&lt;ref name=Leipzig/&gt; However, he never joined the [[Nazi Party]] or any of its subsidiaries, including the [[Reichsschriftumskammer|Reich Author's Organisation]], and during the war his election to the examining board of the Faculty of Theology at the University of Leipzig and to the [[Saxon Academy of Sciences]] both went unratified by the regime.&lt;ref name=Lexikon/&gt; In 1946 he joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and subsequently became a member of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]],&lt;ref name=Lexikon/&gt; the official party of the [[Soviet Occupation Zone]] and later of [[East Germany]]. He was a member of the [[Confessing Church]] and was a delegate to the conference of the [[World Council of Churches]] in Amsterdam in 1948 from the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saxony]].&lt;ref name=Lexikon/&gt;

Baetke was married twice: in 1911 to Agnes Kirsten (1885&amp;ndash;1945) and in 1948 to Erna Knegendorf (1903&amp;ndash;2000). Both his wives were teachers.&lt;ref name=Lexikon/&gt;

Accessed 2009-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; is the oldest advocacy group for women in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Reyes&gt;[[Lawney Reyes]], ''B Street: The Notorious Playground of Coulee Dam'', University of Washington Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-295-98853-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has historically focused on [[New York City]] and [[New York State]] issues. Since 2004 it has developed the '''Institute on Women &amp; Criminal Justice''', to focus a national conversation on women and criminal justice. &lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;

Most of WPA's clients in its early years were poor [[Ireland|Irish]] immigrants with [[alcoholism|alcohol dependency]]. While the ethnicity of the clients of the association has shifted over time, the organization throughout its history has dealt with the effects of poverty and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;

==History==
The WPA has its origins in the Prison Association of New York (now the [[Correctional Association]]), founded by [[Isaac T. Hopper]], who had also been active as an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Quaker]]. A task force was set up to investigate the conditions facing incarcerated women New York, and it was established in January 1845 as the Female Department of the Prison Association. Prominent members included Hopper's daughter [[Abigail Hopper Gibbons]] and novelist [[Catharine Sedgwick]].&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;

From the outset, the Female Department criticized [[New York City]]-area prisons as inadequate, urging that "a home needs to be provided for the homeless; other doors need to be open to them than those that lead to deeper infamy."&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt; By the summer of 1845, the Female Department founded Hopper Home, what would today be called a [[halfway house]], focused on training and rehabilitation of former prisoners or homeless. The Home was originally on Fourth Street near Eighth Avenue in [[Manhattan]]; it later moved to 191 Tenth Avenue. In 1874, it was moved to its present building at 110 Second Avenue.&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16261728/alexandria_gazette/|title=The Women's Prison Association of New|last=|first=|date=1874-07-14|work=Alexandria Gazette|access-date=2018-01-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=3|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853, the Female Department separated from the Prison Association and was chartered by New York State as the Women's Prison Association, with Abigail Gibbons as its leader. The association gained influence. Some of its battles—such as against overcrowded jails— have been perpetual, but WPA lobbying has achieved policy and program changes. For instance, female matrons were hired in all state penal facilities holding women prisoners, a separate reformatory for women and girls was established in [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford, New York]], and the policy was adopted that women prisoners would be searched only by female matrons.&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;

In the 1930s, in the face of the economic exigencies of the [[Great Depression]], the Women's Prison Association was the first women's group to call for the [[decriminalization]] of [[prostitution]].&lt;ref name=Reyes /&gt;

After more than a century of operation, the WPA received its first governmental funding in the 1960s; the funding came from the federal government. In the 1980s, Hopper Home was contracted as a federal [[work release facility]], but that contract ended in 1990.&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;

==Current services==
In the face of the rapid increase in the 1990s of the number of incarcerated women, WPA began to develop as a larger-scale provider of more diverse services. Hopper Home was renovated in 1992 as a residential [[alternative to incarceration]] (ATI) program, mainly for women with drug charges. In 1993, the WPA opened the Sarah Powell Huntington House (SPHH), a transitional residence that allows homeless women who have become involved with the criminal justice system to reunite with their children.&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;

In this same period, WPA established a variety of programs for [[HIV-positive]] women involved in the New York criminal justice system. 25% of criminal justice-involved women in New York are HIV-positive. WPA programs include education and discharge planning in the city jail and state prisons, as well as case management services that can providing continuity after release. WPA coordinates inmate-peer HIV/AIDS education and support programs at [[Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women]] and [[Taconic Correctional Facility]].&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;

Based on its successes in this area, WPA began to extend discharge planning and transitional services to women who are not HIV-positive. Their first such program was established at [[Rikers Island]] in 2000. From 2001, WPA has operated WomenCare, a program providing mentoring services to women leaving New York jail and prison systems.&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;

==Other projects==
Other current WPA projects include the Incarcerated Mother's Law Project (IMLP), founded in 1994 and co-sponsored with the [[Volunteers of Legal Services]] (VOLS). South Brooklyn Legal Services and the Center for Family Representation have joined this project. The program provides workshops for incarcerated mothers to aid them in dealing with visitation and family court issues. IMLP began at New York state prisons, but has expanded to women in the New York City jail and to women in WPA's community-based services.&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;

Given the small number of New York City neighborhoods that are the origin of a large percentage of New York's prison population, since the late 1990s WPA has concentrated on one of these neighborhoods, the [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]] area of [[Brooklyn]]. WPA established its Brooklyn Community Office (BCO) in 1999, to address the web of poverty, poor housing, health problems, and child abuse and neglect. The hope is that intensive case management cab break the cycle of substance abuse and child abuse and/or neglect, and keep families intact. The program, which partners with several other organizations, expanded in 2005 to work also in the adjacent neighborhoods of [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] and [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]].&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;

In addition to its locally focused work, in 2004 WPA founded the Institute on Women &amp; Criminal Justice "to create a national conversation on women and criminal justice in relation to families and communities."&lt;ref name=WPA-History /&gt;
