The '''2015–16 Kuantan Bauxite Disaster''' is an ecological disaster which occurred from 2015 to 2016 onwards in [[Kuantan|Kuantan District]], [[Pahang]], [[Malaysia]]. The bauxite mining was blamed for turning the waters and seas red near Kuantan.

==Background ==
Malaysia annual output of bauxite ore has increased from over 200,000 tonnes in 2013 to nearly 20 million tonnes in 2015, becoming the world's top producer and accounting for nearly half of the supply to China's massive aluminium industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bauxite in Malaysia: The environmental cost of mining|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35340528|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuantan, the capital of Pahang, which has a largely unregulated bauxite mining industry ramped up bauxite output starting in 2014 to fill a supply gap after neighboring Indonesia banned bauxite exports in January the same year and to meet demand from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysia likely to extend bauxite mining ban for three months or more|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/malaysia-bauxite-idUSL3N1GK3EI|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the Pahang government revoked the licences of 34 contractors to curb rampant bauxite mining in the area, due to concerns over rising pollution from the activity and only 11 operators would be allowed to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian state revokes bauxite mining licences over pollution concerns|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysian-state-revokes-bauxite-mining-licences-over-pollution-concerns|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleanup ==
As of December 2016, the Kuantan Port Consortium (KPC) has invested an amount of RM30 million to clean the bauxite waste at Kuantan harbour area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bauxite mining moratorium until March 31, 2017: Wan Junaidi|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2104545|publisher=The Sun|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adam Sedgwick''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|dʒ|w|ɪ|k}}; 22 March 1785 – 27 January 1873) was a British [[geologist]] and priest, one of the founders of modern geology.  He proposed the [[Cambrian]] and [[Devonian period]] of the [[geological timescale]]. Based on work which he did on Welsh [[rock strata]], he proposed the [[Cambrian]] period in 1835, in a joint publication in which [[Roderick Murchison]] also proposed the [[Silurian]] period.  Later in 1840, to resolve what later became known as the [[The Great Devonian Controversy|Great Devonian Controversy]] about rocks near the boundary between the Silurian and Carboniferous periods, he and Murchison proposed the [[Devonian]] period.

Though he had guided the young [[Charles Darwin]] in his early study of geology and continued to be on friendly terms, Sedgwick was an opponent of Darwin's [[theory of evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray Spangenburg, Diane Moser, The Age of Synthesis: 1800–1895. Infobase Publishing. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard V. Lightman, Bennett Zon. Evolution and Victorian Culture. Cambridge University Press, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Sedgwick was born in [[Dent, Cumbria|Dent]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire|Yorkshire]], the third child of an Anglican vicar. He was educated at [[Sedbergh School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="CAD"&gt;{{acad|id=SGWK803A|name=Sedgwick, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied mathematics and theology, and obtained his BA (5th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]]) from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1808 and his MA in 1811. On July 20, 1817 he was ordained a deacon, then a year later he was ordained as a priest.&lt;ref name=CAD /&gt; His academic mentors at Cambridge were [[Thomas Jones (mathematician)|Thomas Jones]] and [[John Dawson (surgeon)|John Dawson]]. He became a [[Fellow]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and [[Woodwardian Professor of Geology]] at Cambridge from 1818, holding the chair until his death in 1873.{{sfn|Bonney|1889}} His biography in the Cambridge Alumni database says that upon his acceptance of the position, reverend Sedgwick had no working knowledge of geology.&lt;ref name=CAD /&gt; An 1851 portrait of Sedgwick by [[William Boxall]] hangs in Trinity's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinity College, University of Cambridge|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/search/located_at/trinity-college-cambridge-5846_locations|publisher=BBC Your Paintings|access-date=12 February 2018|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140511164255/http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/search/located_at/trinity-college-cambridge-5846_locations|archive-date=11 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedgwick studied the geology of the British Isles and Europe. He founded the system for the classification of Cambrian rocks and with [[Roderick Murchison]] worked out the order of the Carboniferous and underlying Devonian strata. These studies were mostly carried out in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;von Zittel, Karl Alfred 1901. ''History of geology and palaeontology to the end of the nineteenth century''. Scott, London. p432&lt;/ref&gt; The investigations into the Devonian meant that Sedgwick was involved with Murchison in a vigorous debate with [[Henry De la Beche]], in what became known as the great Devonian controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Rudwick M.S.J. 1985. ''The great Devonian controversy''. Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedgwick investigated the phenomena of [[metamorphism]] and [[concretion]], and was the first to distinguish clearly between [[Stratification (archeology)|stratification]], [[Joint (geology)|jointing]], and [[Cleavage (geology)|slaty cleavage]]. He was elected to Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] on 1 February 1821. In 1844, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter S|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a co-trustee of the will of Ann Sill, an owner of slaves in plantations in [[Jamaica]], in 1835 Sedgwick was awarded half of £3783 in compensation for 174 slaves, following the abolition of slavery by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/24026|title=Summary of Individual {{!}} Legacies of British Slave-ownership|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A liberal Whig in politics, Sedgwick had long been a passionate supporter of abolition. 

==Geological views and evolution==
The [[Church of England]], by no means a [[fundamentalist]] or [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] church, encloses a wide range of beliefs. During Sedgwick's life there developed something of a chasm between the conservative high church believers and the liberal wing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} After simmering for some years, the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by liberal churchmen in 1860 pinpointed the differences. In all this, Sedgwick, whose science and faith were intertwined in a [[natural theology]], was definitely on the conservative side, and extremely outspoken about it. He told the February 1830 meeting of the [[Geological Society of London]]:
:"No opinion can be heretical, but that which is not true.... Conflicting falsehoods we can comprehend; but truths can never war against each other. I affirm, therefore, that we have nothing to fear from the results of our enquiries, provided they be followed in the laborious but secure road of honest induction. In this way we may rest assured that we shall never arrive at conclusions opposed to any truth, either physical or moral, from whatever source that truth may be derived".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1995|p=129}}, {{cite book|last=Sedgwick|first=Adam|title=The Philosophical Magazine: Or Annals of Chemistry, Mathematics, Astronomy, Natural History and General Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3kqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA310|volume=7|year=1830|publisher=Richard Taylor|page=310|chapter=Geological Society, Feb. 19 – At the Annual General Meeting of the Society, held on this day, the President, Professor Sedgwick, delivered the following Address from the chair: –|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a geologist in the mid-1820s he supported [[William Buckland]]'s interpretation of certain superficial deposits, particularly loose rocks and gravel, as "diluvium" relating to worldwide floods, and in 1825 he published two papers identifying these as due to a "great irregular inundation" from the "waters of a general deluge", [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's flood]]. Sedgwick's subsequent investigations and discussions with continental geologists persuaded him that this was problematic. In early 1827, after spending several weeks in Paris, he visited geological features in the [[Scottish Highlands]] with [[Roderick Murchison]]. He later wrote "If I have been converted in part from the diluvian theory...it was...by my own gradual improved experience, and by communicating with those about me. Perhaps I may date my change of mind (at least in part) from our journey in the Highlands, where there are so many indications of local diluvial operations.... [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]] ridiculed [the doctrine] beyond measure when I met him in Paris. [[Constant Prévost|Prévost]] lectured against it."  In response to [[Charles Lyell]]'s 1830 publication, ''[[Principles of Geology]],'' which is known for promoting [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarian geology]] Sedgwick talked of floods at various dates, then on 18 February 1831 when retiring from the Presidency of the Geological Society he recanted his former belief in Buckland's theory.&lt;ref name=herbert&gt;{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=12 170–174]}}, {{cite book|last=Sedgwick|first=Adam|authorlink=Adam Sedgwick|title=Philosophical Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmD_vgEuTiYC&amp;pg=PA313|accessdate=13 June 2014|volume=9|date=April 1831|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis.|pages=312–315|chapter=Address to the Geological Society, delivered on the Evening of the 18th of February 1831, by the Rev. Professor Sedgwick, M.A. F.R.S. &amp;c. on retiring from the President's chair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He strongly believed that species of organisms originated in a succession of Divine creative acts throughout the long expanse of history. Any form of development that denied a direct creative action smacked as materialistic and amoral. For Sedgwick, moral truths (the obtainment of which separates man from beast) were to be distinguished from physical truths, and to combine these or blur them together could only lead to disastrous consequences. In fact, one's own hope for [[immortality]] may ultimately rest on it.

He stated in 1830 that [[Scriptural geologists]] proposed "a deformed progeny of heretical and fantastical conclusions, by which sober philosophy has been put to open shame, and sometimes even the charities of life have been exposed to violation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sedgwick|1830|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834 he continued, "They have committed the folly and SIN of dogmatizing," having "sinned against plain sense," and "of writing mischievous nonsense," "Their eyes cannot bear to look upon" truth and suppose an "ignorant and dishonest" theory.  They show "bigotry and ignorance," of nature's laws and natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sedgwick|first=Adam |title= On the Studies of the University|year=1834|pages=148-153|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Cole (minister)|Henry Cole]] then responded in 1834 in a 136-page "letter," ''Popular Geology Subversive of Divine Revelation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O’Connor|2007|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He referred to Sedgwick's ideas as "unscriptural and anti-Christian," "scripture-defying", "revelation-subverting," and "baseless speculations and self-contradictions," which were "impious and infidel".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|1834|pp=52, 113}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While he became increasingly Evangelical with age, he strongly supported advances in geology against conservative churchmen. At the September 1844 [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] meeting at [[York]] he achieved national celebrity for his reply defending modern geology against an attack by the [[Dean of York]], the Reverend [[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet|William Cockburn]], who described it as unscriptural. The entire chapter house of the cathedral refused to sit down with Sedgwick, and he was opposed by conservative papers including ''[[The Times]]'', but his courage was hailed by the full spectrum of the liberal press, and the confrontation was a key moment in the battle over relations between Scripture and science.&lt;ref&gt;James Secord, ''Victorian Sensation'' (2000), pp. 232–233.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Adam Sedgwick, 1877.jpg|thumb|right|Sedgwick in 1867]]
When [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]] anonymously published his own theory of universal [[evolutionism]] as his "development hypothesis" in the book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' published in October 1844 to immediate popular success, Sedgwick's many friends urged him to respond. Like other eminent scientists he initially ignored the book, but the subject kept recurring and he then read it carefully and made a withering attack on the book in the July 1845 edition of the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''. ''Vestiges'' "comes before [its readers] with a bright, polished, and many-coloured surface, and the serpent coils a false philosophy, and asks them to stretch out their hands and pluck the forbidden fruit", he wrote in his review.&lt;ref&gt;James Secord, ''Victorian Sensation'' (2000), pp. 233, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting the arguments in ''Vestiges'' was akin to falling from grace and away from God's favour.

He lashed out at the book in a letter to Charles Lyell, bemoaning the consequences of it conclusions. "...If the book be true, the labours of sober induction are in vain; religion is a lie; human law is a mass of folly, and a base injustice; morality is moonshine; our labours for the black people of Africa were works of madmen; and man and woman are only better beasts!"&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Adam Sedgwick to Charles Lyell, 9 April 1845, in ''The Life and Letters of the Rev. Adam Sedgwick'' vol. 2 (1890), pg. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Sedgwick added a long preface to the 5th edition of his ''Discourse on the Studies of the University of Cambridge'' (1850), including a lengthy attack on ''Vestiges'' and theories of development in general.

[[Charles Darwin]] was one of his geology students in 1831, and accompanied him on a field trip to [[Wales]] that summer. The two kept up a correspondence while Darwin was on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' expedition]], and afterwards.  However, Sedgwick never accepted the case for evolution made in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 any more than he did that in  ''Vestiges'' in 1844.  In response to receiving and reading Darwin's book, he wrote to Darwin saying:

:"If I did not think you a good tempered &amp; truth loving man I should not tell you that... I have read your book with more pain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly; parts I laughed at till my sides were almost sore; other parts I read with absolute sorrow; because I think them utterly false &amp; grievously mischievous — You have deserted—after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth—the true method of induction—&amp; started up a machinery as wild I think as [[John Wilkins|Bishop Wilkins]]{{'}}s locomotive that was to sail with us to the Moon. Many of your wide conclusions are based upon assumptions which can neither be proved nor disproved. Why then express them in the language &amp; arrangements of philosophical induction?"&lt;ref name=Letter2548&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2548.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 2548 – Sedgwick, Adam to Darwin, C.

Sedgwick regarded [[natural selection]] as
:"but a secondary consequence of supposed, or known, primary facts. Development is a better word because more close to the cause of the fact. For you do not deny causation. I call (in the abstract) causation the will of God: &amp; I can prove that He acts for the good of His creatures. He also acts by laws which we can study &amp;  comprehend—Acting by law, &amp; under what is called final cause, comprehends, I think, your whole principle".

He emphasised his distinction between the moral and physical aspects of life, "There is a moral or metaphysical part of nature as well as a physical. A man who denies this is deep in the mire of folly". If humanity broke this distinction it "would suffer a damage that might brutalize it—&amp; sink the human race into a lower grade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since its written records tell us of its history".&lt;ref name=Letter2548/&gt;

In a letter to another correspondent, Sedgwick was even harsher on Darwin's book, calling it "''utterly false''" and writing that "It repudiates all reasoning from final causes; and seems to shut the door on any view (however feeble) of the God of Nature as manifested in His works. From first to last it is a dish of rank materialism cleverly cooked and served up".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Miss Gerard from Adam Sedgwick, 2 January 1860, in ''The Life and Letters of the Rev. Adam Sedgwick'' vol. 2 (1890), pgs. 359–360.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this difference of opinion, the two men remained friendly until Sedgwick's death. In contrast to Sedgwick, liberal church members (who included biologists such as [[George Rolleston]], [[William Henry Flower]] and [[William Kitchen Parker]]) were usually comfortable with evolution.

==Sedgwick Club==
The [[Sedgwick Club]], the oldest student-run geological society in the world, was set up in honour of him in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;http://sedgwickclub.soc.srcf.net/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Sedgwick Museum==
On the death of Sedgwick it was decided that his memorial should take the form of a new and larger museum. Hitherto the geological collections had been placed in the [[Woodwardian Museum]] in Cockerell's Building. Through the energy of Professor [[Thomas McKenny Hughes|T. McK. Hughes]] (successor to Sedgwick) the new building, termed the [[Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences|Sedgwick Museum]], was completed and opened in 1903.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=558}}

==Sedgwick Prize==
In 1865, the University of Cambridge received from A. A. Van Sittart the sum of 500 pounds sterling "for the purpose of encouraging the study of geology among the resident members of the university, and in honour of the Rev. Adam Sedgwick". Thus was founded the Sedgwick Prize to be given every third year for the best essay on some geological subject.{{sfn|Bonney|1889}} The first Sedgwick Prize was awarded in 1873.

==Sedgwick Trail==
To celebrate the bicentenary of Sedgwick's birth a geological trail was created near Dent, the village where he was born.  The Sedgwick Trail follows the [[River Clough]], highlighting rock features and exploring the [[Dent Fault]].

The '''Adaro''' were malevolent [[merman]]-like sea spirits found in the mythology of the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knappert |first1=Jan |authorlink1= |title=Pacific Mythology |url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1992 |publisher= Acquarian/Thorson (Harper Collins)|location= |language= |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |page=15 |pages=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaro is a unique creature that lived in the Pacific Ocean. The Adaro is very dangerous. Said to arise from the wicked part of a person's spirit, which is divided between the [[Aunga]] (good) which dies, and the Adaro (evil) which stays as a ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adaro Mythology|url=http://www.mythologydictionary.com/adaro-mythology.html|website=Mythology Dictionary|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adaro is described as a man with gills behind his ears, tail fins for feet, a horn like a [[shark]]'s dorsal fin, and a [[swordfish]] or [[sawfish]]-like spear growing out of his head.&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; They may also travel in Jaratep or Daretep [[waterspout]]s and along [[rainbows]] and are said to kill unwary fishermen by firing flying fish at them.

The '''aureole effect''' or '''water aureole''' is an [[optical phenomenon]] similar to [[Heiligenschein]], creating sparkling light and dark rays radiating from the shadow of the viewer's head. This effect is seen only over a rippling water surface. The waves act as lenses to focus and defocus sunlight: focused sunlight produces the lighter rays, while defocused sunlight produces the darker rays. Suspended particles in the water help make the aureole effect more pronounced. The effect extends a greater angular distance from the viewer's shadow when the viewer is higher above the water, and can sometimes be seen from a plane.&lt;ref name="Aureole"&gt;{{Cite book  | title = Colors and Light in Nature| publisher = Cambridge University Press|page = 102|author =  David K. Lynch|author2 =  William Livingston|last-author-amp =  yes| url = https://books.google.com/?id=4Abp5FdhskAC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22aureole+effect%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22aureole%20effect%22&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-02-23 | isbn = 9780521775045| date = 2001-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the focused (light) ray cones are actually more or less parallel to each other, the rays from the aureole effect appear to be radiating from the shadow of the viewer’s head due to perspective effects. The viewer's line of sight is parallel and lies within the cones, so from the viewer's perspective the rays seem to be radiating from the [[antisolar point]], within the viewer's shadow.&lt;ref name="Aureole"/&gt;

As in similar antisolar optical effects (such as a [[Glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]] or Heiligenschein), each observer will see an aureole effect radiating only from their own head’s shadow. Similarly, if a photographer holds their camera at arm's length, the aureole effect appearing in the picture will be seen radiating from the shadow of the camera, although the photographer would still see it around their head's shadow while taking the picture. This happens because the aureole effect always appears directly opposite the sun, centered at the antisolar point. The antisolar point itself is located within the shadow of the viewer, whatever this is: the eyes of the viewer or the camera's lens. As a matter of fact, when aureole effects are photographed from a plane, it is possible to tell where the photographer was seated.&lt;ref name=" Glory from the air "&gt;{{cite web  | title = Atmospheric Optics| publisher = www.atoptics.co.uk|author =  Les Cowley| url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/glorair.htm | accessdate = 2010-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Figure 1''' shows a graph of the behaviour of an ordinary viscous (or Newtonian) fluid in red, for example in a pipe. If the pressure at one end of a pipe is increased this produces a stress on the fluid tending to make it move (called the [[shear stress]]) and the volumetric flow rate increases proportionally. However, for a Bingham Plastic fluid (in blue), stress can be applied but it will not flow until a certain value, the [[yield stress]], is reached. Beyond this point the flow rate increases steadily with increasing shear stress. This is roughly the way in which Bingham presented his observation, in an experimental study of paints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=E.C. |last=Bingham |year= 1922| title= Fluidity and Plasticity| publisher= [[McGraw-Hill]] |location= New York| page= 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties allow a Bingham plastic to have a textured surface with peaks and ridges instead of a featureless surface like a [[Newtonian fluid]]. 
[[File:Bingham2a.svg|thumb|right|302px|Figure 2. Bingham Plastic flow as described currently]]
'''Figure 2''' shows the way in which it is normally presented currently.&lt;ref name=Steffe/&gt; The graph shows [[shear stress]] on the vertical axis and [[shear rate]] on the horizontal one. (Volumetric flow rate depends on the size of the pipe, shear rate is a measure of how the velocity changes with distance. It is proportional to flow rate, but does not depend on pipe size.) As before, the Newtonian fluid flows and gives a shear rate for any finite value of shear stress. However, the Bingham plastic again does not exhibit any shear rate (no flow and thus no velocity) until a certain stress is achieved. For the Newtonian fluid the slope of this line is the [[viscosity]], which is the only parameter needed to describe its flow. By contrast, the Bingham plastic requires two parameters, the '''yield stress''' and the slope of the line, known as the '''plastic viscosity'''.

The physical reason for this behaviour is that the liquid contains particles (such as clay) or large molecules (such as polymers) which have some kind of interaction, creating a weak solid structure, formerly known as a '''false body''', and a certain amount of stress is required to break this structure. Once the structure has been broken, the particles move with the liquid under viscous forces. If the stress is removed, the particles associate again.

==Definition==
The material is an elastic solid for [[shear stress]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, less than a critical value &lt;math&gt;\tau_0&lt;/math&gt;. Once the critical shear [[shear stress|stress]] (or "[[yield (engineering)|yield stress]]") is exceeded, the material flows in such a way that the [[shear rate]], ∂''u''/∂''y'' (as defined in the article on viscosity), is directly proportional to the amount by which the applied shear stress exceeds the yield stress:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial u} {\partial y} = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \tau &lt; \tau_0 \\ (\tau - \tau_0) / \mu_\infty, &amp; \tau \ge \tau_0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

==Friction factor formulae==
In fluid flow, it is a common problem to calculate the pressure drop in an established piping network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Chemical Engineering Fluid Mechanics. | first1=Ron | last1=Darby | publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] | year=1996 | isbn=0-8247-0444-4| chapter= Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the friction factor, ''f'', is known, it becomes easier to handle different pipe-flow problems, viz. calculating the pressure drop for evaluating pumping costs or to find the flow-rate in a piping network for a given pressure drop. It is usually extremely difficult to arrive at exact analytical solution to calculate the friction factor associated with flow of non-Newtonian fluids and therefore explicit approximations are used to calculate it. Once the friction factor has been calculated the pressure drop can be easily determined for a given flow by the [[Darcy–Weisbach equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;  f = {2 h_f g D \over L V^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ h_f}&lt;/math&gt; is the frictional head loss  ([[SI units]]: m)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ f}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Darcy friction factor]]  (SI units: Dimensionless)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ L}&lt;/math&gt; is the pipe length  (SI units: m)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ g}&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration  (SI units: m/s²)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ D}&lt;/math&gt; is the pipe diameter  (SI units: m)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ V}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean fluid velocity  (SI units: m/s)

===Laminar flow===
An exact description of friction loss for Bingham plastics in fully developed laminar pipe flow was first published by Buckingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Buckingham| first= E.|year= 1921| title= On Plastic Flow Through Capillary Tubes| journal= ASTM Proceedings| volume=21| pages=1154–1156}}&lt;/ref&gt; His expression, the ''Buckingham–Reiner'' equation, can be written in a dimensionless form as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \ f_L = \ {64 \over \mathrm{Re}}\left[1 + {\mathrm{He}\over 6 \mathrm{Re}} - {1\over3} \left( {\mathrm{He}^4 \over f^3 \mathrm{Re}^7}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ f}&lt;/math&gt; is the laminar flow Darcy friction factor  (SI units: dimensionless)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ \mathrm{Re}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Reynolds number]]  (SI units: dimensionless)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ \mathrm{He}}&lt;/math&gt; is the Hedstrom number  (SI units: dimensionless)

The [[Reynolds number]] and the Hedstrom number are respectively defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Re} = { \rho V D  \over \mu}, &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{He} = { \rho D^2 \tau_o \over \mu^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \rho}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density of fluid  (SI units: kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ \mu}&lt;/math&gt; is the dynamic viscosity of fluid  (SI units: kg/m s)
* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ \tau_o}&lt;/math&gt; is the yield point (yield strength) of fluid  (SI units: MPa)

===Turbulent flow===
Darby and Melson developed an empirical expression &lt;ref name=Darby&gt;Darby, R. and Melson J.(1981). "How to predict the friction factor for flow of Bingham plastics". ''Chemical Engineering'' '''28''': 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;
that was then refined, and is given by:&lt;ref name=Darbyetal&gt;{{cite journal| last=Darby| first= R. |date= September 1992| title= Prediction friction loss in slurry pipes| journal= Chemical Engineering |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f_T = 4*10^a \mathrm{Re}^{-0.193} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

* &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf \ f_T}&lt;/math&gt; is the turbulent flow friction factor (SI units: dimensionless)
* &lt;math&gt; a = -1.47\left[1 + 0.146 e^{-2.9\times {10^{-5}}\mathrm{He}} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
Note: Darby and Melson's expression is for a Fanning friction factor, and needs to be multiplied by 4 to be used in the friction loss equations located elsewhere on this page.

==Approximations of the Buckingham–Reiner equation==
Although an exact analytical solution of the Buckingham–Reiner equation can be obtained because it is a fourth order polynomial equation in ''f'', due to complexity of the solution it is rarely employed. Therefore, researchers have tried to develop explicit approximations for the Buckingham–Reiner equation.

===Swamee–Aggarwal equation===
The Swamee–Aggarwal equation is used to solve directly for the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor ''f'' for laminar flow of Bingham plastic fluids.&lt;ref&gt;Swamee, P.K. and Aggarwal, N.(2011). "Explicit equations for laminar flow of Bingham plastic fluids". ''Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering''. {{doi|10.1016/j.petrol.2011.01.015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approximation of the implicit ''Buckingham–Reiner'' equation, but the discrepancy from experimental data is well within the accuracy of the data.
The Swamee–Aggarwal equation is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; f_L = {64 \over \mathrm{Re}} + {64 \over \mathrm{Re}} \left( {\mathrm{He}\over 6.2218 \mathrm{Re}}\right)^{0.958}&lt;/math&gt;

===Danish–Kumar solution===
Danish ''et al.'' have provided an explicit procedure to calculate the friction factor ''f'' by using the Adomian decomposition method.&lt;ref&gt;Danish, M. ''et al.'' (1981). "Approximate explicit analytical expressions of friction factor for flow
of Bingham fluids in smooth pipes using Adomian decomposition method". ''Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation'' '''16''': 239–251.&lt;/ref&gt; The friction factor containing two terms through this method is given as:

:&lt;math&gt; f_L = \frac{K_1 + \dfrac{4 K_2}{\left( K_1 + \frac{K_1 K_2}{K_1^4 + 3 K_2}\right)^3}}{1+ \dfrac{3 K_2}{\left(K_1 + \frac{K_1 K_2}{K_1^4 + 3 K_2}\right)^4}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; K_1 = {16 \over \mathrm{Re}} + {16 \mathrm{He} \over 6\mathrm{Re}^2},&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; K_2 = - {16 \mathrm{He}^4 \over 3\mathrm{Re}^8}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Combined equation for friction factor for all flow regimes==

===Darby–Melson equation===
In 1981, Darby and Melson, using the approach of Churchill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Churchill| first=S.W. |date= November 7, 1977| title= Friction factor equation spans all fluid-flow regimes| journal= Chemical Engineering| pages= 91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of Churchill and Usagi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Churchill| first1=S.W. |last2= Usagi| first2= R.A. |year= 1972| title= A general expression for the correlation of rates of transfer and other phenomena| journal= AIChE Journal| volume= 18| number=6| pages= 1121–1128| doi=10.1002/aic.690180606}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an expression to get a single friction factor equation valid for all flow regimes:&lt;ref name=Darby/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; f = \left[{f_L}^m + {f_T}^m \right]^{1/m}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt; m = 1.7 + {40000\over \mathrm{Re}} &lt;/math&gt;

Both Swamee–Aggarwal equation and the Darby–Melson equation can be combined to give an explicit equation for determining the friction factor of Bingham plastic fluids in any regime. Relative roughness is not a parameter in any of the equations because the friction factor of Bingham plastic fluids is not sensitive to pipe roughness.

==Etymology==
The term ''biological diversity'' was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist Raymond F. Dasmann in the year 1968 lay book ''A Different Kind of Country''&lt;ref name="Dasmann1968"&gt;{{cite book|first=Raymond Fredric |last=Dasmann|title=A Different Kind of Country|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DgM2jwEACAAJ}}|year=1968|publisher=Collier Books|isbn=978-0-02-072810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating conservation. The term was widely adopted only after more than a decade, when in the 1980s it came into common usage in science and environmental policy. [[Thomas Lovejoy]], in the foreword to the book ''Conservation Biology'',&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80&gt;{{cite book |author1=Soulé, Michael E. |author2=Wilcox, Bruce A. |title=Conservation biology: an evolutionary-ecological perspective |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-87893-800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term to the scientific community. Until then the term "natural diversity" was common, introduced by The Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] in an important 1975 study, "The Preservation of Natural Diversity." By the early 1980s TNC's Science program and its head, Robert E. Jenkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/aboutus/index.htm |title=Robert E. Jenkins |publisher=Nature.org |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in America advocated the use of the term "biological diversity".

The term's contracted form ''biodiversity'' may have been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985 while planning the 1986 ''National Forum on Biological Diversity'' organized by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). It first appeared in a publication in 1988 when [[sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] used it as the title of the [[proceedings]]&lt;ref name="WilsonSciences1988"&gt;{{cite book|first1=E.O. |last1=Wilson|title=Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DSGF1xQBYi8C}}|date=1 January 1988|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-03739-6}} [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913154719/http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html |date=13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of that forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Biodiversity Assessment: Summary for Policy-makers|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VKnimgEACAAJ}}|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56481-6}} Annex 6, Glossary. Used as source by [http://www.biodiv.be/glossary_keywords/B "Biodiversity", Glossary of terms related to the CBD], [[Belgium|Belgian]] Clearing-House Mechanism. Retrieved 2006-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this period the term has achieved widespread use among biologists, environmentalists, political leaders and concerned citizens.

A similar term in the United States is ''"natural heritage."'' It pre-dates the others and is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation. Broader than biodiversity, it includes geology and landforms.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- I've never come across this term--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dfg/dfw/natural-heritage/|title=Massachusetts Natural Heritage &amp; Endangered Species Program|last=NHESP|date=5 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

"Biodiversity" is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and long established terms, [[species diversity]] and [[species richness]]. Biologists most often define biodiversity as the "totality of genes, species and [[ecosystems]] of a region".&lt;ref name="Larsson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor-Björn Larsson|title=Biodiversity evaluation tools for European forests|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=zeTU8QauENcC|page=178}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-87-16-16434-6|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis|title=Intro To Env Engg (Sie), 4E|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=n0FvYeoHtAIC|page=40}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-07-067117-1|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances and presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified:

* taxonomic diversity (usually measured at the species diversity level)
* ecological diversity (often viewed from the perspective of [[ecosystem diversity]])
* morphological diversity (which stems from [[genetic diversity]] and [[Molecular biology|molecular diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Campbell |first=AK |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |year=2003 |volume=40 |issue=2 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00803.x |pages=193–203 |title=Save those molecules: molecular biodiversity and life}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Functional group (ecology)|functional diversity]] (which is a measure of the number of functionally disparate species within a population (e.g. different feeding mechanism, different motility, predator vs prey, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is functional diversity, and why do we care?|url = http://jonlefcheck.net/2014/10/20/what-is-functional-diversity-and-why-do-we-care-2/|website = sample(ECOLOGY)|accessdate = 2015-12-22|first = Jon|last = Lefcheck|date = 2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

This multilevel construct is consistent with Datman and Lovejoy. An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A. Wilcox commissioned by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) for the 1982 World National Parks Conference. Wilcox's definition was "Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...".&lt;ref name=wilcox84&gt;

The 1992 [[United Nations]] [[Earth Summit]] defined "biological diversity" as "the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia', [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and other [[marine biology|aquatic ecosystems]] and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems".&lt;ref name="Hawksworth1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

One textbook's definition is "variation of life at all levels of biological organization".&lt;ref name="GastonSpicer2004"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kevin J. |last1=Gaston|first2=John I. |last2= Spicer|title=Biodiversity: An Introduction|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=lY8rc4bcIDwC}}|date=13 February 2004|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-4051-1857-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity can be defined genetically as the diversity of alleles, genes and [[organism]]s. They study processes such as [[mutation]] and [[gene transfer]] that drive evolution.&lt;ref name=wilcox84/&gt;

Measuring diversity at one level in a group of organisms may not precisely correspond to diversity at other levels. However, [[tetrapod]] (terrestrial [[vertebrates]]) taxonomic and ecological diversity shows a very close correlation.&lt;!-- what does this even mean???--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024| last1=Sahney |first1=S. |last2=Benton |first2=M.J. |first3=Paul |last3=Ferry  | year = 2010 | title = Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal = Biology Letters | url = http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/01/22/rsbl.2009.1024.abstract| volume=6| issue=4| pages=544–7 | pmid=20106856| pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
[[File:Swiss National Park 131.JPG|thumb|A [[Temperate coniferous forest|conifer forest]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] ([[Swiss National Park|National Park]])]]

Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things ([[biota (ecology)|biota]]) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, [[soil]]s, geography and the presence of other species. The study of the spatial distribution of [[organism]]s, species and [[ecosystem]]s, is the science of [[biogeography]].

Diversity consistently measures higher in the [[tropics]] and in other localized regions such as the [[Cape Floristic Region]] and lower in polar regions generally.  [[Rain forests]] that have had wet climates for a long time, such as [[Yasuni National Park|Yasuní National Park]] in [[Ecuador]], have particularly high biodiversity.&lt;ref name=dotearth&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/a-durable-yet-vulnerable-eden-in-amazonia/ | title=A Durable Yet Vulnerable Eden in Amazonia | work=Dot Earth blog, New York Times

===Latitudinal gradients===
{{Main|Latitudinal gradients in species diversity}}

Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the [[Geographical pole|poles]] to the [[tropics]]. Thus localities at lower [[latitudes]] have more species than localities at higher latitudes. This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. Several ecological mechanisms may contribute to the gradient, but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that of the poles.&lt;ref name=MoraRobertson2003&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20013.pdf |vauthors=Mora C, Robertson DR |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 | title=Causes of latitudinal gradients in species richness: a test with fishes of the Tropical Eastern Pacific | journal=Ecology | volume = 86 | pages =  1771–1792 |format=PDF | doi=10.1890/04-0883 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Currie | first1 = D.

In 2016, an alternative hypothesis ("the [[fractal]] biodiversity") was proposed to explain the biodiversity latitudinal gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R. (2016). The fractal nature of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient. Biologia, 71(6), 669-672.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the [[species]] pool size and the fractal nature of ecosystems were combined to clarify some general patterns of this gradient. This hypothesis considers [[temperature]], [[moisture]], and [[net primary production]] (NPP) as the main variables of an ecosystem niche and as the axis of the ecological [[hypervolume]]. In this way, it is possible to build fractal hypervolumes, whose [[fractal dimension]] rises up to three moving towards the [[equator]].

A [[biodiversity hotspot]] is a region with a high level of [[Endemism|endemic]] species that have experienced great [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/content/biodiversity-hotspots | author = Biodiversity A-Z | title = Biodiversity Hotspots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by [[Norman Myers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02240252 | author = Myers N | year = 1988 | title = Threatened biotas: 'hot spots' in tropical forests | url = | journal = Environmentalist | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 187–208 | pmid = 12322582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02239720 | author = Myers N | year = 1990 | title = The biodiversity challenge: expanded hot-spots analysis | url = http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Gwen%27s%20Files/Biodiversity/Chapters/Info%20to%20use/Chapter%207/biodiversityhotspotMyers.pdf| journal = Environmentalist | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 243–256 | pmid = 12322583 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.468.8666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20027.pdf | author=Tittensor D. | year=2011 | title= Global patterns and predictors of marine biodiversity across taxa | journal=Nature | volume = 466 | pages =  1098–1101 |format=PDF | doi=10.1038/nature09329 | pmid=20668450 | issue=7310|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2010Natur.466.1098T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKee2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey K. |last=McKee|title=Sparing Nature: The Conflict Between Human Population Growth and Earth's Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=omgIyInG8qEC|page=108}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=December 2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3558-6|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hotspots are spread all over the world, the majority are forest areas and most are located in the [[tropics]].

Accurately measuring differences in biodiversity can be difficult. [[Selection bias]] amongst researchers may contribute to biased empirical research for modern estimates of biodiversity. In 1768, Rev. [[Gilbert White]] succinctly observed of his [[Selborne|Selborne, Hampshire]] ''"all nature is so full, that that&lt;!--"that" is correct--&gt; district produces the most variety which is the most examined."''&lt;ref name="White1887"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gilbert |last=White|title=The Natural History of Selborne: With A Naturalist's Calendar &amp; Additional Observations|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=q7UOQQAACAAJ}}|year=1887|chapter=letter xx|publisher=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of [[evolution]]. The [[origin of life]] has not been definitely established by science, however some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the [[age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]]. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life consisted of [[microorganism]]s – [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[unicellular organism|single-celled]] [[protozoan]]s and [[protist]]s.

The history of biodiversity during the [[Phanerozoic]] (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the [[Cambrian explosion]]—a period during which nearly every [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[multicellular organism]]s first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as [[mass extinction]] events.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; A significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt; The worst was the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;

The [[fossil record]] suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in [[History of Earth|history]].&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent [[geology|geologic]] sections. Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11353852 | year = 2001 | last1 = Alroy | first1 = J | last2 = Marshall | first2 = CR | last3 = Bambach | first3 = RK | last4 = Bezusko | first4 = K | last5 = Foote | first5 = M | last6 = Fursich | first6 = FT | last7 = Hansen | first7 = TA | last8 = Holland | first8 = SM | last9 = Ivany | first9 = LC | title = Effects of sampling standardization on estimates of Phanerozoic marine diversification | volume = 98 | issue = 11 | pages = 6261–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.111144698 | pmc = 33456 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.6261A | displayauthors = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 9 million,&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt; the vast majority [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref name=heywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100725181504/http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2010 |title=Mapping the web of life |publisher=Unep.org |accessdate=2009-06-21 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 318| issue = 7304| doi = 10.1038/466318a| year = 2010| journal = Nature| volume = 466| title = Does diversity always grow?| last1 = Okasha | first1 = S.|bibcode = 2010Natur.466..318O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary diversification===
The existence of a ''global carrying capacity'', limiting the amount of life that can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea shows a [[logistic function|logistic]] pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods) shows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] rise in diversity. As one author states, "Tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 per cent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase in an exponential fashion until most or all of the available ecospace is filled."&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt;

It also appears that the diversity continue to increase over time, especially after mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biox.stanford.edu/highlight/stanford-researchers-discover-animal-functional-diversity-started-out-poor-became-richer|title=Stanford researchers discover that animal functional diversity started out poor, became richer over time - Welcome to Bio-X|website=biox.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, changes through the [[Phanerozoic]] correlate much better with the [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] model (widely used in [[population biology]], [[demography]] and [[macrosociology]], as well as [[fossil]] biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order [[positive feedback]] (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a [[negative feedback]] arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the [[world population]] growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth.&lt;ref name="pmid18677962"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18677962 | year = 2008 | last1 = Markov | first1 = AV | last2 = Korotaev | first2 = AV | title = Hyperbolic growth of marine and continental biodiversity through the phanerozoic and community evolution | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–94 | journal = Journal of General Biology | url=http://elementy.ru/genbio/abstracts?artid=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and [[stochastic]] dynamics.&lt;ref name="pmid18677962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction, named the [[Holocene extinction event]], caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within 100 years.&lt;ref name="Wilson2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward O. |last=Wilson|title=The Future of Life|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Guosshxltn4C}}|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-45078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, in his ''Biodiversity-related Niches Differentiation Theory'',  [[Roberto Cazzolla Gatti]] proposed that species themselves are the architects of biodiversity, by proportionally increasing the number of potentially available niches in a given ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R. (2011). Evolution is a cooperative process: the biodiversity-related niches differentiation theory (BNDT) can explain why. Theoretical Biology Forum, 104(1), 35-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  This study led to the idea that biodiversity is [[autocatalytic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R., Hordijk, W., &amp; Kauffman, S. (2017). Biodiversity is autocatalytic. Ecological Modelling, 346, 70-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[ecosystem]] of interdependent [[species]] can be, therefore, considered as an [[Emergent properties|emergent]] [[autocatalytic set]] (a self-sustaining network of mutually "[[catalytic]]" entities), where one (group of) species enables the existence of (i.e., creates niches for) other species. This view offers a possible answer to the fundamental question of why so many species can [[Coexistence theory|coexist]] in the same ecosystem.

New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5–10,000 new species each year, most of them [[insect]]s) and many, though discovered, are not yet classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all [[arthropod]]s are not yet classified).&lt;ref name=heywood /&gt; Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in [[tropical forest]]s and in general, land has more species than the ocean; some 8.7 million species may exists on Earth, of which some 2.1 million live in the ocean.&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt;

===The balance of evidence===
"Ecosystem services are the suite of benefits that ecosystems provide to humanity."&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature11148 | title=Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity | year=2012 | last1=Cardinale | first1=Bradley | journal=Nature | volume=486 | pages=59–67|bibcode = 2012Natur.486...59C | pmid=22678280 | issue=7401|display-authors=etal| url=https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/10240/7/wardle_d_etal_130415.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The natural species, or biota, are the caretakers of all ecosystems.

Nebel.&amp;nbsp;''Environmental Science : toward a Sustainable Future''. Eighth ed., Upper Saddle River, N.J., Pearson Education, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

These services come in three flavors:
# Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water)&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;
# Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control)&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;
# Cultural services represent human value and enjoyment (e.g.: landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation and spiritual significance)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daniel|first=T. C.|title=Contributions of cultural services to the ecosystem services agenda|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=21 May 2012|volume=109|issue=23|pages=8812–8819|doi=10.1073/pnas.1114773109|bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.8812D |display-authors=etal|pmid=22615401|pmc=3384142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many claims about biodiversity's effect on these ecosystem services, especially provisioning and regulating services. After an exhaustive survey through peer-reviewed literature to evaluate 36 different claims about biodiversity's effect on ecosystem services, 14 of those claims have been validated, 6 demonstrate mixed support or are unsupported, 3 are incorrect and 13 lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions.&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Agricultural biodiversity}}
[[File:Amazon Manaus forest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Amazon Rainforest]] in [[South America]]]]

Agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories: [[genetic diversity|intraspecific diversity]], which includes the genetic variety within a single species, like the potato (''[[Solanum tuberosum]]'') that is composed of many different forms and types (e.g. in the U.S. they might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes, all different, but all part of the same species, ''S. tuberosum'').

The other category of agricultural diversity is called [[species diversity|interspecific diversity]] and refers to the number and types of different species. Thinking about this diversity we might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different crops like potatoes and also carrots, peppers, lettuce etc.

Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is ‘planned’ diversity or ‘associated’ diversity. This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity. Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged, planted or raised (e.g. crops, covers, symbionts and livestock, among others), which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops, uninvited (e.g. herbivores, weed species and pathogens, among others).&lt;ref name="ecology-of-agroecosystems"&gt;{{cite book|first=John H. |last=Vandermeer|title=The Ecology of Agroecosystems|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AFRQSuQGHiIC}}|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-7153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The control of associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face. On [[monoculture]] farms, the approach is generally to eradicate associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive [[pesticide]]s, mechanized tools and [[genetically modified organism|transgenic engineering techniques]], then to [[crop rotation|rotate crops]]. Although some [[polyculture]] farmers use the same techniques, they also employ [[integrated pest management]] strategies as well as strategies that are more labor-intensive, but generally less dependent on capital, biotechnology and energy.

Interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat. Intraspecific diversity, the variety of alleles within a single species, also offers us choice in our diets. If a crop fails in a monoculture, we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new. If a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year, relying on intraspecific diversity. We may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether, relying on interspecific diversity. Even an agricultural society which primarily grows monocultures, relies on biodiversity at some point.
* The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish potato blight]] of 1846 was a major factor in the deaths of one million people and the emigration of about two million. It was the result of planting only two potato varieties, both vulnerable to the blight, ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'', which arrived in 1845&lt;ref name="ecology-of-agroecosystems" /&gt;

(2009) [http://www.cbd.int/climate/ "Climate Change and Biological Diversity"] Convention on Biological Diversity Retrieved 5 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] (ACSF) at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramanujan|first=Krishna|title=Study: Loss of species is bad for your health|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec10/BiodiversityHealth.html|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=Cornell Chronicle|date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health.

===Leisure, cultural and aesthetic value===
Biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as [[hiking]], [[birdwatching]] or natural history study. Biodiversity inspires [[musician]]s, painters, sculptors, writers and other artists. Many cultures view themselves as an integral part of the natural world which requires them to respect other living organisms.

Popular activities such as [[gardening]], [[fishkeeping]] and specimen collecting strongly depend on biodiversity. The number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands, though the majority do not enter commerce.

The relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic animals and plants and commercial collectors, suppliers, breeders, propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood. The general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual organisms, reflecting their inherent value.

Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to [[Human|mankind]] ''in and of itself''. This idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that [[tropical forest]]s and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tribot | first1 = A. | last2 = Mouquet | first2 = N. | last3 = Villeger | first3 = S. | last4 = Raymond | first4 = M. | last5 = Hoff | first5 = F. | last6 = Boissery | first6 = P. | last7 = Holon | first7 = F. | last8 = Deter | first8 = J. | year = 2016 | title = Taxonomic and functional diversity increase the aesthetic value of coralligenous reefs | url = http://nicolasmouquet.free.fr/publications/Tribot_el_al_2016_Scientific_Reports.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Scientific Reports | volume =  6| issue = | pages =  34229| doi = 10.1038/srep34229 | pmid = 27677850 | pmc = 5039688 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...634229T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity supports many [[ecosystem services]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time."&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In absolute terms, the planet has lost 58% of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2016 study by the [https://www.wnf.nl/custom/LPR_2016_fullreport/ World Wildlife Fund]. The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that "the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago". Of that number, 39% accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, 39% for the marine wildlife gone and 76% for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the biggest hit in [[Latin America]], plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.&lt;ref name="LivingPlanetReport2014"&gt;{{citation|url=http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |accessdate=4 October 2014 |title=Living Planet Report 2014 |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101711/http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study conducted by the [[National Science Foundation]] found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and ''vice versa''.

===Introduced and invasive species===
{{Main|Introduced species|Invasive species}}
[[File:Male Silver Pheasant.jpg|thumb|right|Male ''Lophura nycthemera'' ([[silver pheasant]]), a native of [[East Asia]] that has been introduced into parts of [[Europe]] for ornamental reasons]]
Barriers such as large [[rivers]], [[sea]]s, [[oceans]], [[mountains]] and [[deserts]] encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier, via the process of [[allopatric speciation]]. The term [[invasive species]] is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained. Without barriers, such species occupy new territory, often supplanting native species by occupying their niches, or by using resources that would normally sustain native species.

The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torchin|first=Mark E.|author2=Lafferty, Kevin D. |author3=[[Dobson, Andrew P.]] |author4=McKenzie, Valerie J. |author5=Kuris, Armand M.|title=Introduced species and their missing parasites|journal=Nature|date=6 February 2003|volume=421|issue=6923|pages=628–630|doi=10.1038/nature01346|pmid=12571595|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..628T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Jonathan M.|author2=D'Antonio, Carla M.|title=Elton Revisited: A Review of Evidence Linking Diversity and Invasibility|journal=Oikos|date=1 October 1999|volume=87|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.2307/3546992|jstor=3546992}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=J.

Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=GUREVITCH|first=J|author2=PADILLA, D|title=Are invasive species a major cause of extinctions?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=1 September 2004|volume=19|issue=9|pages=470–474|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.07.005|pmid=16701309}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: [[alpha diversity]]) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: [[beta diversity]]). Overall [[gamma diversity]] may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sax|first=Dov F.|author2=Gaines, Steven D. |author3=Brown, James H.|title=Species Invasions Exceed Extinctions on Islands Worldwide: A Comparative Study of Plants and Birds|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1 December 2002|volume=160|issue=6|pages=766–783|doi=10.1086/343877|pmid=18707464}}&lt;/ref&gt; but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. [[Local extinction|Extirpation]], [[population decline]] and [[Species homogeneity|homogenization]] of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jude, David auth.|first=ed. by M. Munawar|title=The lake Huron ecosystem: ecology, fisheries and management|year=1995|publisher=S.P.B. Academic Publishing|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-5103-117-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.

Not all introduced species are invasive, nor all invasive species deliberately introduced. In cases such as the [[zebra mussel]], [[invasive species|invasion]] of US waterways was unintentional. In other cases, such as [[mongoose]]s in [[Hawaii]], the introduction is deliberate but ineffective ([[nocturnal]] [[rat]]s were not vulnerable to the [[diurnality|diurnal]] mongoose). In other cases, such as [[oil palm]]s in Indonesia and Malaysia, the introduction produces substantial economic benefits, but the benefits are accompanied by costly [[unintended consequences]].

Finally, an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces. In [[Belgium]], [[Prunus spinosa]] from Eastern Europe leafs much sooner than its West European counterparts, disrupting the feeding habits of the ''[[Thecla betulae]]'' butterfly (which feeds on the leaves). Introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to compete with the exotic species and unable to survive. The exotic organisms may be [[predator]]s, [[parasite]]s, or may simply outcompete indigenous species for nutrients, water and light.

At present, several countries have already imported so many exotic species, particularly agricultural and ornamental plants, that their own indigenous fauna/flora may be outnumbered. For example, the introduction of [[kudzu]] from Southeast Asia to Canada and the United States has threatened biodiversity in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= ScienceDaily|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110408163917.htm |title=Are invasive plants a threat to native biodiversity?

Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to [[rare species]] that come into contact with more abundant ones. The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species, swamping its [[gene pool]]. This problem is not always apparent from [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] (outward appearance) observations alone. Some degree of [[gene flow]] is normal adaptation and not all [[gene]] and [[genotype]] constellations can be preserved. However, hybridization with or without introgression may, nevertheless, threaten a rare species' existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.27.1.83 | title = Extinction by Hybridization and Introgression | year = 1996 | last1 = Rhymer | first1 = Judith M. | last2 = Simberloff | first2 = Daniel | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 27 | pages = 83–109 | jstor = 2097230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PottsBarbour2001"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Bradley M. |last1=Potts|first2=Robert C.|last2= Barbour|first3=Andrew B. |last3=Hingston|title=Genetic Pollution from Farm Forestry Using Eucalypt Species and Hydrids: A Report for the RIRDC/L &amp; WA/FWPRDC Joint Venture Agroforestry Program|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PyQIOAAACAAJ}}|year=2001|publisher=RIRDC|isbn=978-0-642-58336-9 |issn=1440-6845}}

===Overexploitation===
{{Main|Overexploitation}}

Overexploitation occurs when a resource is consumed at an unsustainable rate. This occurs on land in the form of [[overhunting]], excessive [[logging]], poor [[soil conservation]] in agriculture and the illegal [[wildlife trade]].

About 25% of world [[fishery|fisheries]] are now overfished to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | year = 2007 | last1 = Grafton | first1 = R.

The [[overkill hypothesis]], a pattern of large animal extinctions connected with [[human migration]] patterns, can be used explain why [[megafauna]]l extinctions can occur within a relatively short time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Burney | first = D.

===Hybridization, genetic pollution/erosion and food security===
[[File:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|right|thumb|The Yecoro [[wheat]] (right) [[cultivar]] is sensitive to salinity, plants resulting from a hybrid cross with cultivar W4910 (left) show greater tolerance to high salinity]]
{{See also|Food security|Genetic erosion}}

In [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread [[genetic erosion]] and genetic pollution. This has resulted in loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole.&lt;ref name="bulletin28"&gt;[http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html "Genetic Pollution: The Great Genetic Scandal"; ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518120050/http://www.farmedia.org/bulletins/bulletin28.html |date=18 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetically modified organism]]s contain genetic material that is altered through [[genetic engineering]]. [[Genetically modified crops]] have become a common source for genetic pollution in not only wild varieties, but also in domesticated varieties derived from classical hybridization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pollan |first=Michael |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6DE143CF93AA35751C1A9679C8B63 |title=The year in ideas: A TO Z.; Genetic Pollution; By Michael Pollan, The New York Times, December 9, 2001 |work=The New York Times|date=2001-12-09 |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v22/n1/full/nbt0104-29.html |title=Dangerous Liaisons?

Genetic erosion and genetic pollution have the potential to destroy unique [[genotype]]s, threatening future access to [[food security]]. A decrease in genetic diversity weakens the ability of crops and livestock to be hybridized to resist disease and survive changes in climate.&lt;ref name="bulletin28" /&gt;&lt;!--this argument seems circular. hybridization is bad because...it limits future hybridization. so...the more genetic engineering the better so as to limit future hybridization? just sayin'...--&gt;

===Protection and restoration techniques===
Removal of exotic species will allow the species that they have negatively impacted to recover their ecological niches. Exotic species that have become pests can be identified taxonomically (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;with [[Digital Automated Identification SYstem]] (DAISY), using the [[Consortium for the Barcode of Life|barcode of life]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcoding.si.edu/ |title=Barcode of Life |publisher=Barcoding.si.edu |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120801074239/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html|deadurl=yes|title=Earth Times: show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.ht…|date=1 August 2012|archivedate=1 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal is practical only given large groups of individuals due to the economic cost.

As sustainable populations of the remaining native species in an area become assured, "missing" species that are candidates for reintroduction can be identified using databases such as the ''[[Encyclopedia of Life#Resources and collaborations|Encyclopedia of Life]]'' and the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]].

*[[Biodiversity banking]] places a monetary value on biodiversity. One example is the Australian [[Native Vegetation Management Framework]].
*[[Gene bank]]s are collections of specimens and genetic material. Some banks intend to reintroduce banked species to the ecosystem (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;via tree nurseries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbvl.be/Archief/guid/vlaanderen-heeft-45-zaadtuinen-voor-autochtone-bomen-en-struiken.aspx?artikel=0935212d-8b19-45a4-9cda-167ff68d347c |title=Belgium creating 45 "seed gardens"; gene banks with intent to reintroduction |publisher=Hbvl.be |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduction and better targeting of pesticides allows more species to survive in agricultural and urbanized areas.
*Location-specific approaches may be less useful for protecting migratory species. One approach is to create [[wildlife corridor]]s that correspond to the animals' movements. National and other boundaries can complicate corridor creation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Protected areas==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Protected areas are meant for affording protection to wild animals and their habitat which also includes forest reserves and biosphere reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dolomitipark.it/doc_pdf/parchi.sola.terra/07.ProtectedAreas_Biodiversity.pdf|title=Protected Areas and Biodiversity: An Overview of Key Issues|last=Mulongoy|first=Kalemani Jo|last2=Chape|first2=Stuart|publisher=CBD Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC|year=2004|isbn=|location=Montreal, Canada and Cambridge, UK|pages=15 and 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protected areas have been set up all over the world with the specific aim of protecting and conserving plants and animals. Some scientists have called on the global community to designate as protected areas 30 percent of the planet by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050, in order to mitigate biodiversity loss from anthropogenic causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Baillie|first1=Jonathan|last2=Ya-Ping|first2=Zhang|date=September 14, 2018 |title=Space for nature|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1051|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=361 |issue=6407 |pages=1051 |doi=10.1126/science.aau1397|pmid=30213888|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National parks===
{{Main|National park}}
National park and nature reserve is the area selected by governments or private organizations for special protection against damage or degradation with the objective of biodiversity and landscape conservation. National parks are usually owned and managed by national or state governments. A limit is placed on the number of visitors permitted to enter certain fragile areas. Designated trails or roads are created. The visitors are allowed to enter only for study, cultural and recreation purposes. Forestry operations, grazing of animals and hunting of animals are regulated. Exploitation of habitat or wildlife is banned.

===Wildlife sanctuary===
[[Wildlife sanctuary|Wildlife sanctuaries]] aim only at conservation of species and have the following features:

#The boundaries of the sanctuaries are not limited by state legislation.
#The killing, hunting or capturing of any species is prohibited except by or under the control of the highest authority in the department which is responsible for the management of the sanctuary.
#Private ownership may be allowed.
#[[Forestry]] and other usages can also be permitted.

===Forest reserves===
The [[forest]]s play a vital role in harbouring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000 faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species. In reserved forests, rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest, who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products. The unclassed forests covers 6.4 percent of the total forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics:

#They are large inaccessible forests.
#Many of these are unoccupied.
#They are ecologically and economically less important.

====Steps to conserve the forest cover====
{{see|forest cover}}
#An extensive [[reforestation]]/[[afforestation]] program should be followed.
#Alternative [[environment-friendly]] sources of fuel energy such as [[biogas]] other than wood should be used.
#Loss of biodiversity due to [[forest fire]] is a major problem, immediate steps to prevent forest fire need to be taken.
#[[Overgrazing]] by cattle can damage a forest seriously. Therefore, certain steps should be taken to prevent overgrazing by cattle.
#Hunting and [[poaching]] should be banned.

===Zoological parks===
In [[zoological park]]s or zoos, live animals are kept for public [[recreation]], education and conservation purposes. Modern zoos offer veterinary facilities, provide opportunities for threatened species to [[captive breeding|breed in captivity]] and usually build environments that simulate the native habitats of the animals in their care. Zoos play a major role in creating [[environmental awareness|awareness]] about the need to conserve nature.

===Botanical gardens===
In [[botanical garden]]s, plants are grown and displayed primarily for scientific and educational purposes. They consist of a collection of living plants, grown outdoors or under glass in [[greenhouse]]s and conservatories. In addition, a botanical garden may include a collection of dried plants or [[herbarium]] and such facilities as lecture rooms, laboratories, libraries, museums and experimental or research plantings.

==Resource allocation==
Focusing on limited areas of higher potential biodiversity promises greater immediate return on investment than spreading resources evenly or focusing on areas of little diversity but greater interest in biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=conservationists-triage-determine-which-endangered-species-to-save Conservationists Use Triage to Determine which Species to Save and Not; Like battlefield medics, conservationists are being forced to explicitly apply triage to determine which creatures to save and which to let go] 23 July 2012 ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second strategy focuses on areas that retain most of their original diversity, which typically require little or no restoration. These are typically non-urbanized, non-agricultural areas. Tropical areas often fit both criteria, given their natively high diversity and relative lack of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones-Walters | first1 = L. | last2 = Mulder | first2 = I. | doi = 10.1016/j.jnc.2009.06.001 | title = Valuing nature: The economics of biodiversity | journal = Journal for Nature Conservation | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–247 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | url=http://mdvnaturalist.com/images/econmics_of_biodiversity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
[[File:Hopetoun falls.jpg|thumb|right|A great deal of work is occurring to preserve the natural characteristics of [[Hopetoun Falls]], [[Australia]] while continuing to allow visitor access.]]

===International===
* United Nations [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (1992) and [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]];
* Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ([[CITES]]);
* [[Ramsar Convention]] (Wetlands);
* [[Bonn Convention]] on Migratory Species;
* [[World Heritage Convention]] (indirectly by protecting biodiversity habitats)
* Regional Conventions such as the Apia Convention
* Bilateral agreements such as the [[Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement]].

Global agreements such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], give "sovereign national rights over biological resources" (not property). The agreements commit countries to "conserve biodiversity", "develop resources for sustainability" and "share the benefits" resulting from their use. Biodiverse countries that allow [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products, expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers/exploits the resource to capture them privately. Bioprospecting can become a type of [[biopiracy]] when such principles are not respected.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|Access and Benefit Sharing Agreements]] (ABAs). The Convention on Biodiversity implies [[informed consent]] between the source country and the collector, to establish which resource will be used and for what and to settle on a [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|fair agreement on benefit sharing]].

===National level laws===
Biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions:
* The relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has consequences for biodiversity. It is related to private and public property rights. It can define protection for threatened ecosystems, but also some rights and duties (for example, [[fishing]] and hunting rights).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* Law regarding species is more recent. It defines species that must be protected because they may be threatened by extinction. The U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] is an example of an attempt to address the "law and species" issue.
* Laws regarding gene pools are only about a century old.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Domestication and plant breeding methods are not new, but advances in genetic engineering have led to tighter laws covering distribution of [[genetically modified organisms]], gene [[patent]]s and process patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/patents.shtml |title=Gene Patenting |publisher=Ornl.gov |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments struggle to decide whether to focus on for example, genes, genomes, or organisms and species.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved, however. Bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard, claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/envtllaw/issues/vol12/bosselman-for%20web.pdf |title=Fred Bosselman, A Dozen Biodiversity Puzzles, 12 N.Y.U.

India passed the [[Biological Diversity Act]] in 2002 for the conservation of biological diversity in India. The Act also provides mechanisms for equitable sharing of benefits from the use of traditional biological resources and knowledge.

==Analytical limits==

===Taxonomic and size relationships===
Less than 1% of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x | author = Wilson Edward O | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Earth's species are microbial.

"On the tree of life, based on analyses of small-subunit [[ribosomal RNA]], visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs. The inverse relationship of size and population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladder—to a first approximation, all multicellular species on Earth are insects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/448657a | bibcode=2007Natur.448..657S | title = Biodiversity: World of insects | year = 2007 | last1 = Stork | first1 = Nigel E. | journal = Nature | volume = 448 | issue = 7154 | pages = 657–658 | pmid = 17687315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect extinction rates are high—supporting the Holocene extinction hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1095046 | author = Thomas J.

== Diversity study (botany) ==
The number of morphological attributes that can be scored for diversity study is generally limited and prone to environmental influences; thereby reducing the fine resolution required to ascertain the phylogenetic relationships. DNA based markers- microsatellites otherwise known as ''simple sequence repeats'' (SSR) were therefore used for the diversity studies of certain species and their wild relatives.

In the case of [[cowpea]], a study conducted to assess the level of genetic diversity in cowpea germplasm and related wide species, where the relatedness among various taxa were compared, primers useful for classification of taxa identified, and the origin and phylogeny of cultivated cowpea classified show that SSR markers are useful in validating with species classification and revealing the center of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogunkanmi|first=Liasu Adebayo|date=|title=Genetic diversity of cowpea and its wild relatives|url=|journal=Unilag SPGS (Thesis &amp; Dissertation 1970-2012)|volume=|pages=144–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in 1941, it is currently in its 13th edition. Most of the older books on Indian birds were meant for identification using specimens in the hand and the only other field guide, [[Hugh Whistler]]'s ''Popular Handbook Of Indian Birds'' was published in London, was getting out of date and not readily available in India. The book of Indian birds provided a popular bird-guide in a low-cost edition.  

The [[J. Paul Getty Award for Conservation Leadership]], while awarding Salim Ali in 1976, said in its citation:
:... your book, the Book of Indian Birds which in its way was the seminal natural history volume for everyone in India.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Among the early converts of the book was [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who was to become [[India]]'s first [[prime minister]].  While in jail under the [[British Raj]],  he gave a copy to his 25-year-old daughter [[Indira Gandhi]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The second edition of the book was published in 1942, subsequent editions being in 1944, 1945, 1961, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1977, 1979 (11th edition with reprints in 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990 and 1992), 1996 (12th edition) and 2002 (13th edition).

[[File:BRIDGElogo.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Image of BRIDGE Programme logo|&lt;center&gt;'''British Mid-Ocean Ridge Initiative'''&lt;/center&gt;|right]]
The '''British Mid-Ocean Ridge Initiative''' (the BRIDGE Programme) was a multidisciplinary scientific investigation of the creation of the Earth’s crust in the deep oceans.  It was funded by the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council ([[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]]) from 1993 to 1999.

==Mid-Ocean ridges==
{{main|Mid-ocean ridge}}
Mid-Ocean ridges are active volcanic mountain ranges snaking through the depths of the Earth’s oceans. They occur where the edges of the Earth’s [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] are separating, allowing [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] rock to rise to the seafloor and harden, creating new [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The addition of this crust can cause ocean basins to widen perpendicular to the ridge. This [[seafloor spreading]] is the engine of [[continental drift]].{{efn|For an explanation of the destruction of the Earth’s crust elsewhere in the oceans, without which the crust would constantly grow, see the entry on [[Subduction]]}} At intervals along the mid-ocean ridges super-heated mineral-rich fluids are vented from the seabed. These [[hydrothermal vent]]s are populated by animal and bacterial species not found elsewhere on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=A.D. |last2=Tyler |first2=P.A. |last3=Connelly |first3=D.P. |last4=Copley |first4=J.T. |last5=James |first5=R. |last6=Larter |first6= R.D.|date=2012 |title=The Discovery of New Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent Communities in the Southern Ocean and Implications for Biogeography |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001234 |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=10 |issue=1 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001234 |access-date=9 October 2015|display-authors=etal |pmid=22235194 |pmc=3250512 |pages=e1001234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BRIDGE investigated the geological setting of the ridge, the geochemistry of vent fluids, and ways in which biological communities survive in this apparently hostile environment. To achieve this the programme developed novel deep-ocean technologies for deployment from surface ships and manned submersibles.  It also conducted experimental research into the mechanical and chemical nature of the rocks and underlying crust in these active volcanic regions. The scale of the investigation ranged from extensive regional studies mapping unexplored seafloor to microscopic and chemical analyses at individual vent sites. To achieve the programme’s objectives work was focused at five contrasting locations: the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] at 24–30°N; the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 36–39°N; Iceland and the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge|Reykjanes Ridge]] to its south west; the Scotia back-arc basin (SW Atlantic); and the Lau basin (SW Pacific). Intensive localised studies were made within these areas.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''14''' (spring 1998): back cover}}

==Background to BRIDGE==

The idea for a British mid-ocean ridge research programme was developed by Professors [[Johnson Cann|Joe Cann]] of [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]] and Roger Searle of [[University of Durham|Durham University]] after they attended a meeting in Oregon in 1987 where the idea for a US mid-ocean ridge research programme (the RIDGE Program) was being developed.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletters '''13''' (autumn 1997): p. 12 and '''17''' (autumn 1999): p. 7}}{{efn|The US [[Ridge Interdisciplinary Global Experiments program|Ridge Interdisciplinary Global Experiments program (RIDGE)]] was funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] from 1989 and moved into phase two in 1999 as {{URL|1=https://nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5513|2=RIDGE 2000}}.}} 
In the UK researchers in many disciplines were already studying mid-ocean ridges but it was felt this research could be better integrated to produce new multidisciplinary approaches yielding results of wider significance.&lt;ref name="NERC1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Natural Environment Research Council |date=1993 |title=BRIDGE: British Mid-Ocean Ridge Initiative |location=Swindon |publisher=NERC |page=Foreword + 13pp. (known as ‘’The BRIDGE Glossy’’)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ‘BRIDGE’ branding of research commenced before [[research council]] funding was sought for a formal programme.  BRIDGE was mentioned by name in ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper in February 1989.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''13''': p. 12}} By this time the community of researchers in this field were referring to themselves as the BRIDGE Consortium. Deep-ocean science cruises were being identified as BRIDGE cruises by 1990.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''15''' (autumn 1998): p. 64}} The first BRIDGE newsletter appeared in 1991.

Once the idea of BRIDGE was in place an application for funding was made to the Natural Environment Research Council. This was successful and full funding commenced in 1993 for a programme that would run until 1999.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''13''': p. 13}} The final budget was £13M.{{efn|At 1999 exchange rates: €20M or US$21M.}}

==Aims==

* To invest in British mid-ocean ridge research so that both human skills and instrument resources were increased
* To use both existing capabilities and newly developed instruments to solve some of the fundamental scientific problems pertaining to mid-ocean ridges
* To expand UK mid-ocean ridge research to involve a wider range of skills and new techniques
* To seek both direct and indirect commercial benefits from mid-ocean ridge research
* To liaise with other national programmes to maximise the benefits of British activities&lt;ref name="NERC1993"/&gt;

This last aim was achieved directly and by participation in the international [[InterRidge]] network.

==Objectives==

* To undertake the crucial observations, experiments and modelling aimed at solving fundamental scientific problems
* To conduct the basic surveys necessary to site both regional and local studies
* To develop new marine instrumentation for use in experiments
* To acquire access to the survey vehicles and instruments necessary for undertaking the science
* To attract scientists from diverse disciplines to participate in mid-ocean ridge research
* To consult the UK marine instrumentation community to refine requirements for, and capabilities of, new instruments
* To seek active involvement of the UK [[biotechnology]] community in mid-ocean ridge research
* To construct and update plans that would enable these aims and objectives to be met&lt;ref name="NERC1993"/&gt;

==Scientific problems==

From the wide range of scientific problems that could be addressed by mid-ocean ridge research, BRIDGE identified six that were of most relevance to UK research.

* How does the three-dimensional structure of mid-ocean ridges, and especially their segmentation by [[transform fault]]s and similar features, relate to the physical properties and dynamics of the underlying Earth’s mantle?
* Can the [[geochemistry]] of the lavas erupted at mid-ocean ridges give insights into the scale and origin of heterogeneities in the underlying mantle?
* What is the nature of the [[Magma|magmatic plumbing system]] within the crust and upper mantle below mid-ocean ridges?
* How does the rate of flow and geochemical composition of the [[black smoker]] hydrothermal vent fluids vary with time, and what causes this variation? Can this help us to understand more about the origin of [[Ore|ore deposits]] found on land?
* How do the bacteria that live around the black smoker hot springs survive the high temperatures and the toxic environment? Can these capabilities be exploited in biotechnology?
* How do the chemical and biological processes at the black smoker vent fields affect the global flux of [[chemical species]] in and out of the ocean?  Are the nutrient levels of the oceans partly controlled from the mid-ocean ridges?&lt;ref name="NERC1993"/&gt;

==Programme structure==

===Science===

The scientific aims and objectives of the programme were directed by an international steering committee which met twice a year. The programme held a series of annual funding rounds to which scientists and engineers in the field submitted research proposals. Following a peer-review assessment of each proposal by independent referees the steering committee ranked the most highly rated proposals on their scientific merit and contribution to the programme’s objectives. This short-list was then recommended to NERC for funding.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''9''' (autumn 1995): p. 59}}

===Management===

From 1993 to 1995 programme management (day-to-day administration and budget oversight) was undertaken by NERC head office in [[Swindon]]. A separate Science Coordinator role (incorporating, among other duties, responsibility for expanding the BRIDGE Consortium, organising national conferences and publishing the newsletter) was based at Leeds University where the BRIDGE Chief Scientist, Joe Cann, was chairman of [[Earth science|Earth Sciences]].

In 1995 NERC began [[Outsourcing|contracting out]] programme management for their large programmes.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''8''' (spring 1995): p. 66}} BRIDGE programme management absorbed the science coordination role and a new programme manager was appointed, based at Leeds University. The Leeds BRIDGE office was the programme hub until the end of March 1999 after which the conclusion of the programme was administered by NERC.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''16''' (spring 1999): p. 3}}

==Programme content==

BRIDGE funded 44 research projects: 4 multidisciplinary; 15 geology; 6 biology; 11 studies of the hydrothermal environment at vent fields (9 of the ocean floor and 2 of the overlying water column); and 8 engineering projects to develop the required technologies.{{efn|All projects are listed in BRIDGE Newsletter '''13''': pp. 12–13. Reports from 16 of these are summarised in Newsletters '''14''': pp. 14–25 and '''15''': pp. 52–55}} More than 200 scientists in 28 research centres around the UK contributed to this programme.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''17''': p. 2}} There were 26 BRIDGE deep-ocean research cruises to the North Atlantic, SW Atlantic, SE Pacific, SW Pacific and Indian oceans, 18 of which were directly funded by the programme.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''15''': p. 64}}

==Results==

To discuss and publicise the programme’s results BRIDGE organised its own science conferences at [[Durham University]] (1991), the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences Deacon Laboratory ([[National Oceanography Centre, Southampton#History|IOSDL]]), [[Wormley, Surrey|Wormley]] (1992), [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]] (1993), [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] (1994), the [[Geological Society of London]] (1994, 1995 and 1997), [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] (1996), [[National Oceanography Centre, Southampton|Southampton Oceanography Centre]] (1997) and [[University of Bristol|Bristol University]] (1998).{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''16''': p. 51}} In addition BRIDGE science was reported at other meetings nationally and internationally, for example: at the [[Royal Society]] meeting ''Mid-Ocean Ridges: Dynamics of Processes Associated with Creation of New Ocean Crust'' (1996),{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''10''' (spring 1996): pp. 64–65}} the 1996 [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] annual science festival at [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]] in a BRIDGE session entitled ''Abyssal Inferno: Seafloor volcanoes, hot vents and exotic life at the mid-ocean ridges'',{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''10''': p. 36}} at ''Geoscience 98'', [[Keele University]] (1998),{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''13''': p. 71}} at the meeting ''Technology for Deep-Sea Geological Investigations'' at the Geological Society of London (1998){{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''16''': pp. 52–65}} and at meetings of the [[American Geophysical Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= BRIDGE Newsletter |date=1991–1999 |volume=Nos. '''1'''–'''17''' |issn= 1364-8721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the BRIDGE conferences resulted in books published by the Geological Society of London, presenting in greater detail the science reported at the meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Parson |editor1-first=L.M. |editor2-last=Walker |editor2-first=C.L. |editor3-last=Dixon |editor3-first=D.R. |date=1995 |title=Hydrothermal Vents and Processes |url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/87/1 |location=London |publisher=Geological Society of London |series=Special Publication No. 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=MacLeod |editor1-first=C.J. |editor2-last=Tyler |editor2-first=P.A. |editor3-last=Walker |editor3-first=C.L. |date=1996 |title=Tectonic, Magmatic, Hydrothermal and Biological Segmentation of Mid-Ocean Ridges |url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/118/1 |location=London |publisher=Geological Society of London |series=Special Publication No. 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Mills |editor1-first=R.A. |editor2-last=Harrison |editor2-first=K. |date=1998 |title=Modern Ocean Floor Processes and the Geological Record |url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/148/1 |location=London |publisher=Geological Society of London |series=Special Publication No. 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the programme rapid publication of results was effected through ''The BRIDGE Newsletter''. In style this was an academic journal (but without [[peer review]]) comprising BRIDGE science results together with conference announcements, meeting reports, cruise reports, updates from the mid-ocean ridge programmes of other nations and general news items of relevance to this field of research.{{efn|The articles published in issues '''1'''–'''12''' were listed in BRIDGE Newsletter '''13''': pp. 73–82}} It was published twice a year in spring and autumn. The first issue of eight stapled sheets appeared in August 1991 but after NERC funding commenced it was commercially printed and bound. By issue 10, in April 1996, it had grown to 100 pages and was being distributed to more than 600 researchers and interested parties in 20 countries.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''13''': p. 13}} The last newsletter, [[Numero sign|No.]] 17, was produced in autumn 1999 as a magazine called ''The Fiery Deep, Exploring a New Earth'' summarising the programme and its results to that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Bowler |editor-first=S. |date=1999 |title=The Fiery Deep: Exploring a New Earth |pages=48pp. |location=Swindon |publisher=NERC |series=BRIDGE Newsletter No. 17 |issn=1364-8721}} Text on-line {{URL|1=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~jtc/fierydeep.html |2=here}} or {{URL|1=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816022227/http://www.nerc.ac.uk/bridge/ |2=here}} Retrieved 9 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November 1999 at the [[Natural History Museum, London]] these results were presented to invited guests at a formal end of programme meeting.

As the programme ended, Joe Cann reported, "As a result of the BRIDGE initiative, several groups of UK scientists are at the forefront of international research in mid-ocean ridge science.  The areas of expertise of these scientists range from marine geophysics and geodynamics, physical and chemical oceanography, to marine biology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=British Mid-Ocean Ridge Initiative |date=1998 |title=BRIDGE Annual Report to the NERC Earth Science and Technology Board |page= 3pp. (Internal NERC document. Copy seen by first author of this article.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Every area had success. Here are a few examples. We found new pools of molten rock below the ocean floor where none was expected. We discovered large fields of hot springs, where the wisdom of the time said there should be none. We followed the strange lifecycle of the blind shrimp that live around hot springs in the Atlantic. We made sonar images of the first of a family of enormous faults that slice through the ocean floor, bringing deep rock to the surface. We showed how the flow of one of the big, hot spring fields was affected by scientific drilling. We traced the relationships between animals in hot spring communities up and down the Atlantic. We built new instruments, too, that can operate in these hostile regions".{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''17''': p. 7}}

==Legacy==

In addition to the results of the researches, which are still quoted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Prodehl |first1=C. |last2=Mooney |first2=W.D. |date=2012 |title= Exploring the Earth's Crust: History and Results of Controlled-Source Seismology |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Luc15OnPMFkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher= Geological Society of America |pages=43, 625, 633 |isbn=978-0813712086}}&lt;/ref&gt; the BRIDGE Programme left an interdisciplinary community of deep-ocean scientists with a proven track record of collaboration and new equipment for working at depths of over 3,500 metres.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''17''': pp. 42–45}}

===BRIDGE equipment===

BRIDGE had purchased for the [[National Oceanography Centre, Southampton#Research vessels|UK research fleet]] a [[Simrad Yachting|Simrad]] [[multibeam echosounder]] for mapping the seafloor from a surface ship. To increase detail in any geographical areas of interest it also funded upgrades to the existing UK '''Towed Ocean Bottom Instrument (TOBI)''', which made 3D images of the seabed as it was towed 300m above the ocean floor. TOBI was modified to increase its resolution, to add a [[gyrocompass]] and to add a three component [[magnetometer]] for measuring the magnetic field of the seafloor rock over which it was towed.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletters '''16''': pp. 57–58 and '''17''': pp. 43–44}}

The '''BRIDGE Towed instrument (BRIDGET)''', was developed for hunting and studying the plumes of warm, mineral rich fluids rising into the water column from vent fields.  This “hot-spring sniffer” was towed at depth behind a ship in areas where vent fields were suspected to occur and fed [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] data back to the ship in real time.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletters '''16''': p. 59 and '''17''': pp. 7 and 30}}

Once fields had been detected the fluids venting from the sea-floor could be studied directly using the '''MEDUSA''' instrument. Deployed by a [[deep submergence vehicle]], this could be placed over individual vents for extended time periods to record the characteristics of the fluids as they emerge. At the BRIDGE programme’s close six MEDUSA instruments had been built with BRIDGE funding, three more were constructed for the [[National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology#Geological Survey of Japan|Geological Survey of Japan]], and the next generation was being developed for various US agencies including [[NASA]].{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletters '''16''': pp. 54–55 and '''17''': p. 44}}

For examining the rock of the mid-ocean ridge a new deep ocean drill, the '''BRIDGE Drill''', was developed which marked the core as it drilled. The marking of the core allowed the original north-south orientation of the core to be known after it had been removed. This permitted the magnetic alignment of the rock from which the sample was taken to be determined, providing information on sea-bed movements that had taken place after the rock had formed.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletters '''13''': pp. 17–19, '''15''': pp. 18–20 and '''16''': pp. 53–54}}

For study of the dispersal of animals found at the vent fields, the biologists developed a '''Planktonic Larval Sampler for Molecular Analysis (PLASMA)'''. This was designed to take samples of water to catch the dispersing [[larva]]e of animals living around the vents. PLASMA could be left on the sea-bed in the vicinity of a vent field for up to a year if required, sampling at programmed intervals and preserving any larvae for DNA analysis after the recovery of the equipment.{{refn|group=bnl|BRIDGE Newsletter '''15''': pp. 26–29}}

The '''Chaman Fault''' is a major, active [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]] in [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] that runs for over 850&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="USGS-1"&gt;[http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1685 "USGS Unveils How Earthquakes Pose Risks to Afghanistan"] News Release, 30 May 2007, United States Geological Survey&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Plate tectonics|Tectonically]], it is actually a system of related geologic faults that separates the [[Eurasian Plate]] from the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]. It is a terrestrial, primarily [[Transform fault|transform]], [[Sinistral and dextral|left-lateral]] strike-slip fault.  The slippage rate along the Chaman fault system as the Indo-Australian Plate moves northward (relative to the Eurasian Plate) has been estimated at 10&amp;nbsp;mm/yr or more.&lt;ref name="USGS-1"/&gt; In addition to its primary transform aspect, the Chaman fault system has a [[Convergent boundary|compressional component]] as the [[Indian Plate]] is colliding with the Eurasian Plate.  This type of plate boundary is sometimes called a transpressional boundary.&lt;ref name="USGS-2"&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2007/3027/pdf/FS07-3027_508.pdf "Earthquakes Pose a Serious Hazard in Afghanistan"] Fact Sheet 2007–3027, April 2007, United States Geological Survey&lt;/ref&gt;

From the south, the Chaman fault starts at the [[triple junction]] where the [[Arabian Plate]], the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] meet, which is just off the [[Makran|Makran Coast]] of Pakistan. The fault tracks northeast across [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and then north-northeast into Afghanistan, runs just to the west of [[Kabul]], and then northeastward across the right-lateral-slip Herat fault, up to where it merges with the Pamir fault system north of the 38° parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Fig.2 Chaman fault System associated with Indian Plate Boundary (April 2008) [http://www.neduet.edu.pk/Civil/2008-1.pdf "Chaman Fault System (CFS) – a Prominent Seismo-tectonic Feature In Pakistan"] ''Cowasjee Earthquake Study Centre Ned Newsletter'' 8(1): pp. 2–3, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ghazaband and Ornach-Nal faults are often included as part of the Chaman fault system. South of the triple junction, where the fault zone lies undersea and extends southwest to approximately 10°N 57°E, it  is known as the [[Owen Fracture Zone]].

While there is general agreement that the fault is slipping at a rate of at least 10&amp;nbsp;mm/yr, there is a report of volcanic rocks in Pakistan dated to 2 m.y. BP which have been offset such as to indicate a slip rate of 25–35&amp;nbsp;mm/yr.&lt;ref&gt;not viewed, cited by Lawrence , R. D.; Khan, S. Hasan and Nakata, T. (1992) "Chaman fault, Pakistan-Afghanistan" ''In'' Bucknam, R. C. and Hancock, P. L. (eds.) (1992) ''Major active faults of the world—Results of IGCP project 206'' ''Annales Tectonicae'' 6(supplement): pp. 196–223&lt;/ref&gt; Offsets have been described throughout the fault in Pakistan that are young enough that “only the alluvium of the bottom of active dry washes is not displaced.”&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, R. D.; Khan, S. Hasan and Nakata, T. (1992) "Chaman fault, Pakistan-Afghanistan" ''In'' Bucknam, R. C. and Hancock, P. L. (eds.) (1992) ''Major active faults of the world—Results of IGCP project 206'' ''Annales Tectonicae'' 6(supplement): pp. 196–223, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

The parallel mountain ranges of eastern Balochistan, (east to west) the [[Kirthar Mountains]], the Khude Mountains, the Zarro Mountains, the Pab Mountains and the Mor Mountains, are a result of the compressional plate boundary and are aligned parallel to the Chaman fault movement.  The fault itself is west of these ranges.

==Significant earthquakes along the fault==
*1505, 5 July  or 6th – An earthquake created a 60&amp;nbsp;km long surface rupture along a transverse fault in the Chaman system with several meters of vertical offset. This transverse fault is sometimes called the Paghman fault.&lt;ref name="Quittmeyer"&gt;Quittmeyer, R. C. and Jacob, K.

In the [[geologic record]] the '''Chaotian''' [[Geologic time scale|eon]] or [[Geologic era|era]] is unofficially proposed to denote the time preceding the solidification of the Earth's crust and the formation of Earth's moon, it is the earliest [[system (geology)|era]] within the [[eon (geology)|eon]] of [[Hadean]]. It lasted 196 million years, at {{Ma|4600}} to the beginning of the [[Zirconian]] era, {{Ma|4404}}. It is named after [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]], the primeval void in [[Greek mythology]]. The Chaotian sets in with the emergence of [[Earth]] at 4.6 billion years ago. Its upper limit and thus the transition to the [[zirconian|Zirconian era]] is defined by the occurrence of the first conservation capable [[mineral]]. These are [[zircon]], the oldest mineral in the [[Jack Hills]] of [[Narryer Gneiss Terrane]] in [[Western Australia]] ([[Yilgarn craton]]) found and were dated 4,404 ± 8 million years ago &lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author = Wilde, SA and Others |year = 2001 |title = Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gyr ago |journal = Nature |volume = 409 |issue = 6817 |pages = 175–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to first proposal, it precedes the [[Hadean]] eon and is the earliest eon in Earth's history as a planet. The end of the Chaotian was marked by the hypothetical [[Giant impact hypothesis|collision]] of the proto-Earth and a planet-sized body named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], leading to the formation of the Moon.&lt;ref name=posci1&gt;{{cite web|last=Fox|first=Stuart|title=NASA Scientists Classify the Time Before Earth Existed: the Chaotian Era|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-01/new-timescale-breaksdown-formation-solar-system|publisher=''[[Popular Science]]''|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Beyond Hades|journal=The Economist|date=7 January 2010|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15207606|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively it is defined as the first era of the Hadean eon, before the formation of the first crust on the Earth. As of 2012, it is considered to be part of a proposed revision of the [[Precambrian]] time scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gradstein|first1=F.M.|last2=Ogg|first2=J.G.|last3=Schmitz|first3=Mark|last4=Ogg|first4=Gabi|title=The Geologic Time Scale 2012|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0444594485|pages=360–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Felix M. Gradstein among others | year = 2012 | title = On the Geologic Time Scale | journal = Newsletters on Stratigraphy | volume = 45/2 | pages = 171–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term 'Chaotian' is derived from mythological [[Chaos (mythology)|chaos]], reflecting the [[Chaos Theory|chaotic conditions]] thought to have existed at the start of the formation of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=solidearth1 /&gt;

== Meaning ==
Information about this earliest period can therefore only be obtained indirectly, for example by [[astrophysics|astrophysical considerations]] and [[Geochemistry|geochemical survey]] of [[meteorite]] material and [[Moon|lunar]] rock.

== Origins ==
This geological era designation was proposed by [[NASA]] scientists at the [[Ames Research Center]] in 2010 to formalize terminology in the earliest stages of Earth's history.&lt;ref name=solidearth1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldblatt|first=C.|author2=Zahnle, K.J.|author3=Sleep, N.H.|author4=Nisbet, E.G.|title=The Eons of Chaos and Hades|journal=Solid Earth|date=2 February 2010|url=https://78462f86-a-05ba3201-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/colingoldblatt.net/www/files/goldblatt_se10.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cq5NfzYKGk6hcZBjcAUqIRzlsHoYje7TcZsvAOIiKgEx9mCSfszw0n5SEKTXPSwVMYDrRcyTX_nmzszidyWk7XRTph4gcxNPYSBgx9VY_hw4tORp6Lje0aNDT7tEDtN37oRDtSV-xNLAvNsErtEbbzz_a2SgNUiPjjFRwLtPmKmzM7oP0qPaXKyn0wWfsuvQArJa17j_tCyW0Ag___PNjUAUQXO2m3A2mvROGyv9seM1SLXMr4%3D&amp;attredirects=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NASA proposal divides the Chaotian into the [[Eochaotian]] (4.7-4.65 Gya) and [[Neochaotian]] (4.65-4.6 Gya) [[Era (geology)|eras]], which are in turn proposed to be divided into the [[Nephelean]] (4.7-4.68 Gya) and [[Erebrean]] (4.68-4.65 Gya), and [[Hyperitian]] (4.65-4.62 Gya) and [[Titanomachean]] (4.62-4.6 Gya) [[Period (geology)|periods]], respectively.&lt;ref name=solidearth1/&gt; {{As of|2017|05}}, this has  been adopted by the [[IUGS]].

== Timing of events ==
The exact date of the birth of our [[solar system]] (and the earth) is still controversial. [[Calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion]]s (CAI), the first condensate from the [[protoplanetary disk|planetary orbit]], were dated to 4,567.30 ± 0.16 million years ago by the [[uranium-lead dating|uranium-lead method]].&lt;ref name="connelly"&gt;{{cite |author = Connelly, JN among others |year= 2012 |title= The Absolute Chronology and thermal Processing of solids in the solar Protoplanetary Disk |journal= Science |volume= (6107) 338 |pages=651–655 |doi= 10.1126/science.1226919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manganese-chromium dating of [[chondrules]] revealed an age of 4.571 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shukolyukov |first1=A. |last2=Lugmair |first2=G.W. |publication-date= 2002 |chapter=Chronology of Asteroid Accretion and Differentiation |pages=687–695 |editors=Bottke, W.; Cellino, A.; Paolicchi, P. and Binzel, R.

'''Crepe rubber''' is [[Flocculation|coagulated]] [[latex]] that is rolled out in crinkled sheets, commonly used to make [[Sole (shoe)|sole]]s for shoes and boots but is also a raw material for further processed [[rubber]] products.

==Processing==
[[Colloidal]] latex is first mixed with [[formic acid]] to cause it to coagulate. The coagulum is processed in a "creping battery", a series of machines that crush, press and roll the coagula. The sheets are hung in a heated drying shed and then sorted by grade and packed for shipping.

==Types==
There are several types and grades of rubber crepe, mainly distinguished by the grade and pre-processing of the latex used in their manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ecoport.org/ep?SearchType=earticleView&amp;earticleId=644&amp;page=4363 |title=Processing of Natural Rubber, Manufacture of Latex-Grade Crepe Rubber |first1=John |last1=Cecil |first2=Peter |last2=Mitchell |first3=Per |last3=Diemer |first4=Peter |last4=Griffee |publisher=FAO, Agricultural and Food Engineering Technologies Service |work=ecoport.org |year=2013 |accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pale latex crepe (PLC) is a premium grade, made from raw field latex.
*Estate brown crepe (EBC) is made from "cup lump" (raw, naturally [[coagulate]]d rubber from the collection cup) and other coagulum. 
*Re-milled crepe is made from "wet slab coagulum" (cured latex, still wet from the coagulation tanks), latex sheets (unsmoked) and cup lump.
*Smoked blanket crepe is made from thick sheets of latex that have been processed in a smoker.
*Flat bark crepe is made from scraps and other poor quality raw product.

[[File:Algeria Sahara Desert Photo From Drone 5.jpg|thumb|381x381px|Sand dunes in the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]]]&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''Desert ecology'''  is the study of interactions between both [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] components of [[desert]] environments. A desert [[ecosystem]] is defined by interactions between [[organism]] populations, the [[climate]] in which they live, and any other non-living influences on the [[habitat]]. Deserts are arid regions which are generally associated with warm temperatures, however cold deserts also exist. Deserts can be found on every continent, with the largest being located in [[Antarctica]], the [[Arctic]], [[North Africa|Northern Africa]], and the [[Middle East]].

==Climate==
{{main|Desert climate}}
Deserts experience a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. They can be classified into four types: hot, semiarid, coastal, and cold. '''Hot deserts''' have warm temperatures at all times of the year, and low annual precipitation. The lack of humidity in these deserts results in high temperatures during the daytime and large amounts of heat loss at night. Although the average annual temperature in hot deserts is 20&amp;nbsp;°C to 25&amp;nbsp;°C, extreme weather conditions can lead to temperatures from -18&amp;nbsp;°C to 49&amp;nbsp;°C. Rainfall generally occurs in concentrated bursts, followed by long periods of no precipitation. '''Semiarid deserts''' experience similar conditions to hot deserts, however the maximum and minimum temperatures tend to be less extreme, ranging from 10&amp;nbsp;°C to 38&amp;nbsp;°C. '''Coastal deserts''' are cooler than hot and semiarid deserts, with average summer temperatures between 13&amp;nbsp;°C and 24&amp;nbsp;°C. They also feature higher total rainfall values. '''Cold deserts''' are similar in temperature to coastal deserts, however they receive more annual precipitation, which much of it in the form of snow.&lt;ref name="The Desert Biome"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pullen|first1=Stephanie|title=The Desert Biome|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss5/biome/deserts.html|website=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deserts are most notable for their dry climates resulting from [[rain]]-blocking [[mountain]] ranges and remoteness from [[ocean]]ic moisture.  Deserts occupy one-fifth of the Earth's land surface and occur in two belts: between 15° and 35° latitude in both the southern and northern hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/moja/mojadewd.htm|title=World Deserts|work=Mojave National Preserve: Desert Ecology|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bands are associated with the high solar intensities that all areas in the tropics receive, and at the same time with dry air brought down by the descending arms of [[Hadley cell|Hadley]] and [[Atmospheric circulation|Ferell]] atmospheric circulation cells.

Deserts generally occur because of global wind patterns or rain shadows. Dry winds not only hold little moisture for these areas, but also tend to evaporate any water present. Rain shadows do not occur because of general wind patterns but rather, due to the wind passing over a mountain range. As air rises and cools, its relative humidity increases and some or most moisture rains out, leaving little to no water vapour to form precipitation on the other side of the mountain range.

Many desert ecosystems are limited by available water levels, rather than rates of radiation or temperature. Water flow in these ecosystems can be thought of as similar to energy flow; in fact, it is often useful to look at water and energy flow together when studying desert ecosystems and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noy-Meir|first=Imanuel|date=1973-11-01|title=Desert Ecosystems: Environment and Producers|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000325|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=4|issue=1|pages=25–51|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000325|issn=0066-4162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water availability in deserts may also be hindered by loose sediments. [[Mineral dust|Dust clouds]] commonly form in windy, arid climates. Scientists have previously theorised that desert dust clouds would enhance rainfall, however some studies have shown that precipitation is actually inhibited by this phenomenon by absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. This absorption can result in a positive [[Feedback|feedback loop]], which leads to further desertification.&lt;ref name="Desert Dust"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Daniel|last2=Rudich|first2=Yinon|last3=Lahav|first3=Ronen|title=Desert dust suppressing precipitation: A possible desertification feedback loop|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=22 May  2001|volume=98|issue=11|doi=10.1073/pnas.101122798|pmc=33408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape==
Desert landscapes can contain a wide variety of geological features, such as [[Oasis|oases]], [[Outcrop|rock outcrops]], [[dune]]s, and [[mountain]]s.&lt;ref name="Desert Features"&gt;{{cite web|title=Desert Features|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/features/|website=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunes are structures formed by wind moving sediments into mounds. Desert dunes are generally classified based on their orientation relative to wind directly. Possibly the most recognisable dune type are transverse dunes, whose crests are transverse to the wind direction. Many dunes are considered to be active, meaning that they travel and change over time due to the influence of the wind. However, some dunes can be anchored in place by vegetation or topography, preventing their movement.&lt;ref name="Arabian Deserts"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edgell|first1=H. Stewart|title=Arabian Deserts|date=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-3970-6|pages=201–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some dunes may also be referred to as sticky, which occurs when the individual grains of sand become cemented together. Sticky dunes tend to be more stable and resistant to wind reworking than loose dunes.&lt;ref name="Sticky Dunes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hesse|first1=Paul|title=Sticky dunes in a wet desert: Formation, stabilisation and modification of the Australian desert dunefields|journal=Geomorphology|date=15 November 2011|volume=134|issue=3-4|pages=309–325|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.07.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of geological features in desert environments can reveal a lot about the history of the area. Through observation and identification of rock deposits, geologists are able to interpret the order of events that occurred during desert formation. For example, research conducted on the surface geology of the [[Namib|Namib Desert]] allowed geologists to interpret ancient movements of the [[Kuiseb River]] based on rock ages and features identified in the area.&lt;ref name="Surface Geology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eckardt|first1=Frank D.|last2=Livingstone|first2=Ian|last3=Seely|first3=Mary|last4=Von Holdt|first4=Johanna|title=The Surface Geology and Geomorphology Around Gobabeb, Namib Desert, Namibia|journal=Geografiska Annaler|date=17 October 2013|volume=95|pages=271–284|doi=10.1111/geoa.12028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organism Adaptation==
[[File:Chameau de bactriane.JPG|thumb|355x355px|The high body temperatures of [[bactrian camel]]s allow them to preserve water.]]

=== Animals ===
{{Main|Xerocole}}
Deserts support diverse communities of plant and animals that have evolved resistance to, and methods of circumventing of, the extreme [[temperature]]s and arid conditions. For example, desert grasslands are more humid and slightly cooler than its surrounding ecosystems. Many animals get their energy by eating plants, but desert plants give up the fruit of their production very reluctantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital-desert.com/joshua-tree-national-park/ecosystems.html|title=Desert Ecosystem|website=digital-desert.com|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid intense temperatures, the majority of small desert mammals are nocturnal, and dig burrows in which they live. These burrows help maintain to prevent overheating and resulting loss of water, and to maintain the mammal's optimal temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology of Desert Systems|last=Whitford|first=Walter G.|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd|year=2002|isbn=0127472614|location=San Diego, California|pages=128, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desert ecology is characterized by dry, [[alkaline]] soils, low net production and opportunistic feeding patterns by [[herbivore]]s and [[carnivore]]s. Other organisms' survival tactics are physiologically based. Such tactics include the completion of life cycles ahead of anticipated drought seasons, and storing water with the help of specialized organs.&lt;ref name="CLOUDSLEY-THOMPSON"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloudsley-Thompson|first=J.L.|year=1996|title=Current trends in desert ecology|jstor=43423916|journal=Science Progress|volume=79|issue=3|pages=215–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desert climates are particularly demanding on [[endotherm]]ic organisms. In environments where the external temperature is less than their body temperature, most endotherms are able to balance heat production and heat loss to maintain a comfortable temperature. However, in deserts where air and ground temperatures exceed body temperature, endotherms must be able to dissipate the large amounts of heat being absorbed in these environments. In order to cope with extreme conditions, desert endotherms have adapted through the means of avoidance, relaxation of [[homeostasis]], and specializations. Nocturnal desert rodents, like the [[kangaroo rat]], will spend the daytime in cool burrows deep underground, and emerge at night to seek food. Birds are much more mobile than ground-dwelling endotherms, and can therefore avoid heat-induced dehydration by flying between water sources. To prevent overheating, the body temperatures of many desert mammals have adapted to be much higher than non-desert mammals. [[Camel]]s, for example, can maintain body temperatures that are about equal to typical desert air temperatures. This adaptations allows camels to retain large amounts of water for extended periods of time. Other examples of higher body temperature in desert mammals include the [[Diurnality|diurnal]] [[Antelope squirrel|antelope ground squirrel]], and the [[oryx]]. Certain desert endotherms have evolved very specific and unique characteristics to combat dehydration. Male [[sandgrouse]] have specialized belly feathers that are able to trap and carry water. This allows the sandgrouse to provide a source of hydration for their chicks, who do not yet have the ability to fly to water sources themselves.&lt;ref name="Vertebrate Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pough|first1=F. Harvey|last2=Janis|first2=Christine M.|last3=Heiser|first3=John B.|title=Vertebrate Life|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-321-77336-4|pages=549–556|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plants ===
{{Main|Xerophyte}}
Although deserts have severe climates, some plants still manage to grow.  Plants that can survive in arid deserts are called [[xerophyte]]s, meaning they are able to survive long dry periods. Such plants may close their [[stoma]]ta  the daytime and open them at night, at the time when a plant may load carbon dioxide while, thanks to lower temperatures, losing less water to evaporation.

Adaptations in xerophytes include resistance to heat and water loss, increased water storage capabilities, and reduced surface area of leaves. One of the most common families of desert plants are the [[Cactus|cacti]], which are covered in sharp spines or bristles for defence. The bristles on certain cacti also have the ability to reflect sunlight, such as those of the [[Cephalocereus senilis|old man cactus]]. Certain xerophytes, like [[Nerium|oleander]], feature stomata that are recessed as a form of protection against hot, dry desert winds, which allows the leaves to retain water more effectively. Another unique adaptation can be found in xerophytes like [[Fouquieria splendens|ocotillo]], which are "leafless during most of the year, thereby avoiding excessive water loss".&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reece|first1=Jane B.|last2=Urry|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Cain|first3=Michael L.|last4=Wasserman|first4=Steven A.|title=Campbell Biology Canadian Edition|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-321-77830-7|page=835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration and Research==
The harsh climate of most desert regions is a major obstacle in conducting research into these ecosystems. In the environments requiring special adaptations to survive, it is often difficult or even impossible for researchers to spend extended periods of time investigating the ecology of such regions. To overcome the limitations imposed by desert climates, some scientists have used technological advancements in the area of remote sensing and [[robotics]]. One such experiment, conducted in 1997, had a specialised robot named Nomad travel through a portion of the [[Atacama Desert]]. During this expedition, Nomad travelled over 200 kilometres and provided the researchers with many photographs of sites visited along its path.&lt;ref name="Nomad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wettergreen|first1=David|last2=Bapna|first2=Deepak|last3=Maimone|first3=Mark|last4=Thomas|first4=Geb|title=Developing Nomad for robotic exploration of the Atacama Desert|journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems|date=28 February 1999|volume=26|issue=2-3|pages=127–148|doi=10.1016/S0921-8890(99)80002-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DESERTEC''' was a large-scale project supported by a foundation of the same name and the consortium [[Desertec industrial initiative|Dii]] (Desertec industrial initiative) created in Germany as a [[limited liability company]] ([[GmbH]]).&lt;ref name="dii-about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dii-eumena.com/home/about-us.html | title=Dii - about-us and history | accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project aimed at creating a global [[renewable energy]] plan based on the concept of harnessing sustainable power from sites where renewable sources of energy are more abundant and transferring it through [[high-voltage direct current]] transmission to consumption centers. All kinds of renewable energy sources are envisioned, but the sun-rich deserts of the world play a special role.&lt;ref name="Concept" /&gt;

There are some parallels between Desertec and the [[Atlantropa]] project plan in the 1920s. Atlantropa aimed to integrate [[eurafrika|Europe and Northern Africa]] and its electricity grid based on a giant hydro power station at Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="Atlantropa"&gt;[http://www.umweltsystemwissenschaften.at/usw-magazin/usw-cafe/37-usw-cafe/91-gruener-gigantismus.html Franz Fuchs: ''Grüner Gigantismus'', USW/Uni Graz 4.

==Organizations, Milestones and Activities==

DESERTEC was developed by the [[Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation]] (TREC), a voluntary organization founded in 2003 by the [[Club of Rome]] and the National Energy Research Center Jordan, made up of scientists and experts from across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (EU-MENA).&lt;ref name="Milestones"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is from this network that the [[DESERTEC Foundation]] later emerged as a non-profit organization tasked with promoting the DESERTEC solution around the world. Founding members of the foundation are the German Association of the [[Club of Rome]], members of the network of scientists TREC as well as committed private supporters and long-time promoters of the DESERTEC idea. 
In 2009, the DESERTEC Foundation founded the [[Munich]]-based industrial initiative 'Dii GmbH' together with partners from the industrial and finance sectors. Its task is to accelerate the implementation of the DESERTEC Concept in the focus region EU-MENA.&lt;ref name="Milestones" /&gt;

The scientific studies done by the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) between 2004 and 2007 demonstrated that the desert sun could meet rising power demand in the [[MENA]] region while also helping to power Europe, reduce carbon emissions across the EU-MENA region and power desalination plants to provide freshwater to the MENA region.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Dii GmbH published a further study called Desert Power 2050 in June 2012.&lt;ref name="DS-P-H-02"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.desertec.org/organization/dii-gmbh/ | title = DII Gmbh | date = 13 July 2009 | accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that the MENA region would be able to meet its needs for power with renewable energy, while exporting its excess power to create an export industry with an annual volume of more than €60 billion. Meanwhile, by importing desert power, Europe could save around €30/MWh.

=== Comparison with Atlantropa ===
{{main article|Atlantropa}}
[[File:Atlantropa.jpg|thumb|upright=2|An artist's conception of what Atlantropa may look like, as seen from space]]

[[Atlantropa]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = In hundert Jahren | author = Hanns G&amp;uuml;nther ([[Walter de Haas]])| year = 1931 | publisher = Kosmos}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Macro-engineering|gigantic engineering]] project devised by [[Herman Sörgel]] in the 1920s and promulgated by him until his death in 1952. Its central feature was a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam]] to be built across the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], which would have provided enormous amounts of hydroelectricity for the whole Mediterranean region &lt;ref&gt;"Atlantropa: A plan to dam the Mediterranean Sea." 16 March 2005. &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.xefer.com/iuncturae/2005/03/72 Archive.]&lt;/span&gt; Xefer. Retrieved on 4 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and lowered the surface of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] by up to {{convert|200|m}}, opening up large new lands for settlement. The project reached great popularity in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and for a short period again, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but was forgotten after Sörgel's death 1952.&lt;ref name="ATLANVOIGHT_122"&gt;{{cite book|last=Voigt|first=Wolfgang|title=Atlantropa - Weltenbauen am Mittelmeer|year=1998|isbn=978-3-86735-025-9|page=122|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall technocratic approach to strengthen political unity across the Mediterranean Sea via a large-scale infrastructure project has some parallels to Desertec, as well some technical aspects as the idea of fostering a cross-border electricity grid in the region. A major difference lies in the stepwise approach taken by Desertec, which took previous failures of large-scale technical visions into account. Atlantropa relied on a single large-scale infrastructure and was never, despite its longstanding popularity, close to technical realization. Desertec was led by a similar macro-engineering vision but attempted to start via small-scale steps, which at least partially succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Mediterrane Stromvisionen, Von Atlantropa zu DESERTEC? |first=Alexander |last=Gall |title=Technology Fiction Technology Fiction.

The DESERTEC concept was originated with Dr Gerhard Knies, a German particle physicist and founder of the Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation (TREC) network of researchers. In 1986, in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear accident, he was searching for a potential alternative source of clean energy and arrived at the following remarkable conclusion: in just six hours, the world's deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes in a year.&lt;ref name="KniesTriebAlt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The DESERTEC concept was developed further by TREC – an international network of scientists, experts and politicians from the field of  [[renewable energies]] – founded in 2003 by the [[Club of Rome]] and the National Energy Research Center Jordan. One of the most famous members was Prince [[Hassan bin Talal]] of [[Jordan]]. In 2009, TREC emerged to the non-profit DESERTEC Foundation.&lt;ref name=milstones&gt;

The DESERTEC Foundation was founded on 20 January 2009 with the aim of promoting the implementation of the DESERTEC Concept for clean power from deserts all over the world.

===Dii GmbH===
To help accelerate the implementation of the DESERTEC idea in EU-MENA, the non-profit DESERTEC Foundation and a group of 12 European companies led by Munich Re founded an industrial initiative called Dii GmbH in [[Munich]] on 30 October 2009.&lt;ref name="DS-P-H-02"/&gt; The other companies included Deutsche Bank, E.ON, RWE, Abengoa.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Like the DESERTEC Foundation, Dii GmbH did not intend to build power plants itself. Instead it focused on four core objectives in EU-MENA:

[[Desertec Industrial Initiative|Dii]] GmbH aimed to create a positive investment climate for renewable energies and interconnected power grid in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] by encouraging the necessary technological, economic, political and market frameworks. This included the development of a long-term implementation perspective called Desert Power 2050 with guidance on investment and funding. [[Desertec Industrial Initiative|Dii]] GmbH has initiated selected reference projects to demonstrate overall feasibility and reduce system overall costs.&lt;ref name="Reformulated mission of Dii"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reformulated mission of Dii|url=http://desertenergy.org/mission-and-vision/|website=desertenergy.org|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept details==

===Description===
DESERTEC is a global [[renewable energy]] solution based on harnessing sustainable power from the sites where renewable sources of energy are at their most abundant. These sites can be used thanks to low-loss High-Voltage Direct Current transmission. All kinds of renewables will be used in the DESERTEC Concept, but the sun-rich deserts of the world play a special role.&lt;ref name="Concept" /&gt;

[[File:Fullconnection.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|DLR studies of existing and hypothetical HVDC transmission lines]]
The original and first region for the assessment and application of this concept is the EU-[[MENA]] region (European Union, Middle East and Northern Africa).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The DESERTEC organisations promote the generation of electricity in North Africa, the Middle East and Europe using renewable sources, such as [[solar power plants]], [[wind park]]s, and develop a Euro-Mediterranean [[electricity network]], primarily made up of high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission cables.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its name, DESERTEC's proposal would see most of the power plants located outside of the [[Sahara Desert (ecoregion)|Sahara Desert]] itself but rather in the surrounding areas, in the more accessible [[North Saharan steppe and woodlands|North]] and [[South Saharan steppe and woodlands|South steppes and woodlands]], as well as the relatively moist [[Atlantic Coastal Desert]]. Under the DESERTEC proposal, [[concentrating solar power]] systems, [[photovoltaic]] systems and [[wind power|wind parks]] would be spread over the wide desert regions in North Africa like the [[Sahara Desert]] and all its subdivisions.&lt;ref name=epoch&gt;

In March 2012, the DESERTEC Foundation started working in a further focus region. A year after the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, the DESERTEC Foundation and the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation (JREF) have signed a MoU. They will exchange knowledge and know-how, and coordinate their work together to develop suitable framework conditions for the deployment of renewables and to establish transnational cooperation in Greater East Asia. The aim is to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in Asia to provide secure and sustainable alternatives to fossil and nuclear power. As a part of its mission, JREF promotes the Asia Super Grid Initiative to facilitate an electricity system based fully on renewable energy. The DESERTEC Foundation sees such a grid as an important step towards the implementation of DESERTEC in Greater East Asia and has already conducted a feasibility study on potential grid corridors to make best use of the region’s desert sun.&lt;ref name="desertec.org"/&gt;

=== Studies about DESERTEC ===

====DLR studies====
The DESERTEC Concept was developed by an international network of politicians, academics and economists, called TREC. The research institutes for renewable sources of the governments of Morocco (CDER), Algeria (NEAL), Libya (CSES), Egypt (NREA), Jordan (NERC) and Yemen (Universities of Sana'a and Aden) as well as the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) made significant contributions towards the development of the DESERTEC Concept. The basic studies relating to DESERTEC were led by DLR scientist Dr. Franz Trieb working for the Institute for Technical Thermodynamics at the DLR.&lt;ref name=milstones/&gt; The three studies were funded by the [[German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety]] (BMU). The studies, conducted between 2004 and 2007,&lt;ref name="DLR-H-01"&gt;[http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10200/448_read-255 DESERTEC – Solar power from the desert]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DLR-H-02"&gt;[http://www.desertec.org/fileadmin/downloads/WhiteBook_Excerpt_Trieb_Steinhagen.pdf The DESERTEC concept sustainable electricity and water for Europe, Middle East and North Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; evaluated the following as shown in the table below;

The studies concluded that the extremely high solar radiation in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East outweighs the 10–15% transmission losses between the desert regions and Europe. This means that solar thermal power plants in the desert regions are more economical than the same kinds of plants in southern Europe. The [[German Aerospace Center]] has calculated that if solar thermal power plants were to be constructed in large numbers in the coming years, the estimated cost of electricity would come down from 0.09–0.22 euro/kWh to about 0.04–0.05 euro/kWh.&lt;ref name="KniesTriebAlt"&gt;

The [[Sahara Desert]] was chosen as an ideal location for [[solar farm]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10200/448_read-255 |title= DESERTEC – Solar power from the desert |author= Franz Trieb |publisher= German Aerospace Agency (DLR)}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is exposed to bright sunshine nearly all the time, roughly between 80% and 97% of the daylight hours in the best cases. This is the sunniest year-round area on the planet. In the world's largest hot desert, there is an extremely vast area, covering almost the whole desert, that receives more than 3,600 h of yearly sunshine. There is also a very large area in excess of 4,000 h of sunshine annually. The highest solar radiation received on the planet is in the Sahara Desert, under the [[Tropic of Cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Ecology in Plant Production |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yqxt9AmQr4EC&amp;pg=PA71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This results from a general, strong lack of cloud cover year-round and a geographical position under the tropics.

The annual average [[insolation]], which represents the total amount of [[solar radiation]] energy received on a given area and on a giver period, is about 2,500 kWh/(m² year) over the region and this number can soar up to almost 3,000 kWh/(m² year) in the best cases.&lt;ref name="geni.org"&gt;http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/energytrends/currentusage/renewable/solar/solar-systems-in-the-desert/Solar-Systems-in-the-Desert.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The weather features of the Sahara Desert, especially the insolation, have a pronounced nature. The annual electricity production reaches 1,300,000 TWh at maximum in this sun-drenched area if the whole desert is covered in solar panels.&lt;ref name="geni.org"/&gt;
The desert is also extremely vast covering about some 9,000,000&amp;nbsp;km² (3,474,920 sq mi), being almost as large as [[China]] or the [[United States]] and is sparsely populated, making it possible to set up large solar farms without a negative impact on inhabitants of the region, too. Lastly, sand deserts can provide [[silicon]], a raw material that is essential in the production of [[solar panel]]s.

The great African desert is relatively cloud-free all year long but it's important to note the harsh, desert climate also has some negative features such as extreme heat and sometimes dust or sand-laden winds which frequently blow over the desert and can even result in severe [[duststorm]]s or [[sandstorm]]s. Both phenomenons reduce the solar electricity productivity and the efficiency of the solar panels.

====Desert Power 2050====
Dii announced it will introduce a roll-out-plan in late 2012 which includes concrete recommendations how to enable investments in renewable energy and interconnected power grids. Dii claims working with all key stakeholders from the international scientific and business communities as well as policy-makers and civil society to enable two or three concrete reference projects to demonstrate the feasibility of the long-term vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://social.csptoday.com/emerging-markets/desertec-and-medgrid-competitive-or-compatible |title=DESERTEC and Medgrid: Competitive or compatible? |author=Stancich, Rikki |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203153301/http://social.csptoday.com/emerging-markets/desertec-and-medgrid-competitive-or-compatible |archivedate=3 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dii developed a strategic framework for a fully integrated and decarbonized power system based on renewable energies for the entire North Africa, Middle East and Europe (EUMENA) region in 2050. Therefore, Dii researched from the viewpoint of technology and geography what is the optimal mix of renewable energies to provide the EUMENA region with sustainable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/en/704362/rwe/press-news/reference-projects-to-demonstrate-feasibility/| title = Reference projects to demonstrate feasibility | accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012 Dii presented the first part of its study “Desert Power 2050 – Perspectives on a Sustainable Power System for EUMENA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dii-eumena.com/desert-power-2050.html  | title = Executive Summary of Desert Power 2050| accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Key Findings'''
''Desert Power 2050'' demonstrates that the abundance of sun and wind in the EUMENA region will enable the creation of a joint power network that will entail more than 90 percent renewables. According to the study such a joint power network involving North Africa, the Middle East and Europe (EUMENA) offers clear benefits to all involved. The nations of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) could meet their expanding needs for power with renewable energy, while developing an export industry from their excess power with could reach an annual volume worth more than 60 billion euros, according to the study results. By importing up to 20 percent of its power from the deserts, Europe could save up to 30 euros for each megawatt hour of desert power.

The north and south would become the powerhouses of this joint network, supported by wind and hydropower in Scandinavia, as well as wind and solar energy in the MENA region. Supply and demand would complement one other – both regionally and seasonally – according to the findings of ''Desert Power 2050''. With its constant supply of wind and solar energy throughout the year, the MENA region can cover Europe's energy needs without the latter having to build costly excess capacities. A further benefit of the power network is the enhanced security of supply to all nations concerned. A renewables based network would lead to mutual reliance among the countries involved, complemented by inexpensive imports from the south and the north.

'''Methodology'''
''Desert Power 2050'' presents the full perspective of the EUMENA region, which includes, for instance, the growing consumption of power in the MENA states. The power requirements of the MENA states are likely to more than quadruple by 2050, totalling more than 3000 terawatt hours. Unlike in Europe, the population will also grow considerably by the middle of the century, thus heightening the demand for new jobs. 
Analysing the design of a power system built to include more than 90% renewables 40 years into the future is necessarily subject to major uncertainties on a range of assumptions. To address these uncertainties Dii analysed so-called sensitivities, or perspectives, to show how the results react to changed parameters. Dii has analysed a total of 18 perspectives on the EUMENA power supply in 2050. They cover a wide range of major impact factors on the attractiveness of power system integration. The main message of the study: grid integration across the Mediterranean is valuable under all foreseeable circumstances.

'''Second Phase'''
Desert energy could be a stimulus for growth and make an important contribution when it comes to coping with the social and economic challenges in North Africa and the Middle East. Dii announced that a second phase of Desert Power 2050, ''Getting Started'', will examine this topic in greater depth in the next few months, with discussions including political, scientific and industrial stakeholders. The objective is to formulate recommendations for the regulatory steps required in the years to come.

More energy falls on the world's deserts in six hours than the world consumes in a year, and the Saharan desert is virtually uninhabited and is close to Europe. Supporters say that the project will keep Europe "at the forefront of the fight against climate change and help North African and European economies to grow within greenhouse gas emission limits".&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pfeiffer |first=Tom |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE57N00920090824?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=11613 |title=Europe's Saharan power plan: miracle or mirage? |agency=Reuters |date=23 August 2009 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DESERTEC officials say the project could one day deliver 15&amp;nbsp;percent of Europe's electricity and a considerable part of MENA's electricity demand.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; According to the DESERTEC Foundation, the project has strong job creation potential and could improve the stability in the region.&lt;ref name=DESERTEC_Press_Release&gt;

====Concentrated solar power====
[[File:SolarStirlingEngine.jpg|thumb|[[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|Dish Stirling]]]]
[[Concentrated solar power]] (also called concentrating solar power and CSP) systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight, or solar thermal energy, onto a small area. Electrical power is produced when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (usually a steam turbine) connected to an electrical power generator. Molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. Since solar fields feed their heat energy into a conventional generation unit with a steam turbine, they can be combined without any problem with fossil fuel hybrid power plants. This hybridization secures energy supply also in unfavourable weather and at night without the need of accelerating costly compensatory plants. A technical challenge is the cooling which is necessary for every heating power system. Dii is therefore reliant either on an adequate water supply, coastal facilities or improved cooling technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/tt/Portaldata/41/Resources/dokumente/institut/system/projects/MED-CSP_Executive_Summary_Final.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - MED-CSP_Executive_Summary_Final.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schott.com/solar/english/download/schott_memorandum_e.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307114351/http://www.schott.com/solar/english/download/schott_memorandum_e.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Photovoltaics====
Dii also considers [[photovoltaics]] (PV) as a technology suitable for desert power plants. Photovoltaics is a method of generating electrical power by converting solar radiation into direct current electricity using semiconductors. Photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed of a number of solar cells containing a photovoltaic material. Materials presently used for photovoltaics include monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, and copper indium gallium selenide/sulfide. Driven by advances in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication, the cost of photovoltaics has declined steadily since the first solar cells were manufactured.

In 2010, [[First Solar]], a producer of thin film solar panels, joined Dii as associated partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ford |first=Dana |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/16/us-firstsolar-desertec-idUSTRE62F1EU20100316 |title=First Solar joins DESERTEC solar project |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US based company already has experience with huge PV installations, and has constructed the 550 megawatt [[Desert Sunlight Solar Farm]] and [[Topaz Solar Farm]] in [[California]], which are the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|biggest two PV installations of the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desertsunlight.com/Overview |title=550MW (AC) Desert Sunlight Solar Farm &amp;#124; First Solar |publisher=Desertsunlight.com |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind energy====
As also parts of the desert regions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) come with high wind potential, Dii is examining in which geographic regions the installation of wind farms is suitable. Wind turbines produce electricity by wind turning the blades, which spin a shaft, which connects to a generator which produces electricity. The Sahara Desert is one of the windiest areas on the planet, especially on the western coast where lies the Atlantic coastal desert along Western Sahara and Mauritania. The annual average wind speed at the ground greatly exceeds 5&amp;nbsp;m/s in most of the desert, and even approach 8&amp;nbsp;m/s or 9&amp;nbsp;m/s along the western ocean coast. It's important to note that wind speed increases with height. The regularity and the constancy of winds in arid regions are major assets for wind energy, too. The winds blow nearly constantly over the desert and there are generally no windless days during throughout the year. Therefore, the desert of North Africa is also an ideal location to install large-scale [[wind park]]s and [[wind turbine]]s with very good productivity.

====High-voltage direct current (HVDC)====

To export renewable energy produced in the MENA desert region, a [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) electric power transmission system is needed.&lt;ref name="DSRTC-HVDC-01"&gt;[http://www.esc.ethz.ch/publications/newsletter/ESC_NL_May10.pdf Page 5 | The grid – a key factor in the future power]&lt;/ref&gt; High Voltage DC (HVDC) technology is a proven and economical method of power transmission over very long distances and also a trusted method to connect [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]] [[Utility grid|grids]] or grids of different frequencies. With HVDC energy can also be transported in both directions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/pool/hq/power-transmission/HVDC/HVDC_Proven_Technology_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For long-distance transmission HVDC suffers lower electrical losses than [[alternating current]] (AC) transmission. Because of the higher solar radiation in MENA, the production of energy, even with the included transmissions losses, is still advantageous over the production in South Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/tt/Portaldata/41/Resources/dokumente/institut/system/projects/TRANS-CSP-Executive_Summary_Final.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - TRANS-CSP-Executive Summary_Final-Final.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also very long distance projects have already been realized with technological cooperation from ABB and Siemens – both shareholders of Dii; namely the 800 kV HVDC [[Xiangjiaba]]-[[Shanghai]] transmission system, which was commissioned by [[State Grid Corporation of China]] (SGCC) in June 2010. The HVDC link is the most powerful and longest transmission of its kind to be implemented anywhere in the world; and at the time of commissioning, transmitted 6,400 MW of power over a distance of nearly 2,000 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/pool/hq/power-transmission/HVDC/HVDC_References.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is longer than would be needed to link MENA and Europe. Siemens Energy has equipped the sending converter station Fulong for this link with ten DC converter transformers, including five rated at 800 kV.

The second HVDC project which is also for SGCC with cooperation from ABB, is a new HVDC link of 3,000 MW over 920 kilometres from Hulunbeir, in Inner Mongolia, to Shenyang in the province of Liaoning in the North-Eastern part of China in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abb.com/industries/ap/db0003db004333/d913687e8c5f79d5c1257749003c252d.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120719172926/http://www.abb.com/industries/ap/db0003db004333/d913687e8c5f79d5c1257749003c252d.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 July 2012 |accessdate=3 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another project scheduled for 2014 commissioning – is the construction of an ±800 kV North-East UHVDC link from the North-Eastern and Eastern region of India to the city of Agra across a distance of 1,728 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abb.com/industries/ap/db0003db004333/9716a8ac9879236bc125785200694f18.aspx |title=ABB North-East Agra – ABB HVDC Reference Projects in Asia (HVDC References) |publisher=Abb.com |date=22 September 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another project of this type is the [[Rio Madeira HVDC system]] a HVDC link of {{convert|2375|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=EPE&gt;Esmeraldo, P.C.V., Araujo, E.M.A., Carvalho, D.S. Jr.,  [http://www.e-cigre.org/bib/B4_306_2010.pdf HVDC Madeira Transmission System – Planning Development and Final Design], [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] session, Paris, 2010, Paper B4-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
[[File:Solar Array.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Arrays of parabolic troughs]]
The Sahara Desert covers huge parts of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan and Tunisia. It is one of three distinct physiographic provinces of the African massive physiographic division.

The first solar and wind power projects in North Africa have already begun. [[Algeria]] initiated a unique project in 2011 dealing with Hybrid power generation which combines a 25 MW concentrating solar power array in conjunction with a 130 MW combined cycle gas turbine plant [[Hassi R'Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station]].

Other countries like Morocco have set up ambitious plans on the implementation of renewable energy. The [[Ouarzazate solar power station]] in Morocco for example, with the capacity of 500 MW, will be one of the largest concentrated solar plants in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2011, the DESERTEC Foundation started to evaluate projects that could serve as models for the implementation of DESERTEC according to its sustainability criteria. The first of these is the [[TuNur solar power plant]] in Tunisia that is planned to have 2&amp;nbsp;GW of capacity. Creating up to 20,000 direct and indirect local jobs, its plants include dry-cooling systems that reduce water usage by up to 90%. Construction is planned to begin in 2014, and export power to Italy by 2016. A video on YouTube is explaining this project.&lt;ref name="TuNur"&gt;

Talks with the [[Moroccan government]] had been successful and the Dii confirmed their first reference project would be in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As a partner in a beginning partnership between Europe and MENA Morocco is especially well-suited since a grid connection from Morocco via Gibraltar to Spain already exists. Also the Moroccan government enacted a program to support renewable energies.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2011, Dii signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; MASEN will act as a project developer and will be responsible for all important project steps in Morocco. Dii will promote the project and its financing in the [[European Union]] in Brussels as well as in national governments. This reference project, with a total capacity of 500&amp;nbsp;MW, will be a combination of concentrated solar power plants (400&amp;nbsp;MW) and photovoltaics (100&amp;nbsp;MW). The first available power from the joint Dii/MASEN project could be fed into the Moroccan and Spanish grids between 2014 and 2016, depending on the selected technology and market conditions. Based on the current estimate the total costs are €2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://euobserver.com/1021/115033 | title = Sahara wind and sun to power EU homes | last= Ebels |first=Philip |date=2 February 2012 | accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/11/sahara-solar-panels-green-electricity| title = Could the desert sun power the world? |last= Hickman |first=Leo |work=The Guardian  |date=11 December 2012 | accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Dii emphasized that the power plant won’t be installed in the region of [[Western Sahara]] which is administered by Morocco. An official spokesperson of Dii made the following confirmation: "''Our reference projects will not be located in the region. When looking for project sites, DESERTEC Industrial Initiative will also take political, ecological or cultural issues into consideration. This procedure is in line with the funding policies of international development banks.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Solar giant DESERTEC to avoid Western Sahara | url = https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/desertec-western-sahara | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 23 April 2010 | accessdate =22 May 2010 | location=London | first=Zara | last=Maung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tunisia]], STEG Énergies Renouvelables, a subsidiary of the Tunisian state utility company STEG, and Dii are currently working on a pre-feasibility study. The study focuses on substantial solar and wind energy projects in Tunisia. Research will address the technical and regulatory conditions for the supply of energy in local networks for the export of power to neighbouring countries as well as Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://allafrica.com/stories/201011081266.html | title = Tunisia: Nation and DESERTEC Sign MoU | date=5 November 2010 | accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides financing of the project will be analysed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.rechargenews.com/business_area/finance/article252057.ece| title = Tunisia still in running for DESERTEC role despite turmoil| author= Stromsta, Karl-Erik |date=12 April 2011 | accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algeria]], which offers excellent conditions for renewable energy, is considered as a potential location for a further reference project. In December 2011, the Algerian energy supplier [[Sonelgaz]] and Dii signed a Memorandum of Understanding on their future collaboration in the presence of EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger and the Algerian Minister for Energy and Mining Youcef Yousfi. The focus of this cooperation will be the strengthening and the exchange of technical expertise, joint efforts in market development and the progress of renewable energy in Algeria as well as in foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.europolitics.info/externa-policies/dii-and-sonelgaz-agree-to-cooperate-in-algeria-art320850-44.html |title= Dii and Sonelgaz agree to cooperate in Algeria |last= Kugyela |first= Tamás |date=9 December 2011 | accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Euro-Mediterranean projects, Medgrid and DESERTEC are both attempting to generate solar energy from deserts and complement each other, a [[Memorandum of understanding|MoU]] was signed on 24 November 2011 between Medgrid and Dii to study, design and promote an [[interconnected]] [[electrical grid]] linking both projects.&lt;ref name="MEDG04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MEDG05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MEDG06"/&gt; The plan is to build five interconnections at a cost of around 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion), including between [[Tunisia]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="MEDG07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MEDG13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europolitics.info/sectoral-policies/more-interconnections-are-needed-within-and-beyond-the-eu-art315137-14.html |title=More interconnections are needed within and beyond the EU |publisher=europolitics.info |date=3 January 2012 |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316092500/http://www.europolitics.info/sectoral-policies/more-interconnections-are-needed-within-and-beyond-the-eu-art315137-14.html |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy }} by Tamás Kugyela&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of Dii and Medgrid are covered by the Mediterranean Solar Plan (MSP), a political initiative within the framework of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] (UfM).

In March 2012 Dii, [[Medgrid]], [http://www.friendsofthesupergrid.eu/ Friends of the supergrid] and [http://www.renewables-grid.eu/ Renewables Grid Initiative] signed a joint declaration to support the effective and complete integration, in a single electricity market, of renewable energy from both large-scale and decentralised sources, which shall not be played out against each other in Europe and in its neighbouring regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medgrid-psm.com/en/2012/03/no-transition-without-transmission/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103165228/http://www.medgrid-psm.com/en/2012/03/no-transition-without-transmission/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 January 2013 |title=No Transition without Transmission |publisher=Medgrid-psm.com |date=21 March 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obstacles==
Some experts – such as Professor Tony Day, director of the Centre for Efficient and Renewable Energy in Building at London South Bank University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/8370642.stm | work=Reuters | title=Solar power technology takes its next step  | date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Wilkinson of Janusian Security Risk Management,&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt; and Wolfram Lacher of Control Risks consultancy&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;  – are concerned about political obstacles to the project. Generating so much of the electricity consumed in Europe and in Africa would create a political dependency on North African countries which had corruption before [[Arab Spring]] and a lack of cross-border coordination. Moreover, DESERTEC would require extensive economic and political cooperation between [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]], which is at risk as the border between the two countries is closed due to a disagreement over the [[Western Sahara]], Inram Kada by EUMENA, is responsible for expediting the project. Cooperation between the states of Europe and the states of the Middle East and North Africa is also certain to be challenging. Large scale cooperation necessary between the EU and the North African nations the project may be delayed due to bureaucratic red tape and other factors such as expropriation of assets.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;

There are also concerns that the water requirement for the solar plant to clean dust off panels and for turbine coolant may be detrimental to local populations in terms of the demand it will place on the local water supply.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; An EU innovation supported project however resulted in the development of a [[silicone]] based film with a [[Nano-|nano]]-[[dentrite]] structure on it.  The film is fused on top of the solar panels and the nano-dentrite structure makes that sand, water, salt, bacteria, molds, etc. can't attach to the photovoltaic panels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bluenergy-ag.net/English/tech_solar.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Opposed to this, studies point out the generation of fresh water by the solar thermal plants.&lt;ref name="AQUACSP"/&gt; Furthermore, no significant amount of water is needed for cleaning and cooling, since alternative technologies can be used (dry cleaning, dry cooling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.energy.ca.gov/pier/conferences+seminars/2005-06_advanced_cooling_conference/papers/F_Advanced_Heller_System_Technical_2005.pdf |title= Advanced Heller System – Technical_2005_feb |format=PDF |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, dry cooling is more expensive, technologically challenging and less efficient than the water cooling currently planned. Plans for water desalination for cooling purposes are not part of the DESERTEC business plan or cost estimates as proposed.

The late [[Hermann Scheer]] ([[Eurosolar]]) pointed out that the doubled solar radiation in the Sahara can not be the only criterion especially with its continuous [[trade wind]]s there {{clarify span|being problematic|date=October 2012}}.&lt;ref name="nano2010510"&gt;interview with [[Hermann Scheer]] by correspondent [[:de:Stefan Schulze-Hausmann]], TV contributions "Zukunftsstadt Masdar" and "DESERTEC", [[:de:nano (Sendung)]], 3sat, 10. May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmitting energy over long distances has been criticized{{Who|date=November 2010}}, with questions raised over the cost of cabling compared to energy generation, and over electricity losses. However, the study and current operating technology show that electricity losses using [[high-voltage direct current]] transmission amount to only 3% per 1,000&amp;nbsp;km (10% per 3,000&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/en/power-transmission/hvdc/hvdc-ultra/ |title=Ultra HVDC Transmission System – Siemens |publisher=Energy.siemens.com |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment may be required within Europe in a "[[supergrid]]".&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Cook |url=http://www.DESERTEC.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=38 |title=DESERTEC Forum |accessdate=16 January 2009 |date=2007-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044202/http://www.desertec.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=38 |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, one proposal is to cascade power between neighbouring states so that states draw on the power generation of neighbouring states rather than from distant desert sites.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;{{cite web| author=Gerry Wolff  | url= http://www.trec-uk.org.uk/elec_eng/cascade.html | title = The Cascading Principle | accessdate=16 January 2009 | date=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One key question will be the cultural aspect, as Middle Eastern and African nations may need assurance that they will own the project rather than it being imposed from Europe.&lt;ref name=zukunftstreff&gt;{{cite web| author= DESERTEC | url= http://www.zukunftstreff.info/science/1-aktuelle-nachrichten/80-europes-dream-of-endless-energy.html | title = Economic and cultural aspects of DESERTEC Project | date = 16 July 2008 | accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East Calcutta Wetlands''', (22 0 27’ N 88 0 27’ E), are a complex of natural and human-made [[wetland]]s lying east of the city of [[Calcutta]] (Kolkata), of [[West Bengal]] in [[India]]. The wetlands cover 125 square kilometers, and include salt marshes and salt meadows, as well as sewage farms and settling ponds. The wetlands are used to treat Kolkata's sewage, and the nutrients contained in the waste water sustaining fish farms and agriculture.

The name '''East Calcutta Wetlands''' was coined by Dr. Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, Special Advisor(Agricultural Ecosystems), Commission on Ecosystem Management,IUCN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://in.linkedin.com/in/dhrubajyoti-ghosh-5533a114 | title=Dhrubajyoti Ghosh | publisher=LinkedIn | accessdate=28 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}, who reached this incredible but neglected part of the city searching the answer to a question: What exactly happens to the city sewage? These natural water bodies which were known just as fisheries provided the answer. Devised by local fishermen and farmers, these wetlands served, in effect, as the natural sewage treatment plant for the city. The East Kolkata Wetlands host the largest sewage fed aquaculture in the world. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}. After the decision to extend Salt Lake City by converting more wetlands in the area, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by CSOs. saved the Wetlands by a landmark judgement of Justice [[Umesh Chandra Banerjee]] of [[Calcutta High Court]].

The East Calcutta Wetlands were designated a "wetland of international importance" under the [[Ramsar Convention]] on 19 August 2002.

==Flora==
There are about 100 plant species, which have been recorded in and around the East Calcutta Wetlands. These include
sagittaria montividensis, cryptocoryene ciliata, cyperus spp., crostichum aureum, lpomoea aquatica, etc. The sunderbans used to extend up to patuli in the 1950s.

Several kinds of water hyacinths grow across these wetlands. Local farmers and fisher folk use water hyacinth to create a buffer between land and water to minimize erosion.

The area is also home to large numbers of coconut and betel nut trees. Many varieties of vegetables are farmed here, including cauliflower, eggplant, pumpkin, sunflower and sacred basil. Tracts of land are dedicated to paddy cultivation as well.

==Fauna==
Numerous species of fish are farmed in the sewage fed ponds called bheris in the East Kolkata wetlands. These include silver carp, tilapia,
The area is also home to marsh mongoose and small Indian mongoose. Palm Civet and Small Indian Civet are significant in and around East Calcutta Wetlands. Approximately 20 mammals are reported from this region. Snakes found in the East Calcutta Wetland include Checkered keel back (Xenochrophis piscator), Smooth water snake (Enhydris enhydris), Buff striped keel back (Amphiesma stolata), and Bronze back tree snake (Tendrelaphis pristis) It is the Type locality of a mammalian species, called Salt Lake Marsh Mongoose. Over 40 species of birds can be spotted at the wetlands. The process of urbanisation however, is leading to the disappearance of many bird species from the area.(Ghosh,A,K, 2004)

Kolkata is an example of how natural wetlands are sometimes being utilized in developing countries. Using the purification capacity of wetlands, the Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta) has pioneered a system of [[sewage]] disposal. Built to house one million people, Kolkata is now home to over 10 million, many living in slums. But the 8,000-hectare East Kolkata Wetlands Ramsar Site, a patchwork of tree-fringed canals, vegetable plots, rice paddies and fish ponds – and the 20,000 people that work in them – daily transform one-third of the city's sewage and most of its domestic refuse into a rich harvest of fish and fresh vegetables. For example, the Mudially Fishermen's Cooperative Society is a collective of 300 families that lease 70 hectares into which wastewater from the city is released. Through a series of natural treatment processes – including the use of [[Eichhornia crassipes]] and other plants for absorbing oil, grease and heavy metals – the Cooperative has turned the area into a thriving fish farm and nature park.

==Controversy==
Recently illegal [[landfills]] are on the rise and the wetlands are being slowly assimilated in the stream city. This unprecedented land development and urbanization are creating concerns about the impact on the environment. This is because the [[wetlands]] serve as a natural sponge absorbing excess rainfall and doing its bit to reduce [[pollution]].
Wetlands are under threat due to exponential expansion of real-estate projects in eastern Kolkata especially in the Salt Lake and Rajarhat sectors.

==Microbial Biodiversity==
Microbial Diversity is an integral part of biodiversity which includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, protozoa and protists (Ghosh, A., 2007). East Kolkata Wetland shows an immense diversity of flora and fauna both at the macro and micro level. Microbial richness of a region is its unseen asset that needs to be explored and conserved. Soil samples collected from ECW shows the presence of various new strains of microbes which are not only ecologically important but also have commercial value (Ghosh, A., 2007). These include Actinobacteria which are responsible for the degradation of nitrophenol, nitroaromatic compounds, pesticides and herbicides; Proteobacteria related to the bioremediation of heavy metals, degradation and recycling of woody tissues of plants, oil contaminated soil and toxic compounds and nitrogen fixation along with the cyanobacters; other bacteria playing important roles in metal accumulation, oil degradation, antimicrobial compound production, enzyme production etc. (Ghosh, A., 2007).

==EKWMA==
The East Kolkata Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Act, 2006 represents an important landmark as it paved way for establishment of the East Kolkata Wetlands Management Authority (EKWMA) for conservation and management of the EKW. The EKWMA is constituted under Section 3 of the Act, 2006. In 2017 Section 3(2) of the Act, 2006 has been amended and the composition of the EKWMA has been changed. The EKWMA is a thirteen (13) member body with the Chief Secretary, Government of West Bengal, Secretaries of different Departments of State Govt. as well as four experts nominated by the State Govt. under the chairmanship of Minister-in-Charge, Department of Environment, Government of West Bengal.
The EKWMA is guided by the East Kolkata Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Act, 2006, the East Kolkata Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2006, and the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://ekwma.in/ek/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecosynthesis''' is the use of [[introduced species]] to fill niches in a disrupted environment, with the aim of increasing the speed of ecological restoration. This decreases the amount of physical damage done in a disrupted landscape. An example is using willow in a stream corridor for sediment and phosphorus capture.&lt;ref&gt;Tane, Hakai (1995) Ecography. Mapping and Modelling Landscape Ecosystems. Canberra: The Murray-Darling Basin Commission&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to aid ecological restoration which, is the practice of renewing and restoring degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems and habitats in the environment by active human intervention and action. Humans ecosynthesis to make environments more suitable for life, through restoration ecology (introduced species, vegetation mapping, habitat enhancement, remediation and mitigation.) &lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, David (2002) Permaculture. Principles and Pathways beyond Sustainability. Hepburn, Victoria: Holmgren Design Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planetary Ecosynthesis==

==Restoration Ecology==
Ecological restoration aims to recreate, initiate, or accelerate the recovery of an ecosystem that has been disturbed.&lt;ref name=K.&gt;[https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/restoration-ecology-13339059 K. J. Vaughn Restoration Ecology, (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revegetation''': the establishment of vegetation on sites where it has been previously lost, often with erosion control as the primary goal.

'''Habitat enhancement''': the process of increasing the suitability of a site as habitat for some desired species.

'''Remediation''': improving an existing ecosystem or creating a new one with the aim of replacing another that has deteriorated or been destroyed.

'''Mitigation''': legally mandated remediation for loss of protected species or an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=K./&gt;

Through [[restoration ecology]] humans can help ecosystems that we have either caused harm to or disturbed be brought back to  functional state.

==Trophic Cascade==
[[File:Gray wolf (8952676448).jpg|thumb|Gray wolf in YellowStone National Park]] A clear example of humans ecosynthesiszing would be through the introduction of a species to cause a [[trophic cascade]], which is the result of indirect effects between nonadjacent trophic levels in a food chain or food web, such as the top predator in a food chain and a plant.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Eisenberg, (2010), The wolf's tooth : keystone predators, trophic cascades, and biodiversity,[https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/reader.action?docID=3317488]&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example of a trophic cascade is that of the introduction of wolves to YellowStone National Park, which had extradionary effects to the ecosystem. Yellowstone National Park had a massive population of elk because they had no predators, which caused the local [[aspen]] population and other vegetation to significantly decrease in population size. However, the introduction of wolves controlled the elk population and indirectly affected the aspen and other vegetation. This brought the ecosystem back to a sustainable life.&lt;ref&gt;C. A.

[[File:Eight Thousanders Map.png|{{largethumb}}|Locations of the 14 ''eight-thousanders'' in the world]]

The [[International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation]] or [[UIAA]] recognise '''eight-thousanders''' as the 14 [[mountain]]s that are more than {{convert|8000|m|ft|0}} in height above [[sea level]], and are considered to be sufficiently independent from neighbouring peaks.  However, there is no precise definition of the criteria used to assess independence and since 2012, the UIAA has been involved in a process to consider whether the list should be expanded to 20 mountains.  All eight-thousanders are located in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] and [[Karakoram]] mountain ranges in [[Asia]], and their summits are in the [[death zone]].

==History of climbing all eight-thousanders==
[[File:Flight over himalaya annotated.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Flight over [[Khumbu]]-region; six eight-thousanders and some ''seven-thousanders'' are visible]]

The first recorded attempt on an eight-thousander was when [[Albert F. Mummery]] and [[J. Norman Collie]] tried to climb Pakistan's [[Nanga Parbat]] in 1895. The attempt was unsuccessful when Mummery and two [[Gurkha]]s, Ragobir, and Goman Singh, were killed by an [[avalanche]].&lt;ref name=Mummery1895/&gt;

The first recorded successful ascent of an eight-thousander was by the French [[Maurice Herzog]] and [[Louis Lachenal]], who on the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition]] reached the summit of [[Annapurna]] on 3 June 1950.&lt;ref name=Herzog1951/&gt; The first winter ascent of an eight-thousander was done by a Polish team led by [[Andrzej Zawada]] on [[Mount Everest]]. Two
climbers [[Leszek Cichy]] and  [[Krzysztof Wielicki]] reached the summit on 17 February 1980.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1984_files/AJ%201984%2050-59%20Zawada%20Everest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders was the Italian [[Reinhold Messner]], on 16 October 1986. In 1987, Polish climber [[Jerzy Kukuczka]] became the second person to accomplish this feat. Kukuczka is also the man who established the most new routes (9) on the main eight-thousanders. Messner summited each of the 14 peaks without the aid of supplemental [[oxygen]]. This feat was not repeated until nine years later by the Swiss [[Erhard Loretan]] in 1995. [[Phurba Tashi]] of Nepal has completed the most climbs of the eight-thousanders, with 30 ascents between 1998 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=20198|title=Preliminary stats: Himalaya and Everest 2011 spring review|publisher=ExplorersWeb|date=8 June 2013|subscription=yes|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juanito Oiarzabal]] has completed the second most, with a total of 25 ascents between 1985 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8000ers.com/cms/en/news-mainmenu-176/1-latest/283-lhotse-summits.html|title=Lhotse Summits|publisher=8000ers.com|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of| November 2018}}, the country with the most climbers to have climbed all 14 eight-thousanders is [[Italy]] with seven climbers, followed by [[Spain]] with six climbers, and [[South Korea]] with five climbers. [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Poland]] have three climbers each that completed the "Crown of the Himalaya".

The proposed 6 new eight-thousander peaks would not meet the wider UIAA criteria of 600 meters of elevation change between standalone peaks, called [[topographic prominence]], as used by the UIAA elsewhere for major mountains (the lowest prominence of the existing list of 14 eight-thousanders is Lothse, at 610 metres).&lt;ref name="horr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markhorrell.com/blog/2014/a-funny-name-for-a-mountain/|title=A funny name for a mountain|publisher=Mark Horrell|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, only Broad Peak Central, with a topographic prominence of 181 meters, would even meet the 150–metre prominence threshold to be a British Isles [[List of Marilyns in the British Isles|Marilyn]].&lt;ref name="horr1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.markhorrell.com/blog/2013/do-we-really-need-more-8000m-peaks/|title=Do we really need more 8000m peaks|publisher=Mark Horrell|date=23 October 2013|quote=The most prominent one, Broad Peak Central is just 196m high and the least prominent, Lhotse Middle, is a meagre 60m. To put this in context, the highest mountain in Malta is 253m, while the Eiffel Tower stands a whopping 300m.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the appeal noted the UIAA's 1994 reclassification of Alpine 4,000 metre peaks where a prominence threshold of 30–metres was used, amongst other criteria; the logic being that if 30–metres worked for 4,000 metres summits, then 60–metres should work for 8,000m summits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theuiaa.org/mountaineering/mountain-classification/|title=UIAA Mountain Classification: 4,000ERS OF THE ALPS|date=March 1994|publisher=[[UIAA]]|quote=Topographic criterium: for each summit, the level difference between it and the highest adjacent pass or notch should be at least 30 m (calculated as average of the summits at the limit of acceptability). An additional criterium can be the horizontal distance between a summit and the base of another adjacent 4000er.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{As of| November 2018}}, there has been no conclusion by the UIAA and the proposals appear to have been set aside.

=== Climbers with disputed ascents===
Claims in which not enough evidence was provided to verify the ascents of all 14 peaks. The disputed ascent in each claim is shown in parentheses.  In most cases, the influential Himalayan chronicler [[Elizabeth Hawley]], is an important source regarding the fact-base of the dispute. Her well-regarded ''[[The Himalayan Database]]'' is the source for other online Himalayan ascent databases (e.g. AdventureStats.com).&lt;ref name="haw1"&gt;If a mountaineer wants worldwide recognition that they have reached the summit of some of the most formidable mountains in the world, they will need to get the approval of Elizabeth Hawley.{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-10268549|title=Elizabeth Hawley, unrivalled Himalayan record keeper|publisher=BBC News|date=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haw2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/obituaries/elizabeth-hawley-who-chronicled-everest-treks-dies-at-94.html|title=Elizabeth Hawley, Who Chronicled Everest Treks, Dies at 94|publisher=New York Times|date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cho Oyu]] is a recurrent problem peak as it is a small hump circa 30 mins into the summit plateau, and the main proxy - "Did you see Everest" - requires clear weather.&lt;ref&gt;I have summitted Cho Oyu 4 times and will be heading for my fifth this coming season. Each time I have watched the Koreans and Japanese go only to where they can see Everest, not the summit, because they know this is what will be asked.{{cite web|url= https://explorersweb.com/2017/05/09/cho-oyu-summit-where-is-it-exactly-2017-05-09-60289/|title=Cho Oyu summit: Where is it exactly|publisher=Explorersweb.com|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many people who climb Cho Oyu in Tibet stop at a set of prayer flags with views of Everest and believe they’ve reached the top, unaware they still have to walk for 15 minutes across the summit plateau until they can see the Gokyo Lakes in Nepal.{{cite web|url= http://www.markhorrell.com/blog/2014/when-is-a-summit-not-a-summit/|title=When is a summit not a summit?|publisher=Mark Horrell|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Shishapangma]] is another problem peak because of its dual summits, which despite being close in height, are up to two hours climbing time apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12199129002/Asia-Tibet-Cho-Oyu-and-Shisha-Pangma-Central-West-Summit|title=Asia, Tibet, Cho Oyu and Shisha Pangma Central (West) Summit|publisher=American Alpine Journal|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Elizabeth Hawley]] famously got [[Ed Viesturs]] to re-climb the main summit of [[Shishapangma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Keeper-Mountains-Elizabeth-Hawley-Story/dp/1927330157|title=Keeper of the Mountains: The Elizabeth Hawley Story|page=185-195|publisher=Rocky Mountain Books|date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Energy Policy Act of 2005''' ({{USPL|109|58}}) is a [[Act of Congress|bill]] passed by the [[United States Congress]] on July 29, 2005, and signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on August 8, 2005, at [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].  The act, described by proponents as an attempt to combat growing energy problems, changed [[US energy policy]] by providing [[Energy subsidies#Allocation of subsidies in the United States|tax incentives]] and loan guarantees for energy production of various types.

The [[Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935]] was repealed, effective February 2006, by the passing of this act.&lt;ref name="repeal" /&gt;

==Provisions==
===General provisions===
* The bill exempted fluids used in the natural gas extraction process of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) from protections under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], [[Clean Water Act]], [[Safe Drinking Water Act]], and [[CERCLA]] ("Superfund").&lt;ref name="Kosnik"/&gt;
* Under an amendment in the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], Section 406, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes [[loan guarantee]]s for innovative technologies that avoid [[greenhouse gases]], which might include advanced [[nuclear reactor]] designs, such as [[pebble bed modular reactor]]s (PBMRs) as well as [[carbon capture and storage]] and [[renewable energy]];
* the Act increases the amount of [[biofuel]] (usually [[ethanol]]) that must be mixed with gasoline sold in the United States to {{convert|4|e9USgal|m3}} by 2006, {{convert|6.1|e9USgal|m3}} by 2009 and {{convert|7.5|e9USgal|m3}} by 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/oust/fedlaws/publ_109-058.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303163112/http://www.epa.gov/oust/fedlaws/publ_109-058.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  two years later, the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] extended the target to {{convert|36|e9USgal|m3}} by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| &lt;!-- url= http://www.emerging-markets.com/biodiesel/pdf/Forbes_%20Biofuels%20Bright%20Future_ByWillThurmond_EmergingMarketsOnline.pdf --&gt; | format=[[PDF]] |title= Biofuels’ Bright Future | author= Will Thurman |date= November 17, 2008 | work= Forbes | publisher= emerging-markets.com | accessdate=2011-04-08| quote= In December 2007, with the imminent arrival of $100-per-[[Barrel (unit)#Oil barrel|barrel oil]], the U.S. Congress swiftly acted to upgrade the 2005 biofuels initiative and RFS from its original target of {{convert|7|e9USgal|m3}} by 2012 to a revised [[Renewable Fuel Standard|RFS]] target (passed in December 2007) of {{convert|36|e9USgal|m3}} of biofuels production by 2022.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* it seeks to increase [[coal]] as an energy source while also reducing air pollution, through authorizing $200 million annually for clean coal initiatives, repealing the current {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} cap on coal leases, allowing the advanced payment of royalties from coal mines and requiring an assessment of coal resources on federal lands that are not national parks;
* it authorizes tax credits for [[wind energy|wind]] and other [[alternative energy]] producers;
* it adds ocean energy sources, including [[wave]] and [[tidal power]] for the first time as separately identified, renewable technologies;
* it authorizes $50 million annually over the life of the law for biomass grants;
* it includes provisions aimed at making [[geothermal energy]] more competitive with fossil fuels in generating electricity;
* it requires the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] to:
** study and report on existing natural energy resources including wind, solar, waves and tides;
** study and report on national benefits of [[demand response]] and make a recommendation on achieving specific levels of benefits and encourages [[time-based pricing]] and other forms of demand response as a policy decision;
** designate [[National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor]]s where there are significant [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] limitations adversely affecting the public (the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] may authorize federal permits for transmission projects in these regions);
** report in one year on how to dispose of [[High level waste|high-level nuclear waste]];
* it authorizes the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] to grant leases for activity that involves the production, transportation or transmission of energy on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]] lands from sources other than gas and oil (Section 388);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* it requires all [[Public utility|public]] [[Electric utility|electric utilities]] to offer [[net metering]] on request to their customers;
* it prohibits the manufacture and importation of [[mercury-vapor lamp]] ballasts after January 1, 2008;
* it provides [[tax break]]s for those making [[energy conservation]] improvements to their homes;
* it provides incentives to companies to [[Offshore drilling|drill for oil]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]];
* it exempts oil and gas producers from certain requirements of the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]];

In Congressional bills, an "authorization" of a discretionary program is a permission to spend money IF money has been appropriated; while an [[appropriation bill|"appropriation"]] is the provision of funds so it can be spent. The authorizations above will not get carried out if money is never appropriated for them.

=== Change to daylight saving time ===
{{further|Daylight saving time in the United States}}
The bill amends the [[Uniform Time Act]] of 1966 by changing the start and end dates of [[daylight saving time]], beginning in 2007. Clocks were set ahead one hour on the second Sunday of March (March 11, 2007) instead of on the first Sunday of April (April 1, 2007). Clocks were set back one hour on the first Sunday in November (November 4, 2007), rather than on the last Sunday of October (October 28, 2007). This had the net effect of slightly lengthening the duration of daylight saving time.

Lobbyists for this provision included the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, the [[National Association of Convenience Stores]], and the National [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]] Foundation Fighting Blindness.

Lobbyists against this provision included the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]], the [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]], the National [[Parent-Teacher Association]], the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium, the [[Edison Electric Institute]], and the [[Air Transport Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/07/26/dim_witted_proposal_for_daylight_time/|title=Dim-witted proposal for daylight time|work=Boston Globe|author=Alex Beam|date=2005-07-26|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section of the act is controversial; some have questioned whether daylight saving results in net energy savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ryan Kellogg |author2=Hendrik Wolff |title=Does extending daylight saving time save energy? Evidence from an Australian experiment|version=CSEM WP 163|publisher=University of California Energy Institute|format=PDF|date=January 2007|url=http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/PDF/csemwp163.pdf|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial building deduction===
The Act created the Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Tax Deduction, a special financial incentive designed to reduce the initial cost of investing in [[Green building|energy-efficient building]] systems via an accelerated tax deduction under section §179D of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC)[https://web.archive.org/web/20120628180426/http://www.capitalreviewgroup.com/energy-certification/179d-tax-deduction/] Many building owners are unaware that the [Policy Act of 2005] includes a tax deduction (§179D) for investments in "energy efficient commercial building property" designed to significantly reduce the heating, cooling, water heating and interior lighting cost of new or existing commercial buildings placed into service between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2013.
§179D includes full and partial tax deductions for investments in energy efficient commercial building that are designed to increase the efficiency of energy-consuming functions. Up to $.60 for lighting, $.60 for HVAC and $.60 for building envelope, creating a potential deduction of $1.80 per sq/ft. Interior lighting may also be improved using the Interim Lighting Rule, which provides a simplified process to earn the Deduction, capped at $0.30-$0.60/square foot. Improvements are compared to a baseline of [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|ASHRAE]] 2001 standards.&lt;ref name="cbd2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lightingtaxdeduction.org/ |title=NEMA website dedicated to lighting aspects of the Commercial Buildings Tax Deduction |accessdate=2010-04-05 |author=DiLouie, Craig |work= |publisher=[[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] (NEMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain these benefits the facilities/energy division of a business, its tax department, and a firm specializing in EPAct 179D deductions needed to cooperate. IRS mandated software had to be used and an independent 3rd party had to certify the qualification. For municipal buildings, benefits were passed through to the primary designers/architects in an attempt to encourage innovative municipal design.

The Commercial Buildings Tax Deduction expiration date had been extended twice, last by the [[Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008]]. With this extension, the CBTD could be claimed for qualifying projects completed before January 1, 2014.&lt;ref name="cbd2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goulding|first=Charles|title=EPAct Section 179D|url=http://www.energytaxsavers.com/About.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy management===
The commercial building tax deductions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/179d-commercial-buildings-energy-efficiency-tax-deduction |title=§179D Commercial Buildings Energy Efficiency Tax Deduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; could be used to improve the payback period of a prospective energy improvement investment. The deductions could be combined by participating in demand response programs where building owners agree to curtail usage at peak times for a premium. The most common qualifying projects were in the area of lighting.

===Energy savings===

Percentages permitted under Notice 2006-52
&lt;small&gt;(Effective for property placed in service January 1, 2006 – December 31, 2008)&lt;/small&gt;
* Interior Lighting Systems 16⅔%, 
* Heating, Cooling, Ventilation, and Hot Water Systems 16⅔%, 
* Building Envelope 16⅔%.
Percentages permitted under Notice 2008-40
&lt;small&gt;(Effective for property placed in service January 1, 2006 – December 31, 2013)&lt;/small&gt;
* Interior Lighting Systems 20%,
* Heating, Cooling, Ventilation, and Hot Water Systems 20%,
* Building Envelope 10%. 
Percentages permitted under Notice 2012-22
* Interior Lighting Systems 25%,
* Heating, Cooling, Ventilation, and Hot Water Systems 15%, 
* Building Envelope 10%.
Effective date of Notice 2012-22 – December 31, 2013; if §179D is extended beyond December 31, 2013, is also effective (except as otherwise provided in an amendment of §179D or the guidance thereunder) during the period of the extension.

==Cost estimate==
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] review of the conference version of the bill estimated the Act will increase direct spending by $2.2 billion over the 2006-2010 period, and by $1.6 billion over the 2006-2015 period. The CBO did not attempt to estimate additional effects on discretionary spending.
The CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the legislation would reduce revenues by $7.9 billion over the 2005-2010 period and by $12.3 billion over the 2005-2015 period.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Support==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}
The collective reduction in national consumption of energy (gas and electricity) is significant for home heating. The Act provided gible financial incentives (tax credits) for average homeowners to make environmentally positive changes to their homes.  It made improvements to home energy use more affordable for walls, doors, windows, roofs, water heaters, etc.  Consumer spending, and hence the national economy, was abetted.  Industry grew for manufacture of these environmentally positive improvements.  These positive improvements have been near and long-term in effect.

The collective reduction in national consumption of oil is significant for automotive vehicles.  The Act provided tangible financial incentives (tax credits) for operators of hybrid vehicles.  It helped fuel competition among auto makers to meet rising demands for [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel-efficient vehicles]].  Consumer spending, and hence the national economy, was abetted.  Dependence on imported oil was reduced.  The national trade deficit was improved.  Industry grew for manufacture of these environmentally positive improvements.  These positive improvements have been near and long-term in effect.

==Criticism==
* The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' contended that the spending bill was a broad collection of subsidies for United States energy companies; in particular, the nuclear and oil industries.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, Michael and Juliet Eilperin. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/29/AR2005072901128.html Energy Bill Raises Fears About Pollution, Fraud Critics Point to Perks for Industry]." ''The Washington Post''. July 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Speaking for the National Republicans for Environmental Protection Association, President Martha Marks said that the organization was disappointed in the bill because it did not support conservation enough, and continued to subsidize the well-established oil and gas industries that didn't require subsidizing.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8870039/ Bush signs $12.3 billion energy bill into law]." ''MSNBC''. August 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The bill did not include provisions for drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] (ANWR); some Republicans claimed "access to the abundant [[oil reserves]] in ANWR would strengthen America's energy independence without harming the environment."&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Peyton. "[http://www.nationalcenter.org/TSR111005.html Small Group of House Republicans Derails ANWR Drilling] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803110211/http://nationalcenter.org/TSR111005.html |date=2014-08-03 }}." Washington, DC: [http://www.nationalcenter.org/ The National Center for Public Policy Research]. November 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] criticized Senator [[Barack Obama]]'s vote for the bill in the [[2008 Democratic Primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_557416.html | title=Clinton preaches to her choir | author=Zito, Salena | publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' | date=March 15, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The bill exempted fluids used in the natural gas extraction process of [[hydraulic fracturing]] (''fracking'') from protections under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], [[Clean Water Act]], [[Safe Drinking Water Act]], and [[CERCLA]].&lt;ref name="Kosnik"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthworksaction.org/pubs/PetroleumExemptions1c.pdf |title=The Oil and Gas Industry's Exclusions and Exemptions to Major Environmental Statutes |author=Kosnik, Renee Lewis MSEL, JD |publisher=''Earthworks' Oil and Gas Accountability Project http://www.ogap.org'' |date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It created a loophole that exempts companies drilling for natural gas from disclosing the chemicals involved in fracking operations that would normally be required under federal clean water laws. ''See'' [[Exemptions for hydraulic fracturing under United States federal law]]. This exclusion has been called the "Halliburton Loophole". [[Halliburton]] is the world's largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services.&lt;ref name="Halliburton Loop"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-01/epa-shrinking-halliburton-loophole-threatens-obama-gas-pledge.html |title=EPA Shrinking ‘Halliburton Loophole’ Threatens Obama Gas Pledge |author=Mark Drajem and Katarzyna Klimasinska |date=1 February 2012 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was a response to a recommendation from the [[Energy Task Force]], chaired by [[Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=United States.

== History ==

The autogyro is the last remaining type of aircraft which has not a yet been used to circumnavigate the globe.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BJR"/&gt; The expedition was the first attempt ever to fly an autogyro around the Earth, a trip of about 25,000 miles (40,000&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="Weather halts"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/north_yorkshire/3620876.stm BBC news] Weather halts record flight bid&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chess"&gt;[http://www.chess-dynamics.com/news_previous.html Mission Description from Chess Dynamics (sponsor)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616061030/http://www.chess-dynamics.com/news_previous.html |date=16 June 2008 }} Quote: "Expedition Global Eagle is the worlds first attempt to fly around the world in an autogyro. Global Eagle departed in April 2004 and will take approximately three and a half months to complete its journey. which will see the gyroplane visit 25 different countries."&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2003, a year before the circumnavigation attempt, the ''Global Eagle'' broke the world range record  by flying non-stop from [[Culdrose]] in [[Cornwall]] to [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] in [[Scotland]], a total of 580 miles (928&amp;nbsp;km), after a flight lasting 7 hours and 23 minutes, breaking the old record of either 543.27 statute miles (874.32&amp;nbsp;km) or 869.23&amp;nbsp;km (540.11&amp;nbsp;mi){{clarify|date=January 2010}} &lt;!-- was 543.27  miles (869.23&amp;nbsp;km) which do not agree--&gt; held by [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Ken Wallis]].&lt;ref name="BJR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Northern Echo"&gt;[http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2003/2/25/102431.html Pilot celebrates distance record in '007' gyroplane From the Northern Echo, first published Tuesday 25 February 2003.] Quote: "After his landing yesterday he said: "I am absolutely delighted. There were several tricky moments but the journey has gone very well. I am now looking forward to celebrating with the rest of the team in Wick later on." He said the flight had uncovered teething problems with the aircraft, Global Eagle, which would now be put right before he sets out on his next record attempt—flying round the world in June. "Soon after setting out I lost power to the radio and drifted off course towards America, without a visa. "I was forced to fly above the cloud over Wales, which was a totally new experience in an open-cockpit. "The hairiest bit was flying for about 50 miles over open sea, which is all right in a twin-engined helicopter but a different matter in a single-engined gyroplane. If the engine cuts out then that is it, you are down. "One thing that will need a rethink is the design of the cockpit—there was no room to read a map.""&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20030225/ai_n12678876 Army pilot breaks gyroplane flight record Independent, The (London),  25 February 2003 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lynx"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/north_yorkshire/3658535.stm BBC news] Army pilot's gyroplane record bid 26 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="story"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040711002725/http://www.globaleagle.co.uk/gyroplane_story.htm Story of the record]&lt;/ref&gt; During the record-breaking trip Jones drifted toward [[North America]] due to a broken radio, before finally correcting the course. While flying over [[Wales]] he had to fly over the clouds in the open cockpit of the autogyro.&lt;ref name="Northern Echo"/&gt; He also flew for approximately 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) over the [[North Sea]] which, as he acknowledged during an interview, was a dangerous course due to the fact the autogyro only had one engine and therefore in case it cut-off there would be no alternative solution but to crash land in the water.&lt;ref name="Northern Echo"/&gt; The average flight altitude was 4,000&amp;nbsp;ft and the average speed was 70&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="Northern Echo"/&gt; In 2004, Jones, a [[Lynx helicopter]] pilot,&lt;ref name="Lynx"/&gt; was one of 75 licensed autogyro pilots in the UK.&lt;ref name="yorkshirepost 1"&gt;[http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/Yorkshire-pilot-speaks-of-nerves.774175.jp Yorkshire pilot speaks of nerves over world trip] Published Date: 15 April 2004 Julie Hemmings&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2003 the original Eagle suffered an accident during landing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magnigyro.com/USA/S.A.%20Newsletter/Magni%20news%20letter%20may_03.pdf Magni South Africa Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119154431/http://www.magnigyro.com/USA/S.A.%20Newsletter/Magni%20news%20letter%20may_03.pdf |date=19 November 2008 }} p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumnavigation attempt trip commenced on 26 April 2004 under the patronage of General Sir [[Michael Walker, Baron Walker of Aldringham|Michael Walker]],&lt;ref name="BJR"&gt;[http://www.bjr.co.uk/news-main.html BJR Systems] Quote: "General Sir Michael Walker, Chief of Defence Staff, is the patron of Expedition Global Eagle." and "The autogyro is now on the brink of making aviation history and in the bid to do so, WO2 Jones will closely follow the route taken by Brian Milton in 1998, when he became the first person to fly a microlight around the world." and "The autogyro is the last remaining class of aircraft yet to circumnavigate the globe."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of Defence Staff]] of the [[British Armed Forces]] and it was supposed to last about three and a half months. The autogyro flight was to have touched down in twenty five countries with frequent landings due to the limited range of the autogyro.&lt;ref name="Chess"/&gt; The ''Global Eagle'''s route was planned to approximately follow the flightpath taken by [[Brian Milton]] in 1998 when he became the first person to circumnavigate the globe using a [[microlight]].&lt;ref name="BJR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Route 1"/&gt; Due to technical difficulties with the original gyrocopter the gyro at launch was supplied by the Italian manufacturer ''Magni Gyro'' which also supplied spare parts and technical assistance to the expedition.&lt;ref name="Magni Gyro Details"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040611044601/http://globaleagle.co.uk/aircraft.htm Magni Gyro Details from Global Eagle Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magni Gyro Barry"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040925202900/http://globaleagle.co.uk/gallery_show.php?id_gla=25 Picture of Barry Jones and his Magni Gyro]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="magnigyro"/&gt; The new gyro featured a new colour scheme and the eagle logo was not used.&lt;ref name="Magni Gyro Barry"/&gt;

The expedition successfully completed the [[Europe]]an leg of the journey which included [[Oostende]], [[Belgium]], [[Friedrichshafen]], [[Germany]], the [[Alps]], [[Bolzano]], [[Trento]], [[Casaleggio Novara]], the location of the Magni airfield in [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040908210958/http://globaleagle.co.uk/gallery_show.php?id_gla=125 Picture of Barry Jones while flying over Italy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forlì]], [[Pescara]], [[Bari]], [[Italy]], [[Corfu]], [[Athens]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040908205225/http://globaleagle.co.uk/gallery_show.php?id_gla=75 Picture of Barry Jones at Athens airport]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mykonos]], [[Kos]] and [[Rhodes]],  in [[Greece]] and the military base of [[RAF Akrotiri|Akrotiri]] in [[Cyprus]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040706180606/http://globaleagle.co.uk/gallery_show.php?id_gla=83 Picture at Acrotiri Cyprus]&lt;/ref&gt; albeit with delays.&lt;ref name="Journey 1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040621194411/http://www.globaleagle.co.uk/ Global Eagle website details]&lt;/ref&gt; The journey through the Alps was very difficult because Jones had to climb to 10,000 feet over the Alps where it was extremely windy.&lt;ref name="Gulf News"/&gt; Jones also had to make a [[forced landing]] in the [[Italian Alps]].&lt;ref name="Weather halts"/&gt; Also the trip from Athens to Akrotiri over the [[Mediterranean]] proved very frightening because flying over the water, with only a few ships below, meant that it would be very difficult to get any help in case of a mishap.&lt;ref name="Gulf News"/&gt;  From Akrotiri, Global Eagle went to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], [[Turaif]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Arar, Saudi Arabia|Arar]], [[Hafr Al-Batin]], [[Qaisumah]], [[Jubail]], [[Bahrain]], [[Abu Dhabi]] in the [[Arab Emirates]] and [[Muscat, Oman]].&lt;ref name="Journey 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040904075244/http://globaleagle.co.uk/gallery_show.php?id_gla=106 Picture at Bahrain airport showing the autogyro]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="desert"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041029200317/http://globaleagle.co.uk/gallery_show.php?id_gla=120 Picture of Brian Jones flying over the desert of Saudi Arabia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040904075644/http://globaleagle.co.uk/gallery_show.php?id_gla=109 Picture of Global Eagle at Bahrain airport]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Over Jordan and Saudi Arabia, Jones had to fly over the [[desert]] for hours and to battle [[Dust storm|sandstorms]] and hot weather at low altitudes while at higher altitudes it would become very cold.&lt;ref name="desert"/&gt; Further, communication was impossible while flying over the desert because of a lack of ground stations and the atmospheric conditions prevailing in the area. While there, Jones had to communicate with commercial aircraft flying over the desert which would then relay his messages to the ground stations at the local airports. A [[Saudia]] flight helped him approach and land at [[Turaif]].&lt;ref name="Gulf News"/&gt; 

Subsequently Jones arrived at [[Abu Dhabi]] and from there he flew to [[Muscat, Oman]] and then [[Gawadar]] and [[Ormara]] in [[Pakistan]] and, finally, [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name="Journey 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040904075533/http://globaleagle.co.uk/gallery_show.php?id_gla=138 Picture of Barry Jones over the sea of Oman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040904075548/http://globaleagle.co.uk/gallery_show.php?id_gla=134 Picture taken while flying over Muscat Harbour]&lt;/ref&gt; The flight from Muscat to Karachi broke the record for the longest flight over water by an autogyro and lasted six hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/The-Eagle-has-landed-.875323.jp The Yorkshire Post] The Eagle has landed – but pilot vows to try again Quote: "509-mile flight from Muscat to Karachi, the longest over water by an autogyro" 22 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

From Karachi, Jones flew the autogyro to [[India]] where it navigated  to  [[Ahmedabad]], [[Udaipur]], [[Jaipur]], [[New Delhi]], [[Bareilly]], [[Gorakhpur]], [[Patna]] and [[Baghdogra]], sometimes through sandstorms, and finally landed during [[monsoon]] rains in the army base of [[Guwahati]].&lt;ref name="Weather halts"/&gt; The delays incurred in the European leg of the journey proved damaging to the effort because Jones was forced to arrive in India during monsoon season. The monsoons he encountered were the worst in 20 years with 100 people killed in the Guwahati area alone.&lt;ref name="yorkshirepost 2"&gt;[http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/Record-attempt-in-doubt-after.869160.jp Record attempt in doubt after gyro is damaged] Published Date: 12 October 2004 DISASTER has struck a Yorkshire-based pilot's attempt to set a world record by flying an autogyro from England to Australia single handed.

Jones and his support team then returned to the UK in order to revise the plans for the truncated trip to Australia. Upon returning to India they discovered that the gyro while at the army base of [[Guwahati]] had spent time submerged in water. The [[transponder]], the [[radio]] and the rest of the instruments were damaged. As well, the flying controls and the cables needed to be replaced. The damage totalled £10,000 and could not be raised on time.&lt;ref name="GE termination"/&gt; In addition the team members, being soldiers, had to return to [[active duty]] by early 2005. This led to the attempt being abandoned.&lt;ref name="Flyer UK"/&gt; The trip when cancelled had covered between 6,550&amp;ndash;7,500 miles (10,480&amp;ndash;12,100&amp;nbsp;km) and had lasted for four months due to the delays experienced, averaging approximately 350 miles per flight day.&lt;ref name="Weather halts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="magnigyro"&gt;[http://www.magnigyro.it/inglese/impieghi.htm Magnigyro website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303130214/http://www.magnigyro.it/inglese/impieghi.htm |date=3 March 2011 }} Quote:"The “Eagle” _ as the gyro is named _ left Middle Wallop (England) on 26th April 2003 and reached India after nearly 4 months’ flying over land and sea.

==Description==

[[File:Typhoonsizes.jpg|thumb|The relative sizes of [[Typhoon Tip]], [[Cyclone Tracy]], and the [[United States]].]]

In order to form a hypercane, according to Emanuel's hypothetical model, the ocean temperature would have to be at least 49&amp;nbsp;°C (120&amp;nbsp;°F). A critical difference between a hypercane and present-day hurricanes, is that a hypercane would extend into the upper [[stratosphere]], whereas present-day hurricanes extend into only the lower stratosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |first=Kerry |last=Emanuel |title=Hypercane |work=Mega Disasters |publisher=History Channel |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypercanes would have wind speeds of over {{convert|800|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and would also have a central pressure of less than {{convert|70|kPa|inHg|lk=on}} (700 millibars), giving them an enormous lifespan.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; For comparison, the largest and most intense storm on record was 1979's [[Typhoon Tip]], with a wind speed of {{convert|305|km/h|mph}} and central pressure of {{convert|87|kPa|inHg|lk=on}} (870 millibars). Such a storm would be eight times more powerful than the strongest storms yet recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |first=Robert |last=Henson |title=Hypercane |work=Mega Disasters |publisher=History Channel |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extreme conditions needed to create a hypercane could conceivably produce a system up to the size of [[North America]], creating [[storm surge]]s of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an eye nearly {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} across.{{cn|date=June 2016}} The waters could remain hot enough for weeks, allowing more hypercanes to be formed. A hypercane's clouds would reach {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the [[stratosphere]]. Such an intense storm would also damage the Earth's [[ozone]].&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; Water molecules in the stratosphere would react with [[ozone]] to accelerate decay into O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and reduce absorption of [[ultraviolet light]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Mechanism==
A hurricane functions as a [[Carnot heat engine]] powered by the temperature difference between the sea and the uppermost layer of the troposphere. As air is drawn in towards the eye it acquires [[latent heat]] from evaporating sea-water, which is then released as [[sensible heat]] during the rise inside the eyewall and radiated away at the top of the storm system. The energy input is balanced by energy dissipation in a turbulent [[boundary layer]] close to the surface, which leads to an energy balance equilibrium. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

However, in Emanuel's model, if the temperature difference between the sea and the top of the troposphere is too large, there is no solution to the equilibrium equation. As more air is drawn in, the released heat reduces the central pressure further, drawing in more heat in a runaway positive feedback. The actual limit to hypercane intensity depends on other energy dissipation factors that are uncertain: whether inflow ceases to be [[isothermal]], whether [[shock waves]] would form in the outflow around the eye, or whether turbulent breakdown of the vortex happens.&lt;ref name="extinction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerry A. Emanuel. The maximum intensity of hurricanes. Journal of the atmospheric sciences. Vol 45, no 7. pp. 1143-1155. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The volcano was unknown before 1939, although "Kick 'em Jenny" appeared on earlier maps as either the name of a small island now called Diamond Rock (or Île Diamante), or the name of the strait between Grenada and Ronde Island (or Île de Ronde). The name itself may be a reference to the waters sometimes being extremely rough.&lt;ref name="USGS-01"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/WestIndies/KickEmJenny/description_kick_em_jenny.html | title=Description: Kick 'Em Jenny Volcano, West Indies | publisher=[[United States Geological Service]] | date=2001-12-12 | accessdate=2009-10-16 | last=Topinka | first=Lyn | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512101346/http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/WestIndies/KickEmJenny/description_kick_em_jenny.html | archivedate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uwiseismic.com/General.aspx?id=55 | title=Grenada - Kick 'Em Jenny Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=University of the West Indies | accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity==
The first record of the volcano was in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, Rosaly M. C. (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=eRqrEwvIvKoC&amp;pg=PA11 ''The volcano adventure guide''], [[Cambridge University Press]], Illustrated ed. p. 11. {{ISBN|0-521-55453-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it must have erupted many times before that date. On 23–24 July 1939 an eruption broke the sea surface, sending a cloud of steam and debris {{convert|275|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} into the air and generating a series of [[tsunami]]s around two metres high when they reached the coastlines of northern Grenada and the southern Grenadines. A small tsunami also reached the West coast of nearby Barbados, where 'a sea-wave' suddenly washed over a coastal road, most likely at Paynes Bay.

The volcano has erupted on at least twelve occasions between 1939 and 2001 (the last being on December 4, 2001), although none of the eruptions have been as large as the 1939 one, and most were only detected by seismographs. The larger eruptions have also been heard underwater or on land close to the volcano as a deep rumbling sound.&lt;ref name="USGS-01" /&gt;

A submersible survey in 2003 detected a crater with active [[fumarole]]s releasing cold and hot gas bubbles. Samples of fresh [[olivine]] [[basalt]] were collected. An arc shaped collapse structure appears on the west flank and was the apparent source of a submarine debris avalanche extending 15&amp;nbsp;km down the ridge slope to the west toward the [[Grenada Basin]].&lt;ref name="UVO-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/kick-039em-jenny|title=Kick-'em-Jenny, West Indies|last=Mattox|first=Steve|date=April 5, 2002|publisher=[[The University of Oregon]]|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Global Volcanism Program]] reports the summit to be {{convert|185|m|0|abbr=on}} below the sea surface.

Signs of elevated seismicity began July 11, 2015, and on July 23 a strong continuous signal was recorded by instruments observing Kick 'em Jenny, prompting authorities to raise the alert level to orange, which is the second-highest level.&lt;ref name=UWI&gt;{{cite web|title=Changed Alert Level at Kick 'em Jenny Submarine Volcano |url=http://www.uwiseismic.com/NewsDetails.aspx?id=365 |website=The University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre |accessdate=24 July 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aFasJLLt?url=http://www.uwiseismic.com/NewsDetails.aspx?id=365 |archivedate=24 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, July 24, at 0200 an hour long explosion event was recorded, scientists from the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre observed nothing out of the ordinary at the surface above the volcano during an overflight on 25 July, and by 1800 no activity was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has now been changed. On March 12, 2018 the warning has once again been raised to Orange.

==Maritime exclusion zone==
The volcano is on the shipping route from St Vincent to Grenada. There is a [[maritime exclusion zone]] monitored by the Seismic Research Centre of the University of the West Indies, Trinidad and this is normally at 1.5&amp;nbsp;km from the centre of the volcano. Bubbles of volcanic gases can lower water density, creating a sinking hazard. This is marked on marine charts. During periods of high level seismic activity this is increased to 5&amp;nbsp;km.

{{Silurian graphical timeline}}
The '''Lau event''' was the last of three relatively minor [[mass extinction]]s (the [[Ireviken event|Ireviken]], [[Mulde event|Mulde]], and '''Lau''' events ) during the [[Silurian]] period.&lt;ref&gt;The Ireviken, Mulde, and Lau events, were all closely followed by isotopic excursions.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a major effect on the [[conodont]] fauna, but barely scathed the [[graptolite]]s.  It coincided with a global low point in sea level, is closely followed by an excursion in [[geochemistry|geochemical]] [[isotope]]s in the ensuing late Ludfordian [[faunal stage]] and a change in depositional regime.&lt;ref name=loydell07&gt;{{cite journal | first=D.K. | last=Loydell | year=2007 | title=Early Silurian positive d&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C excursions and their relationship to glaciations, sea-level changes and extinction events. | journal=Geol. J. | volume=42 | pages=531–546 | doi=10.1002/gj.1090 | issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotic impact==
The Lau event started at the beginning of the late [[Ludfordian]], a subdivision of the Ludlow stage, about {{Ma|420}}.  Its [[stratum|strata]] are best exposed in [[Gotland]], [[Sweden]], taking its name from the parish of Lau.  Its base is set at the first extinction datum, in the [[Eke beds]], and despite a scarcity of data, it is apparent that most major groups suffered an increase in extinction rate during the event; major changes are observed worldwide at correlated rocks, with a "crisis" observed in populations of [[conodont]]s and [[graptolite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  More precisely, conodonts suffered in the Lau event, and graptolites in the subsequent isotopic excursion.&lt;ref name=loydell07/&gt;  Local extinctions may have played a role in many places, especially the increasingly enclosed [[Wales|Welsh]] basin; the event's relatively high [[Extinction event|severity rating]] of 6.2 does not change the fact that many life-forms became re-established shortly after the event, presumably surviving in [[Refugium (population biology)|refuge]] or in environments that have not been preserved in the geological record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Isotopic effects==
A peak in [[δ13C|{{delta|13|C}}]], accompanied by fluctuations in other isotope concentrations, is often associated with mass extinctions. Some workers have attempted to explain this event in terms of climate or sea level change&amp;nbsp;– perhaps arising due to a build-up of glaciers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Lehnert, O. |author2=Joachimski, M.M. |author3=Fryda, J. |author4=Buggisch, W. |author5=Calner, M. |author6=Jeppsson, L. |author7=Eriksson, M.E. |year=2006 |title=The Ludlow Lau Event-another Glaciation In The Silurian Greenhouse? |conference=2006 Philadelphia Annual Meeting |booktitle=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs |volume=38 |number=7 |pages=183 |issn= |doi= |url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2006AM/finalprogram/abstract_113842.htm |accessdate=2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, such factors alone do not appear to be sufficient to explain the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samtleben |first1=C. |last2=Munnecke |first2=A. |last3=Bickert |first3=T. |last4=Pätzold |first4=J. |year=1996 |title=The Silurian of Gotland (Sweden): facies interpretation based on stable isotopes in brachiopod shells |journal=International Journal of Earth Sciences |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=278–292 |doi=10.1007/bf02422234 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/E6857763723729P2.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-26 |bibcode=1996IJEaS..85..278S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative hypothesis is that changes in ocean mixing were responsible. An increase in density is required to make water downwell; the cause of this densification may have changed from hypersalinity (due to ice formation and evaporation) to temperature (due to water cooling).&lt;ref name=jeppsson00/&gt;

The {{delta|13|C}} curve slightly lags conodont extinctions, hence the two events may not represent the same thing.  Therefore, the term ''Lau event'' is used only for the extinction, not the following isotopic activity, which is named after the time period in which it occurred.&lt;ref name=loydell07/&gt;

Loydell suggests many causes of the isotopic excursion, including increased carbon burial, increased carbonate weathering, changes in atmospheric and oceanic interactions, changes in primary production, and changes in humidity or aridity.&lt;ref name=loydell07/&gt;  He uses a correlation between the events and glacially induced global sea level change to suggest that carbonate weathering is the major player, with other factors playing a less significant role.

==Sedimentological impact==
Profound sedimentary changes occurred at the beginning of the Lau event; these are probably associated with the onset of [[sea level rise]], which continued through the event, reaching a high point at the time of deposition of the [[Burgsvik beds]], after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes appear to display [[anachronism]],&lt;!--this special usage, not covered at the link, needs dab here: footnote?--&gt; marked by an increase in erosional surfaces and the return of flat-pebbled conglomerates in the Eke beds.  This is further evidence of a major blow to ecosystems of the time&amp;nbsp;– such deposits can only form in conditions similar to those of the early [[Cambrian]] period, when life as we know it was only just becoming established. Indeed, [[stromatolite]]s, which rarely form in the presence of abundant higher life forms, are observed during the Lau event and, occasionally, in the overlying Burgsvik beds;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This suite of characteristics is common to the larger [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events|end-Ordovician]] and [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|end-Permian]] extinctions.

[[File:LepIndicaVol1Cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of volume 1]]
'''''Lepidoptera Indica''''' was a 10 volume work on the butterflies of the Indian region that was begun in 1890 and completed in 1913. It was published by [[Lovell Augustus Reeve|Lovell Reeve]] and Co. of London. It has been considered the ''magnum opus'' of its author, [[Frederic Moore]], assistant curator at the museum of the East India Company. Frederic Moore described a number of new species through this publication. Moore was a splitter, often creating new genera for species and new species for what are now treated as subspecies.

==History==
[[File:LepIndicaDedication.jpg|thumb|left|Dedication]]
The series was based on a large collection of butterflies that were under the care of the curator of the Asiatic Museum, Dr Thomas Horsfield. The museum was closed in 1879 and the collection was transferred to the British Museum. Moore in his preface defined the Indian region as being roughly bounded by the Himalayan mountains in the north, Suleiman and Hala mountains in the northwest, Ceylon to the South and Burma in the East and including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Moore however died before the work could be completed and the work was then taken over by Colonel [[Charles Swinhoe]], brother of [[Robert Swinhoe]] and one of the founders of the [[Bombay Natural History Society]].

The butterfly collections that were described in this work, many of which were previously undescribed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Journal of Natural History|series=Series 6|volume= 14| issue= 84| year= 1894| doi=10.1080/00222939408677837|author= Sherborn, C. Davies |pages= 464–465| title=The dates of Moore's ‘Lepidoptera Indica.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been made by additions from numerous correspondents and collectors in the Civil and Military services from across India. The first catalogue of these collections was prepared by [[Arthur Grote]] in 1857-1859. Grote also took notes on the life histories, making use of a Munshi Zynulabdin, a local artist. Moore also noted the contributions of Sir [[Walter Elliot (ICS)|Walter Elliot]] from the Madras region, S. Nevill(e) Ward for notes from the Malabar coast, [[William Stephen Atkinson|W. S. Atkinson]], A E Russell, Colonel A M Lang (Oudh, Kashmir, Simla), Captain T. Hutton (Mussoorie), Captain H. L. de la Chaumette (Lucknow), C. Horne, Dr [[Francis Day]], W. Forsyth Hunter, Major J. Le Mesurier, Major-Gen. G. Ramsay, Lt.-Col. [[Henry Haversham Godwin-Austen|H H G Godwin-Austin]] (sic), Captain R. Bayne Reed, W. B Farr, G H Wilkinson, Dr. A. Leith, Dr. J. Shortt, Capt. H B Hellard, [[William Chapman Hewitson|W C Hewitson]] for material from the Atkinson collection, [[John Obadiah Westwood|J. O Westwood]] for material collected by R Hunter at Saugor, J.

Rothney, Colonel C. Swinhoe, Major J W Yerbury, [[Lionel de Niceville]], H J Elwes, Hon. L. W. de Rothschild, G F Hampson (Nilgiris). Moore also thanks [[William Forsell Kirby|W F Kirby]] and [[Arthur Gardiner Butler|A G Butler]] of the British Museum for nomenclature and bibliographic help. He also thanks private collectors including W L Distant, Godman and Salvin, H. Druce, [[Henley Grose-Smith]] and J J Weir, [[John Henry Leech|J H Leech]] and P. Crowley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lepidoptera Indica. Volume 1.|chapter=Preface|url=https://archive.org/stream/lepidopteraindic01moor#page/n13/mode/1up|year=1890|publisher=L. Reeve and Co.

[[File:LepIndicaVol8cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of volume 8]]
The delineation and lithography for the first few volumes was done mainly by Moore's son F. C. Moore but later made use of other artists including [[John Nugent Fitch]] and [[E. C. Knight]].

==Taxonomic commentary==
Moore was a splitter and did not follow the concept of subspecies for polytypic forms. Moore often created genera for single species. His approach was however dropped after Swinhoe took over.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan CF (1975) Horsfield, Moore, and the Catalogues of the East India Company Museum.

==History==
The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a rapid growth in the development of [[nuclear power in the United States]].  By 1976, however, many nuclear plant proposals were no longer viable due to a slower rate of growth in electricity demand, significant cost and time overruns, and more complex regulatory requirements.  Also, there was considerable [[Anti-nuclear movement in the United States|public opposition to nuclear power]] in the USA by this time, which contributed to delays in licensing planned nuclear power stations, and further increased costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CK48AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA16 Nuclear power: Futures, Costs, and Benefits] p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 1970s it became clear that nuclear power would not grow nearly as dramatically as once believed.  This was particularly galvanized by the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979. Eventually, more than 120 reactor orders were ultimately cancelled&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33442.pdf Nuclear Power: Outlook for New U.S. Reactors] p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the construction of new reactors ground to a halt. [[Al Gore]] has commented on the historical record and reliability of nuclear power in the United States:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the 253 nuclear power reactors originally ordered in the United States from 1953 to 2008, 48 percent were cancelled, 11 percent were prematurely shut down, 14 percent experienced at least a one-year-or-more outage, and 27 percent are operating without having a year-plus outage. Thus, only about one fourth of those ordered, or about half of those completed, are still operating and have proved relatively reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Al Gore (2009). ''[[Our Choice]]'', Bloomsbury, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A cover story in the February 11, 1985, issue of ''[[Forbes magazine]]'' commented on the overall management of the nuclear power program in the United States:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The failure of the U.S. nuclear power program ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history, a disaster on a monumental scale ... only the blind, or the biased, can now think that the money has been well spent. It is a defeat for the U.S. consumer and for the competitiveness of U.S. industry, for the utilities that undertook the program and for the private enterprise system that made it possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuclear Follies", a February 11, 1985 cover story in ''[[Forbes magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 2000s, aging infrastructure, growing power use and fears of [[global climate change]] all prompted what was then called the "[[nuclear renaissance]]". Engineering companies noted that the commissioning process was a major barrier to further construction, and changes to the system were carried out by the [[US Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] as part of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], along with new tax incentives and loan guarantees. As many as 30 new reactors were planned by 2009.&lt;ref name=decline&gt;J. Matthew Roney, [http://sustainablog.org/2013/09/us-nuclear-power-in-decline/ "US Nuclear Power In Decline"], Earth Policy Institute, 10 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|September 2017}}, only two new reactors are still under construction, both at [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant|Vogtle]]. The project has announced significant delays and [[cost overrun|budget overruns]]. Most of the other new builds and the equally extensive list of upgrades to existing reactors have been shelved. The majority of this change in fortunes is due to the rapidly falling prices of [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name=decline/&gt;

[[File:HRDiagram.png|thumb|upright=1.4|A [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] plots the actual brightness (or [[absolute magnitude]]) of a star against its [[color index]] (represented as B−V). The main sequence is visible as a prominent diagonal band that runs from the upper left to the lower right. This plot shows 22,000 stars from the [[Hipparcos Catalogue]] together with 1,000 low-luminosity stars (red and white dwarfs) from the [[Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars]].]]
{{Star formation}}
In [[astronomy]], the '''main sequence''' is a continuous and distinctive band of [[star]]s that appears on plots of stellar [[Color index|color]] versus [[Absolute magnitude|brightness]]. These color-magnitude plots are known as [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]]s after their co-developers, [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] and [[Henry Norris Russell]]. Stars on this band are known as '''main-sequence stars''' or [[dwarf star]]s. These are the most numerous true stars in the universe, and include the Earth's [[Sun]].

After condensation and ignition of a star, it generates [[thermal energy]] in its dense core region through [[nuclear fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]]. During this stage of the star's lifetime, it is located on the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and age. The cores of main-sequence stars are in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of [[gravitational collapse]] from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation on temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the [[photosphere]]. The energy is carried by either [[radiation]] or [[convection]], with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.

The main sequence is sometimes divided into upper and lower parts, based on the dominant process that a star uses to generate energy. Stars below about 1.5 times the [[Solar mass|mass of the Sun]] ({{solar mass|1.5}}) primarily fuse hydrogen atoms together in a series of stages to form helium, a sequence called the [[proton–proton chain]]. Above this mass, in the upper main sequence, the nuclear fusion process mainly uses atoms of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] as intermediaries in the [[CNO cycle]] that produces helium from hydrogen atoms. Main-sequence stars with more than two solar masses undergo convection in their core regions, which acts to stir up the newly created helium and maintain the proportion of fuel needed for fusion to occur. Below this mass, stars have cores that are entirely radiative with convective zones near the surface. With decreasing stellar mass, the proportion of the star forming a convective envelope steadily increases. Main-sequence stars below {{solar mass|0.4}} undergo convection throughout their mass. When core convection does not occur, a helium-rich core develops surrounded by an outer layer of hydrogen.

In general, the more massive a star is, the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence. After the hydrogen fuel at the core has been consumed, the star [[stellar evolution|evolves]] away from the main sequence on the HR diagram, into a [[supergiant]], [[red giant]], or directly to a [[white dwarf]].

== History ==
[[File:Hot and brilliant O stars in star-forming regions.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Hot and brilliant [[O-type main-sequence star]]s in star-forming regions. These are all regions of star formation that contain many hot young stars including several bright stars of spectral type O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Brightest Stars Don't Live Alone|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1230/|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=ESO Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

In the early part of the 20th century, information about the types and distances of [[star]]s became more readily available. The [[stellar spectrum|spectra]] of stars were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. [[Annie Jump Cannon]] and [[Edward C. Pickering]] at [[Harvard College Observatory]] developed a method of categorization that became known as the [[Stellar classification|Harvard Classification Scheme]], published in the ''Harvard Annals'' in 1901.&lt;ref name=longair06/&gt;

In [[Potsdam]] in 1906, the Danish astronomer [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] noticed that the reddest stars—classified as K and M in the Harvard scheme—could be divided into two distinct groups. These stars are either much brighter than the Sun, or much fainter. To distinguish these groups, he called them "giant" and "dwarf" stars. The following year he began studying [[star cluster]]s; large groupings of stars that are co-located at approximately the same distance. He published the first plots of color versus [[luminosity]] for these stars. These plots showed a prominent and continuous sequence of stars, which he named the Main Sequence.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

At [[Princeton University]], [[Henry Norris Russell]] was following a similar course of research. He was studying the relationship between the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their [[absolute magnitude]]. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable [[parallax]]es and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name=obs36/&gt;

Of the red stars observed by Hertzsprung, the dwarf stars also followed the spectra-luminosity relationship discovered by Russell. However, the giant stars are much brighter than dwarfs and so do not follow the same relationship. Russell proposed that the "giant stars must have low density or great surface-brightness, and the reverse is true of dwarf stars". The same curve also showed that there were very few faint white stars.&lt;ref name=obs36/&gt;

In 1933, [[Bengt Strömgren]] introduced the term Hertzsprung–Russell diagram to denote a luminosity-spectral class diagram.&lt;ref name=zfa7/&gt; This name reflected the parallel development of this technique by both Hertzsprung and Russell earlier in the century.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

As evolutionary models of stars were developed during the 1930s, it was shown that, for stars of a uniform chemical composition, a relationship exists between a star's mass and its luminosity and radius. That is, for a given mass and composition, there is a unique solution for determining the star's radius and luminosity. This became known as the [[Vogt-Russell theorem]]; named after [[Heinrich Vogt (astronomer)|Heinrich Vogt]] and Henry Norris Russell. By this theorem, when a star's chemical composition and its position on the main sequence is known, so too is the star's mass and radius. (However, it was subsequently discovered that the theorem breaks down somewhat for stars of non-uniform composition.)&lt;ref name=schatzman33/&gt;

A refined scheme for [[stellar classification]] was published in 1943 by [[William Wilson Morgan]] and [[Philip Childs Keenan]].&lt;ref name=keenan_morgan43/&gt; The MK classification assigned each star a spectral type—based on the Harvard classification—and a luminosity class.  The Harvard classification had been developed by assigning a different letter to each star based on the strength of the hydrogen spectral line, before the relationship between spectra and temperature was known.  When ordered by temperature and when duplicate classes were removed,  the [[spectral type]]s of stars followed, in order of decreasing temperature with colors ranging from blue to red, the sequence O, B, A, F, G, K and M. (A popular [[mnemonic]] for memorizing this sequence of stellar classes is "Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me".) The luminosity class ranged from I to V, in order of decreasing luminosity. Stars of luminosity class V belonged to the main sequence.&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;

In April 2018, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant "ordinary" (i.e., main sequence) [[star]], named [[Icarus (star)|Icarus]] (formally, [[MACS J1149 Lensed Star 1]]), at 9 billion light-years away from [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="NA-20180402"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kelly, Patrick L. et al. |title=Extreme magnification of an individual star at redshift 1.5 by a galaxy-cluster lens |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-018-0430-3 |date=2 April 2018 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=334–342 |doi=10.1038/s41550-018-0430-3 |accessdate=2 April 2018 |arxiv=1706.10279 |bibcode=2018NatAs...2..334K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPC-20180402"&gt;{{cite web |last=Howell |first=Elizabeth |title=Rare Cosmic Alignment Reveals Most Distant Star Ever Seen |url=https://www.space.com/40171-cosmic-alignment-reveals-most-distant-star-yet.html |date=2 April 2018|work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation and evolution ==
{{Main|Star formation|Protostar|Pre-main-sequence star|Stellar evolution#Main sequence}}
When a [[protostar]] is formed from the [[Jeans instability|collapse]] of a [[giant molecular cloud]] of gas and dust in the local [[interstellar medium]], the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass.&lt;ref name=asr34_1/&gt; The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the [[initial mass function]].)&lt;ref name=science295_5552/&gt; During the initial collapse, this [[pre-main-sequence star]] generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an [[exothermic]] [[nuclear fusion]] process that converts hydrogen into helium.&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;

{{Star nav}}

When nuclear fusion of hydrogen becomes the dominant energy production process and the excess energy gained from gravitational contraction has been lost,&lt;ref name=science293_5538/&gt; the star lies along a [[curve]] on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] (or HR diagram) called the standard main sequence. Astronomers will sometimes refer to this stage as "zero age main sequence", or ZAMS.&lt;ref name=zams_sao/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen1999/&gt; The ZAMS curve can be calculated using computer models of stellar properties at the point when stars begin hydrogen fusion. From this point, the brightness and surface temperature of stars typically increase with age.&lt;ref name="clayton83"/&gt;

A star remains near its initial position on the main sequence until a significant amount of hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and to the right of the main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;

== Properties ==
The majority of stars on a typical HR diagram lie along the main-sequence curve. This line is pronounced because both the [[stellar classification|spectral type]] and the [[luminosity]] depend only on a star's mass, at least to [[orders of approximation|zeroth-order approximation]], as long as it is fusing hydrogen at its core—and that is what almost all stars spend most of their "active" lives doing.&lt;ref name=mss_atoe/&gt;

The temperature of a star determines its [[spectral type]] via its effect on the physical properties of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in its [[photosphere]]. A star's energy emission as a function of wavelength is influenced by both its temperature and composition. A key indicator of this energy distribution is given by the [[color index]], ''B''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''V'', which measures the star's [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] in blue (''B'') and green-yellow (''V'') light by means of filters.&lt;ref group=note&gt;By measuring the difference between these values, this eliminates the need to correct the magnitudes for distance. However, see [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]].&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in magnitude provides a measure of a star's temperature.

== Dwarf terminology ==
Main-sequence stars are called dwarf stars,&lt;ref name=smith91/&gt;&lt;ref name=powell06/&gt; but this terminology is partly historical and can be somewhat confusing. For the cooler stars, dwarfs such as [[red dwarf]]s, [[orange dwarf]]s, and [[yellow dwarf]]s are indeed much smaller and dimmer than other stars of those colors. However, for hotter blue and white stars, the size and brightness difference between so-called "dwarf" stars that are on the main sequence and the so-called "giant" stars that are not becomes smaller; for the hottest stars it is not directly observable. For those stars the terms "dwarf" and "giant" refer to differences in [[spectral line]]s which indicate if a star is on the main sequence or off it.  Nevertheless, very hot main-sequence stars are still sometimes called dwarfs, even though they have roughly the same size and brightness as the "giant" stars of that temperature.&lt;ref name=moore06/&gt;

The common use of "dwarf" to mean main sequence is confusing in another way, because there are dwarf stars which are not main-sequence stars. For example, a [[white dwarf]] is the dead core of a star that is left after the star has shed its outer layers, that is much smaller than a main-sequence star, roughly the size of [[Earth]]. These represent the final evolutionary stage of many main-sequence stars.&lt;ref name=wd_sao/&gt;

== Parameters ==
[[File:Morgan-Keenan spectral classification.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Comparison of main sequence stars of each spectral class]]
By treating the star as an idealized energy radiator known as a [[black body]], the luminosity ''L'' and radius ''R'' can be related to the [[effective temperature]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; by the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;L = 4 \pi \sigma R^{2} T_{eff}^{4}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ'' is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]]. As the position of a star on the HR diagram shows its approximate luminosity, this relation can be used to estimate its radius.&lt;ref name=ohrd/&gt;

The mass, radius and luminosity of a star are closely interlinked, and their respective values can be approximated by three relations. First is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], which relates the luminosity ''L'', the radius ''R'' and the surface temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;''. Second is the [[mass–luminosity relation]], which relates the luminosity ''L'' and the mass ''M''. Finally, the relationship between ''M'' and ''R'' is close to linear. The ratio of ''M'' to ''R'' increases by a factor of only three over 2.5 [[orders of magnitude]] of ''M''. This relation is roughly proportional to the star's inner temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'', and its extremely slow increase reflects the fact that the rate of energy generation in the core strongly depends on this temperature, whereas it has to fit the mass–luminosity relation. Thus, a too high or too low temperature will result in stellar instability.

A better approximation is to take {{nowrap begin}}''ε'' = ''L/M''{{nowrap end}}, the energy generation rate per unit mass, as ε is proportional to ''T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the core temperature. This is suitable for stars at least as massive as the Sun, exhibiting the [[CNO cycle]], and gives the better fit ''R'' ∝ ''M''&lt;sup&gt;0.78&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A course on stars' physical properties, formation and evolution | publisher=University of St. Andrews | url=http://www-star.st-and.ac.uk/~kw25/teaching/stars/STRUC4.pdf | accessdate=2010-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sample parameters ===
The table below shows typical values for stars along the main sequence. The values of [[luminosity]] (''L''), [[radius]] (''R'') and [[mass]] (''M'') are relative to the Sun—a dwarf star with a spectral classification of G2 V. The actual values for a star may vary by as much as 20–30% from the values listed below.&lt;ref name=siess00/&gt;

== Energy generation ==
[[File:Nuclear energy generation.svg|right|upright=1.5|thumb|'''[[Logarithm]] of the relative energy output (ε)'''&lt;br/&gt;[[Proton-proton chain reaction|Proton-Proton]] (PP), [[CNO cycle|CNO]] and [[Triple-alpha process|Triple-α]] fusion processes at different temperatures:&lt;br/&gt;''The dashed line shows the combined energy generation of the PP and CNO processes within a star. At the Sun's core temperature, the PP process is more efficient.'']]
{{See also|Stellar nucleosynthesis}}
All main-sequence stars have a core region where energy is generated by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support the remainder of the star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.&lt;ref name=brainerd/&gt;

Main-sequence stars employ two types of hydrogen fusion processes, and the rate of energy generation from each type depends on the temperature in the core region. Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts, based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process. In the lower main sequence, energy is primarily generated as the result of the [[proton-proton chain]], which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium.&lt;ref name=hannu/&gt; Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the [[CNO cycle]]. (See the chart.) This process uses atoms of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium.

At a stellar core temperature of 18 million [[Kelvin]], the PP process and CNO cycle are equally efficient, and each type generates half of the star's net luminosity. As this is the core temperature of a star with about 1.5 {{solar mass}}, the upper main sequence consists of stars above this mass. Thus, roughly speaking, stars of spectral class F or cooler belong to the lower main sequence, while A-type stars or hotter are upper main-sequence stars.&lt;ref name="clayton83"/&gt; The transition in primary energy production from one form to the other spans a range difference of less than a single solar mass. In the Sun, a one solar-mass star, only 1.5% of the energy is generated by the CNO cycle.&lt;ref name=apj555/&gt; By contrast, stars with 1.8 {{solar mass}} or above generate almost their entire energy output through the CNO cycle.&lt;ref name=maurizio05/&gt;

The observed upper limit for a main-sequence star is 120–200 {{solar mass}}.&lt;ref name=apj620_1/&gt; The theoretical explanation for this limit is that stars above this mass can not radiate energy fast enough to remain stable, so any additional mass will be ejected in a series of pulsations until the star reaches a stable limit.&lt;ref name=apj162/&gt; The lower limit for sustained proton–proton nuclear fusion is about 0.08 {{solar mass}} or 80 times the mass of [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref name=hannu/&gt; Below this threshold are sub-stellar objects that can not sustain hydrogen fusion, known as [[brown dwarf]]s.&lt;ref name=apj406_1/&gt;

== Structure ==
{{Main|Stellar structure}}
[[File:Solar internal structure.svg|right|upright=1.0|thumb|This diagram shows a cross-section of a Sun-like star, showing the internal structure.]]
Because there is a temperature difference between the core and the surface, or [[photosphere]], energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are [[radiation]] and [[convection]]. A [[radiation zone]], where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and there is very little mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a [[convection zone]] the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.&lt;ref name=brainerd/&gt;&lt;ref name=aller91/&gt;

In massive stars (above 10 {{solar mass}})&lt;ref name=aaa102_1/&gt; the rate of energy generation by the CNO cycle is very sensitive to temperature, so the fusion is highly concentrated at the core. Consequently, there is a high temperature gradient in the core region, which results in a convection zone for more efficient energy transport.&lt;ref name=hannu/&gt; This mixing of material around the core removes the helium ash from the hydrogen-burning region, allowing more of the hydrogen in the star to be consumed during the main-sequence lifetime. The outer regions of a massive star transport energy by radiation, with little or no convection.&lt;ref name=brainerd/&gt;

Intermediate-mass stars such as [[Sirius]] may transport energy primarily by radiation, with a small core convection region.&lt;ref name=lockner06/&gt; Medium-sized, low-mass stars like the Sun have a core region that is stable against convection, with a convection zone near the surface that mixes the outer layers. This results in a steady buildup of a helium-rich core, surrounded by a hydrogen-rich outer region. By contrast, cool, very low-mass stars (below 0.4 {{solar mass}}) are convective throughout.&lt;ref name=science295_5552/&gt; Thus the helium produced at the core is distributed across the star, producing a relatively uniform atmosphere and a proportionately longer main sequence lifespan.&lt;ref name=brainerd/&gt;

== Luminosity-color variation ==
[[File:Sun920607.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The [[Sun]] is the most familiar example of a main-sequence star]]
As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in the core of a main-sequence star, the reduction in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. Since it is the outflow of fusion-supplied energy that supports the higher layers of the star, the core is compressed, producing higher temperatures and pressures. Both factors increase the rate of fusion thus moving the equilibrium towards a smaller, denser, hotter core producing more energy whose increased outflow pushes the higher layers further out. Thus there is a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time.&lt;ref name="clayton83"/&gt; For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70% of its current value.&lt;ref name=sp74/&gt; As a star ages this luminosity increase changes its position on the HR diagram. This effect results in a broadening of the main sequence band because stars are observed at random stages in their lifetime. That is, the main sequence band develops a thickness on the HR diagram; it is not simply a narrow line.&lt;ref name=padmanabhan01/&gt;

Other factors that broaden the main sequence band on the HR diagram include uncertainty in the distance to stars and the presence of unresolved [[binary star]]s that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. Variations in chemical composition caused by the initial abundances, the star's [[Stellar evolution|evolutionary status]],&lt;ref name=apj128_3/&gt; interaction with a [[Binary star|close companion]],&lt;ref name=tayler94/&gt; [[Stellar rotation|rapid rotation]],&lt;ref name=mnras113/&gt; or a [[Stellar magnetic field|magnetic field]] can all slightly change a main-sequence star's HR diagram position, to name just a few factors. As an example, there are [[Metallicity|metal-poor stars]] (with a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium) that lie just below the main sequence and are known as [[subdwarf]]s. These stars are fusing hydrogen in their cores and so they mark the lower edge of main sequence fuzziness caused by variance in chemical composition.&lt;ref name=cwcs13/&gt;

A nearly vertical region of the HR diagram, known as the [[instability strip]], is occupied by pulsating [[variable star]]s known as [[Cepheid variable]]s. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects the upper part of the main sequence in the region of class ''A'' and ''F'' stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects the upper part of the main sequence are called [[Delta Scuti variable]]s. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect.&lt;ref name=green04/&gt; Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like [[Beta Cephei variable]]s, are unrelated to this instability strip.

== Lifetime ==
[[File:Isochrone ZAMS Z2pct.png|upright=1.0|right|thumb|This plot gives an example of the mass-luminosity relationship for zero-age main-sequence stars. The mass and luminosity are relative to the present-day Sun.]]
The total amount of energy that a star can generate through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is limited by the amount of hydrogen fuel that can be consumed at the core. For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated at the core must be at least equal to the energy radiated at the surface. Since the luminosity gives the amount of energy radiated per unit time, the total life span can be estimated, to [[Orders of approximation|first approximation]], as the total energy produced divided by the star's luminosity.&lt;ref name=rit_ms/&gt;

For a star with at least 0.5 {{solar mass}}, when the hydrogen supply in its core is exhausted and it expands to become a [[red giant]], it can start to fuse [[helium]] atoms to form [[carbon]]. The energy output of the helium fusion process per unit mass is only about a tenth the energy output of the hydrogen process, and the luminosity of the star increases.&lt;ref name="prialnik00"/&gt; This results in a much shorter length of time in this stage compared to the main sequence lifetime. (For example, the Sun is predicted to spend {{nowrap|130 million years}} burning helium, compared to about 12 billion years burning hydrogen.)&lt;ref name=mnras386_1/&gt; Thus, about 90% of the observed stars above 0.5 {{solar mass}} will be on the main sequence.&lt;ref name=arnett96/&gt; On average, main-sequence stars are known to follow an empirical [[Mass–luminosity relation|mass-luminosity relationship]].&lt;ref name=lecchini07/&gt; The luminosity (''L'') of the star is roughly proportional to the total mass (''M'') as the following [[power law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}L\ \propto\ M^{3.5}\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship applies to main-sequence stars in the range 0.1–50 {{solar mass}}.&lt;ref name=rolfs_rodney88/&gt;

The amount of fuel available for nuclear fusion is proportional to the mass of the star. Thus, the lifetime of a star on the main sequence can be estimated by comparing it to solar evolutionary models. The [[Sun]] has been a main-sequence star for about 4.5 billion years and it will become a red giant in 6.5 billion years,&lt;ref name=apj418&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sackmann | first=I.-Juliana |author2=Boothroyd, Arnold I. |author3=Kraemer, Kathleen E. | title=Our Sun.

Hence:&lt;ref name=hansen_kawaler94&gt;{{cite book | first=Carl J. | last=Hansen |author2=Kawaler, Steven D. | date=1994 | title=Stellar Interiors: Physical Principles, Structure, and Evolution | page=28 | publisher=Birkhäuser | isbn=978-0-387-94138-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix} \tau_{\rm MS}\ \approx \ 10^{10} \text{years} \cdot \left[ \frac{M}{M_{\bigodot}} \right] \cdot \left[ \frac{L_{\bigodot}}{L} \right]\ =\ 10^{10} \text{years} \cdot \left[ \frac{M}{M_{\bigodot}} \right]^{-2.5} \end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' and ''L'' are the mass and luminosity of the star, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}M_{\bigodot}\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[solar mass]], &lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}L_{\bigodot}\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solar luminosity]] and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\rm MS}&lt;/math&gt; is the star's estimated main sequence lifetime.

Although more massive stars have more fuel to burn and might intuitively be expected to last longer, they also radiate a proportionately greater amount with increased mass. This is required by the stellar equation of state; for a massive star to maintain equilibrium, the outward pressure of radiated energy generated in the core not only must but ''will'' rise to match the titanic inward gravitational pressure of its  envelope. Thus, the most massive stars may remain on the main sequence for only a few million years, while stars with less than a tenth of a solar mass may last for over a trillion years.&lt;ref name=apj482&gt;{{cite journal | last=Laughlin | first=Gregory |author2=Bodenheimer, Peter |author3=Adams, Fred C. | title=The End of the Main Sequence | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | date=1997 | volume=482 | issue=1 | pages=420–432 | doi= 10.1086/304125 | bibcode=1997ApJ...482..420L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact mass-luminosity relationship depends on how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star does not need to produce as much energy to remain in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel to remain in equilibrium.&lt;ref name=imamura07&gt;{{cite web | last=Imamura | first=James N. | date=7 February 1995 | url=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/208/feb6/mass.html | title=Mass-Luminosity Relationship | publisher=University of Oregon | accessdate=2007-01-08 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061214065335/http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/208/feb6/mass.html| archivedate = 14 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via [[convection]], which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium.&lt;ref name="clayton83" /&gt;

In high-mass main-sequence stars, the opacity is dominated by [[electron scattering]], which is nearly constant with increasing temperature. Thus the luminosity only increases as the cube of the star's mass.&lt;ref name="prialnik00"/&gt; For stars below 10 {{solar mass}}, the opacity becomes dependent on temperature, resulting in the luminosity varying approximately as the fourth power of the star's mass.&lt;ref name=rolfs_rodney88&gt;{{cite book | first=Claus E. | last=Rolfs |author2=Rodney, William S. | date=1988 | title=Cauldrons in the Cosmos: Nuclear Astrophysics | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=978-0-226-72457-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For very low-mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere also contribute to the opacity. Below about 0.5 {{solar mass}}, the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the mass-luminosity relation can vary depending on a star's composition.&lt;ref name=science295_5552&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kroupa | first=Pavel | title=The Initial Mass Function of Stars: Evidence for Uniformity in Variable Systems | journal=Science | date=2002 | volume=295 | issue=5552 | pages=82–91 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5552/82 | accessdate=2007-12-03 | doi=10.1126/science.1067524 | pmid=11778039 |arxiv = astro-ph/0201098 |bibcode = 2002Sci...295...82K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary tracks ==
{{Main|Stellar evolution}}
[[File:Evolutionary track 1m.svg|thumb|left|Evolutionary track of a star like the sun]]

When a main-sequence star has consumed the hydrogen at its core, the loss of energy generation causes its gravitational collapse to resume and the star evolves off the main sequence.  The path which the star follows across the HR diagram is called an evolutionary track.&lt;ref name="Iben2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Icko Iben|title=Stellar Evolution Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IU357EiecWwC&amp;pg=PA1481|date=29 November 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-01657-6|pages=1481–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Open cluster HR diagram ages.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.2|[[H-R Diagram]] for two open clusters: [[NGC 188]] (blue) is older and shows a lower turn off from the main sequence than [[Messier 67|M67]] (yellow). The dots outside the two sequences are mostly foreground and background stars with no relation to the clusters.]]
In stars more massive than {{solar mass|0.23}}, the hydrogen surrounding the helium core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell and causing the outer layers of the star to expand and cool.  The stage as these stars move away from the main sequence is known as the [[subgiant branch]]; it is relatively brief and appears as a [[Hertzsprung gap|gap]] in the evolutionary track since few stars are observed at that point.

When the helium core of low-mass stars becomes degenerate, or the outer layers of intermediate-mass stars cool sufficiently to become opaque, their hydrogen shells increase in temperature and the stars start to become more luminous.  This is known as the [[red giant branch]]; it is a relatively long-lived stage and it appears prominently in H-R diagrams.  These stars will eventually end their lives as white dwarfs.&lt;ref name=pmss_atoe&gt;{{cite web | author=Staff | date=12 October 2006 | url=http://outreach.atnf.csiro.au/education/senior/astrophysics/stellarevolution_postmain.html | title=Post-Main Sequence Stars | publisher=Australia Telescope Outreach and Education | accessdate=2008-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaas141&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Girardi, L. |author2=Bressan, A. |author3=Bertelli, G. |author4=Chiosi, C. | title=Evolutionary tracks and isochrones for low- and intermediate-mass stars: From 0.15 to 7 M&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and from Z=0.0004 to 0.03 | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement | date=2000 | volume=141 | issue=3 | pages=371–383 | doi=10.1051/aas:2000126|arxiv = astro-ph/9910164 |bibcode = 2000A&amp;AS..141..371G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most massive stars do not become red giants, instead their cores quickly become hot enough to fuse helium and eventually heavier elements and they are known as [[supergiant]]s.  They follow approximately horizontal evolutionary tracks from the main sequence across the top of the H-R diagram.  Supergiants are relatively rare and do not show prominently on most H-R diagrams.  Their cores will eventually collapse, usually leading to a supernova and leaving behind either a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]].&lt;ref name=sitko00&gt;{{cite web|last=Sitko |first=Michael L. |date=24 March 2000 |url=http://www.physics.uc.edu/~sitko/Spring00/4-Starevol/starevol.html |title=Stellar Structure and Evolution |publisher=University of Cincinnati |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050326090756/http://www.physics.uc.edu/~sitko/Spring00/4-Starevol/starevol.html |archivedate=26 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[star cluster|cluster of stars]] is formed at about the same time, the main sequence lifespan of these stars will depend on their individual masses.  The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed in sequence by stars of ever lower masses.  The position where stars in the cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the [[turnoff point]].  By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.&lt;ref name=science299_5603&gt;{{cite journal | last=Krauss | first=Lawrence M. |author2=Chaboyer, Brian | title=Age Estimates of Globular Clusters in the Milky Way: Constraints on Cosmology | journal=Science | date=2003 | volume=299 | issue=5603 | pages=65–69 | doi= 10.1126/science.1075631 | pmid=12511641 |bibcode = 2003Sci...299...65K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description===
The Marcellus Formation is a [[black shale]] that may contain [[limestone]] [[Bed (geology)|beds]] and concentrations of iron [[pyrite]]&amp;nbsp;([[Iron|Fe]][[Sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[siderite]]&amp;nbsp;(Fe[[carbonate|CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]).&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/docrec/pdoc1724.pdf |title=HRS Documentation Record, Safety Light Corporation, EPA ID No. PAD987295276 |accessdate=2008-04-02 |format= PDF|work=Hazard Ranking System|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its sedimentary structure, or bedding, is moderately well developed. Like most shales, it tends to split easily along the bedding plane, a property known as [[fissility (geology)|fissility]].&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;
Lighter colored shales in the upper portion of the formation tend to split into small thin-edged fragments after exposure.&lt;ref name=MacFarlane1890&gt;{{cite book

====Outcrops====
[[File:Middle Delaware River above Walpack Bend.jpg|alt=A placid river winds its way through farmland and forest.|thumb|upright|[[Delaware River]] above Walpack Bend, where it leaves the buried valley eroded from Marcellus Shale bedrock]]
The Marcellus appears in outcrops along the northern margin of the formation in central New York. There, the two [[Joint (geology)|joint]] planes in the Marcellus are nearly at right angles, each making cracks in the formation that run perpendicular to the bedding plane, which lies almost level.&lt;ref name=MacFarlane1890/&gt;
These joints form smooth nearly vertical [[cliff]]s, and the intersecting joint planes form projecting corners in the rock faces.&lt;ref name=MacFarlane1890/&gt;
Once exposed, the weathered faces lose most of their organic carbon,&lt;ref name=Peucker-ehrenbrink2001/&gt;
turning from black or dark gray to a lighter shade of gray.

Outcrops of the Marcellus  can contain very small beds that resemble [[coal]].&lt;ref name=Vanuxem1842/&gt; The New York outcrops, and others further south in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, were extensively excavated in the early 19th century, sometimes at great expense, in the false hope of finding minable [[coal seam]]s.&lt;ref name=Vanuxem1842&gt;{{cite book

===Age===
On the [[geological timescale]], the Marcellus occurs in the [[Middle Devonian]] epoch, of the [[Devonian]] [[Period (geology)|period]], in the [[Paleozoic]] [[Era (geology)|era]], of the [[Phanerozoic]] [[Eon (geology)|eon]].

====Overlying====
In the first New York survey, the Marcellus shale was placed below the Hamilton Group at the base of the Erie division of the New York system, but this taxonomy is obsolete.&lt;ref name=White1882/&gt;

In current practice, the Marcellus Formation&amp;nbsp;(abbr. Dm or Dms) is classified as the basal unit of the [[Hamilton Group]]&amp;nbsp;(Dh),&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; lying beneath the [[Mahantango Formation]]&amp;nbsp;(Dmh) member of this group in Pennsylvania&lt;ref name="explanation"/&gt; and Maryland. In New York, the Mahantango, also of Middle Devonian age, is further divided. There the Marcellus is separated from the overlying Skaneateles Formation, a more clastic and fossiliferous dark shale, by the thin Stafford or Mottville Limestone bed.&lt;ref name=Grasso1968/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin2004&gt;{{cite journal

In eastern Ohio the Hamilton Group also lies disconformably beneath the Rhinestreet Shale Member of the [[West Falls Formation]], another transgressive black shale tongue with similar characteristics to the Marcellus.&lt;ref name=Wickstrom/&gt;

====Underlying====
The Marcellus shale is typically found deposited on the limestone of the [[Onondaga Formation]]&amp;nbsp;(Don), which extends down to the end of the [[Early Devonian]] period. The contact between them may be sharp, gradational, or erosional. In southwestern Ontario, Canada, north of [[Lake Erie]], the Marcellus overlies the Dundee Formation, a lateral equivalent of the Onondaga.&lt;ref name=Rickard1984/&gt;&lt;ref name="Southern Ontario"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/mndm/mines/resgeol/southern/southwestern/geo_e.asp |title=Geology of the Southwestern District |work=Resident Geologist Program |accessdate=2008-04-02 |date=2004-05-21 |publisher=Ministry of Northern Development and Mines, Government of Ontario |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922120056/http://www.mndm.gov.on.ca/mndm/mines/resgeol/southern/southwestern/geo_e.asp |archivedate=September 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural Gas===
{{main|Marcellus natural gas trend}}
[[File:Marcellus Shale Gas Play.png|thumbnail|Producing gas wells in the Marcellus Shale gas play]]
The Marcellus natural gas trend, which encompasses 104,000 square miles and stretches across Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and into southeast Ohio and upstate New York, is the largest source of natural gas in the United States, and production was still growing rapidly in 2013. The Marcellus is an example of [[shale gas]], natural gas trapped in low-permeability shale, and requires the well completion method of [[hydraulic fracturing]] to allow the gas to flow to the well bore. The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.

===Iron===
At the base of the Marcellus, in the [[pyrite]]-[[carbonate]] bed between the carbonaceous black shale and a green calcareous shale bed,&lt;ref name=Dewees1878/&gt; pyrite, carbonate, and groundwater reacted to form [[gossan]] [[iron oxide]] and [[gypsum]].&lt;ref name=Feldmann2007&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3790/is_200707/ai_n19434226/pg_10 |author = Feldmann, R.M. |author2=Schweitzer, C.E. |author3=Redman, C.M. |author4=Morris, N.J. |author5=Ward, D.J. | year = 2007 | title = New Late Cretaceous Lobsters From The Kyzylkum Desert Of Uzbekistan|journal=Journal of Paleontology | volume = 81 | issue = 4 |pages = 701–713 | doi = 10.1666/pleo0022-3360(2007)081[0701:NLCLFT]2.0.CO;2 | issn=0022-3360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marcellus iron ore was actively mined in south Central Pennsylvania from its discovery in the late 18th century, until it was supplanted by the rich ore beds of the [[Iron Range]] of [[Minnesota]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Swank1965&gt;{{cite book

The ore was easily located and worked from shallow pits and shafts, but once the usable upper deposits were removed, or if a mine shaft entered the bed too far below the surface, only unusable unconverted pyritic deposits were found.&lt;ref name=Dewees1878/&gt;

Hematite ore was converted to [[pig iron]] in [[charcoal]]-fired stone [[blast furnace]]s that were constructed throughout the [[Juniata River]] region near the workable ore deposits from the Marcellus and other formations.&lt;ref name=Swank1965/&gt;
Iron products from this area, known as "Juniata Iron," were produced during the period between the [[American Revolution]] and the [[American Civil War]]. These blast furnaces were important to the economy of the region at the time,&lt;ref name=Philadelphia1936&gt;{{cite book

The ore from the Marcellus varied in thickness, becoming unworkably thin, and even disappearing altogether in places between the workable beds.&lt;ref name=Dewees1878/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lesley1859/&gt; The quality of the ore also varied,&lt;ref name=Dewees1878/&gt; and it was not always profitable to [[smelting|smelt]], as several furnaces built near iron ore mines in the Marcellus were abandoned before the ore and timber resources used to fuel them became scarce.&lt;ref name=Lesley1859&gt;{{cite book

In some locations in Pennsylvania the quality of the ore was quite good, with relatively deep veins containing 45% iron, and very low sulfur.&lt;ref name=Dewees1878/&gt;
In Virginia, the Marcellus ore occasionally contained [[zinc]], which produced a characteristic green flame in the furnace as it was consumed, but deposited a hard mass of impure [[zinc oxide]] known as [[cadmia]], which built up over time near the top of the flue, and had to be removed periodically to keep it unobstructed.&lt;ref name=Firmstone1874&gt;{{cite journal

====Iron pigments====
Drainage that reacted with the pyrite inclusions also deposited a form of [[bog iron]] near several outcrops of the Marcellus. In the 19th century, iron ore from these deposits was used as a mineral paint pigment. After being heated in a kiln and finely ground, it was mixed with [[linseed oil]], and used to paint exterior wood on barns, covered bridges, and railroad cars.&lt;ref name=Lesley1892/&gt; In addition to the bog iron,  at several sloped locations in eastern Pennsylvania brown hematite was found lying on the Marcellus bedrock buried beneath the soil. These deposits were also excavated and used for mineral paint during that time.&lt;ref name=White1882/&gt; A bed of hematite paint ore is also found almost directly below the Marcellus, but it is actually part of the underlying Oriskany Formation.&lt;ref name=Lesley1892/&gt;

====Chalybeate====
Iron rich "ferruginous waters" emanating from [[chalybeate]] springs near the base of the Marcellus in [[Bedford, Pennsylvania]] were believed to have healing powers by Native Americans. The [[Bedford Springs Hotel]] was a [[mineral spa]] built in 1802 around a series of mineral springs, including one of these, its "iron spring". The Chalybeate Springs Hotel, built nearby in 1851 around three other mineral springs including another chalybeate spring,&lt;ref name=Waymarking&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1054 |title=Chalybeate Springs Hotel&amp;nbsp;— U.S. National Register of Historic Places|work=Waymarking.com |accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a "resort for invalids".&lt;ref name=Stevenson1882&gt;{{cite book|title=The Geology of Bedford and Fulton Counties|first =John James | last = Stevenson|publisher=The board of Commissioners for the 2d.

===Other uses===
The Marcellus has also been used locally for shale [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] and common [[Fill dirt|fill]],&lt;ref name=Allensville/&gt; although the pyritic shales are not suitable for this purpose because of acid rock drainage and volumetric expansion.&lt;ref name=Doden2008&gt;{{cite journal

and was considered superior "[[road metal]]" because the fine grained fragments packed together tightly, yet drained well after a rain.&lt;ref name=Lesley1892/&gt;

The dark slaty shales may have the necessary [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage]] and hardness to be worked, and were quarried for low grade roofing [[slate]] in eastern Pennsylvania during the 19th century. The slates from the Marcellus were inferior to the [[Martinsburg Formation]] slate quarried further south, and most quarries were abandoned, with the last significant operation in Lancaster County.&lt;ref name=Lesley1892/&gt; The Marcellus black slate was also quarried in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, for [[Chalkboard|school slates]] used by students in 19th-century rural schools.&lt;ref name=Lesley1892/&gt;

Carbonaceous shales, such as the Marcellus, are a possible target for [[carbon capture and storage]] for [[mitigation of global warming]]. Because carbon [[Adsorption|adsorbs]] [[carbon dioxide]]&amp;nbsp;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at a greater rate than [[methane]]&amp;nbsp;(CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon dioxide injected into the formation for geological [[CO2 sequestration|sequestration]] could also be used to recover additional [[natural gas]] in a process analogous to [[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]], but the practical value of this theoretical technique is not yet known.&lt;ref name=Wickstrom/&gt; Scientists believe that adsorption would allow sequestration at shallower depths than [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] in deep saline formations, which must be at least {{convert|800|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} below the surface to maintain liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical state]].&lt;ref name=PA2006/&gt;

Natural decomposition of the shale into smaller fragments can affect [[slope stability]], necessitating shallower slopes that require more material be disturbed in cut and fill work, exacerbating the acid rock drainage problem.

Other [[sulfate]] minerals that can be produced by reactions with pyrite include [[anhydrite]], [[melanterite]], [[rozenite]], [[jarosite]], and [[alunite]].&lt;ref name=Doden2008/&gt;
The reactions have generated a heave pressure on the order of 500 kPa (10,000 pounds per square foot), but may be able to generate four times this pressure &amp;nbsp; enough to heave [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] in a 5-story building.&lt;ref name=Doden2008/&gt;
[[Limestone]], which is used to neutralize the acid drainage, can actually exacerbate the expansion problem by promoting sulfate–sulfate reactions that form the minerals [[thaumasite]] and [[ettringite]], which have even higher molar volumes.&lt;ref name=Doden2008/&gt;

Drilling [[borehole]]s through the Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has a relatively low [[density]], and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some [[drilling fluid]]s. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.&lt;ref name=Wickstrom/&gt;

'''Meltwater management''' is a runoff management system designed to deal with runoff caused by the melting of snow in colder climates. They were designed when it became apparent that using the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best management practice]] (BMP) for rainfall runoff was not working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/Cold_climate_impact_on_runoff_management|title=Cold climate impact on runoff management - Minnesota Stormwater Manual|website=stormwater.pca.state.mn.us|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snow filtration''' is a system to deal with left-over [[snow]] in an [[environmentally friendly]] way. Removing snow from roads is done to ensure [[road safety]]. The conventional method is by removing the snow and emptying it into rivers. However, since salt is used to melt ice on the roads, the salt also enters the rivers with the dumped snow. This increases the salt content of the rivers which can have impacts on aquatic and marine ecosystems. The practice of removing snow from streets and off-loading it into rivers affects the aquatic ecosystems. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Jay|title=Dump Snow in Rivers, Harbors? There's a Downside.|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41427190/ns/us_news-environment/t/dump-snow-rivers-harbors-theres-downside/#.WQzRIcm1uRs|website=NBCNews|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
In spring as snow melts, the salt used on roads as a deicer is left behind, which can be environmentally damaging as it creates a [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] environment for plants.

The snow [[Surface runoff|runoff]] is collected and brought to a collection center. It is directed through an oil and grit separator which also monitors the consistency of pollutants in the runoff. The oil and grit separator causes [[electrochemical]] and [[biological process|biological]] processes, which bind [[heavy metals]] and [[nutrients]] to the sediment by means of [[redox|
reduction-oxidation]] reactions. At the same time, this reduces the amount of [[chlorine]] present in the runoff. 

The runoff then flows into a [[catch basin]], where plants use the salt [[ions]] (e.g. [[Potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Phosphorus|P&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;]]) for their growth.The runoff is further filtered by the plants, leaving only clean water to go back into [[streams]] and [[river]]s.&lt;!-- Plagiarism --&gt;

The '''National Balloon Facility''', also known as the TIFR Balloon Facility, is a stratospheric-balloon launch base under the joint management of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (TIFR) and the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO). This institute is located at [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] near [[Electronics Corporation of India Limited]] (ECIL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stratocat.com.ar/bases/31e.htm|title=Stratospheric balloon launch bases and sites|publisher=StratoCat|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being the only major balloon facility in the world close to the [[Magnetic dip#Explanation|geomagnetic equator]], this facility is extensively used by researchers from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/about%20us.html|title=NBF History|publisher=TIFR|accessdate=19 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031029142857/http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/about%20us.html|archivedate=29 October 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ballooning activity in India was prompted by research into atmospheric exploration and cosmic ray studies. During the 1940s, Dr. [[Homi J. Bhabha]] of TIFR started sending balloons up to an altitude of 25&amp;nbsp;km to study secondary cosmic radiation. Due to unique geographic reasons [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] was selected for stratospheric balloon launches. After various diplomatic meetings arrangements were made by US and Indian organisations to jointly launch balloons from Hyderabad. The first launch had support of Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory (AFCRL) and TIFR.

The launches were carried out from two locations. US balloons were launched from [[Begumpet Airport]] and Indian balloons from [[Osmania University]] Campus. The first balloon was launched on 2 February 1961. During the first stage of the facility's operation, forty balloons were launched.

After five years all the facilities were consolidated at Osmania University and under management of [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] &amp; TIFR and around 170 balloons were launched.

After a few years with increasing demands for balloon flights, a relatively low population density and proximity to the geomagnetic equator, a permanent site at Hyderabad near ECIL was selected. However, presently due to rapid development this facility is today surrounded by several population settlements: by the [[Cherlapally Central Jail]] in the east;  [[Kamala Nagar, Hyderabad|Kamala Nagar]] in the west; and [[Electronics Corporation of India]] Ltd. in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stratocat.com.ar/bases/31e.htm|title=Stratospheric balloon launch bases and sites|publisher=StratoCat|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The campus contains a complete balloon manufacturing facility. The institute conducts balloon-based scientific experiments in X-ray and [[Infrared Astronomy]], and in [[Aeronomy]].
Balloons from this facility are launched twice in a year, i.e. in summer and winter. NBF also regularly monitors and analyses local weather at [[tropospheric]] and [[stratospheric]] altitudes, required for making decisions about balloon launches.

Under the High Altitude Balloon Development Project, a 61,000m³ indigenously developed balloon penetrated into the Mesosphere on 7 January 2014, for the first time in India. Until that time, only balloons from USA and Japan had accomplished this feat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/HAA_Record.html HAA Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Natural History Museum of Armenia''' represents Armenia's unique nature and its diversity. The museum was reopened in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://armenpress.am/arm/news/397620 Երևանում վերաբացվեց ՀՀ բնության պետական թանգարանը]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During the [[Soviet]] period, an anti-religion museum was opened in 1952 which was later transformed into a museum of natural sciences and in 1960 renamed as The Natural History Museum of Armenia.
In 1999 the museum was relocated in another building. From 2000 to 2004 with the patronage of Bella and Levon Aharonyan, two [[Iranian Armenians|Iranian-Armenian]] benefactors, the building of the museum was reconstructed and opened to the public with its new exhibition.

== Exhibition ==
The museum is home to over 6000 objects, only one-third of which are temporarily or primarily put on display. In four rooms, rare types of flora and fauna are exhibited. The museum also presents the personal collection of the Aharonyan family.

The objects in the museum represent the diversity of nature in Armenia. The main exhibition contains photos related to zoology, botany, geology and plastic arts. replicas of mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibious animals, fish, insects, and arachnid as well as skulls, skins, shells, pieces of trees, samples of herbarium, animal or plant fossils, useful extracted materials, oil paintings, drawings etc.

== Events ==
The museum holds exhibitions and occasional events aiming to increase environmental awareness and active participation in offering solutions for environmental problems. Many of the animals in the museum are registered in the [[IUCN]] [[Red List of Threatened Species]].

== The Natural History Museum of Armenia ==
Since February 27, 2003, The Natural History Museum of Armenia operates according to the constitution of the republic of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlis.am/DocumentView.aspx?DocID=10159/ ՀՀ կառավարության Որոշում, 10 հոկտեմբերի 2002 թվականի N 1638-Ն]&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the museum, аs a non-commercial organization, is to raise awareness and knowledge regarding environmental issues and positively influence the accomplishment of environmental programs.

The organization fulfills various types of enterprises such as the following:
* Designing micro museums and spaces for plants and animals indoors
* Organizing parallel exhibitions to those of the museum such as exhibitions of decorative fish or birds.
* Increasing the number of the endangered species in Armenia, so as to return them to the nature
* Growing decorative plants and nurturing herbal plants for exhibition purposes.

== Branches ==
The museum has active branches in [[Shirak Province|Shirak]] ([[Gyumri]]) and [[Ararat Province|Ararat]] (Qukasav) regions.

== Address ==
* Number 34, Tigran Mex Avenue, Yerevan, Armenia

[[Image:Pre-Hurricane Bob Ocean Turbidity.jpg|thumb|Visualisation of the Ocean Turbidity of the ocean just before [[Hurricane Bob]] (August 14, 1991)]]
'''Ocean turbidity''' is a measure of the amount of cloudiness or haziness in sea water caused by individual particles that are too small to be seen without magnification. Highly [[turbidity|turbid]] [[ocean]] waters are those with a large number of scattering [[particulate]]s in them. In both highly absorbing and highly scattering [[water]]s, visibility into the water is reduced. The highly scattering (turbid) water still reflects a lot of light while the highly absorbing water, such as a [[blackwater river]] or lake, is very dark. The scattering particles that cause the water to be turbid can be composed of many things, including [[sediment]]s and [[phytoplankton]].

==Measurement==

There are a number of ways to measure ocean turbidity, including autonomous remote vehicles, [[shipcasts]] and satellites.

From a [[satellite]], a proxy measurement of the water turbidity can be made by examining the amount of [[reflectance]] in the visible region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. For the [[Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer]] (AVHRR), the logical choice is band 1, covering [[wavelengths]] 580 to 680 [[nanometre]]s, the [[orange (colour)|orange]] and [[red]]. In order to make derived products that are comparable over [[time]] and [[space]], an [[atmospheric correction]] is required. To do this, the effects of [[Rayleigh scattering]] are calculated based on the satellite viewing angle and the [[solar zenith angle]] and then subtracted from the band 1 [[radiance]]. For an [[Particulate|aerosol]] correction, band 2 in the near infrared is used. It is first corrected for Rayleigh scattering and then subtracted from the Rayleigh corrected band 1. The Rayleigh corrected band 2 is assumed to be aerosol [[radiance]] because no return signal from water in the near [[infrared]] is expected since water is highly absorbing at those wavelengths. Because bands 1 and 2 are relatively close on the electromagnetic spectrum, we can reasonably assume their aerosol radiances are the same.

In these images the turbidity is quantified as the percent reflected light emerging from the water column in a range of 0 to 8 percent. The reflectance percentage can be correlated to [[attenuation]], [[Secchi disk depth]] or total suspended solids although the exact relationship will vary regionally and depends on the [[optical]] properties of the water. For example, in [[Florida Bay]], 10% reflectance corresponds to a sediment concentration of 30 milligram/litre and a Secchi depth of 0.5 metre. These relationships are approximately [[linear]] so that 5% reflectance would correspond to a sediment concentration of approximately 15 milligram/litre and a Secchi depth of 1 metre. In the [[Mississippi River]] plume regions these same reflectance values would represent sediment concentrations that are about ten times or more higher.

==Hurricanes==

As one would expect, the majority of these images reveal large increases in turbidity in the regions where a hurricane has made landfall. The increases are primarily due to sediments that have been resuspended from the shallow bottom regions. In areas near shore some of the signal may also be due to sediments [[erosion|eroded]] from [[beach]]es as well as from sediment laden river plumes. In some cases a post-hurricane [[phytoplankton bloom]] due to increased [[nutrient]] availability may perhaps be detectable.

The examination of the turbidity after the passing of a hurricane can have potentially many uses for coastal resource management including:

* identifying regional "hot spots" where the erosion could be expected to be most severe
* estimating the total sediment concentration that has been mobilized by the hurricane
* determining the spatial extent of the sediment mobilization
* identifying the extent and contribution of river plumes
* assessing and predicting potential [[ecosystem]] impacts

With regard to these uses, determining the regions of high turbidity will allow managers to best decide on response strategies as well as help ensure that post-hurricane resources are most effectively utilized.

==Interpreting images==

Only a small fraction of the light incident on the ocean will be reflected and received by the satellite. The probability for a [[photon]] to reflect and exit the ocean decreases exponentially with length of its path through the water because the ocean is an absorbing medium. The more ocean a photon must travel through, the greater its chances of being absorbed by something. After absorption, it will eventually become part of the ocean's heat reservoir. The absorption and scattering characteristics of a water body determine the rate of vertical light attenuation and set a limit to the depths contributing to a satellite signal. A reasonable rule of thumb is that 90 percent of the signal coming from the water that is seen by the satellite is from the first attenuation length. How deep this is depends on the absorption and scattering properties of both the water itself and other constituents in the water. For wavelengths in the near infrared and longer, the penetration depth varies from a metre to a few [[micrometre]]s. For band 1, the penetration depth will usually be between 1 and 10 metres. If the water has a large turbidity spike below 10 metres, the spike is unlikely to be seen by a satellite.

For very shallow clear water there is a good chance the bottom may be seen. For example, in the [[Bahamas]], the water is quite clear and only a few metres deep, resulting in an apparent high turbidity because the bottom reflects a lot of the band 1 light. For areas with consistently high turbidity signals, particularly areas with relatively clear water, part of the signal may be due to bottom reflection. Normally this will not be a problem with a post-hurricane turbidity image since the [[storm]] easily resuspends enough sediment such that bottom reflection is negligible.

[[Cloud]]s are also problematic for the interpretation of satellite derived turbidity. Cloud removal [[algorithm]]s perform a satisfactory job for [[pixel]]s that are fully cloudy. Partially cloudy pixels are much harder to identify and typically result in false high turbidity estimates. High turbidity values near clouds are suspect.

'''Our World In Data''' (OWID) is an [[Electronic publishing|online publication]] that presents empirical research and data that show how [[living conditions]] around the world are changing.  The web publication on [[International development|global development]] uses interactive [[Data visualization|data visualisations]] (charts and maps) to present the research findings on development that explain the causes and consequences of the observed changes.  The aim is to show how the world is changing and why.

The publication is developed at the [[University of Oxford]] and authored by social [[historian]] and development economist [[Max Roser]]. It covers a wide range of topics across many academic disciplines: Trends in [[health]], [[Hunger|food provision]], the [[Economic growth|growth]] and [[Economic inequality|distribution of incomes]], [[violence]], [[Human rights|rights]], [[war]]s, [[culture]], [[energy use]], [[education]], and [[environmental change]]s are empirically analysed and visualised in this web publication.

Covering all of these aspects in one resource makes it possible to understand how the observed long-run trends are interlinked. The research on global development is presented to the audience of interested readers, journalists, academics, and policy people. The articles cross-reference each other to make it possible for the reader to learn about the drivers of the observed long-run trends. For each topic the quality of the data is discussed and, by pointing the visitor to the sources, this website works as a database of databases – a meta-database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ourworldindata.org/about/|title=About — Our World in Data|website=ourworldindata.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], before the [[Syrian Civil War]], oil sales for 2010 were projected to generate $3.2 billion for the Syrian government and accounted for 25.1% of the state's revenue.&lt;ref name=IMF&gt;{{cite book|title=IMF Country Report No. 10/86 |date=March 2010 |page=17|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2010/cr1086.pdf|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syria's oil sector has been hit by the Civil War and international sanctions imposed on Syria.

Syria’s two biggest oil companies are the [[Syrian Petroleum Company]] (SPC), which is owned by the Syrian Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, and Al-Furat Petroleum Company, which is 50% owned by SPC and the other 50% foreign owned. The joint venture currently includes SPC with 50%, [[Royal Dutch Shell|Anglo-Dutch Shell]] with 32%, and the remainder held by Himalaya Energy Syria, a consortium of [[China National Petroleum Company]] and [[India]]'s [[Oil and Natural Gas Corporation]].&lt;ref name=EIA/&gt; As of December 2011 Shell has suspended operations in Syria due to EU sanctions.&lt;ref name=ft021211&gt;{{cite web|title=Shell to quit Syria after EU extends sanctions|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bc9dae8a-1cd1-11e1-a134-00144feabdc0.html#axzz24klfkSfR|publisher=Financial Times|date=2 December 2011|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important consortium is Deir Ez Zor Petroleum Company, owned by SPC and [[France]]'s [[Total S.A.|Total]].

Syria is the only significant crude oil producing country in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] region, which includes [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]]. According to the ''Oil and Gas Journal'', Syria had {{convert|2500000000|oilbbl|m3}} of petroleum reserves as of 1 January 2010.&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Analysis Brief: Syria|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=SY|publisher=US Energy Information Agency|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria's known oil reserves are mainly in the eastern part of the country in the [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]] near its border with [[Iraq]] and along the [[Euphrates River]], and a number of smaller fields are located in the center of the country.&lt;ref name=OBG95&gt;{{cite book|title=The Report: Syria 2011|year=2011|publisher=Oxford Business Group|isbn=1-907065-34-2|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oDz9juos_tkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Report:+Syria+2011+By+Oxford+Business+Group#v=onepage&amp;q=oil%20french%20mandate&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Syria produced around {{convert|385000|oilbbl|m3}} per day of crude oil.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;&lt;ref name=PBReview/&gt; Oil production has stabilized after falling for a number of years, and is poised to turn around as new fields come online.

== History ==
[[File:حقل نفط رميلان.jpg|thumb|A [[pumpjack]] in Syria's Rumeilan oil fields]]
Syrian oil exploration first began in 1933 during the French Mandate by the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (a consortium made up of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[BP]], [[Exxon-Mobil]], [[Total S.A.|Total]], and Gulbekian), which after unsuccessfully drilling eleven wells, gave up hope of finding any oil in Syria. In 1949, James W. Menhall (1881-1974), an independent oil producer from Illinois, United States, was approached by Syrian President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] to come to Syria to prospect for oil. His James W. Menhall Drilling Company was awarded a concession on 17 May 1955 by unanimous vote of the Syrian parliament and started drilling in April 1956.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In September 1956, Menhall discovered the [[Karatchok]] oil field with over 1 billion barrels of reserves. Six consecutive wells were drilled, each producing in excess of {{convert|4000|oilbbl|m3}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Menhall was just commencing preparations to drill the adjoining [[Rmelan|Rumeilan]] oil field (with over 500 million barrels of reserves) when, on 5 October 1958, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] of Egypt, as President of the [[United Arab Republic]], expropriated Menhall's concession and confiscated his equipment and three drilling rigs without compensation.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Syrian government, under the Baath Party leadership, has since refused to consider any compensation.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Syrian oil industry took off in 1968, when the Karatchok oil field began production after a pipeline connecting it to the [[Homs]] refinery was completed, although Syria did not begin exporting oil until the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="USState"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3580.htm | title=Background Note: Syria | publisher=US State Department | accessdate=18 August 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817013711/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3580.htm | archive-date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Syria's net [[List of countries by oil exports|petroleum exports]] were estimated to be {{convert|148000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=USGeoSurvey&gt;{{cite web|last=Taib|first=Mowafa|title=2009 Minerals Yearbook: Syria|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2009/myb3-2009-sy.pdf|publisher=US Geological Survey|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All oil exports are marketed by [[Sytrol]], Syria's state oil marketing firm, which sells most of its volumes under 12-month contracts. Before the imposition of EU sanctions, Syrian crude oil exports went mostly to the [[European Union]], in particular [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[France]], totaling an estimated {{convert|137400|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in 2009, according to [[Eurostat]].&lt;ref name=EurostatOil&gt;{{cite web|title=Imports (by country of origin) - oil - annual data|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=nrg_123a&amp;lang=en|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the European Union as a whole spent $4.1 billion on Syrian oil imports.&lt;ref name=EUOil&gt;{{cite web|title=Registration of Crude Oil Imports and Deliveries in the European Union 2010|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/observatory/oil/doc/import/coi/eu-coi-2010-01-12.pdf|publisher=European Commission Directorate-General for Energy|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local exporters of oil in Syria include the [[Altoun Group]] in Maraba, Damascus, Syria,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/media/aff/news-communiques/2012/05/18b.aspx Canada Tightens Sanctions Against Assad Regime].

The [[Syrian Civil War]] broke out in 2011 and is ongoing. In the same year, Syria’s major trading partners imposed international sanctions on Syrian oil and financial system, devastating the Syrian oil industry, adding to the devastation of the civil war.

==Challenges==
[[File:Syria oil exports by destination country 2010.gif|thumb|right|Syria oil exports by destination country in 2010 (note that as of 2012, all countries on this chart no longer trade oil with Syria due to sanctions against the country)]]
Besides the Civil War and the imposition of international sanctions, Syria's oil sector faces a number of challenges, including a decline in output and production resulting from technological problems and a depletion of oil reserves. Syria's rate of oil production has decreased steadily from a peak of close to {{convert|610000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in 1995 down to approximately {{convert|385000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in 2010. Meanwhile, consumption is rising, which means that Syria could become a net oil importer within a decade.&lt;ref name=PBReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=USState/&gt;{{update inline|?=yes|date=December 2015}} To counteract this problem, Syria intensified oil exploration efforts.

Syria's upstream oil production and development has traditionally been the mandate of the [[Syrian Petroleum Company]] (SPC), owned by the Syrian Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. SPC has undertaken efforts to reverse the trend toward declining oil production and exports by increasing oil exploration and production in partnership with foreign oil companies. The SPC directly controls about half of the country's oil production and takes a 50% stake in development work with foreign partners.&lt;ref name=EIA/&gt;

[[Foreign direct investment|Foreign investment]] is vital for improving production levels; however, following the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, many countries important to Syria's oil exports have imposed sanctions, which legally prevents Western companies from working in the country.

Al-Furat Petroleum Company is a joint venture established in 1985. It is currently 50% owned by SPC and the other 50% is foreign owned: [[Royal Dutch Shell|Anglo-Dutch Shell]] with 32%, and the remainder held by Himalaya Energy Syria, a consortium of [[China National Petroleum Company]] and [[India]]'s [[Oil and Natural Gas Corporation]].&lt;ref name=EIA/&gt; The company produced an average {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}. As of December 2011 Shell has suspended operations in Syria due to EU sanctions.&lt;ref name=ft021211/&gt;

Deir Ez Zor Petroleum Company is a consortium owned by SPC and [[France]]'s [[Total S.A.|Total]]. Total formed its Syrian operation in 1988 and in 2008 renewed its partnership sharing agreement with Syria.

Another option to handle the increase in domestic oil consumption besides increasing oil production is to switch [[power station]]s from oil-fired to [[natural gas]]-fired.

'''Ronald Douglas Lawrence''' (September 12, 1921 – November 27, 2003) was a [[Canadian]] naturalist and wildlife author. He was an expert on the [[wildlife of Canada]], on which he wrote more than thirty books, which have been published in 14 languages.&lt;ref name="macleans"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Jenish |first=D. |date=August 19, 1996 |title=The call of the wild |magazine=Maclean's |volume=109 |issue=34 |pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life: Spain, Britain, and war===
Lawrence was born in 1921 on a British passenger ship in the [[Bay of Biscay]] off the coast of [[Spain]]. His mother was Spanish and his father, a journalist, was British. He was one of five children. As a child in northern Spain, Lawrence developed an early interest in nature. In his autobiography, he described his young self as a "happy loner engrossed in the natural world ... I cannot recall a single day when I was bored".&lt;ref name="eh"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Earth Heroes: Champions of Wild Animals |last=Malnor |first=Carol |last2=Hovemann |first2=Anisa Claire |last3=Malnor |first3=Bruce |publisher=Dawn Publications |year=2010 |isbn=9781584691235 |pages=71–85 |chapter=Ronald 'RD' Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At 14 years, Lawrence lied about his age so that he could join the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and killed a man on his first night to save himself.&lt;ref name="eh"/&gt; He served for two years, but finding himself outnumbered in the [[Pyrenees]], fled to France in 1938. Shortly after he traveled to Britain to rejoin his family, and during the summer of 1939 he worked on the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]''. With the arrival of World War II, he enlisted with the British and spent another five years at war, beginning in September 1939. He was a tank gunner in [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]] and [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], and participated in [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] at Normandy, where he was seriously injured in August 1944.&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Great naturalist emerges from obscurity |last=Butala |first=Sharon |date=July 23, 1994 |work=Toronto Star |page=H12}}&lt;/ref&gt; His leg was full of shrapnel, but he insisted that his leg not be amputated; instead, doctors removed 37 of 39 pieces of shrapnel, and Lawrence was determined to exercise the limb until he no longer walked with a limp.&lt;ref name="eh"/&gt; His war experiences scarred him, and are recounted in his 1994 autobiography, which he wrote at the encouragement of his publisher.&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt;

After the war, he studied biology at [[Cambridge University]] for four years, but did not complete his degree. He found the environment stifling, with snobbish students and a [[pedagogy]] that ignored the first-hand experience of nature.&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Wolf man was leader of the pack |last=Perkins |first=Martha |date=January 10, 2004 |work=The Globe and Mail |page=F8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Cambridge, he went back to Spain, where he worked as a journalist and novelist and married a British woman. They had a son in 1953 after returning to Britain.&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt;

===In Canada===
Lawrence moved to Canada alone in June 1954, later reflecting that "it was as if I had come home after a long absence".&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt; Living in Toronto, he became a reporter for the ''[[Toronto Star]]''.  Within six months he drove west to [[Rainy River, Ontario]] and purchased 100 acres of land for a homestead. His wife and son joined him in July 1955. For three years he made a living cutting timber from [[Crown land]] and selling it to mills. He and his wife had a second child, but his wife did not like their lifestyle in Canada, so she took the children to England and filed for divorce. Lawrence was left in the company of his four dogs, one part wolf, which he developed into a [[sled dog]] team. During this period Lawrence also sold fur pelts, but he came to view trapping as cruel, and stopped.&lt;ref name="eh"/&gt; 

In 1957 Lawrence left the area and headed west, embarking on months-long wilderness excursions, which he supported by working for newspapers and living frugally. In southeastern [[British Columbia]] he tracked a [[cougar]] for nine months, and in Ontario he observed a [[beaver]] colony for six months.&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt; Lawrence was extremely dedicated to wildlife observation, and believed that his close but unobtrusive study provided new insight into animal behavior. He said, for example, that he witnessed starving rabbits commit suicide by running their heads into trees, and saw [[herbivore]]s, like beavers, consume flesh.&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt; During this period he met Joan, his second wife, in Winnipeg, with whom he raised orphaned animals. By this time Lawrence had rescued moose calves, bear cubs, and wolves.&lt;ref name="eh"/&gt; Joan died in 1969. His decades of wilderness adventure and study were the material of his nature writing.&lt;ref name="eh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt;

Lawrence returned to Ontario and married Sharon, his third wife. They settled on a 100-acre property—his last home, called "Wolf Hollow"—in the [[Haliburton Highlands]]. He and Sharon rehabilitated wildlife, and Lawrence now lectured and supervised graduate students. According to his wife, "Ron mentored hundreds of young people ... so they in turn could continue to educate and influence younger generations".&lt;ref name="eh"/&gt;

The naturalist acknowledged [[Henry David Thoreau]] as a great influence in his life: "At fourteen I read ''[[Walden]]'' and was deeply impressed by one of Thoreau's sentences: 'In wildness is the preservation of the world.'"&lt;ref name="eh"/&gt; He was concerned and angry about humankind's treatment of nature, but generally kept his opinions out of his writing; he opposed [[clear-cut logging]] and the organized [[bear hunting|hunts of bears]] and wolves organized to control deer populations. He loved wolves and considered them the "ultimate stabilizers" in their ecosystems.&lt;ref name="eh"/&gt; In his memoir (''The Green Trees Beyond'', 1994), he wrote of his preference for nature over civilization, and explained how (per one reviewer) "he was taught to love for the first time by a wolf".&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; He reared a number of abandoned wolves: in his memoir, he wrote, "We cannot make up our minds whether we are a family of four people or a pack of four wolves ... The wolves, of course, have no doubt about the matter. They see us as a pack, Sharon fulfilling the role of much loved materfamilias, myself as the pack leader."&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;

Lawrence finished his last book in 1997, and had four in progress at the time of his death. ''Cry Wild'' (1970), a book about wolves, is Lawrence's most popular; a 1991 reprint in the United States sold 1.5 million copies in  three months.&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt;  Lawrence kept a low profile, which may explain his relative lack of fame in Canada, but his writing brought him much attention: he and Sharon received six thousand visitors to their Haliburton homestead over 12 years.&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt; Lawrence died of [[Alzheimer's disease]] on November 27, 2003, in [[Haliburton County, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;

[[File:Arendal_Tromøy_Spornes_b.JPG|300px|thumb|På Tromøy i [[Arendal]] kommune er raet avsatt helt ytterst mot Skagerrak i [[Raet National Park]].]]
'''Raet'''  is the largest [[terminal moraine]] in [[Scandinavia]]. It was formed during the end of the [[last glacial period]], 12,800–11,500 years ago, in one of the latest advances of the glaciers.

As the glacier retreated towards the end of this period, it could stop for hundreds of years before moving forward again. Material that the glacier brought from the inland, such as particles of rocks, gravel, sand and clay, gathered where the edge of the ice laid still for some time. Such deposits, which are partly deposited on land and partly in ocean, are called ''terminal moraine''.

As the ice pulled back and the land rose, these deposits were left behind in the landscape. Later these deposits have been affected by sea and precipitation so that the roughest material remains on the surface. If you dig yourself through a terminal moraine, it is the variation in the size of the particles that are striking; it consists of unsorted material.

[[File:Salatdyrking Rensgata Stokke (1).JPG|thumb|Agricultural areals by Akersvannet i Stokke in [[Vestfold]].]]

Several steps of terminal moraines or ra-steps in Norway can be identified. The oldest are located in the sea and along the sea, the youngest in the mountain valleys.

From ancient times, parts of Raet have been important as a route in Norway, especially in [[Vestfold]] and [[Østfold]].

==The word "ra"==
The word ''ra'' is of [[Old Norwegian]] origin and means a ridge of [[gravel]]. The word is used in Norwegian as a general term about terminal moraine.

This structure goes a long way over land and elsewhere under water.

In [[Vestfold]] and Østfold, this geological formation is very visible and well-known. The Ra step was deposited for about 10,600 years ago around a glacier covering most of Scandinavia and had its center above what is today [[Bottenviken]].

''Raet'' as the name of this long ridge through Vestfold is very old; in [[Horten]] municipality lies a farm called Ra. The word is used as farm name in many places in Norway, this is farms located on terminal moraines.

Today, knowledge of moraines and the ice age is taken as granted, but the knowledge about this is only about 150 years old. [[Geology]] research on moraines and the Ice Age took place in the mid-1800s, and it took a long time before an understanding of how the ra-step forms a coherent structure around the ice with [[Bottenviken]] as the center.

==Ra-trinnet==
[[File:Moelen4.jpg|300px|thumb|Mølen, helt sørvest i Brunlanes.]]
The Ra-step can be followed from Finland through Sweden to Northern Norway, some places in the sea, elsewhere far inland. From Sweden the ra-step can be followed into Østfold at [[Halden]] - [[Moss]], it crosses [[Oslofjorden]] at [[Jeløya]] and reaches [[Horten]], continues through [[Vestfold]], follows [[highway 19]] to Gulli, then old E18 to [[Larvik]], through [[Bøkeskogen]], over the [[Farris]] eidet and continues beyond [[Brunlanes]], extends into the sea and is visible above sea level as islands along [[Telemark]] and [[Aust-Agder]]: [[Mølen]], [[Jomfruland]], [[Merdø]] and some other small islands.

East of [[Fevik]] in [[Grimstad]], Raet goes on land and continues west to [[Rogaland]] and along Western Norway, Trøndelag and Northern Norway.

[[File:Farrisvannet2.jpg|thumb|left|Farrisvannet sett fra Gopledal vannverk]]
In Trøndelag, the ra-step is called [[Tautra]] because the ice edge crossed the Trondheimsfjord at [[Tautra]].

Raet dams up several lakes. In [[Østfold]] [[Vannsjø]] is among the seas that are created in this way, and in [[Vestfold]] this applies to [[Borrevannet]], [[Goksjø]] and [[Farris]] as well as the lake [[Rore]] in [[Grimstad]].

==Ytre Raet==
There is also a somewhat older maternity disposition a little beyond the big Raet, or Ra-stage, and this is often called ''Ytre Raet''. This older stage is 250 years older than the main stage.
The geographic distance between Raet and Ytre Raet varies, and the distance is greatest through [[Sandefjord]], [[Nøtterøy]] and [[Tønsberg]] where Ytre Raet crosses the northern part of Nøtterøy and continues in [[Slagen]], [[Ringshaug]] and [[Skallevold]]. In Brunlanes and at [[Fredrikstad]] and [[Halden]] the distance is shorter between the two ra-steps.

Ytre Raet contributes to large, good agricultural areas in the municipalities of Sandefjord, Nøtterøy and Tønsberg.

==The road at Raet==
[[File:Gravhaug på Raet Skjee 23709 2.JPG|thumb|Raet has been a major [[ancient trackway]] through large parts of Vestfold for more than thousand years. [[Tumuli]] and church buildings are located close to this trackway, as here is the old [[main highway]]. The image is from [[Skjee]] in the [[Sandefjord]] municipality.]]

[[File:Raet Hortensveien.jpg|thumb|[[Riksvei 19]] between Horten and Tønsberg, near the farm Ra follow the ancient trackway.]]
'''Raet''' is used as place name for large parts of the ra through Østfold and Vestfold. 

Raet was in [[old age]] a convenient route, because there were so few [[watercourse]]s to cross. When [[Bishop]] Jens Nilsson went on visits to [[Østfold]] and [[Bohuslän]] in the late 16th century, he traveled along Raet because it was easily accessible. Still [[European route E6|E6]] in Østfold and [[European route E18|E18]] in Vestfold follow Raet for long distances.

Raet also attracted settlements, so that the oldest, largest and best farms are still there.
Similarly [[tumuli]] in [[Iron Age]] often was located along Raet.&lt;ref&gt;Einar Østmo: ''Arkeologi for alle'' (s. 94), Landbruksforlaget, Oslo 1998, {{ISBN|82-529-1156-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top of [[the moraine]] has been used as [[road]] from prehistoric times, and in some places ''Raveien '' is the name of the road.

[[European route E18|E18]] long followed this old trace in Vestfold from Sem to Farriseidet.
Now the road in the main traces follows a trace inside the raid.

In Østfold, [[European route E6|E6]] follows Raet from Halden to Moss.

The place [[Helgeroa]] in Vestfold, near the [[Mølen]], where Raet descended on the seabed, became a central place for a period of communication precisely because the location lay there the natural road in the direction of the east through Vestfold.

==Protection==
Several areas of raet are protected as [[national park]]s, landscaping areas and [[nature reserves]].

Two [[national park]]s are on the Raet: [[Jomfruland National Park]] in Telemark and [[Raet National Park]] in Aust-Agder. In [[Vestfold]] [[Mølen]] and [[Bøkeskogen]] in Larvik and [[Bøkemoa]] in the Sandefjord protected.

[[Gea Norvegica Geopark]] has as one of its tasks to convey knowledge about the importance of geology, and has information boards, among other things, on the [[Mølen]] in [[Brunlanes]] in Larvik municipality.

==Steps in ice melting in Eastern Norway==
In Eastern Norway, the different stages of ice melting are clearly marked in the landscape with endemorins in several stages.

The provisions in Eastern Norway are best investigated, and the moral steps in Eastern Norway have therefore become a reference framework in the national context.

Mostly, it has been so that the ice has moved forward at the same time in a larger area.

The oldest ra-step to be seen in Oslofjord is called [[Tjøme-Hvaler-step]] and is approximately 11,200 years old.

The next step is called '' Ytre Raet '' and is approximately 10,850 years old, while the main stage, ''Ra-Step'', is approx. 10,600 years old.

Younger is the [[Ås-Ski-step]], which forms the threshold for [[Inner Oslofjord]]. This is about 10,200–10,400 years old. Large sand areas are deposited as the ice lay at [[Drøbak]]-[[Svelvik]].

The next stop for the ice edge is called the Aker-step in the [[Groruddalen]] where the deposits demolishes [[Maridalsvannet]], [[Bogstadvannet]] and [[Sognsvann]]. In [[Sylling]], the acronym dams up [[Holsfjorden]]. The Aker step is approx. 9,800 years old.

On [[Romerike]] there are several steps of which [[Gardermoen]] or [[Hauerseter]] is the most marked with large sandboxes. This is about 9,600 years old.

Then the [[Minnesund]]-step is the last before the ice melted. This is about 9,500 years old.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3977">'''Rolling cone motion''' is the [[Rolling|rolling motion]] generated by a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] rolling over another cone. In rolling cone motion, at least one of the cones is [[convex body|convex]], while the other cone may be either convex, or concave, or a flat surface (a flat surface can be regarded as a special case of a cone whose [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] angle equals &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;). The distinguishing characteristic of a rolling cone, in relation to other [[axial symmetry|axially symmetrical]] rollers ([[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[sphere]], round disk), is that while rolling on a flat surface, the cone's [[center of gravity]] performs a [[circular motion]] rather than a [[linear motion|linear]] one. Another unique characteristic is that one of its points (its apex) is at rest throughout the entire motion.

==Kinematics==
[[File:Cone rolling over a cone.svg|thumb|300px|An illustration of a cone rolling over another cone.svg]]
The motion of a rolling cone can be described as a combination of a [[rotation|rotational motion]] of the cone around its axis of symmetry, and a [[rotary motion]] of its axis around the axis of symmetry of the stationary cone. The ratio between the [[angular velocity|angular velocities]] of these two motions is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1} ={\sin\alpha\over\sin\beta}&lt;/math&gt;  
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are the half apex angles of the stationary cone and the rolling cone, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is the angular velocity of the rolling cone's axis of symmetry around the axis of symmetry of the stationary cone, and  &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt;  is the angular velocity of the rolling cone around its own axis of symmetry. In the special case of a cone rolling on a flat surface, this ratio becomes &lt;math&gt;\sin \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the cone's half apex angle. For example, a cone having an apex angle of 120 degrees, while being rolled on a flat surface, will perform exactly two full rotations around its axis of symmetry before returning to its original position.

==Use==
One of the most practical applications of rolling cones is the use of  [[tapered roller bearing]]s in rotating devices. Tapered bearings can bear higher loads than [[ball bearing]]s in both radial and axial directions, and therefore are more frequently used as wheel bearings in most wheeled land vehicles.

In [[Conveyor systems]], conical rollers are sometimes used when there's a need to create a curved path. A common example is belt conveyors in airport terminals where there's a need to move the luggage in loops.

In the 18th and 19th century rolling cone motion was used in the process of [[olive oil extraction]]. The olives were put in a large circular basin and heavy metal cones were rolled upon them. The fact that a cone can roll in circles without sliding made it more efficient to use conical roller [[millstone]]s.

'''Soil Guideline Values''' (SGVs) are figures which are used in non-statutory technical guidance for assessors carrying out risk assessments to determine whether land is considered [[Contaminated land|‘contaminated’]] under [[United Kingdom]] law, that is “land which appears to… be in such a condition, by reason of substances in, on or under the land, that (a) significant harm is being caused or there is a significant possibility of such harm being caused…” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/43#commentary-c13739731|title=Environmental Protection Act 1990|last=Parliament of the United Kingdom|first=|date=1990|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This guidance stipulates three stages in such risk assessments:

#   Preliminary qualitative assessment including development of conceptual site model
#   Generic Quantitative Risk Assessment (GQRA)
#   Detailed Quantitative Risk Assessment (DQRA)

Soil Guideline Values are used in the second stage, GQRA, to determine whether harm caused by long-term exposure to a given soil concentration of chemicals ''may'' present an unacceptable risk to ''human'' health in some ''generic'' [[land-use]] scenario. The SGVs are therefore conservative estimates for a given scenario. Exceedance of a SGV does not confirm that there is a ‘significant possibility of significant harm’, merely that the possibility exists and therefore more detailed, site-specific investigation of contaminants present, pathways and receptors is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/297676/scho0309bpqm-e-e.pdf|title=Using Soil Guideline Values|last=Jeffries|first=J|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation and relationship to Generic Assessment Criteria ==
SGVs are derived by the [[Environment Agency]] using the ‘CLEA’ model (which can also be customised or used for DQRA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/455747/LIT_10167.pdf|title=CLEA Software (Version 1.05) Handbook|last=Environment Agency|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, there are no currently valid SGVs for many important and common elements, such as [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[lead]] or [[chromium]]. The only body mandated to produce these values is the Environment Agency, following extensive consultation with other government departments.

In lieu of such figures, equivalent values known as “Generic Assessment Criteria” (GAC) may be calculated by any individual or organisation, starting from [[toxicity]] and relevant data and using the CLEA model, just as the Environment Agency calculates SGVs. SGVs are in fact a GAC derived and published by the environment agency. For example, a range of GACs for more complex chemicals has been calculated and been made publicly available by charity CL:AIRE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.claire.co.uk/component/phocadownload/category/8-initiatives?download=44:gac-report-6-12-09b|title=Soil Generic Assessment Criteria for Human Health Risk Assessment|last=CL:AIRE|first=|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with input from a range of authoritative sources including the Environment Agency. That said, GACs are not always openly published, as deriving them is a complex matter and thus these values do hold commercial value for consultancies who have undertaken such calculations.

== Scenarios and inherent assumptions ==
There are three generic land-use scenarios for which SGVs are published, and most derivations of GACs also follow these scenarios:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291014/scho0508bnqw-e-e.pdf|title=Updated technical background to the CLEA model|last=Jeffries &amp; Martin|first=|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a residential setting, with a two-storey small terraced house where the most vulnerable ‘critical’ receptor of the contamination is a female child of zero to six years old, spending most of their time in or close to home
*  an allotment consisting of open space where vegetables may be grown, with the same critical receptor
* a commercial three-storey office where the critical receptor is a working female adult aged 16–65 years old and exposed for a working lifetime of 49 years for 45 hours per week.

SGVs and GACs derived from these scenarios may only be used if the scenarios apply exactly or otherwise it is clearly demonstrated that the scenarios are more conservative than the real-world situation. For example, in the case of a playing field, it could be argued that the residential scenario is suitably conservative:

*    the critical receptor (for the playing field) is likely to be older (than that for the residential case) therefore with a higher body mass and perhaps less likely to directly ingest soil
*    exposure times at the playing field will be far lower than at a residential site
*    the presumed absence of a building would likely reduce the possibility of vapour and dust build up
*    it’s unlikely for vegetables to be grown on the playing field
*    all possible pathways are considered within the residential scenario

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51736">{{about|the extrasolar phenomenon on solar-type stars|other uses|Super flare (disambiguation)}}

'''Superflares''' are very strong explosions observed on [[stars]] with energies up to ten thousand times that of typical [[solar flare]]s. The stars in this class satisfy conditions which should make them solar analogues, and would be expected to be stable over very long time scales.
The original nine candidates were detected by a variety of methods. No systematic study was possible until the launch of the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler satellite]], which monitored a very large number of solar-type stars with very high accuracy for an extended period. This showed that a small proportion of stars had violent outbursts, up to 10,000 times as powerful as the strongest flares known on the Sun. In many cases there were multiple events on the same star. Younger stars were more likely to flare than old ones, but strong events were seen on stars as old as the Sun.

The flares were initially explained by postulating [[giant planet]]s in very close orbits, such that the [[magnetic field]]s of the star and planet were linked. The orbit of the planet would warp the [[field line]]s until the instability released magnetic field energy as a flare. However, no such planet has showed up as a Kepler transit and this theory has been abandoned.

All superflare stars show quasi-periodic [[brightness]] variations interpreted as very large [[starspot]]s carried round by rotation. [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] studies found spectral lines that were clear indicators of [[chromosphere|chromospheric]] activity associated with strong and extensive magnetic fields. This suggests that superflares only differ in scale from solar flares.

Attempts have been made to detect past solar superflares from [[nitrate]] concentrations in [[polar ice]], from historical observations of [[aurora]]s, and from those [[radioactive isotope]]s that can be produced by solar energetic particles. Although two promising events have been found in the [[carbon-14]] records in tree rings, it is not possible to associate them definitely with a superflare event.

Solar superflares would have drastic effects, especially if they occurred as multiple events. Since they can occur on stars of the same age, mass and composition as the Sun this cannot be ruled out. However, solar-type superflare stars are very rare and are magnetically much more active than the Sun; if solar superflares do occur, it may be in well-defined episodes that occupy a small fraction of its time.

==Superflare stars==
A superflare star is not the same as a [[flare star]], which usually refers to a very late spectral type [[red dwarf]]. The term is restricted to large transient events on stars that satisfy the following conditions:&lt;ref name=schaefer1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaefer|first1=Bradley E.|last2=King|first2=Jeremy R.|last3=Deliyannis|first3=Constantine P.|title=Superflares on ordinary solar-type stars|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1 February 2000|volume=529|issue=2|pages=1026–1030|doi=10.1086/308325|arxiv = astro-ph/9909188 |bibcode = 2000ApJ...529.1026S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The star is in spectral class F8 to G8
* It is on or near the [[main sequence]]
* It is single or part of a very wide binary
* It is not a rapid rotator
* It is not exceedingly young
Essentially such stars may be regarded as solar analogues.
Originally nine superflare stars were found, some of them similar to the [[Sun]].

==Original superflare candidates==
The original paper &lt;ref name="schaefer1" /&gt; identified nine candidate objects from a literature search:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Star  !! Type !! V (mag) !! Detector !! Flare Amplitude !! Duration !! Energy (erg)
|-
| [[Groombridge 1830]] || G8 V || 6.45 || Photography || ΔB = 0.62 mag || 18 min || E&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| [[Kappa1 Ceti]] || G5 V || 4.83 || Spectroscopy || EW(He) = 0.13Å || ~ 40 min || E ~ 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| MT Tauri|| G5 V || 16.8 || Photography || ΔU = 0.7 mag || ~ 10 min || E&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| [[Pi1 Ursae Majoris]] || G1.5 Vb || 5.64 || X-ray || L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s || &gt;~ 35 min || E&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| S Fornacis || G1 V || 8.64 || Visual || ΔV ~ 3 mag|| 17 - 367 min || E&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| BD +10°2783 || G0 V || 10.0 || X-ray || L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s || ~ 49 min || E&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| [[Omicron Aquilae]] || F8 V || 5.11 || Photometry || ΔV = 0.09 mag || ~ 5 - 15 day || E&lt;sub&gt;BV&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| [[5 Serpentis]] || F8 IV-V || 5.06 || Photometry || ΔV = 0.09 mag || ~ 3 - 25 day || E&lt;sub&gt;BV&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| UU Coronae Borealis || F8 V || 8.86 || Photometry || ΔI = 0.30 mag || &gt;~ 57 min || E&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Type gives the [[spectral classification]] including spectral type and luminosity class.

V (mag) means the normal apparent [[visual magnitude]] of the star.

EW(He) is the [[equivalent width]] of the 5875.6Å He I D3 line seen in emission.

The observations vary for each object. Some are X-ray measurements, others are visual, photographic, spectroscopic or photometric. The energies for the events vary from 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; to 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; ergs.

== Kepler discoveries ==
The [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler spacecraft]] is a space observatory designed to find planets by the method of [[astronomical transit|transits]]. A [[photometer]] continually monitors the brightness of 150,000 stars in a fixed area of the sky (in the constellations of Cygnus, Lyra and Draco) to detect changes in brightness caused by planets passing in front of the stellar disc. More than 90,000 are [[G-type main sequence star|G-type stars]] (similar to the Sun) on or near the main sequence. The observed area corresponds to about 0.25% of the entire sky. The photometer is sensitive to wavelengths of 400–865&amp;nbsp;nm: the entire visible spectrum and part of the infrared. The photometric accuracy achieved by Kepler is typically 0.01% (0.1 mmag) for 30 minute integration times of 12th magnitude stars.

=== G-type stars ===
The high accuracy, the large number of stars observed and the long period of observation make Kepler ideal for detecting superflares. Studies published in 2012 and 2013 involved 83,000 stars over a period of 500 days (much of the data analysis was carried out with the help of five first-year undergraduates).&lt;ref name="maehara1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maehara|first1=Hiroyuki|last2=Shibayama|first2=Takuya|last3=Notsu|first3=Shota|last4=Notsu|first4=Yuta|last5=Nagao|first5=Takashi|last6=Kusaba|first6=Satoshi|last7=Honda|first7=Satoshi|last8=Nogami|first8=Daisaku|last9=Shibata|first9=Kazunari|title=Superflares on solar-type stars|journal=Nature|date=24 May 2012|volume=485|issue=7399|pages=478–481|doi=10.1038/nature11063|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7399/full/nature11063.html|bibcode = 2012Natur.485..478M|pmid=22622572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shibayama1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shibayama|first1=Takuya|last2=Maehara|first2=Hiroyuki|last3=Notsu|first3=Shota|last4=Notsu|first4=Yuta|last5=Nagao|first5=Takashi|last6=Honda|first6=Satoshi|last7=Ishii|first7=Takako T.|last8=Nogami|first8=Daisaku|last9=Shibata|first9=Kazunari|title=Superflares on solar-type stars observed with Kepler I.

The spectral classes range from F8 to G8.  The integration time was 30 min in the original study.  1547 superflares were found on 279 solar-type stars.The most intense events increased the brightness of the stars by 30% and had an energy of 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; ergs. White-light flares on the Sun change the brightness by about 0.01%, and the strongest flares have a visible-light energy of about 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;  ergs. (All energies quoted are in the optical bandpass and so are lower limits since some energy is emitted at other wavelengths.) Most events were much less energetic than this: flare amplitudes below 0.1% of the stellar value and energies of 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; ergs were detectable with the 30 minute integration. The flares had a rapid rise followed by an exponential decay on a time scale of 1–3 hours. The most powerful events corresponded to energies ten thousand greater than the largest flares observed on the Sun. Some stars flared very frequently: one star showed 57 events in 500 days, a rate of one every nine days. For the statistics of flares, the number of flares decreased with energy E roughly as E&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, a similar behaviour to solar flares. The duration of the flare increased with its energy, again in accordance with the solar behaviour.

Some Kepler data is taken at one minute sampling, though inevitably with lower accuracy.&lt;ref name="maehara2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maehara|first1=Hiroyuki|last2=Shibayama|first2=Takuya|last3=Notsu|first3=Yuta|last4=Notsu|first4=Shota|last5=Honda|first5=Satoshi|last6=Nogami|first6=Daisaku|last7=Shibata|first7=Kazunari|title=Statistical Properties of Superflares on Solar-Type Stars Based on 1-Min Cadence Data|journal=Earth, Planets and Space|date=29 April 2015|volume=67|page=59|doi=10.1186/s40623-015-0217-z|arxiv = 1504.00074 |bibcode = 2015EP&amp;S...67...59M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this data, on a smaller sample of stars, reveals flares that are too brief for reliable detection with 30-min integrations, allowing detection of events as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; ergs, comparable with the brightest flares on the Sun. The occurrence frequency as a function of energy remains a power law E&lt;sup&gt;−n&lt;/sup&gt; when extended to lower energies, with n around 1.5. At this time resolution some superflares show multiple peaks with separations of 100 to 1000 seconds, again comparable to the pulsations in solar flares. The star KIC 9655129  showed two periods, of 78 and 32 minutes, suggesting [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] oscillations in the flaring region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pugh|first1=C.E.|last2=Nakariakov|first2=V.M.|last3=Broomhall|first3=A.M.|title=A multi-period oscillation in a stellar superflare|journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=23 October 2015|volume=813|issue=1|page=L5|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/813/1/L5|arxiv = 1510.03613 |bibcode = 2015ApJ...813L...5P }}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations suggest that superflares are different only in scale and not in type to solar flares.

Superflare stars show a quasi-periodic brightness variation, which is interpreted as evidence of starspots carried around by solar rotation. This allows an estimate of the rotation period of the star; values range from less than one day up to tens of days (the value for the Sun is 25 days). On the Sun, radiometer monitoring from satellites shows that large sunspots can reduce the brightness by up to 0.2%. In superflare stars the most common brightness variations are 1-2%, though they can be as great as 7-8%, suggesting that the area of the starspots can be very much larger than anything found on the Sun. In some cases the brightness variations can be modelled by only one or two large starspots, though not all cases are so simple. The starspots could be groups of smaller spots or single giant spots.

Flares are more common in stars with short periods. However, the energy of the largest flares is not related to the period of rotation. Stars with larger variations also have much more frequent flares; there is as well a tendency for them to have more energetic flares. Large variations can be found on even the most slowly rotating stars: one star had a rotation period of 22.7 days and variations implying spot coverage of 2.5% of the surface, over ten times greater than the maximum solar value. By estimating the size of the starspots from the amplitude variation, and assuming solar values for the magnetic fields in the spots (1000 G),  it is possible to estimate the energy available: in all cases there is enough energy in the field to power even the largest flares observed. This suggests that superflares and solar flares have essentially the same mechanism.

In order to determine whether superflares can occur on the Sun, it is important to narrow the definition of Sun-like stars. When the temperature range is divided into stars with T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;  above and below 5600K (early and late G-type stars), stars of lower temperature are about twice as likely to show superflare activity as those in the solar range and those that do so have more flares: the occurrence frequency of flares (number per star per year) is about five times as great in the late-type stars. It is well known that both the rotation rate and the magnetic activity of a star decrease with age in G-type stars. When flare stars are divided into fast and slow rotators, using the rotation period estimated from brightness variations, there is a general tendency for the fastest-rotating (and presumably youngest) stars to show a greater probability of activity: in particular, stars rotating in less than 10 days are 20-30 times more likely to have activity. Nevertheless, 44 superflares were found on 19 stars with similar temperatures to the Sun and periods greater than 10 days (out of 14000 such stars examined); four superflares with energies in the range 1-5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; ergs were detected on stars rotating more slowly than the Sun (of about 5000 in the sample). The distribution of flares with energy has the same shape for all classes of star: although Sun-like stars are less likely to flare, they have the same proportion of very energetic flares as younger and cooler stars.

=== K and M type stars ===
Kepler data have also been used to search for flares on stars of later spectral types than G. A sample of 23,253 stars with effective temperature T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; less than 5150K and surface gravity log g &gt; 4.2, corresponding to main sequence stars later than K0V, was examined for flares over a time period of 33.5 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walkowicz|first1=Lucianne M.|author1link=Lucianne Walkowicz|title=White-light flares on cool stars in the Kepler Quarter 1 data|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=13 January 2011|volume=141|issue=2|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/141/2/50|display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1008.0853 |bibcode = 2011AJ....141...50W|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 373 stars were identified as having obvious flares. Some stars had only one flare, while others showed as many as fifteen. The strongest events increased the brightness of the star by 7-8%. This is not radically different from the peak brightness of flares on G-type stars; however, since K and M stars are less luminous than type G, this suggests that flares on these stars are less energetic. Comparing the two classes of stars studied, it seems that M stars flare more frequently than K stars but the duration of each flare tends to be shorter. It is not possible to draw any conclusions about the relative proportion of G and K type stars showing superflares, or about the frequency of flares on those stars that do show such activity,  since the flare detection algorithms and criteria in the two studies are quite different.

Most (though not all) of the K and M stars show the same quasi-periodic brightness variations as the G stars. There is a tendency for more energetic flares to occur on more variable stars; however flare frequency is only weakly related to variability.

[[Wiktionary:putative#English|putative]]
&lt;/ref&gt; that these eruptions may be produced by the interaction of the star's magnetic field with the magnetic field of a gas-giant planet orbiting so close to the primary that the magnetic fields were linked.  Rotation or orbital motion would wind up the magnetic fields until a reconfiguration of the fields would cause an explosive release of energy. The [[RS Canum Venaticorum variable]]s are close binaries, with orbital periods between 1 and 14 days, in which the primary is an F- or G-type main sequence star, and with strong chromospheric activity at all orbital phases.  These systems have brightness variations attributed to large starspots on the primary; some show large flares thought to be caused by magnetic reconnection. The companion is close enough to spin up the star by tidal interactions.

A gas giant however would not be massive enough to do this, leaving the various measurable properties of the star (rotation speed, chromospheric activity) unchanged. If the giant and the primary were close enough for the magnetic fields to be linked, the orbit of the planet would wrap the field lines until the configuration became unstable followed by a violent release of energy in the form of a flare. Kepler discovered a number of closely orbiting gas giants, known as [[hot Jupiter]]s; studies of two such systems showed periodic variations of the chromospheric activity of the primary synchronised to the period of the companion.

Not all planetary transits can be detected by Kepler, since the planetary orbit may be out of the line of sight to Earth. However, the hot Jupiters orbit so close to the primary that the chance of a transit is about 10%. If superflares were caused by close planets the 279 flare stars discovered should have about 28 transiting companions; none of them actually showed evidence of transits, effectively excluding this explanation.

==Spectroscopic observations of superflare stars==
Spectroscopic studies of superflares allow their properties to be determined in more detail, in the hope of detecting the cause of the flares. The first studies were made using the high dispersion spectrograph on the [[Subaru telescope]] in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="notsu2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Notsu|first1=Yuta|last2=Honda|first2=Satoshi|last3=Maehara|first3=Hiroyuki|last4=Notsu|first4=Shota|last5=Shibayama|first5=Takuya|last6=Nogami|first6=Daisaku|last7=Shibata|first7=Kazunari|title=High-dispersion Spectroscopy of Solar-type Superﬂare Stars I.

Of these, only 16 showed evidence of being visual or spectroscopic binaries; these were excluded since close binaries are frequently active, while in the case of visual binaries there is the chance of activity taking place on the companion. Spectroscopy allows accurate determinations of the effective temperature, the surface gravity and the abundance of elements beyond helium ('[[metallicity]]'); most of the 34 single stars proved to be main sequence stars of spectral type G and similar composition to the Sun. Since properties such as temperature and surface gravity change over the lifetime of a star, stellar evolution theory allows an estimate of the age of a star: in most cases the age appeared to be above several hundred million years. This is important since very young stars are known to be much more active. Nine of the stars conformed to the narrower definition of solar-type given above, with temperatures greater than 5600K and rotation periods longer than 10 days; some had periods above 20 or even 30 days. Only five of the 34 could be described as fast rotators.

Observations from [[LAMOST]] have been used to measure [[Chromosphere#On other stars|chromospheric activity]] of 5,648 solar-like stars in the Kepler field, including 48 superflare stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karoff|first=Christoffer|last2=Knudsen|first2=Mads Faurschou |last3=De Cat|first3=Peter |last4=Bonanno|first4=Alfio |last5=Fogtmann-Schulz|first5=Alexandra |last6=Fu|first6=Jianning |last7=Frasca|first7=Antonio |last8=Inceoglu|first8=Fadil |last9=Olsen|first9=Jesper |date=2016-03-24|title=Observational evidence for enhanced magnetic activity of superflare stars |url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160324/ncomms11058/full/ncomms11058.html|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=7|pages=11058|doi=10.1038/ncomms11058|pmc=4820840|pmid=27009381|bibcode = 2016NatCo...711058K }}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations show that superflare stars are generally characterized by larger chromospheric emissions than other stars, including the Sun. However, superflare stars with activity levels lower than, or comparable to, the Sun do exist, suggesting that solar flares and superflares most likely share the same origin. The very large ensemble of solar-like stars included in this study enables detailed and robust estimates of the relation between chromospheric activity and the occurrence of superflares.

All the stars showed the quasi-periodic brightness variations, ranging from 0.1% to nearly 10%, interpreted as the rotation of large starspots.&lt;ref name="notsu2015b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Notsu|first1=Yuta|last2=Honda|first2=Satoshi|last3=Maehara|first3=Hiroyuki|last4=Notsu|first4=Shota|last5=Shibayama|first5=Takuya|last6=Nogami|first6=Daisaku|last7=Shibata|first7=Kazunari|title=High Dispersion Spectroscopy of Solar-type Superﬂare Stars II. Stellar Rotation, Starspots, and Chromospheric Activities|journal=Publ. Astron. Soc. Jpn.|date=29 March 2015|volume=67|issue=3|page=33|doi=10.1093/pasj/psv002|arxiv = 1412.8245 |bibcode = 2015PASJ...67...33N }}&lt;/ref&gt; When large spots exist on a star, the activity level of the [[chromosphere]] becomes high; in particular, large chromospheric [[plage (astronomy)|plages]] form around sunspot groups. The intensities of certain solar and stellar lines generated in the chromosphere, particularly the lines of ionised calcium (Ca II) and the Hα line of hydrogen, are known to be indicators of magnetic activity. Observations of the Ca lines in stars of similar age to the Sun even show cyclic variations reminiscent of the 11 year solar cycle. By observing certain infrared lines of Ca II for the 34 superflare stars it was possible to estimate their chromospheric activity. Measurements of the same lines at points within an active region on the Sun, together with simultaneous measurements of the local magnetic field, show that there is a general relation between field and activity.

Although the stars show a clear correlation between rotational speed and activity, this does not exclude activity on slowly rotating stars: even stars as slow as the Sun can have high activity.  All the superflare stars observed had more activity than the Sun, implying larger magnetic fields. There is also a correlation between the activity of a star and its brightness variations (and therefore the starspot coverage): all stars with large amplitude variations showed high activity.

Knowing the approximate area covered by starspots from the size of the variations, and the field strength estimated from the chromospheric activity, allows an estimate of the total energy stored in the magnetic field; in all cases there was enough energy stored in the field to account for even the largest superflares. Both the photometric and the spectroscopic observations are consistent with the theory that superflares are different only in scale from solar flares, and can be accounted for by the release of magnetic energy in active regions very much larger than those on the Sun. Nevertheless, these regions can appear on stars with masses, temperatures, compositions, rotation speeds and ages similar to the Sun.

== Detecting past superflares on the Sun==
Since stars apparently identical to the Sun can produce superflares it is natural to ask if the Sun itself can do so, and to try to find evidence that it has done in the past. Large flares are invariably accompanied by energetic particles, and these particles produce effects if they reach the earth. The [[Carrington event]] of 1859, the largest flare of which we have direct observation, produced global [[aurora |auroral displays]] extending close to the equator. Energetic particles can produce chemical changes in the atmosphere, which can be permanently recorded in the polar ice. Fast protons generate distinctive isotopes, particularly carbon-14, which can be taken up and preserved by living creatures.

===Nitrate concentrations in polar ice===
When solar energetic particles reach the Earth's atmosphere they cause ionisation that creates nitric oxide (NO) and other reactive nitrogen species, which then precipitate out in the form of nitrates. Since all energetic particles are deflected to a greater or lesser extent by the geomagnetic field, they enter preferentially at the polar latitudes; since high latitudes also contain permanent ice, it is natural to look for the nitrate signature of particle events in [[ice core]]s. A study of a Greenland ice core extending back to 1561 AD achieved resolutions of 10 or 20 samples a year, allowing in principle the detection of single events.&lt;ref name="schrijver2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schrijver|first1=C.J.|display-authors = etal|title=Estimating the frequency of extremely energetic solar events, based on solar, stellar, lunar, and terrestrial records|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=9 August 2012|volume=117|issue=A8|page=A08103|doi=10.1029/2012JA017706|arxiv = 1206.4889 |bibcode = 2012JGRA..117.8103S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Precise dates (within one or two years) can be achieved by counting annual layers in the cores, checked by identification of deposits associated with known volcanic eruptions. The core contained an annual variation of nitrate concentration, accompanied by a number of 'spikes' of different amplitudes. The strongest of these in the entire record was dated to within a few weeks of the Carrington event of 1859. However, other events can produce nitrate spikes, including biomass burning which also produces enhanced ammonium concentrations. An examination of fourteen ice cores from Antarctic and Arctic regions showed large nitrate spikes: however, none of them were dated to 1859 (the closest was 1863). All such spikes were associated with ammonium and other chemical indicators of combustion. There is no evidence that nitrate concentrations can be used as indicators of historic solar activity.

===Single events from cosmogenic isotopes===
When energetic protons enter the atmosphere they create isotopes by reactions with the major components; the most important of these is [[carbon-14]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C), which is created when secondary neutrons react with nitrogen. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C, which has a [[half-life]] of 5,730 years, reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide which is taken up by plants; dating wood by its &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C content is the basis of [[radiocarbon dating]]. If wood of known age is available the process can be reversed. Measuring the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C content and using the half-life allows estimation of the content when the wood was formed. The growth rings of trees show patterns, caused by various environmental factors: [[dendrochronology]] uses these growth rings of trees, compared across overlapping sequences, to establish accurate dates. Applying this method shows that atmospheric &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C does indeed vary with time, due to solar activity. This is the basis of the carbon dating calibration curve. Clearly, it can also be used to detect any peaks in production caused by solar flares, if those flares create enough energetic particles to produce a measurable increase in &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C.

An examination of the calibration curve, which has a time resolution of five years, showed three intervals in the last 3,000 years in which &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C increased significantly.&lt;ref name="miyake2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake|first1=Fusa|last2=Nagaya|first2=Kentaro|last3=Masuda |first3=Kimiaki|last4=Nakamura|first4=Toshio|title=A signature of cosmic-ray increase in AD 774–775 from tree rings in Japan|journal=Nature |date=14 June 2012|volume=486|issue=7402|pages=240–2|doi=10.1038/nature11123|bibcode = 2012Natur.486..240M|pmid=22699615}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of this two Japanese cedar trees were examined with a resolution of a single year, and showed [[774–775 carbon-14 spike|an increase of 1.2% in AD 774]], some twenty times larger than anything expected from the normal solar variation.

Carbon-14 is not the only isotope that can be produced by energetic particles. [[Beryllium-10]] (&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be) is also formed from nitrogen and oxygen, and deposited in polar ice. However, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be deposition can be strongly related to local weather and shows extreme geographic variability; it is also more difficult to assign dates.&lt;ref name="thomas2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Brian C. |last2=Melott |first2=Adrian L.|last3=Arkenberg|first3=Keith R.|last4=Snyder II|first4=Brock R.|title=Terrestrial effects of possible astrophysical sources of an AD 774-775 increase in 14C production|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=26 March 2013|volume=40 |issue=6 |page=1237 |doi=10.1002/grl.50222|arxiv = 1302.1501 |bibcode = 2013GeoRL..40.1237T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be increase during the 770s was found in an ice core from the Antarctic, though the signal was less striking because of the lower time resolution (several years); another smaller increase was seen in Greenland.&lt;ref name="usoskin2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miyake2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miyake |first1=Fusa |last2=Masuda |first2=Kimiaki|last3=Nakamura|first3=Toshio|title=Another rapid event in the carbon-14 content of tree rings|journal=Nature Communications |date=7 November 2013|volume=4|page=1748|doi=10.1038/ncomms2783|bibcode = 2013NatCo...4E1748M|pmid=23612289}}&lt;/ref&gt; When data from two sites in North Greenland and one in the West Antarctic, all taken with a one-year resolution, were compared they all showed a strong signal: the time profile also matched well with the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C results (within the uncertainty of dating for the &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be data).&lt;ref name="mekhaldi2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mekhaldi|first1=Florian|display-authors = etal|title=Multiradionuclide evidence for the solar origin of the cosmic-ray events of AD 774/5 and 993/4|journal=Nature Communications|date=26 October 2015|volume=6|page=8611 |doi=10.1038/ncomms9611 |bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8611M|pmid=26497389|pmc=4639793}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chlorine-36]] (&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl) can be produced from argon and deposited in polar ice; because argon is a minor atmospheric constituent the abundance is low. The same ice cores which showed &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be also provided increases of &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl, though with a resolution of five years a detailed match was impossible.

[[993-994 carbon-14 spike|A second event in AD 993/4]] has also been found from  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in tree rings, but at a lower intensity.&lt;ref name ="miyake2013" /&gt; This event also produced measurable increases in &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl in Greenland ice cores.

If these events are presumed to be produced by fast particles from large flares, it is not easy to estimate the particle energy in the flare or compare it with known events. The Carrington event does not appear in the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C record, and neither did any other large particle event that has been directly observed. The flux of particles must be estimated by calculating production rates of radiocarbon, and then modelling the behaviour of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt; once it has entered the carbon cycle; the fraction of the created radiocarbon taken up by trees depends to some extent on that cycle. As an extra complication, the cosmogenic isotopes are preferentially created by energetic protons (several hundred MeV). The energetic particle spectrum of a solar flare varies considerably between events; one with a 'hard' spectrum, with more high-energy protons, will be more efficient at producing a &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C increase. The most powerful flare which also had a hard spectrum that has been observed instrumentally took place in February 1956 (the beginning of nuclear testing obscures any possible effects in the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C record); it has been estimated that if a single flare were responsible for the AD 774/5 event it would need to be 25-50 times more powerful than this. A sunspot group may produce several flares over its lifetime, and the effects of such a sequence would be aggregated over the one-year period covered by a single &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C measurement; however, the total effect would still be ten times greater than anything observed in a similar period in modern times.

Solar flares are not the only possibility for producing the cosmogenic isotopes. A long or short [[gamma-ray burst]] has been proposed as being consistent with all the details of the AD 774/5 event if it was sufficiently close.&lt;ref name="pavlov2013"&gt;{{ cite journal|last1 = Pavlov |first1 = A.K. |last2 = Blinov |first2 = A.V. |last3 = Konstantinov |first3 = A.N.|display-authors = etal |title = AD 775 pulse of cosmogenic radionuclides production as imprint of a Galactic gamma-ray burst|journal =  Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date = 2013|volume = 435|issue = 4 |pages = 2878–2884|doi =10.1093/mnras/stt1468|arxiv = 1308.1272 |bibcode = 2013MNRAS.435.2878P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hambaryan2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hambaryan |first1=V.

===Historical records===
A number of attempts have been made to find additional evidence supporting the superflare interpretation of the isotope peak around AD 774/5 by studying historical records. The Carrington event produced auroral displays as far south as Caribbean and Hawaii, corresponding to [[geomagnetic latitude]] of about 22°;&lt;ref name="tsurutani2003"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the event of 774/5 corresponded to an even more energetic flare there should have been a global auroral event.

Usoskin et al.&lt;ref name="usoskin2013"/&gt; cited references to aurorae in Chinese chronicles for AD 770 (twice), 773 and 775. They also quote a “red cross” in the sky in AD 773/4  from the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]];  “inflamed shields” or “shields burning with a red colour” seen in the sky over Germany in AD 776 recorded in the [[Royal Frankish Annals]]; “fire in heaven” seen in Ireland in AD 772; and an apparition in Germany in AD 773 interpreted as riders on white horses. Even if the dates do not precisely conform to the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C increase this might suggest a period of high solar activity. Zhou et al.&lt;ref name="zhou2013"&gt;{{cite web

On a date which they give as 17 January AD 775, there were more than ten bands of white lights “like the spread silk” stretching across eight Chinese constellations; the display lasted for several hours. The observations, made during the Tang dynasty, were made from the capital Xian; although geomagnetic latitudes change over time, this would correspond to the lower twenties.

There are a number of difficulties involved when trying to link the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C results to historical chronicles. Tree ring dates may be in error because there is no discernible ring for a year (unusually cold weather), or two rings (a second growth during a warm autumn). If the cold weather were global, following a large volcanic eruption, it is conceivable that the effects could also be global: the apparent &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C date may not always match the chronicles.

===General solar activity in the past===
Superflares seem to be associated with a general high level of magnetic activity. As well as looking for individual events, it is possible to examine the isotope records to find the activity level in the past and identify periods when it may have been much higher than now. Lunar rocks provide a record unaffected by geomagnetic shielding and transport processes. Both cosmic rays and solar particle events can create isotopes in rocks, and both are affected by solar activity. The cosmic rays are much more energetic and penetrate more deeply, and can be distinguished from the solar particles which affect the outer layers. Several different radioisotopes can be produced with very different half-lives; the concentration of each may be regarded as representing an average of particle flux over its half-life. Since fluxes must be converted into isotope concentrations by simulations there is a certain model-dependence here. The data are consistent with the view that the flux of energetic solar particles with energies above a few tens of MeV has not changed over periods ranging from five thousand to five million years. Of course, a period of intense activity over a time scale short with respect to the half-life would not be detected.

&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C measurements, even with low time resolution, can indicate the state of solar activity over the last 11,000 years until about 1900. Although radiocarbon dating has been applied as far back as 50,000 years, during the deglaciations at the start of the Holocene the biosphere and its carbon uptake changed dramatically making estimation before this impractical; after about 1900 the [[Suess effect]] makes interpretation difficult. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be concentrations in stratified polar ice cores provide an independent measure of activity. Both measures agree reasonably with each other and with the Zurich sunspot number of the last two centuries. As an additional check, it is possible to recover the isotope [[Titanium-44]] (&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti) from meteorites; this provides a measurement of activity that is not affected by changes in transport process or the geomagnetic field. Although it is limited to about the last two centuries, it is consistent with all but one of the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be reconstructions and confirms their validity.  The energetic flare events discussed above are rare; on long time scales (significantly more than a year), the radiogenic particle flux is dominated by cosmic rays. The inner solar system is shielded by the general magnetic field of the sun, which is strongly dependent on the time within a cycle and the strength of the cycle. The result is that times of powerful activity show up as ''decreases'' in the concentrations of all these isotopes. Because cosmic rays are also influenced by the geomagnetic field, difficulties in reconstructing this field set a limit to the accuracy of the reconstructions.

The &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C reconstruction of activity over the last 11,000 years shows no period significantly higher than the present; in fact, the general level of activity in the second half of the 20th century was the highest since 9000 BC. In particular, the activity in the period around the AD 774 &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C event (averaged over decades) was somewhat lower than the long-term average, while the AD 993 event coincided with a small minimum. A more detailed scrutiny of the period AD 731 to 825, combining several &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C datasets of one- and two-year resolution with auroral and sunspot accounts does show a general increase in solar activity (from a low level) after about AD 733, reaching its highest level after 757 and remaining high in the 760s and 770s; there were several aurorae around this time, and even a low-latitude aurora in China.

== Effects of a hypothetical solar superflare ==
The effect of the sort of superflare apparently found on the original nine candidate stars would be catastrophic for the Earth and would leave traces on the [[Solar System]]; the event on S Fornacis for example involved an increase in the stars' luminosity by a factor of about twenty. Thomas Gold suggested that the glaze on the top surface of certain lunar rocks might be caused by a solar outburst involving a luminosity increase of over a hundred times for 10 to 100 seconds at some time in the last 30,000 years.&lt;ref name="gold1969"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gold|first1=Thomas|title=Apollo 11 Observations of a Remarkable Glazing Phenomenon on the Lunar Surface|journal=Science|date=26 September 1969|volume=165|issue=3900|pages=1345–9|doi=10.1126/science.165.3900.1345|bibcode = 1969Sci...165.1345G|pmid=17817880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the terrestrial effects, this would cause local ice melting followed by refreezing as far out as the moons of Jupiter. There is no evidence of superflares on this scale having occurred in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="RS2000" /&gt;. 

Even for much smaller superflares, at the lower end of the Kepler range, the effects would be serious. In 1859 the Carrington event caused failures in the telegraph system in Europe and North America. Possible consequences today would include:
* Damage to or loss of all artificial satellites
* Airline passengers on trans-polar flights would receive high radiation doses from the energetic particles (as would any astronauts or the crew of the [[International Space Station]])
* Significant depletion of the [[ozone layer]] with increased risk of cataracts, sunburn and skin cancer, as well as damage to growing plants. The recovery time would be of the order of months to years. In the strongest cases there would be severe damage to the biosphere, especially to primary photosynthesis in the oceans
* Failure of the electricity distribution system (as in the [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm]]), possibly with damage to transformers and switching equipment
* Loss of power to the cooling systems of spent fuel rods stored at nuclear power stations
* Loss of most radio communication because of increased ionisation in the atmosphere
It is evident that superflares often repeat rather than occurring as isolated events. The NO and other odd nitrogens created by flare particles catalyse the destruction of ozone without being consumed themselves, and have a long lifetime in the stratosphere. Flares at a frequency of one a year or even less would have a cumulative effect; the destruction of the ozone layer could be permanent and lead to at least a low-level extinction event.

Superflares have also been suggested as a solution to the [[Faint young Sun paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Airapetian|first=V. S.|last2=Glocer|first2=A.|last3=Gronoff|first3=G.|last4=Hébrard|first4=E.|last5=Danchi|first5=W.|title=Prebiotic chemistry and atmospheric warming of early Earth by an active young Sun|journal=Nature Geoscience|doi=10.1038/ngeo2719|volume=9|issue=6|pages=452–455|bibcode = 2016NatGe...9..452A |year=2016|hdl=10871/31990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Can superflares occur on the Sun?==
Since superflares can occur on stars apparently equivalent in every way to the Sun, it is natural to ask if they can occur on the Sun itself. An estimate based on the original Kepler photometric studies suggested a frequency on solar-type stars (early G-type and rotation period more than 10 days) of once every 800 years for an energy of 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; erg and every 5000 years at  10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; erg.&lt;ref name="shibayama1" /&gt; One-minute sampling provided statistics for less energetic flares and gave a frequency of one flare of energy 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; erg every 5–600 years for a star rotating as slowly as the Sun; this would be rated as X100 on the solar flare scale.&lt;ref name="maehara2015" /&gt; This is based on a straightforward comparison of the number of stars studied with the number of flares observed. An extrapolation of the empirical statistics for solar flares to an energy of 10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; erg suggests a frequency of one in 10,000 years.

However, this does not match the known properties of superflare stars. Such stars are extremely rare in the Kepler data; one study showed only 279 such stars in 31,457 studied, a proportion below 1%; for older stars this fell to 0.25%.&lt;ref name="shibayama1" /&gt;  Also, about half of the stars which were active showed repeating flares: one had as many as 57 events in 500 days. Concentrating on solar-type stars, the most active averaged one flare every 100 days; the frequency of superﬂare occurrence in the most active Sun-like stars is 1000 times larger than that of the general average for such stars. This suggests that such behaviour is not present throughout a star's lifetime, but is confined to episodes of extraordinary activity. This is also suggested by the clear relation between the magnetic activity of a star and its superflare activity; in particular, superflare stars are much more active (based on starspot area) than the Sun.

There is no evidence for any flare greater than the Carrington event (about  10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg, or 1/10,000 of the largest superflares) in the last 200 years. Although larger events from the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C record ca. 775 AD is unambiguously identified as a solar event, its association to the flare energy is unclear, and it is unlikely to exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg. 

The more energetic superflares  seem to be ruled out by energetic considerations for our sun, which suggest it is not capable of a flare of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; ergs&lt;ref&gt;Kitchatinov, L.L., Mordvinov, A.V. and Nepomnyashchikh, A.A., 2018. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02833.pdf Modelling variability of solar activity cycles]&lt;/ref&gt;. A calculation of the free energy in magnetic fields in active regions that could be released as flares gives a lower upper bound of around 3×10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg suggesting the most energetic a super flare can be is three times that of the Carrington event&lt;ref name=Katsova/&gt;.

Some stars have a magnetic field 5 times that of Earth and rotate much faster and these could theoretically have a flare of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; ergs. This could explain some superflares at the lower end of the range. To go higher than this may require an anti-solar rotation curve - one in which the polar regions rotate faster than the equatorial regions&lt;ref name=Katsova&gt;Katsova, M.M., Kitchatinov, L.L., Livshits, M.A., Moss, D.L., Sokoloff, D.D. and Usoskin, I.G., 2018.

The '''Supreme War Council''' was a central command that coordinated Allied military strategy during [[World War I]]. It was founded in 1917, and was based in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]. The council served as a forum for preliminary discussions of potential armistice terms and peace treaty settlement conditions.

==Formation==
[[United Kingdom|British]] [[Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] had grave concerns regarding the strategy of Sir [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|William Robertson]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], and Sir [[Douglas Haig]], the Commander in Chief of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], in response to the Allied losses at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] and at [[Battle of Passchendaele]]. 

Following the Italian defeat at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], in which the Germans and Austro-Hungarians surprised the Italian forces, Lloyd George proposed the formation of the Supreme War Council at the [[Rapallo Conference]] of 5–7 November 1917.

Japan and Russia were not to be included, and the Italians and French, worried that [[Macedonian front|Salonika]] might be evacuated, wanted it confined to the Western Front.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp191-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permanent Military Representatives===
Each Allied nation would also appoint a senior military officer as Permanent Military Representative. The French PMR was [[Ferdinand Foch]], later replaced by [[Maxime Weygand]] and [[Joseph Joffre]]. The British were represented by Sir [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Hughes Wilson]]. Italy was represented by [[Luigi Cadorna]].

The USA, which was "Associated" with the Allies, was not involved with the political structures, but sent a Permanent Military Representative, [[Tasker H. Bliss]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp191-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson and his staff conducted numerous research projects into offensives against Turkey, culminating in the "Joint Note 12".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp194-5&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Supreme War Council (30 January- 1 February) [[Maurice Hankey|Hankey]] recorded that the national Commanders-in-Chief, national Chiefs of Staff and PMRs “all gave different advice” creating “a worse state of chaos than I have ever known in all my wide experience”. Lloyd George, whose main goal was to thwart Robertson, blocked a suggestion by Foch (French Chief of Staff) that the proposed Allied Reserve be controlled by the national Chiefs of Staff, possibly prompted by the notes Wilson was passing him across the table. It was eventually agreed that Foch should command the Reserve, with Wilson as his deputy.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp197&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied Reserve eventually slipped from the agenda as the Commanders-in-Chief, [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]] and [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] refused to hand over sufficient troops. Early in 1918 Wilson replaced Robertson as [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] and at the end of March Foch became Allied [[Generalissimo]]. After April 1918 all Allied troops on the Western Front were placed under the command of the {{lang|fr|{{ill|Grand Quartier général des armées alliées|fr}} (GQGA)}}, a multi-national general staff that developed from the Supreme War Council. The {{lang|fr|GQGA}} was on similar lines to the {{lang|fr|[[Grand Quartier Général (1914–1919)|GQG]]}} and came under General [[Ferdinand Foch]], who had overall command of all Allied troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lagarde|first=Lieutenant Benoît|title=Grand Quartier Général des Armées Alliées, 1914–1918|url=http://www.servicehistorique.sga.defense.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/SHDGR_REP_15NN_GQGA.pdf|work=Sous-Serie GR 15 NN - Répertoire Numérique Detaillé|publisher=[[Defence Historical Service|Service Historique de la Défense]]|accessdate=5 July 2017|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without its two main personalities the military machinery at Versailles became less important.

==Meetings==

===14–16 January 1920 in Paris, France===
This meeting was held four days after the ratification of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. [[Lloyd George]] proposed dropping the blockade of the [[Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic]] by starting negotiations with the "Russian people" in the form of the [[All Russian Co-operative Society|centrosoyuz]], which at that time was not controlled by the [[Bolsheviks]]. This was agreed, with a communique from the Council being published on 16 January. In the event, the negotiations soon became simply between the [[United Kingdom]] and a bolshevised centrosoyuz, leading to the [[Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement]].

===6–16 July 1920 in Spa, Belgium===
{{main|Spa Conference of 1920}}
This was attended by [[Weimar Republic|German]] delegates to discuss [[war reparations]].

'''War tax due stamp''' is a kind of [[War tax stamp|war tax]] and [[postage due]] stamps that was used for [[mail]] when the war tax has not been paid by the sender. They were issued in [[Romania]] between 1915 and 1921.&lt;ref name=academic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Владинец, Н. И.; Ильичёв, Л. И.; Левитас, И. Я.; Мазур, П. Ф.; Меркулов, И. Н.; Моросанов, И.

During war the sender of a [[Letter (message)|letter]] paid a war tax. Then they placed a war tax stamp on the letter showing the tax was paid. If the sender did not do that, a war tax due stamp was applied by the [[postal service]]. When the letter was delivered the person receiving the letter paid double the normal rate.&lt;ref name=academic/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2430">Many species of [[wildflower]]s are native to [[New England]]. There are four important community types which show considerable diversity and blending across this [[United States physiographic region]]. These are: alpine, coniferous forests, northern hardwood forests, and wetlands. Wetlands may be further subdivided into bogs, swamps, and bottomlands.  
This article lists some of these '''Wildflowers of New England''' and references sites for further research.

==Threats==
[[Habitat]] Loss and [[Invasive Species]] are major threats to the wildflowers of this region.
These invasive species include [[Purple Loosestrife]], [[Garlic Mustard]] and [[Multiflora Rose]].
