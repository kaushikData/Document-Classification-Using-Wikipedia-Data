'''''$pread''''' was a quarterly [[magazine]] by and for [[sex worker]]s and those who support their rights. The magazine's focus was: "personal experiences and political insights" and it "contain(ed) practical information like news, features, health columns, and resources related to the sex industry".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About |url=http://www.spreadmagazine.org/ |publisher=$pread Magazine |accessdate=April 2, 2015|date=May 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528104430/http://www.spreadmagazine.org/ |archivedate=May 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Articles were written by readers as well as by figures from academic, cultural, and literary backgrounds, most of whom are current or former sex workers. The magazine was launched on March 15, 2005 by Rachel Aimee, Rebecca Lynn, and Raven Strega.&lt;ref name="Rough Trade"/&gt; ''$pread'' was based in New York City, and was sold throughout the United States and Canada at [[independent bookstore]]s and via national distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/pread-magazine-provided-a-smart-funny-lifeline-for-sex-workers-around-the-world-069|title=Remembering '$pread,' the Magazine That Gave Sex Workers a Voice - VICE|website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A co-editor said, "We want the general public to become aware of issues such as the physical working conditions of sex workers and their health care and housing needs, and to start considering sex workers as real people rather than mythical beasts who only come to life when someone drops a quarter into a slot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-01-11/people/whore-pride/2 ''Whore Pride''], Rachel Kramer Bussel, The Village Voice, January 11, 2005 Accessed March 26, 2009.  [https://www.webcitation.org/5g85vYnGj?url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-01-11/people/whore-pride/2 Archived] April 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''$pread'' published personal experiences, political insights, and contained practical information, such as news, features, health columns, and sex industry resources. ''$pread'' supported the sex work community by donating 15% of each print run to the workplaces of and the outreach organizations utilized by sex workers. The tax outreach program "helps sex workers who don't know they can and should file taxes", said [[Audacia Ray]], an executive editor at the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/nyregion/05sex.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Federal%20Taxes%20(US) An Old Profession That's New to Doing Taxes]. Corey Kilgannon, ''The New York Times''. April 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 30, 2010, ''$pread'' has ceased printed publication due to both financial issues and not having enough people to keep the operation running, even if "there was $100k made available".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spreadmagazine.org/2010/08/30/pread-is-dead-really/ $pread is Dead, Really] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5g86YpQZk?url=http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 |date=April 18, 2009 }}. Retrieved September 6, 2010.  $pread Blog, August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Because ''$pread'' was part of the [[sex workers rights]] movement, it was criticized by some branches of feminism that believe that sex work is inherently degrading:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Among feminists, perceptions are no less polarized – sex workers are either fully empowered agents using their sexuality in unassailably positive ways, or victims of a job that degrades them by its very nature. Most feminist dialogues about sex work sound more like monologues; defensiveness, mischaracterizations, and willful ignorance abound, making casualties of complexity and nuance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 ''Hot &amp; Bothered'', Bitch Magazine, Issue 33, Fall 2006 ] Accessed March 26, 2009.[https://www.webcitation.org/5g86YpQZk?url=http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 Archived] April 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''$pread'' Book==
[[The Feminist Press]] released a collection of some of the articles and essays from the original publications of the magazine into a 368-page book on the 15th March 2015 entitled ''$pread : The Best of the Magazine that Illuminated the Sex Industry and Started a Media Revolution''.&lt;ref name="$pread book publication from The Feminist Press"&gt;{{cite web |title=$pread book publication by The Feminist Press |url=http://www.feministpress.org/books/pread |accessdate=April 2, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XfDSTm1n?url=http://www.feministpress.org/books/pread |archivedate=April 9, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Absolute music''' (sometimes '''abstract music''') is music that is not explicitly "about" anything; in contrast to [[program music]], it is non-[[Representation (arts)|representational]].&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;M. C. Horowitz (ed.), ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-684-31377-4}}, vol.1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early [[German Romanticism]], such as [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] but the term was not coined until 1846 where it was first used by [[Richard Wagner]] in a programme to [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]].&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahlhaus|first=Carl|title=The Idea of Absolute Music|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthetic ideas underlying the absolute music derive from debates over the relative value of what were known in the early years of aesthetic theory as the fine arts.  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], in his ''[[Critique of Aesthetic Judgment]]'', dismissed music as "more enjoyment than culture" because of its lack of conceptual content, thus taking as a negative the very feature of music that others celebrated.  [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], in contrast, regarded music as the highest of the arts because of its spirituality, which Herder linked to the invisibility of sound.  The ensuing arguments among musicians, composers, music historians and critics have, in effect, never stopped.

== The Spiritualist debate ==

A group of Romantics consisting of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Jean Paul Richter]] and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] gave rise to the idea of what can be labeled as "spiritual absolutism". In this respect, instrumental music transcends other arts and languages to become the discourse of a 'higher realm' – rooted greatly in [http://academic.cengage.com/music/book_content/049557273X_wrightSimms_DEMO/assets/ITOW/7273X_INT_07_ITOW_Hoffmann.pdf Hoffmann’s famous review of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony], published in 1810. These protagonists believed that music could be more emotionally powerful and stimulating without words. According to Richter, music would eventually 'outlast' the word.

==The Formalist debate==
Formalism is the concept of music for music's sake and refers to instrumental music. In this respect, music has no meaning at all and is enjoyed by appreciation of its formal structure and technical construction. The 19th century music critic [[Eduard Hanslick]] argued that music could be enjoyed as pure sound and form, that it needed no connotation of extra-musical elements to warrant its existence. In fact, these extra-musical ideas detracted from the beauty of the music. The Absolute, in this case, is the purity of the art.

{{quote|Music has no subject beyond the combinations of notes we hear, for music speaks not only by means of sounds, it speaks nothing but sound.|Eduard Hanslick&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the [[liner notes]] to the [[Juilliard String Quartet]]'s ''Intimate Letters''. Sony Classical SK 66840.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Formalism therefore rejected genres such as opera, song and tone poems as they conveyed explicit meanings or programmatic imagery. Symphonic forms were considered more aesthetically pure. (The choral finale of [[Beethoven]]'s Ninth Symphony, as well as the programmatic Sixth Symphony, became problematic to formalist critics who had championed the composer as a pioneer of the Absolute, especially with the late quartets).

[[Carl Dahlhaus]] describes absolute music as music without a "concept, object, and purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Art and the Senses | publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Bacci, Francesca  |author2=Melcher, David | year=2011 | pages=253 | isbn=9780199230600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition and objections to absolute music===

The majority of opposition to the idea of instrumental music being 'absolute' came from [[Richard Wagner]]. It seemed ludicrous to him that art could exist without meaning; for him it had no right to exist.

[[Wagner]] considered the choral finale of [[Beethoven]]'s Ninth Symphony to be the proof that music works better with words, famously saying: "Where music can go no further, there comes the word&amp;nbsp;... the word stands higher than the tone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=JE4h5YAIftYC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Quest for Voice: On Music, Politics, and the Limits of Philosophy: the 1997 Ernest Bloch Lectures|last=Goehr|first=Lydia|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520214125|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagner also called Beethoven's Ninth Symphony the death knell of the symphony, for he was far more interested in combining all forms of art with his {{lang|de|[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]}}.

==Contemporary views==
Today, the debate continues over whether music has meaning or not.  However, most contemporary views, reflecting ideas emerging from views of subjectivity in [[linguistic meaning]] arising in [[cognitive linguistics]], as well as [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]]'s work on cultural biases in science and other ideas on meaning and [[aesthetics]] (e.g. [[Wittgenstein]] on cultural constructions in thought and language&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 | title =        Wittgenstein the Musical: Notes toward an Appreciation
 | author =       Béla Szabados
 | journal =    AE: Canadian Aesthetics Journal / Revue canadienne d'esthétique
 | url =          https://www.uqtr.ca/AE/Vol_10/wittgenstein/szabados.htm
 | date =         Fall 2004
 | pages =   Volume 10 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;), appear to be moving 
towards a consensus that music provides at least some [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]ification or meaning, in terms of which it is ''understood''.

The cultural bases of musical understanding have been highlighted in [[Philip Bohlman]]'s work, who considers music as a form of cultural communication:
{{quote|There are those who believe that music represents nothing other than itself. I argue that we are constantly giving it new and different abilities to represent who we are.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 | title =        The Meaning of Music
 | author =       Shula Neuman
 | journal =    The [[University of Chicago]] Chronicle
 | url =          http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/980402/bohlman.shtml
 | date =         April 2, 1998
 | pages =   Vol. 17, No. 13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Bohlman has gone on to argue that the use of music, e.g. among the Jewish diaspora, was in fact a form of ''identity building''.

[[Susan McClary]] has criticised the notion of 'absolute music', arguing that all music, whether explicitly programmatic or not, contains implicit programs that reflect the tastes, politics, aesthetic philosophies and social attitudes of the composer and their historical situation. Such scholars would argue that classical music is rarely about nothing, but reflects aesthetic tastes that are themselves influenced by culture, politics and philosophy. Composers are often bound up in a web of tradition and influence, in which they strive to consciously situate themselves in relation to other composers and styles. [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]], on the other hand, believes music has no means to reserve a "specific layer or pocket for meaning. Once it has been brought into sustainable connection with a structure of prejudgment, music simply becomes meaningful."

Music which appears to demand an interpretation, but is abstract enough to warrant objectivity (e.g. [[Tchaikovsky]]'s 6th Symphony), is what [[Lydia Goehr]] refers to as 'double-sided autonomy'. This happens when the formalist properties of music became attractive to composers because, having no meaning to speak of, music could be used to envision an alternative cultural and/or political order, while escaping the scrutiny of the censor (particularly common in [[Shostakovich]], most notably the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies).

===Linguistic meaning===
On the topic of musical meaning, 
[[Wittgenstein]], at several points in his late diary ''Culture and Value'',&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|trans-title = [[Culture and Value]] |title = Vermischte Bemerkungen
|author = [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] |translator=Peter Winch&lt;!-- |trans-date=1984--&gt; |year = 1944 |page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; ascribes meaning to music, for instance, that in the finale, 
a conclusion is being drawn, e.g.:
{{quote|[One] can point to particular places in a tune by Schubert and say: look, that is the point of the tune, this is where the thought comes to a head.}}

[[Jerrold Levinson]] has drawn extensively on Wittgenstein to comment: 
{{quote|Intelligible music stands to literal thinking in precisely the same relation as does intelligible verbal discourse. If that relation be not exemplification but instead, say, expression, then music and language are, at any rate, in the same, and quite comfortable, boat.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

[[File:Adele Blood 1910.jpg|thumb|140px|Adele Blood {{circa|1910}}]]
'''Adele Mary Blood''' (April 23, 1886 – September 13, 1936) was an American actress in [[silent movies]], [[vaudeville]], and theater.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
She was born on April 23, 1886, in [[San Francisco, California]], to Ira E. Blood and Frances Emma Stewart. Frances was a member of the Alameda school department for many years. Adele moved to the eastern [[United States]] some years before 1917. As a youth, she was a talented equestrienne, had an interest in fashion, and admired the theater.

===Career===
Blood's first public performance was at the [[California Theatre (San Francisco)|California Theatre]] in [[San Francisco]]. She acted the character ''Marguerite'' in a production featuring Lewis Morrison as ''Mephisto''. Blood appeared in numerous plays as the [[leading lady]]. Some of the theatrical presentations in which she starred are ''The Unmasking'', ''All Rivers Meet The Sea'', and ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]''. In the latter she was with the stock company of Edward Davis, her first husband. Davis was a clergyman-actor who was formerly the pastor of the First Christian Church in [[Oakland, California]]. Their marriage was turbulent and Blood began divorce proceedings in 1914. Actress [[Jule Power]] was named as [[co-respondent]] in her suit. Davis responded by naming Governor [[Earl L. Brewer|Earl Brewer]] of [[Mississippi]] as co-respondent in counter charges against Blood. She finally won her divorce suit after which she left on a tour of the Orient. Following her divorce from Davis she was briefly married to Englishman Waddell Hope.

During her vaudeville tours Blood was on stage in most of the prominent cities in the United States. She starred for five years in ''Everywoman''. During her travels she was known as "the most beautiful blonde on the American stage". She made two motion pictures including ''The Devil's Toy'' (1916) and ''[[The Riddle: Woman]]'' (1920).

By December 1917, Blood retired. She became the devoted companion of her sister-in-law, Susanna Holmes, who was known as the "Silver Queen". Blood became named heiress to the Holmes' fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Oakland Tribune]] |title=Adele Blood, Stage Beauty, May Inherit Big Fortune |date=December 29, 1917 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood eventually eschewed both wealth and social position because she believed it led to a philosophy of pessimism. She returned to the stage by accepting an offer from the Oriental company of Tim Frawley.

In 1926 she met Colonel R.W. Castle in [[Kashmir]]. He was an [[England|English]] officer in the Indian service. The two were engaged and planned a wedding in [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Adele Blood to Wed. Actress Engaged to Col. R.W.

==Death==
On the night of September 13, 1936, Blood shot herself in the head at her home on the grounds of the [[Westchester Country Club]] in [[Harrison, New York]]. She died a few hours later at the [[United Hospital (Port Chester, New York)|United Hospital]] in [[Port Chester, New York]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Adele Blood Hope, Actress, Ends Life.

Her 17-year-old daughter, Dawn, was in the home with friends when they heard the sound of a gunshot come from Blood's bedroom. Dawn told police that her mother had been financially pressed and worried excessively in the previous two weeks.

Adele's possessions were auctioned off garnering $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Hope Effects Auctioned.

Dawn Blood committed suicide in July 1939. She was 19.

==Legacy==
Blood financed a summer stock company and leased the auditorium of the Bronxville High School for plays. The plays were scheduled to run for six weeks, but closed in three weeks. Both mother and daughter appeared in the casts.

'''Aerial rigging''' is a specialty within the field of rigging that deals specifically with human loads.  Aerial rigging is the process of setting up equipment used to make humans fly, specifically aerial [[circus]] and aerial dance equipment. The field is of critical importance, and a thorough grasp of the principles of aerial rigging is essential in order to ensure the safety of the artists and the audience.

Aerial rigging is commonly practiced to different degrees by specialty fabricators, professional riggers, professional [[Acrobatics|aerial artists]], as well as amateur aerial artists. Most aerial circus equipment is built by fabricators around the world that build equipment specifically for the circus industry.

Aerial artists, both professional and amateur, often become riggers out of necessity. They generally learn to rig what they need.

WLA [[Hazard analysis|(Weak Link Analysis)]] is the process of systematically analyzing aerial rigging for the weakest link or links in the system.  WLA is the most common process used by aerial riggers to assess and improve rigging.  However, it is not the only system used.

The American Radio Archives are part of the Special Collections Department at Grant R. Brimhall Library. The purpose of the archives is to collect, preserve, and share materials related to the history of the radio in perpetuity.

The addition of the Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters materials greatly expanded the collection in both size and scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ppbwebsite.org/about.html|title=Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters|last=(323)851-6400|first=iNet // Web Solutions, Los Angeles|website=www.ppbwebsite.org|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Radio collections include TV material, as actors and writers often crossed into the other medium. The development of television is therefore a large part of radio’s history, and well represented at the Broadcasting Collection. The TV scripts of ARA belong to two groups: the general Broadcasting Collection and a number of smaller collections. The Broadcasting Collection consists of scripts purchased over the years from various sources. Smaller collections contain material compiled by institutions and individuals. The scripts span more than 40 years of American TV history, including live broadcasting in the 1940s through the 1980s. The ARA covers the spectrum of TV entertainment programming, from soap opera to comedy, westerns, dramas, crime series, and more.&lt;ref&gt;Berard, Jeanette M. and Klaudia Englund (2009).

The solution concept '''authority distribution''' was formulated by [[Lloyd Shapley]] and his student X. Hu in 2003 to measure the authority power of players in a well-contracted organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hu |first=Xingwei |first2=Lloyd |last2=Shapley |title=On Authority Distributions in Organizations |journal=Games and Economic Behavior |volume=45 |pages=132–170 |year=2003 | doi = 10.1016/s0899-8256(03)00130-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The index generates the [[Shapley-Shubik power index]] and can be used in ranking, planning and organizational choice.

==Definition==

The organization contracts each individual by boss and approval relation with others. So each individual has its own authority structure, called command game. The [[Shapley-Shubik power index]] for these command games are
collectively denoted by a power transit matrix Ρ.

The authority distribution π is defined as the solution to the counterbalance equation π=πΡ. The basic idea for the counterbalance equation is that a person's power comes from his critical roles in others' command game; on the other hand, his power could also be redistributed to those who sit in his command game as vital players.

For a simple legislative body, π is simply the Shapley-Shubik power index, based on a probabilistic argument (,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hu |first=Xingwei |title=An Asymmetric Shapley–Shubik Power Index |journal=International Journal of Game Theory |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=229–240 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s00182-006-0011-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapley |first=L. S. |first2=M. |last2=Shubik |title=A Method for Evaluating the Distribution of Power in a Committee System |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=787–792 |year=1954 |doi=10.2307/1951053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Applications==

'''Example 1. College ranking by applicants’ acceptance'''

Suppose that there are large numbers of college applicants to apply the colleges
Each applicant files multiple applications. Each college then offers some
of its applicants admissions and rejects all others. Now some applicants may get no offer
from any college; the other then get one offer or multiple offers. An applicant with multiple
offers will decide which college to go to and reject all other colleges which make offers
to him. Of all applicants who apply to and receive offers from College i, we let P(i,j) be
the proportion of those applicants who decide to go to college j. Such applicants of
course apply to and receive offers from College j as well.

To rank the colleges by the acceptance rates of the applicants to whom offers were
made, we can apply the authority distribution associated with the matrix P. The so-called “authority distribution” can be regarded as the measure of relative
attractiveness of the colleges from the applicants’ point of view.

'''Example 2. Journal rankings by citations'''

Assume there are n journals in a scientific field. For any Journal i, each issue
contains many papers, and each paper has its list of references or citations. A paper in journal j
can be cited in another paper in Journal i as a reference. Of all papers cited by Journal i (repetition
counted), we let P(i,j) be the proportion of those papers which are published on Journal j. So P
measures the direct impact between any two journals and P(i, i) is the self-citation rate
for Journal i . The authority distribution for π = πP would quantify the long-term influence of
each journal in the group of journals and can be used to rank these journals.

'''Example 3. Planning of a freeway system'''

A few small towns believe that building a freeway system would be to their common
benefit. Say, they plan to build freeways F1,F2, . . . ,Fn−1. We let Fn be the existing traffic
channels of car, truck and bus. We assume that all the potential freeways have the same
length. Otherwise we can make up the assumption by dividing long freeways into smaller
segments and rename them all. The freeways with higher traffic intensity should be built
with more driving lanes and so receive more investments. Of all the traffic flow on Fi, we
let P(i,j) be the (estimated) proportion of the traffic flowing into Fj . Then the authority
distribution π satisfying π = πP will measure the relative traffic intensity on each Fi and
can be used in the investment allocation.

A similar issue can be found in designing an Internet or Intranet system.

'''Example 4. Real Effective Exchange Rates Weights'''

Assume there are n countries. Let P(i,j) be country j's weights of consumption of country's total production.
The associated π measures the weights in the trading system of n countries.

'''''Bit Boy!! Arcade''''' is a [[video game]] developed by Austrian indie studio Bplus for [[Nintendo 3DS]]' [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]] service. It was released in the United States on April 17, 2014 and in Europe on April 24, 2014. It's a sequel to the 2009 released ''[[Bit Boy!!]]'' for Nintendo's [[WiiWare]] service and the second installment of the ''[[Bit Boy!!]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/jf92XfxZZMDhKsJ5jZ2whWa6dGyW2_0D |title=– Bit Boy!! ARCADE – Game Info |publisher=Nintendo.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It uses a 3D, isometric playing field, with polygon characters.
According to Bplus two more sequels will be released in undefined future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bitboy.bplus.at/story.htm |title=#BitBoyARCADE |publisher=Bitboy.bplus.at |date= |accessdate=2014-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Players control a red cube named Kubi (from {{lang-el|κύβος}} (kubos) &lt;ref&gt;English ''cube'' from Old French &lt; Latin ''cubus'' &lt; Greek κύβος (''kubos'') meaning "a cube, a die, vertebra". In turn from [[PIE]] ''*keu(b)-'', "to bend, turn".&lt;/ref&gt;), who they must navigate through a series of worlds. The game follows the principle of rescuing Kubi's friends and avoid monsters that roam the levels. 
The main goal in each phase, each level consists of 10 normal and 10 action phases, is to rescue seven of Kubis friends.

The publisher denotes the game with the terms "Hide + Seek", "Avoid + Collect" and "Action + Puzzle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bitboy.bplus.at/story.htm |title=#BitBoyARCADE |publisher=Bitboy.bplus.at |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Each level is based on a square floor plan. On this grid-like basis Kubi is moved. The camera is oriented isometric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/37296/bit-boy-arcade-review |title=Bit Boy!! Arcade Review
| publisher = NintendoWorldReport.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The players define how fast Kubi is moving by pressing the control pad and the buttons at the same time. Depending on how fast they are pressed Kubi moves fast or slow.
The game uses the 3DS featured play coins to give the player the ability to purchase continues like it would be in a real arcade machine.

==Plot==

===Characters===
ZeLeLi is a mighty gearwheel-shaped being created out of the essence of our dying sun 7 billion years in the future. ZeLeLi is the origin of time, life and light so it possesses power over these universal forces. Travelling through time and space, ZeLeLi spreads the seed of life and light in all time in the whole universe. 
Its counterpart are the black Shadow Plättchen. Forcefully cut out of the negative space of a black hole, the black Shadow Plättchen represent exactly the opposite of ZeLeLi. Like the ZeLeLi, Plättchen are not limited within the constrains of time and space.
Wherever they come along they spread massive havoc.  
Central to the plot of the game are two main characters, the games hero Kubi and the game designer Bernd. He appears as a through the air floating pixel head and talks to Kubi during the games sequences.

===Story===
At the beginning of the game Kubi gets killed by a monster created from the black Shadow Plättchen. Bernd is devastated and pleads ZeLeLi for help. ZeLeLi turns back the time and gives Kubi and Bernd the ability to speak to each other. In the mean time Bernd deleted the game in which Kubi died to create another one in whom his hero doesn't have to suffer this fate. Kubi thinks that Bernd is the one who has kidnaped all of his friends and refuses to be the hero unless Bernd designs the game exactly like Kubi wants it to be. As the story continues it is hinted that Bernd even if he is the developer of the game is not allmighty. The Shadow Plättchen gained power by killing small fairies called Pixel Flies and by kidnaping their king. With this power they got the ability to take influence on the game. So Kubi and Bernd are forced to work together to save Kubis friends and the game itself.

==Development==
''Bit Boy!! Arcade'' was produced by Bplus. The first announcement was made via press release on 16 February 2012 stating that the game was halfway done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2012/02/bit_boy_arcade_for_eshop_is_halfway_done|title=Bit Boy!!

'''Caustic humour''' is a type of [[humour]] which relies on [[wit]]ty [[insult]]s. As is implied by the name (which literally means humour which is designed to [[Burn (injury)|burn]] or to [[corrode]]), it involves the clever use of language to convey biting, insulting, or sometimes even cruel remarks.

This kind of humour is often attributed to such comedians and comedic writers as [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Don Rickles]], [[George Carlin]], [[Bill Hicks]], [[Bea Arthur]], [[Andrew Dice Clay]], [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]], [[Simon Amstell]] and the "Wild" Ben Mason, philosophers  [[Voltaire]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and politicians Sir [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]], [[Paul Keating]], [[Derryn Hinch]], and [[Dennis Skinner]].

'''Code Mystics''' is a [[video game developer]] specializing in the emulation and remastering of older video games for modern systems.

==History==
Code Mystics was founded in 2009 by Jeff Vavasour. Prior to this, Vavasour had helped to found the [[Vancouver]] studio for Digital Eclipse Software in 1997; Digital Eclipse's focus was on emulation of old [[arcade game]]s for modern hardware. Digital Eclipse Software merged with [[ImaginEngine]] in 2003 to become [[Backbone Entertainment]], which later merged with several other small developers to form [[Foundation 9 Entertainment]] in 2005, which Vavasour served on as executive vice president for Canadian Operations. In 2006, Vavasour left Foundation 9 to become a consultant in the industry, but later sought for form Code Mystics, inviting former employees from Digital Eclipse to join him to continue to develop modern emulations of classic software title.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2011/02/geekdad-interview-jeff-vavasour-founder-and-ceo-of-code-mystics/ | title = GeekDad Interview: Jeff Vavasour – Founder and CEO of Code Mystics | first = Tony | last = Sims | date = February 14, 2011 | accessdate = June 22, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.codemystics.com/company.shtml | title = Code Mystics - Company | accessdate = June 22, 2016 | website = Code Mystics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Etiquette at the Ball.jpg|thumb|''Etiquette at the Ball'', London, 1895]]
'''Dance etiquette''' is the set of [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] rules which govern the [[social behavior]] of [[dance]] by its [[dancer|participants]]. Such rules include the way in which the participants should look and the way in which they approach, dance with and leave their partner. [[Etiquette]] can vary in its specification and stringency between different [[style of dance|styles of dance]]. 

== Western social dance rules ==
* The dancers move counter clockwise (from above) around the floor.
* When things go wrong on the dance floor always apologize. Generally it does not matter who is at fault.
* If you are moving more slowly than other dancers keep to the center of the floor.
* If you are engaged in conversation move off the dance floor.
* To cross the room either dance across the floor or walk around the perimeter.
* Carry food and beverages around the perimeter. Wipe up your own spills.
* While dancing, do not give dance tips unless asked. If asked, just give tips about what you were asked about. When engaged in giving a lengthy tip, or if you stop dancing to discuss it, move off the dance floor. And, above all, don't give that person tips again until they ask you again.
* The traditional rule about declining dances was that you could politely turn down a request to dance only by saying something like "No, thank you. I'm sitting this one out." or "I'd be happy to dance with you later. I just need to rest now.", and that if you turn down a request to dance, to be polite, it was considered important that you not dance at all during the dance in question. Many dance groups today have abandoned this rule, and explicitly say that it's always ok to decline a dance with a simple "no, thank you", and no reason need be given.
* Don't just dance with your favorite dancers. It's called "social" dancing for a reason.
* It is always up to the follow, not the lead, to set the distance between the partners. However, if the lead feels like he is being held too closely for comfort or safety, they might say something like "If you move away a little bit, I'll be able to lead you more safely." If either partner is not being allowed to set what they feel is a comfortable and safe distance, they should feel free to say that they need to sit down to rest, or something else equally polite.

'''"Episode 7202"''' is the 7202nd episode of the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]''. It premiered on [[Eleven (Australian TV channel)|Eleven]] on 1 September 2015. The episode was written by series producer [[Jason Herbison]] and directed by Declan Eames. It is ''Neighbours''{{'}} first [[Two-hander|three-hander]] in 30 years. Typically episodes of the show feature the ensemble cast and multiple on-going storylines. "Episode 7202" focuses on the conclusion to a long-running [[love triangle]] between [[Lauren Turner (Neighbours)|Lauren Turner]] ([[Kate Kendall]]), [[Brad Willis (Neighbours)|Brad Willis]] ([[Kip Gamblin]]) and [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]). Herbison hoped the episode would be memorable for viewers, while Gamblin was grateful that he, Elmaloglou and Kendall were trusted enough with it. 

Kendall thought the love-triangle was the perfect storyline to use the three-hander style and Elmaloglou said the consequences would be felt for a long time within the show. The episode was filmed in early June 2015. It is set in just two of the six houses on [[Ramsay Street]]. The actors described the filming schedule as "pretty busy" and a "collaborative effort". The episode was preceded by an online bonus scene titled "Before Dawn". "Episode 7202" received a positive reception from television critics, with one calling it "an ambitious move" and another dubbing it a "landmark episode" for the show. For his work on the episode, Herbison earned an [[AWGIE Award]] for Best Script for a Television Serial.

==Plot==
After spending the night together, [[Lauren Turner (Neighbours)|Lauren Turner]] ([[Kate Kendall]]) and [[Brad Willis (Neighbours)|Brad Willis]] ([[Kip Gamblin]]) discuss how things have changed between them. At Number 22, [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]) wakes up on the sofa alone and stares at an empty wine glass. Lauren asks Brad what he and Terese argued about and he tells her that Terese has not been attending her [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA meetings]]. Lauren then tells him that their night together does not have to go any further, but they agree to tell Terese, even though it could spell the end of the Willis's marriage. As he returns home, Brad finds Terese pouring a bottle of wine down the sink. She admits that she has a drinking problem and is willing to change. Terese then visits Lauren to ask for phone numbers of counsellors. Lauren calls Brad to tell him they can not reveal their affair to Terese. However, Terese receives an email containing aerial photos of the neighbourhood and she sees a picture of Brad and Lauren kissing. Realising that her husband has begun an affair, a devastated Terese returns to Number 32. 

Terese baits Lauren with questions about Brad until Lauren realises that Terese knows. Brad sees the email and returns to Lauren's home where Terese throws a jam jar at him. In the garden, Terese forces Lauren to admit that she has had feelings for Brad since they were reunited two years ago. Terese believes the affair has been going on for a while, and tries to find proof on Lauren's phone. She pushes Lauren into the swimming pool during the struggle. Brad goes after Terese and tries to explain that he and Lauren were going to tell her. Brad begs Terese to keep her appointment with the councillor, while she tells him to leave. Brad goes back to Lauren and asks if she meant what she said about having feelings for him for all that time. She says yes and gives him an ultimatum – try to work out a relationship with her or save his marriage to Terese. After leaving a sketch of Brad that Lauren drew on the lawn of Number 32, Terese calls her son and asks him to bring everyone home.

On 18 August 2015, David Knox of [[TV Tonight]] reported that ''Neighbours'' would be airing their first three-hander – an episode that features just three characters – on 1 September.&lt;ref name="Knox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/08/neighbours-first-just-3-characters-for-an-entire-episode.html|title=Neighbours first: just 3 characters for an entire episode|last=Knox|first=David|date=18 August 2015|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's episodes usually feature an ensemble cast with multiple on-going storylines.&lt;ref name="Baillie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/08/26/neighbours-breaks-with-its-30-year-tradition-for-a-special-episode-as-love-triangle-hits-explosive-climax-5361549/|title=Neighbours breaks with its 30 year tradition for a special episode as love triangle hits explosive climax|last=Baillie|first=Katie|date=26 August 2015|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Knox observed that it is uncommon for an Australian drama to focus on so few actors.&lt;ref name="Knox"/&gt; "Episode 7202" centres on the conclusion to a love-triangle storyline that has been running since 2013, with Brad Willis finally choosing Lauren Turner over his wife Terese.&lt;ref name="Knox"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baillie"/&gt; The episode is set in just two houses on opposite sides of [[Ramsay Street]], and the scenes deal with three of the [[Kübler-Ross model|five stages of grief]]: denial, anger and bargaining.&lt;ref name="Knox"/&gt;

The show's series producer Jason Herbison wrote the episode, and he hoped that it would be memorable for viewers in the future.&lt;ref name="Nervous"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a665402/neighbours-producer-jason-herbison-i-was-nervous-over-three-hander-episode.html#~pmurctpnUpgAEQ|title=Neighbours producer Jason Herbison: 'I was nervous over three-hander episode'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=26 August 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted to being worried about how the actors would react to the script, explaining "I was a bit nervous when I broke the news of the episode to Kate, Kip and Rebekah. Filming an entire episode with no other cast is a big call in fast-moving serial television. However, all three embraced the challenge and delivered some of their best performances ever."&lt;ref name="Nervous"/&gt; 

Gamblin was grateful to the producers for trusting that he, Elmaloglou and Kendall could carry such an important episode. He told Sarah Ellis from ''[[Inside Soap]]'' "Usually we get three or four scenes, so to have a whole episode to ourselves was good – even though there were a lot of lines to learn!"&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|date=12–18 September 2015|title=It's hard for me to justify what Brad has done|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=36|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kendall expressed her amazement that a three-hander had not been done before, but believed the love triangle was the perfect storyline to use the style. She felt excited about the script when she received it and branded the plot "really interesting".&lt;ref name="HairDown"/&gt; Kendall told Carena Crawford of ''[[All About Soap]]'' that it was a challenge to find the much needed depth and subtlety for the scenes.&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Carena|date=12–25 September 2015|title=Brad wants to be with Lauren!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|issue=357|page=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Episode 7202" was preceded by an online bonus scene called "Before Dawn", which featured Brad and Lauren discussing their feelings for each other after they had sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a666150/neighbours-spoilers-terese-brad-and-lauren-three-hander-teased-in-new-trailer.html#~pmYxkxdx3KzO4W|title=Neighbours spoilers: Terese, Brad and Lauren three-hander teased in new trailer|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=31 August 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamblin admitted that he was not surprised to learn Brad and Lauren would finally give into their feelings for one another.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt; He believed many fans of the show had wanted Brad and Lauren to get together from the moment the Turner and Willis families arrived in 2013.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; Ellis observed that it was "inevitable" that they would reunite at some point.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; Brad and Terese's marriage was tested multiple times, but things came to a head when Terese's alcoholism and Brad's lack of sensitivity to her feelings began affecting their children.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; After Brad and Lauren's one-night stand, Gamblin said Brad felt guilty, but he also wanted to be honest and tell Terese to "minimise the damage".&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; Elmaloglou thought the consequences of the episode would be felt for a long time afterwards, and that some "interesting dynamics" would also develop between the families.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt;

===Filming===
The episode was filmed in early June 2015.&lt;ref name="Backstage"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBhS4dkOrV0|people=Gamblin, Kip; Elmaloglou, Rebekah; Kendall, Kate|year=2015|title=Neighbours Backstage – Kip Gamblin (Brad Willis)|medium=Television production|publisher=[[Neighbours]] and [[YouTube]]|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamblin described the filming schedule as "pretty busy", while Elmaloglou called it "a real collaborative effort".&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt; For the scene in which Terese throws a jam jar at Brad, Elmaloglou was told to aim for Gamblin's head and he would get out of the way. Gamblin said that if he had failed to duck in time, she would have hit him across the face.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; The actors had two chances to get the take right as there were only two jam jars available for the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhwaM0DTZyo|people=Gamblin, Kip; Elmaloglou, Rebekah; Kendall, Kate|year=2015|title=Neighbours – Rebekah Elamloglou, Kip Gamblin &amp; Kate Kendall – Ep 7202 Reaction #4|medium=Television production|publisher=[[Neighbours]] and [[YouTube]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kendall told an ''[[Inside Soap]]'' columnist that the stunt where Terese pushes Lauren in the pool could only be shot once, as it would take too long to dry out their hair and clothes.&lt;ref name="HairDown"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 2015|title=I'd like to see Lauren let her hair down!|journal=[[Inside Soap|Inside Soap Yearbook 2016]]|issue=1|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained "so we knew what the money shot was, and worked everything else up towards that."&lt;ref name="HairDown"/&gt; Kendall and Elmaloglou were unable to hear Eames call out "cut", so they continued "really going at it" resulting in the final take.&lt;ref name="HairDown"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5114">'''European art cinema''' is a branch of [[Film|cinema]] that was popular in the 1960s.  It is based on a rejection of the tenets and techniques of [[classical Hollywood cinema]].

==History==
European art cinema gained popularity in the 1960s, with notable filmmakers such as [[Federico Fellini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], and [[Ingmar Bergman]]. At this time it was new to the even broader field of [[art film|art cinema]].

==Differences from classical==
The [[continuity editing]] system is not necessarily abandoned but instead is not ''needed''.  The cause and effect driven [[narrative]], as well as the goal-oriented protagonist&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, A. (1985). The Classic Narrative System. The Cinema Book, 212. London: British Film Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; are also not needed.  Instead, we may have the protagonist wander around aimlessly for the whole movie, with nothing of real importance happening to drive him from one activity to the other.

Classical Hollywood cinema has a narrative transitivity, in which there is "a sequence of events in which each unit follows the one preceding it according to a chain of causation; this chain is usually psychological".&lt;ref&gt;Wollen, P. (1982). Godard and Counter-Cinema: Vent d'est, 80.  Semiotic Counter-Strategies: Readings and Writings London: Verso&lt;/ref&gt;   The 'tale over teller' mantra of the classical Hollywood cinema is closely linked to the editing form that classical Hollywood cinema takes, and the rules they impose.  For example, the [[180 degree rule]] is followed since crossing the 180 degree line will cause a disturbance or a jarring effect on the viewer, thus calling attention away from story and to the teller.  Jump cuts are avoided, since they can cause an ellipsis of the spatial or temporal kind.  It is the job of classical Hollywood cinema to get the audience lost and absorbed into the story of the film, so that the film is pleasurable.  In contrast the task of European art cinema is to be ambiguous, utilizing an open-ended (and sometimes [[intertextual]]) plot, causing the audience to ask questions themselves whilst introducing an element of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Wollen, P. (1982). Godard and Counter-Cinema: Vent d'est, 85.  Semiotic Counter-Strategies: Readings and Writings London: Verso&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way they differ in terms of ‘realism’ is that Hollywood classical cinema has characters in full make up all the time, even when just coming out of bed; whereas European art cinema strives for a representation of the 'truth' and may not have characters in costume or make up.&lt;ref&gt;Wollen, P. (1982). Godard and Counter-Cinema: Vent d'est, 89.  Semiotic Counter-Strategies: Readings and Writings London: Verso&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gambling Commission''' is an [[Non-departmental public body|executive non-departmental public body]] of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] responsible for regulating gambling and supervising [[gaming law]] in Great Britain. Its remit covers [[video arcade|arcades]], [[betting]], [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]], [[casino]]s, [[slot machine]]s and [[lottery|lotteries]], as well as remote gambling, but not [[spread betting]]. 

The stated aims of the Commission are to keep crime out of gambling, and to protect the vulnerable. It issues licences to operators, and advises the government on gambling-related issues. It also collaborates with the police over suspected illegal gambling.
The Commission replaced the Gaming Board for Great Britain in 2007. In 2013 it assumed responsibility for regulating the National Lottery.

==History==
The Gambling Commission was established under the [[Gambling Act 2005]] and assumed full powers in 2007, taking over responsibility from the Gaming Board for Great Britain, in regulating [[video arcade|arcades]], [[betting]], [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]], [[casino]]s, [[slot machine]]s and [[lottery|lotteries]], but not [[spread betting]] (regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|act=Gambling Act 2005|chapter=19|type=act|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-proposes-stricter-rules-contract-difference-products|title=FCA proposes stricter rules for contract for difference products|date=6 December 2016|access-date=4 June 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Financial Conduct Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission is a [[non-departmental public body]], sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations|title=Departments, agencies and public bodies|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also responsible for the remote gambling which includes betting online, by telephone and other communication devices using the equipment, based on the territory of Great Britain.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

On 1 October 2013 the [[National Lottery Commission]], which regulated the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], became part of the Gambling Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about/About-us.aspx|title=About us|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK SI|title=The Public Bodies (Merger of the Gambling Commission and the National Lottery Commission) Order 2013|number=2329|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==

=== Aims and objectives ===
The Commission's stated aims are "to keep crime out of gambling, to ensure that gambling is conducted fairly and openly, and to protect children and vulnerable people". However, critics note its ADR process and default non-disclosure of complaints as often part of "standard procedure" contrasts directly with the validity of this claimed remit.&lt;ref name="what"&gt;[http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/UploadDocs/Contents/Documents/Whatitis.pdf The Gambling Commission: What it is and what it does] (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission released a new 2018/19 business plan with the goals of improving industry standards, consumer protections and to further public protection from gambling related harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gambling Commission Business Plan 2018-2019|url=http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/Business-plan-2018-2019.pdf |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UKGC Announces 2019 Plan to Improve Industry Standards|url=https://www.casinoreviews.co.uk/news/industry/ukgc-announces-2019-plan-improve-industry-standards.html |date=2 May 2018 |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Licensing ===
The Commission issues licences to gambling operators, can levy fines and revoke licences, and is tasked with investigating and prosecuting illegal gambling. It is also responsible for advising national and local government on gambling-related issues.&lt;ref name="what" /&gt;

==== Remote gambling ====
For remote gambling, the Commission issues licences to those operators whose remote gambling equipment is located in the territory of Great Britain. Whilst, those operators who wish to advertise their services in England, Wales, or Scotland, but are based outside the country, have to obtain a licence from the Gambling Commission following the passage of the [[Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014]]. The 2014 Act changed the licensing requirements so that any company wishing to advertise gambling and take bets from consumers in England, Wales, or Scotland must hold a licence issued by the Gambling Commission. Previously, an operator in one of the [[whitelisted gambling jurisdictions]] could advertise their services in Great Britain without requiring a separate license from the Commission.&lt;ref name="what" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightcasino.com/news/new-uk-gambling-law-explained/ "New UK gambling law explained: what's all the fuss about?"

===Monitoring and regulation===
The list of responsibilities of the Gambling Commission includes work to ensure that licensees act in accordance with the requirements imposed by the Gambling Act 2005 and other related regulations and standards. The Commission has the right to visit its licensees and examine their financial activities. As a result of this examination, specialists from the Gambling Commission can issue recommendations for amendments. Apart from such advice, supplementary licence conditions can be set or removed. In some cases, the Commission may take action to correct or avoid certain misconducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compliance|url=http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-gambling-businesses/for-gambling-businesses.aspx|publisher=Gambling Commission|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from reviewing the activities of the licensed operators, the Commission is authorised to take regulatory actions against those licensees who breach the rules in some way. The range of actions that may need to be taken varies from issuing a warning to inflicting a fine on those who violate licence conditions. In situations where additional investigation is required, the licence can be revoked.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The Intelligence department of the Gambling Commission collects information about the illegal activities related to their field and conducts preliminary investigation to build a picture of the situation and inform senior management.They also collaborate with other UK organisations and the police in cases where suspicious betting or gambling activities are detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keaveny|first=Paul|title=Wayne Rooney's father bailed in betting probe|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/wayne-rooneys-father-bailed-in-betting-probe-2366311.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=19 April 2014|author2=Mike Hornby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of operators and personal licence holders who have had a regulatory sanction imposed on them is published on the site of the Gambling Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about/Who-we-are-and-what-we-do/Who-we-are-and-what-we-do.aspx Gambling Commission: Regulatory Powers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Notable Actions ====

In February 2018, the Commission fined British bookmaker [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]] £6.2 million for not protecting players after a series of systematic failures to prevent [[money laundering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=William Hill fined £6.2m for failing to protect customers and prevent money laundering|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/william-hill-fine-protect-customers-money-laundering-bookmaker-gambling-commission-a8218891.html |publisher=independent.co.uk |date=20 February 2018 |accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2018, the Commission issued a £600,000 penalty to [[LeoVegas]] for producing misleading adverts to customers as well as several self-exclusion failings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/02/leovegas-fined-for-accepting-bets-from-problem-gamblers|title=LeoVegas fined for accepting bets from problem gamblers|last=Davies|first=Rob|date=2018-05-02|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the Commission fined [[32Red]] £2 million for failing a problem gambler who had deposited £758,000 with 32Red over more than two years. 32Red had failed to check the customer, who had a net income of £2,150 per month, could afford the bets despite several previous regulatory rulings in this area.&lt;ref name=guardian-20180620&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/online-casino-32red-fined-2m-for-failing-problem-gambler |title=Online casino 32Red fined £2m for failing problem gambler |last=Davies |first=Rob |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 June 2018 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The Gambling Commission has come under fire for not preventing the spread of [[Fixed odds betting terminal]]s on the high street. Their spread is linked to the transfer of responsibility for planning permission for bookmakers moving from the Gambling Commission to local authorities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 2014, the UK-regulated online bookmaker [[Canbet]] went into receivership, owing millions to customers. The demise of this site raised questions of the ability of the Commission to protect UK customers from rogue traders, although overall responsibility for UK online regulation was only given to the UKGC in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|act=Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014|type=act|year=2014|chapter=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, UK-regulated online bookmaker BetButler closed down, leaving a message on its website reading "The Board of BetButler Limited has been approached by a third party regulated gaming business to acquire the customer database, including all balances and pending withdrawal requests, of the business. This process will take some days to complete." Concerns were raised about pay out times and their financial state many months before this appeared. Again, the Gambling Commission have been criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2014/09/01/betbutler-com-stops-trading-ahead-of-potential-sale/|title=Distressed BetButler stops trading ahead of potential sale|date=1 September 2014|publisher=SBC News|access-date=4 June 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mathematics]] of [[gambling]] are a collection of [[probability]] applications encountered in games of chance and can be included in [[game theory]]. From a mathematical point of view, the games of chance are experiments generating various types of [[aleatory]] events, the probability of which can be calculated by using the properties of probability on a finite space of events.

==Experiments, events, probability spaces==
The technical processes of a game stand for experiments that generate [[aleatory]] events. Here are a few examples:
* Throwing the dice in [[craps]] is an experiment that generates events such as occurrences of certain numbers on the dice, obtaining a certain sum of the shown numbers, and obtaining numbers with certain properties (less than a specific number, higher than a specific number, even, uneven, and so on). The [[sample space]] of such an experiment is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for rolling one die or {(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), ..., (2, 6), ..., (6, 1), (6, 2), ..., (6, 6)} for rolling two dice. The latter is a set of ordered pairs and counts 6 x 6 = 36 elements. The events can be identified with sets, namely parts of the sample space. For example, the event ''occurrence of an even number'' is represented by the following set in the experiment of rolling one die: {2, 4, 6}.
* Spinning the [[roulette]] wheel is an experiment whose generated events could be the occurrence of a certain number, of a certain color or a certain property of the numbers (low, high, even, uneven, from a certain row or column, and so on). The sample space of the experiment involving spinning the roulette wheel is the set of numbers the roulette holds: {1, 2, 3, ..., 36, 0, 00} for the American roulette, or {1, 2, 3, ..., 36, 0} for the European. The event ''occurrence of a red number'' is represented by the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36}. These are the numbers inscribed in red on the roulette wheel and table.
* Dealing cards in [[blackjack]] is an experiment that generates events such as the occurrence of a certain card or value as the first card dealt, obtaining a certain total of points from the first two cards dealt, exceeding 21 points from the first three cards dealt, and so on. In card games we encounter many types of experiments and categories of events. Each type of experiment has its own sample space. For example, the experiment of dealing the first card to the first player has as its sample space the set of all 52 cards (or 104, if played with two decks). The experiment of dealing the second card to the first player has as its sample space the set of all 52 cards (or 104), less the first card dealt. The experiment of dealing the first two cards to the first player has as its sample space a set of ordered pairs, namely all the 2-size arrangements of cards from the 52 (or 104). In a game with one player, the event ''the player is dealt a card of 10 points as the first dealt card'' is represented by the set of cards {10♠, 10♣, 10♥, 10♦, J♠, J♣, J♥, J♦, Q♠, Q♣, Q♥, Q♦, K♠, K♣, K♥, K♦}. The event ''the player is dealt a total of five points from the first two dealt cards'' is represented by the set of 2-size combinations of card values {(A, 4), (2, 3)}, which in fact counts 4 x 4 + 4 x 4 = 32 combinations of cards (as value and symbol).
* In 6/49 [[lottery]], the experiment of drawing six numbers from the 49 generates events such as drawing six specific numbers, drawing five numbers from six specific numbers, drawing four numbers from six specific numbers, drawing at least one number from a certain group of numbers, etc. The sample space here is the set of all 6-size combinations of numbers from the 49.
* In [[draw poker]], the experiment of dealing the initial five card hands generates events such as dealing at least one certain card to a specific player, dealing a pair to at least two players, dealing four identical symbols to at least one player, and so on. The sample space in this case is the set of all 5-card combinations from the 52 (or the deck used).
* Dealing two cards to a player who has discarded two cards is another experiment whose sample space is now the set of all 2-card combinations from the 52, less the cards seen by the observer who solves the probability problem. For example, if you are in play in the above situation and want to figure out some odds regarding your hand, the sample space you should consider is the set of all 2-card combinations from the 52, less the three cards you hold and less the two cards you discarded. This sample space counts the 2-size combinations from 47.

==The probability model==
A probability model starts from an experiment and a mathematical structure attached to that experiment, namely the space (field) of events. The event is the main unit probability theory works on. In gambling, there are many categories of events, all of which can be textually predefined. In the previous examples of gambling experiments we saw some of the events that experiments generate. They are a minute part of all possible events, which in fact is the
set of all parts of the sample space.

For a specific game, the various types of events can be:
* Events related to your own play or to opponents’ play;
* Events related to one person’s play or to several persons’ play;
* Immediate events or long-shot events.

Each category can be further divided into several other subcategories, depending on the game referred to. These events can be literally defined, but it must be done very carefully when framing a probability problem. From a mathematical point of view, the events are nothing more than subsets and the space of events is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. Among these events, we find elementary and compound events, exclusive and nonexclusive events, and independent and non-independent events.

In the experiment of rolling a die:
* Event {3, 5} (whose literal definition is ''occurrence of 3 or 5'') is compound because {3, 5}= {3} U {5};
* Events {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6} are elementary;
* Events {3, 5} and {4} are incompatible or'' ''exclusive because their intersection is empty; that is, they cannot occur simultaneously;
* Events {1, 2, 5} and {2, 5} are nonexclusive, because their intersection is not empty;
* In the experiment of rolling two dice one after another, the events ''obtaining 3 on the first die'' and ''obtaining 5 on the second die'' are independent because the occurrence of the second event is not influenced by the occurrence of the first, and vice versa.

In the experiment of dealing the pocket cards in Texas Hold’em Poker:
* The event of dealing (3♣, 3♦) to a player is an elementary event;
* The event of dealing two 3’s to a player is compound because is the union of events (3♣, 3♠), (3♣, 3♥), (3♣, 3♦), (3♠, 3♥), (3♠, 3♦) and (3♥, 3♦);
* The events ''player 1 is dealt a pair of kings'' and ''player 2 is dealt a pair of kings'' are nonexclusive (they can both occur);
* The events ''player 1 is dealt two connectors of hearts higher than J'' and ''player 2 is dealt two connectors of hearts higher than J'' are exclusive (only one can occur);
* The events ''player 1 is dealt (7, K)'' and ''player 2 is dealt (4, Q)'' are non-independent (the occurrence of the second depends on the occurrence of the first, while the same deck is in use).
These are a few examples of gambling events, whose properties of compoundness, exclusiveness and independency are easily observable. These
properties are very important in practical probability calculus.

The complete [[mathematical model]] is given by the probability field attached to the experiment, which is the triple ''sample space—field of events—probability function''. For any game of chance, the probability model is of the simplest type—the sample space is finite, the space of events is the set of parts of the sample space, implicitly finite, too, and the probability function is given by the definition of [[probability]] on a finite space of events:

==Combinations==
Games of chance are also good examples of [[combinations]], [[permutations]] and arrangements, which are met at every step: combinations of cards in a player’s hand, on the table or expected in any card game; combinations of numbers when rolling several dice once; combinations of numbers in lottery and bingo; combinations of symbols in slots; permutations and arrangements in a race to be bet on, and the like. Combinatorial calculus is an important part of gambling probability applications. In games of chance, most of the gambling probability calculus in which we use the classical definition of probability reverts to counting combinations. The gaming events can be identified with sets, which often are sets of combinations. Thus, we can identify an event with a combination.

For example, in a five draw poker game, the event ''at least one player holds a four of a kind formation'' can be identified with the set of all combinations of (xxxxy) type, where ''x'' and ''y'' are distinct values of cards. This set has 13C(4,4)(52-4)=624 combinations. Possible combinations are (3♠ 3♣ 3♥ 3♦ J♣) or (7♠ 7♣ 7♥ 7♦ 2♣). These can be identified with elementary events that the event to be measured consists of.

==Expectation and strategy==
Games of chance are not merely pure applications of probability calculus and gaming situations are not just isolated events whose numerical probability is well established through mathematical methods; they are also games whose progress is influenced by human action. In gambling, the human element has a striking character. The player is not only interested in the mathematical probability of the various gaming events, but he or she has expectations from the games while a major interaction exists. To obtain favorable results from this interaction, gamblers take into account all possible information, including [[statistics]], to build gaming strategies. The predicted [[average]] gain or loss is called ''[[expected value|expectation]]'' or [[expected value]] and is the sum of the probability of each possible outcome of the experiment multiplied by its payoff (value). Thus, it represents the average amount one expects to win per bet if bets with identical odds are repeated many times. A game or situation in which the expected value for the player is zero (no net gain nor loss) is called a ''fair game. ''The attribute ''fair ''refers not to the technical process of the game, but to the chance balance house (bank)–player.

Even though the randomness inherent in games of chance would seem to ensure their fairness (at least with respect to the players around a table—shuffling a deck or spinning a wheel do not favor any player except if they are fraudulent), gamblers always search and wait for irregularities in this randomness that will allow them to win. It has been mathematically proved that, in ideal conditions of randomness, and with negative expectation, no long-run regular winning is possible for players of games of chance. Most gamblers accept this premise, but still work on strategies to make them win either in the short term or over the long run.

==House advantage or edge==
Casino games provide a predictable long-term advantage to the casino, or "house", while offering the player the possibility of a large short-term payout. Some casino games have a skill element, where the player makes decisions; such games are called "random with a tactical element." While it is possible through skilful play to minimize the house advantage, it is extremely rare that a player has sufficient skill to completely eliminate his inherent long-term disadvantage (the '''house edge''' or '''house vigorish''') in a casino game. Common belief is that such a skill set would involve years of training, an extraordinary memory and numeracy, and/or acute visual or even aural observation, as in the case of [[Eudaemons|wheel clocking]] in Roulette. For more examples see [[Advantage gambling]].

The player's disadvantage is a result of the casino not paying winning wagers according to the game's "true odds", which are the payouts that would be expected considering the odds of a wager either winning or losing. For example, if a game is played by wagering on the number that would result from the roll of one die, true odds would be 5 times the amount wagered since there is a 1/6 probability of any single number appearing. However, the casino may only pay 4 times the amount wagered for a winning wager.

The house edge (HE) or [[vigorish]] is defined as the casino profit expressed as a percentage of the player's original bet. In games such as [[Blackjack]] or [[Spanish 21]], the final bet may be several times the original bet, if the player doubles or splits.

Example: In American [[Roulette]], there are two zeroes and 36 non-zero numbers (18 red and 18 black). If a player bets $1 on red, his chance of winning $1 is therefore 18/38 and his chance of losing $1 (or winning -$1) is 20/38.

The player's expected value, EV = (18/38 x 1) + (20/38 x -1) = 18/38 - 20/38 = -2/38 = -5.26%. Therefore, the house edge is 5.26%. After 10 rounds, play $1 per round, the average house profit will be 10 x $1 x 5.26% = $0.53.
Of course, it is not possible for the casino to win exactly 53 cents; this figure is the average casino profit from each player if it had millions of players each betting 10 rounds at $1 per round.

The house edge of casino games vary greatly with the game. Keno can have house edges up to 25%, slot machines can have up to 15%, while most [[Pontoon (game)|Australian Pontoon]] games have house edges between 0.3% and 0.4%.

The calculation of the Roulette house edge was a trivial exercise; for other games, this is not usually the case. Combinatorial analysis and/or computer simulation is necessary to complete the task.

In games which have a skill element, such as Blackjack or [[Spanish 21]], the house edge is defined as the house advantage from optimal play (without the use of advanced techniques such as [[card counting]] or [[shuffle tracking]]), on the first hand of the shoe (the container that holds the cards). The set of the optimal plays for all possible hands is known as "basic strategy" and is highly dependent on the specific rules, and even the number of decks used. Good Blackjack and Spanish 21 games have house edges below 0.5%.

Online slot games often have a published Return to Player (RTP) percentage that determines the theoretical house edge. Some software developers choose to publish the RTP of their slot games while others do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gamblersfever.net/online-slots-return-to-player-rtp-explained/ |title=Online slots Return to Player (RTP) explained - GamblersFever }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the set theoretical RTP, almost any outcome is possible in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://getgamblingfacts.ca/how-gambling-really-works/return-to-player-rtp-and-hit-frequency-what-do-these-mean/ |title=Return to Player and Hit frequency - What do these mean? - GetGamblingFacts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard deviation==

The luck factor in a casino game is quantified using [[standard deviation]] (SD). The standard deviation of a simple game like Roulette can be simply calculated because of the [[binomial distribution]] of successes (assuming a result of 1 unit for a win, and 0 units for a loss). For the binomial distribution, SD is equal to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{npq}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of rounds played, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of winning, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of losing. Furthermore, if we flat bet at 10 units per round instead of 1 unit, the range of possible outcomes increases 10 fold. Therefore, SD for Roulette even-money bet is equal to &lt;math&gt;2b\sqrt{npq}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the flat bet per round, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of rounds, &lt;math&gt;p=18/38&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q=20/38&lt;/math&gt;.

After enough large number of rounds the theoretical distribution of the total win converges to the [[normal distribution]], giving a good possibility to forecast the possible win or loss. For example, after 100 rounds at $1 per round, the standard deviation of the win (equally of the loss) will be &lt;math&gt;2\cdot\$1\cdot\sqrt{100\cdot18/38\cdot20/38}\approx\$9.99&lt;/math&gt;. After 100 rounds, the expected loss will be &lt;math&gt;100\cdot\$1\cdot2/38\approx\$5.26&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Three sigma rule|3 sigma]] range is six times the standard deviation: three above the mean, and three below. Therefore, after 100 rounds betting $1 per round, the result will very probably be somewhere between &lt;math&gt;-\$5.26-3\cdot\$9.99&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\$5.26+3\cdot\$9.99&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., between -$34 and $24. There is still a ca. 1 to 400 chance that the result will be not in this range, i.e. either the win will exceed $24, or the loss will exceed $34.

The standard deviation for the even-money Roulette bet is one of the lowest out of all casinos games. Most games, particularly slots, have extremely high standard deviations. As the size of the potential payouts increase, so does the standard deviation.

Unfortunately, the above considerations for small numbers of rounds are incorrect, because the distribution is far from normal. Moreover, the results of more volatile games usually converge to the normal distribution much more slowly, therefore much more huge number of rounds are required for that.

As the number of rounds increases, eventually, the expected loss will exceed the standard deviation, many times over. From the formula, we can see the standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the number of rounds played, while the expected loss is proportional to the number of rounds played. As the number of rounds increases, the expected loss increases at a much faster rate. This is why it is practically impossible for a gambler to win in the long term (if they don't have an edge). It is the high ratio of short-term standard deviation to expected loss that fools gamblers into thinking that they can win.

The volatility index (VI) is defined as the standard deviation for one round, betting one unit. Therefore, the VI for the even-money American Roulette bet is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{18/38\cdot20/38}\approx0.499&lt;/math&gt;.

The variance &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the square of the VI. Therefore, the variance of the even-money American Roulette bet is ca. 0.249, which is extremely low for a casino game. The variance for Blackjack is ca. 1.2, which is still low compared to the variances of [[slot machine|electronic gaming machines]] (EGMs).

Additionally, the term of the volatility index based on some confidence intervals are used. Usually, it is based on the 90% confidence interval. The volatility index for the 90% confidence interval is ca. 1.645 times as the "usual" volatility index that relates to the ca. 68.27% confidence interval.

It is important for a casino to know both the house edge and volatility index for all of their games. The house edge tells them what kind of profit they will make as percentage of turnover, and the volatility index tells them how much they need in the way of cash reserves. The mathematicians and computer programmers that do this kind of work are called gaming mathematicians and gaming analysts. Casinos do not have in-house expertise in this field, so they outsource their requirements to experts in the gaming analysis field.

'''GotFrag''' was a website, founded in 2002, that covered daily events and news about [[e-Sports]] and professional video gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ho, Marcus|date=January 2008|title=Enter the dragon; professional gaming in China|journal=GameAxis Unwired|issue=52|pages=34|issn=0219-872X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Post]]'' writer Michael Kane called GotFrag "the best source of gaming [information] for the hard-core community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kane, Michael|year=2008|title=Game Boys: Professional Videogaming's Rise from the Basement to the Big Time|publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=0-670-01896-1|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site provided gamers with a place to find information and current events about their favorite eSports teams and players. In 2007, GotFrag became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Major League Gaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McCarthy, Caroline|date=2007-06-05|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9726395-7.html|title=Major League Gaming acquires GotFrag|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

When launched in 2002, GotFrag primarily provided coverage of professional ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' gaming. However, after the acquisition of other sites, GotFrag's coverage was expanded. In 2004, GotFrag released the second version of their website. Along with the launch of version 2, GotFrag announced their GotFrag Prime service. Prime provided paying viewers additional content, features, and benefits. In December 2004, GotFrag introduced GameSense, the first ever statistical database of professional players, providing an overview of professional gamers around the world with statistics and game records. In September 2006, Gotfrag introduced its "GotComms" service which caters to [[Ventrilo]] and [[Teamspeak]] server rental.

On June 6, 2007, [[Major League Gaming]] acquired Gotfrag for an undisclosed sum. GotFrag, which had historically focused on PC games, said it would remain committed to covering the platform as well as increasing coverage of console eSports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2007-06-06|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14219|title=MLG Acquires GotFrag, Adds Bromberg As CEO|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, after a long period of relative inactivity, the URL to GotFrag began redirecting users to the [[ESEA League]] website. This has increased speculation that Gotfrag has officially been shut down.

As of November 20, 2015, the GotFrag domain simply redirects to lpkane.com, one of the former owners of ESEA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6453">The '''Gothic film''' is a film that is based on [[Gothic fiction]] or contains Gothic elements. Since various definite [[film genre]]s—including science fiction, film noir, thriller, and comedy—have used Gothic elements, the Gothic film is challenging to define clearly as a genre. Gothic elements have also infused the horror film genre, contributing supernatural and nightmarish elements. To create a Gothic atmosphere, filmmakers have sought to create new camera tricks that challenge audiences' perceptions.&lt;ref name="kaye239"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaye|2015|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gothic films also reflected contemporary issues. ''A New Companion to The Gothic''{{'}}s Heidi Kaye said "strong visuals, a focus on sexuality and an emphasis on audience response" characterize Gothic films like they did the literary works.&lt;ref name="kaye240"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaye|2015|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of the Gothic'' said the foundation of Gothic film was the combination of Gothic literature, stage melodrama, and [[German expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2015|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Cambridge Companion to Gothic Fiction'', Misha Kavka says Gothic film is not an established genre, rather contributing Gothic images, plots, characters, and styles to films. These elements are often found in "the broader category of ''horror''". Kavka quotes William Patrick Day's definition of the Gothic, "[it] tantalizes us with fear, both as its subject and its effect; its does so, however, not primarily through characters or plots or even language, but through ''spectacle''". Cinema suits the Gothic definition in creating images that establish the spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kavka|2002|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Gothic films were part of early cinema, adapting Gothic fiction on screen like stage melodramas had previously done. Gothic works that strongly influenced cinema were those from the 19th century: ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]], ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], and ''[[Dracula]]'' by [[Bram Stoker]].&lt;ref name="kaye239" /&gt; Like most early cinema, many silent Gothic films were lost or very short.&lt;ref name="kaye240" /&gt; In the aftermath of [[World War I]], the horrors of war pervaded Gothic films. [[Robert Wiene]]'s ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920), though not based on a Gothic text, exhibited [[German Expressionism]] that Heidi Kaye said "transformed the American approach to Gothic cinema".&lt;ref name="kaye241"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaye|2015|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of the Gothic'' said ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' became a "milestone in Gothic film".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2015|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''New Directions in 21st-Century Gothic: The Gothic Compass'', scholars consider the Gothic films ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931) by [[James Whale]], ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931) by [[Tod Browning]], and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1931) by [[Rouben Mamoulian]] "a foundational triptych, from which they in turn look back to earlier Gothic films and forward to later ones".&lt;ref name="piatti42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rall|2015|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the first modern Gothic film is considered to be ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2015|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable films==

When the [[British Film Institute]] in 2013 launched a program celebrating films and TV shows with Gothic themes, ''[[The Guardian]]'' identified the following as the ten best Gothic films (ordered by year):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Kermode | first=Mark | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/oct/25/10-best-gothic-films-mark-kermode | title=The 10 best gothic films | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=October 25, 2013 | accessdate=October 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ice Follies''', formerly known as the Shipstads &amp; Johnson Ice Follies, was a touring ice show featuring elaborate production numbers, similar in concept to [[Ice Capades]].  It was founded in 1936 by Eddie Shipstad, Roy Shipstad, and Oscar Johnson, who also skated in the show.&lt;ref name=abt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider Farris|first1=Jo Ann|title=Shipstads and Johnson Ice Follies| url= https://www.thoughtco.com/shipstads-and-johnson-ice-follies-1282982|website=[[Dotdash|ThoughtCo.com]]|publisher=[[IAC (company)|IAC]]|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, [[Winter Olympic Games|Olympic]] skaters such as [[Donald Jackson]], [[Barbara Berezowski]], [[Peggy Fleming]], and [[Janet Lynn]] were in the cast.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Ice Follies also featured novelty acts such as [[Frick and Frack]]&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; and Richard Dwyer, who was billed as "Mr. Debonair".&lt;ref name=abt0&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider Farris|first1=Jo Ann|title=Richard Dwyer - "Mr. Debonair" Ice Skating Show Star and Figure Skating Legend |url= http://figureskating.about.com/od/skatingstarsofthepast/p/dwyer.htm|website=About.com |publisher=IAC |accessdate=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production company is now called Ice Follies and Holiday on Ice, Inc., a subsidiary of [[Feld Entertainment]] which produces the shows under the [[Disney on Ice]] and "... on Ice" titles. Feld formed the new subsidiary from the Ice Follies and U.S. [[Holiday on Ice]] touring companies.

The show was a variety show that included a chorus line called The Ice Folliettes, which led to [[Synchronized skating|synchronized figure skating]], that famously precisely performed a kick line and pinwheel on ice.&lt;ref name=abt/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Roy Shipstad, Oscar Johnson, and Eddie Shipstad.jpg|thumb|upright|Ice Follies founders Roy Shipstad, Oscar Johnson, and Eddie Shipstad]]

In 1946, Ice Follies began co-producing Ice Cycles with [[Ice Capades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirschner|first1=Betty Jean|title=Thrills, Laughs, Flashing Blades Put Ice Cycles' on Must-See List|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=DIL19460109.2.4|accessdate=September 6, 2016|work=Daily Illini|date=January 9, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Ice Follies left the Ice Cycles show, leaving it under Ice Capades' ownership.&lt;ref name=pshf/&gt; In 1950, Roy Shipstad retired from performing and recruited Richard Dwyer to take over his role of "Debonair" as the "Young Debonair". By 1966, "Young" was dropped from the role title that later became "Mr. Debonair".&lt;ref name=abt0/&gt; Frack became ill in 1954 ending the duo,&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; but Frick continued at Ice Follies with other partners.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hevesi|first1=Dennis|title=Werner Groebli, Ice Skating’s Frick, Dies at 92|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/arts/dance/23groebli.html|accessdate=November 23, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ildebrando Zacchini''' (1868 - July 17, 1948, [[Tampa, Florida]]) was a [[Malta|Maltese]]-born [[painter]], [[inventor]], and [[travelling circus]] owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/article1089283.ece?nsm=true|title=Rene Zacchini left circus to serve in Florida House...|date=April 22, 2010|publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Inspired by the works of [[Jules Verne]], Zacchini came up with an idea for a [[human cannonball]] act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HxoMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TV0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6030,5671666&amp;dq=ildebrando-zacchini&amp;hl=en|title=Zacchini Cannon Enters Museum |date=March 31, 1976|publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of explosives, Zacchini's human-firing cannon used compressed air, and he first tested it on his son [[Hugo Zacchini]]. 

The idea for the cannonball act was initially proposed to the Italian government as a military maneuver to be used in conjunction with [[parachute]]s; when the proposal was rejected Zacchini looked to use the technique as part of an entertainment act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QPccAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p3sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5725,287006&amp;dq=ildebrando-zacchini&amp;hl=en|title='Trigger man' behind human cannonball dies|date=January 11, 1993|publisher=''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]''|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Zacchini family were later inducted into the [[Ringling Brothers]] Circus Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8251137|title=Ildebrando Zacchini| publisher= Find A Grave|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''J. R. R. Tolkien's Riders of Rohan''''' is a computer video game from 1991 based upon the fictional [[War of the Ring]] set in the [[Middle-earth]] world created by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], centered in the [[Lord of the Rings]] novels. The massive-scale simulation takes part in the realm of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] and the player controls the forces of Good during the onslaught of the forces of Evil, namely centered on the conflict with [[Saruman]] of [[Isengard]]. It was published by [[Konami]] and [[Mirrorsoft]].

==Gameplay==
In terms of gameplay, it is very similar to the 1988 ''[[War in Middle Earth (1988 computer game)|War in Middle Earth]]'', except the setting was downsized from the entire world just to the land of the Rohirrim, engulfing mostly the storyline from ''[[The Two Towers]]'', and to a small extent ending in ''[[The Return of the King]]''. In a combination of a single-unit adventure, small-scale battlefield tactics and broadscale campaign warfare, the player must coordinate the Fellowship and Rohan's troops in order to fend of the invasion of Saruman's [[Orcs]] and save the Rohirrim lands, as well as mounting enough forces to push the war on the fronts in the east in order to contribute to [[Sauron]]'s defeat.

At the beginning, the player can in the starting menu choose to start a new game, load an old one, quit, access encyclopedias dealing with featured units and characters, or practice. The practice folds down to tutorials in single-fighter combat:
- Archery: the player takes control of [[Legolas]] attempting to shoot down (18) Orcs from a wall, while crouching from their spears
- Duel: the player chooses between four Heroes: [[Aragorn]], Legolas, Gimli and Eomer, to fight either an Orc or a Dunlending in melee combat
- Magic Duel: the player takes control over [[Gandalf]] fighting a Nazgul flying mounted on a Felbeast

The game begins just before the Battles at the [[Fords of Isen]], with the player taking control over Rohan's western armies (an army consisted of an infantry unit [Westfold Militia], a light cavalry unit [Outriders], a horse archers unit [Harrowdale Bow] and three heave cavalry units [Helms Deep Guards and Edoras Guards, the Grimslade squadron being under Theodred's personal leadership]). The main army is led by Theodred, while there is a separate unit of heavy cavalry [Harrowdale] that is still behind on the road. The game ends when Sauron is destroyed after the Battle at the Black Gates and Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom.

===Units===
The player can control only the good side in the conflict.
* Rohirrim Infantry - the poor, the young and the old gathered together, versatile all-round melee fighters eager to patriotically defend their homeland (squad size: 600)
* Rohirrim Archers - Rohan ground units which have mastered the proficiency with the bow (squad size: 150)
* Rohirrim Light Cavalry - fastest in the world, ideal scouts; useful for rapid skirmishes (squad size: 450)
* Rohirrim Heavy Cavalry - renown horsemen, among the hardest fighters in the world; useful for routing enemies with their lances (squad size: 450)
* Rohirrim Horse Archers - highly skilled, mounted ranged units; can also fire while moving but with reduced accuracy (squad size: 150)
* Ents - tree-like beings from [[Fangorn]] forest as they are, they are fiercely powerful warriors little can stand against, should they ever decide to join the conflict and not neutrally stand by idle.
* Orcs - all-around melee units, but generally weak and flee when outnumbered; vulnerable when exposed to direct sunlight
* Orcish archers - coward Orc fighters that have mastered the proficiency with the bow
* Uruk-hai - elite Saruman's warriors, hybrid orcs; travel across sunlight without problem; fierce fighters that can stand ground against most
* War Riders - Orcs mounted on the backs of large wolves ([[warg]]s); very savage and fierce, except when their attack is broken; their mounts are hungry and independent on their own, very weakly trained
* Dunlendings - savage, lightly-armed tribesmen from the countryside with an innate hatred for the Rohirrim, will blindly fight to the death

== Characters ==
The game features a number of characters, only conditionally "heroes": 
* Aragorn - (Fellowship) the mightiest mortal in the world, a brilliant personal fighter; master strategic leader
* Gimli - (Fellowship) masterful hand-to-hand combat fighter
* Legolas (Fellowship) - Elven prince; best archer in the world, very quick but lightly armed
* Gandalf (Fellowship) - a Wizard (Maia) sent by the Valar to aid the Free Peoples against the Dark Lord, the most powerful hero; avoids combat and councils others, best fighter amongst the Good forces with unmatched powers, invincible through conventional means (can wipe out nearly anything)
* Merry (Fellowship) - non-combatant; stealthy
* Pippin (Fellowship) - non-combatant; stealthy
* Treebeard (Ents) - leader of the Ents, among the oldest creatures; concerned for the living, especially his native Forest
* Eomer (Rohan) - King's nephew and Third Marshall of the Riddermark; excellent leader as second only to the King; very good sword fighter
* Erkenbrand (Rohan) - Leader of Westfold and commander of Helm's Deep; an exceptional warrior and is bent on maintaining the defenses at the Hornburg
* Hama (Rohan) - King's Doorward and Captain of His Guard; a very good fighter as boundlessly loyal
* Theoden (Rohan) - The King. The best military commander in the world, still a potent fighter, but very old and physically weakened
* Theodred (Rohan) - Prince, Second Marshal of the Riddermark. Identical to Eomer (personal combat), but a weaker commander
* Eowyn (Rohan) - Eomer's sister, inspires the people as a shield maiden; non-combatant
* Grima (Rohan/Isengard) - The King's councilor, convinced Saruman is an ally, in reality a spy and saboteur
* Saruman (Isengard) - the chief antagonist; powerful as Gandalf, unengaged leader of the evil forces; wants to anihialate the Rohirrim and get the One Ring for himself, building an Army of dark forces for that task

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called the game's graphics "simple, yet pleasing", but described it as "a lightweight strategy game that includes several action sequences and some very limited character interaction". The magazine stated that those who had not read Tolkien's books would likely not understand the game's backstory, and that strategy players would dislike how closely they needed to follow the original story's actions to succeed in the game. ''Computer Gaming World'' only recommended it to devoted Tolkien fans.{{r|greenberg199202}}

'''Sister list:''' [[List of vaudeville performers: A–K]]

This is a partial '''list of vaudeville performers'''. Those on this list appeared at least once on the American [[vaudeville]] stage during its heyday between 1881 and 1932. The source in the citation included with each entry confirms their appearance and cites information in the performance notes section.

'''Vaudeville''' is a style of [[variety show|variety entertainment]] predominant in North America and Australasia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A similar development in Britain was known as [[Music Hall]]. Developing from many sources, including shows in [[bar (establishment)|saloons]], [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]], [[freak show]]s, [[dime museum]]s, British [[pantomime]]s, and other popular forms of entertainment, vaudeville became one of the most popular types of entertainment in America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Vaudeville took the form of a series of separate, usually unrelated acts each featuring a different types of performance. These performances could ranges from musicians (both classical and popular), dancers, [[comedian]]s, animal acts, [[Magician (illusion)|magician]]s, [[female impersonator|female]] and [[drag king|male impersonator]]s, to [[acrobatics|acrobat]]s, [[one-act play]]s or scenes from plays, [[Sportsperson|athlete]]s lecturing [[celebrities]], minstrels, or even short films.

While the initial origins of vaudeville are obscure, historians acknowledge that the opening of [[Tony Pastor]]'s Fourteenth Street Theatre in New York City on October 24, 1881, marks the beginning of American vaudeville. Pastor had refined the rough variety acts into something wholesome enough for women and children. Other theatre owners quickly picked up on Pastor's new style of vaudeville and theatres began springing up like weeds and would continue in a quick pace until the 1920s. In Australasia vaudeville companies such as  Fuller's became household names, eventually operating in several Australian and New Zealand cities at once.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2f29/fuller-john&lt;/ref&gt; Vaudeville reached its height around 1915. These heights included an industrialization of the business of vaudeville. Following this climax, vaudeville began to struggle with competition from film and in the following decade, radio. These mediums competed not only for audiences, but talent as well. Towards the end of the 1920s, vaudeville theatres began to be converted to [[cinemas]] or closed altogether with entire circuits. After the blow dealt the world by the economic downturn of the [[Great Depression]], vaudeville's pulse quickly weakened. Just as historians mark the date of the "birth" of vaude, the date of its death is marked as well. New York's [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], was the palace of vaudeville; a place where only the greatest of vaude's performers performed. On November 16, 1932, the last vaudeville bill was played there and the Palace became a full-time movie house. Vaudeville did continue to struggle on, but it never again reached the heights attained in 1915.&lt;ref name="Laurie-335-481-488"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laurie|1953|pp=335, 481, 488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Long Distance Walkers Association''' ('''LDWA''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] association whose aim is "to further the common interests of those who enjoy Long Distance Walking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldwa.org.uk/library/association/association.php|title=Memorandum and Articles of Association|work=Long Distance Walkers Association|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was established in 1972 by Chris Steer, Alan and Barbara Blatchford and has over 7,000 members.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldwa.org.uk/history.php|title=LDWA History|work=Long Distance Walkers Association|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It defines a "long distance walk" as "any walk over 20 miles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldwa.org.uk/faqs.php#WhatMakes|title=FAQ: What makes a walk long-distance|work=Long Distance Walkers Association|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Farnham walk Dec 09.JPG|thumb|left|A walk around Farnham]]
The association has 43 local groups which organise walks for their members, and publishes a journal ''Strider'' three times a year. Walks fall into two categories. Group walks (also referred to as social walks) are normally led walks of around 20 miles in length. Challenge events&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/6590209.stm Walkers prepare for 24-hour trek]&lt;/ref&gt; are normally between 20 and 100 miles, are self led (i.e. participants navigate the route based on written instructions) and must generally be completed within a defined time limit. Challenge walks are marshalled i.e. participants must call in at clipper points or checkpoints to get a tally card punched to show they are following the route. Information about group walks, challenge events (including ones arranged by other organisations who agree to the association's conditions for challenge walks) and other information of interest to walkers such as a database of [[long distance path]]s in the UK can be found via the association's web site.

The Association, along with the [[Ramblers Association]], is recognised by [[Sport England]] as the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for "Rambling" in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/recognised_sports.aspx |title=Which sports do we recognise? |work=Sport England |accessdate=30 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520041023/http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/recognised_sports.aspx |archivedate=20 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mass Effect''''' is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[BioWare]] and published by [[Microsoft Game Studios]] and [[Electronic Arts]]. Originally released for the [[Xbox 360]] video game console in 2007, it is the first game of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series. The game takes place within the [[Milky Way]] galaxy in the year 2183, where civilization is threatened by a highly advanced machine race known as the Reapers. The player assumes the role of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who must stop a rogue agent from carrying out the Reapers' galactic invasion. The gameplay requires the player to complete multiple [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]] that generally involve space exploration, squad and vehicular combat, and interaction with [[non-player character]]s.

Planned as the first chapter of a trilogy from the very beginning, ''Mass Effect'' was developed over the course of three and a half years and uses the [[Unreal Engine 3]] as a groundwork. It was designed so that the player would assume the role of a central character that could make important decisions and impact the story of the game in numerous ways. The combat was designed to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games|real-time]] [[third-person shooter]] interface. In 2008 and 2009, two [[downloadable content]] packs that introduced new missions to the base game were released.

''Mass Effect'' received critical acclaim from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]] and sold more than one and a half million copies by January 2008. Critics praised the game's [[interactive storytelling]] and cinematic design, but criticized its unbalanced combat mechanics and poor [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]]. The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the 2007 [[Spike Video Game Awards]] and Roleplaying Game of the Year at the 2008 [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences|Interactive Achievement Awards]]. ''Mass Effect'' was [[porting|ported]] to the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[PlayStation 3]] platforms in 2008 and 2012, respectively. A sequel, ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', was released in 2010.

==Gameplay==
''Mass Effect'' is a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] [[action role-playing game]] in which the player takes the role of [[Commander Shepard]] from a [[Virtual camera system|third-person perspective]].&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat-training and first name are determined by the player before the game begins.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide New Career"/&gt; There are six different [[character class]]es for the player to choose from and each of them have different talents that provide enhanced combat capabilities.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Talents"/&gt; For example, the Soldier class is trained in weapon damage and has improved health, while the Sentinel class is trained in protecting and healing allies.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Talents"/&gt; At one point in the game, players may evolve their base class talent into one of two specializations, which depend on the class chosen by the player.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Talents"/&gt; Although any class can use any weapon type, each class is only effective with the weapons they are trained in.&lt;ref name="Manual Combat"/&gt;

The game's [[overworld]] is a galaxy map that the player can explore to find and complete [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]]. Most of the quests that progress the story consist of combat missions, while optional quests generally involve the player gathering items or interacting with [[non-player character]]s. As the player progresses throughout the game, six squad members become available, each with their own talents that can be developed.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; [[Experience point]]s are gained in multiple ways, such as completing quests, defeating enemies, or finding and collecting items around the environment.&lt;ref name="Manual Playing"/&gt; Each time a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the player "levels up" and is awarded a number of Talent Points that can be used to develop talents for both Shepard and the members of the squad.&lt;ref name="Manual Playing"/&gt; Each talent has 12 ranks that can be unlocked, with each rank costing one Talent Point.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Talents"/&gt;

The player's primary mode of transportation is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Transportation"/&gt; Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, buy new equipment, and travel to numerous [[planetary system]]s. Although the game features a large number of planets for the player to examine, only a few of them can actually be landed on and explored.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Some of them can also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Transportation"/&gt; Upon landing on a planet, the player can traverse on foot or by using an all-terrain infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Transportation"/&gt; Equipment items, which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.&lt;ref name="Manual Equipment"/&gt;

===Combat===
[[File:Mass Effect Combat.png|250px|thumb|left|In combat, the player can pause the action to display the squad's [[user interface]] and calmly select different powers for the squad members to use. The squad's [[Health (gaming)|health bars]] and shields are displayed at the bottom left corner of the screen.]]

Combat in ''Mass Effect'' is squad-based and two squad members accompany the player on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Command"/&gt; The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Battles take place in [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games|real-time]], but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different talent abilities for the squad members to use.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; The game uses an [[Over the shoulder shot|over the shoulder perspective]] akin to a [[third-person shooter]], and features a [[cover system]] which allows players to strategically hide behind objects while fighting enemy forces.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; The player may also issue orders to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind an object, scout ahead, regroup, or focus their fire on a designed target.&lt;ref name="Manual Combat"/&gt;

Weapons range from [[pistol]]s to [[shotgun]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, and [[sniper rifle]]s.&lt;ref name="Manual Combat"/&gt; Although all of them have unlimited ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Command"/&gt; In addition, the player can use [[grenade]]s which latch onto targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated.&lt;ref name="Manual Combat"/&gt; Shepard and the squad members are protected by a [[Health (gaming)|health bar]] and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental [[hazard]]s like [[heat]] or [[Toxicity|toxic]] agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Transportation"/&gt; The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Talents"/&gt; The player can revive fallen squad members with the use of the Unity talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Talents"/&gt;

===Dialogue and morality===
During conversations with characters, ''Mass Effect'' employs a [[Pie menu|radial command menu]], called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's [[Interactive storytelling|dialogue options]] depend on wheel direction.&lt;ref name="Manual Playing"/&gt; The left side of the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile.&lt;ref name="Manual Playing"/&gt; Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. Morality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points allow the player to develop talents that affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.&lt;ref name="Prima Guide Morality"/&gt;

===Setting and characters===

[[File:Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale at EXP Con 2011.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Mark Meer]] (left) and [[Jennifer Hale]] (right) provided the voices for the male and female protagonist of the game, Commander Shepard.]]

''Mass Effect'' is set within the [[Milky Way]] galaxy in the year 2183 where [[interstellar travel]] is possible through the use of mass transit devices called Mass Relays, a technology believed to have been built by an extinct alien race known as the Protheans.&lt;ref name="Mass Relays"/&gt; The term "Mass Effect" is defined as a form of [[mass]]-negating technology, allowing the creation of physics phenomena, like [[artificial gravity]] or [[faster-than-light|FTL]] travel.&lt;ref name="Mass Effect Fields"/&gt; A conglomerate body of governments known as the Citadel Council controls a large percentage of the galaxy and is responsible for maintaining law and order among races of the galactic community.&lt;ref name="Citadel Council"/&gt; Races that belong to the Citadel Council include humans, asari, salarians, and turians. Other alien races seen in the game include the reptilian krogan, the environmental suited quarians, and a hostile race of networked [[artificial intelligence]]s called geth. Humanity is represented by the Systems Alliance, an organized body that joined the galactic community in 2157.&lt;ref name="Systems Alliance"/&gt;

The protagonist of the game is Commander Shepard (voiced by [[Mark Meer]] or [[Jennifer Hale]]), a graduate of the Systems Alliance special forces program and a candidate to become the first human member of the Special Tactics and Reconnaissance (Spectre) force, agents given broad authority by the Citadel Council to protect the galaxy. Shepard's squad members include human Systems Alliance marine [[Kaidan Alenko]] ([[Raphael Sbarge]]), human Systems Alliance soldier [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Ashley Williams|Ashley Williams]] ([[Kimberly Brooks]]), turian Citadel Security officer [[Garrus Vakarian]] ([[Brandon Keener]]), krogan mercenary [[Urdnot Wrex]] ([[Steven Barr]]), quarian mechanic [[Tali'Zorah]] (Ash Sroka), and asari [[Xenoarchaeology|exoarchaeologist]] [[Liara T'Soni]] ([[Ali Hillis]]). Other characters include ''SSV Normandy'' captain [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#David Anderson|David Anderson]] ([[Keith David]]) and ''SSV Normandy''{{'}}s pilot [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Jeff "Joker" Moreau|Jeff "Joker" Moreau]] ([[Seth Green]]).&lt;ref name="Mass Effect Credits"/&gt;

===Plot===
Shepard and Kaidan are sent to the human colony of Eden Prime to recover an unearthed Prothean beacon. They repel an attack by the geth, rescuing Ashley in the process. Rogue turian Spectre, Saren Arterius, activates the beacon before escaping. Shepard reaches the beacon and receives a vision showing scenes of war and death. The ''SSV Normandy'' and its crew are summoned by Ambassador Donnel Udina to the Citadel Station, but Shepard is unable to convince the Citadel Council of Saren's treason without solid evidence. Shepard meets Garrus and Wrex, and rescues Tali, who possesses a recording of a conversation between Saren and asari Matriarch, Benezia. The two discuss their victory while also mentioning an artifact called the "Conduit" and the return of the Reapers, a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships believed to eradicate all [[Organism|organic]] civilization every 50,000 years. The Council revokes Saren's Spectre status and makes Shepard the first human Spectre. Shepard is also handed command of the ''Normandy'' by Anderson, and begins to follow several leads provided by him and Udina.

On the world of Therum, Shepard rescues Benezia's daughter Liara T'Soni, who joins Shepard's squad because of her biotic abilities and expertise of the Protheans. On the colony of Feros, Shepard fights off Saren's forces and learns that his flagship, Sovereign, possesses unique mind-control capabilities. On the world of Noveria, Shepard tracks down and defeats Benezia, who reveals that she and Saren are being indoctrinated by Sovereign. Meanwhile, the Council informs Shepard that a salarian infiltration unit has uncovered Saren's main base on Virmire. Upon arrival, Shepard learns that Saren has discovered a cure for the krogan genetic disease, the genophage, and plans to breed an army of unstoppable krogan warriors. Wrex clashes with Shepard over whether to destroy it, which results in him either standing down or being executed. After this conflict, Shepard assists the salarians in destroying the base by planting a bomb in it. Inside, Shepard is confronted by Sovereign, who reveals itself to be an actual Reaper.

Sovereign reveals that the Reapers remain outside the Milky Way waiting for organic life to develop and discover the Mass Relays, before harvesting them when they reach their peak. Afterwards, Shepard must choose between saving Ashley or Kaidan, who have both been pinned down with the bomb about to explode. Shepard also finds Saren, who claims that his allegiance to Sovereign will save organic life forms by demonstrating their usefulness to the Reapers. Liara is then able to pinpoint the Conduit's location back on the ''Normandy'': a Prothean world known as Ilos. There, Shepard learns that the Citadel Station is actually a huge Mass Relay that the Reapers use to invade the galaxy. During the last [[extinction]] cycle, a few Protheans survived on Ilos via [[cryopreservation]] and then re-entered the Citadel Station via the Conduit, a reverse-engineered miniature Mass Relay disguised aboard the station as a statue. The Protheans sabotaged the Citadel to prevent the Reapers from remotely activating the Citadel Mass Relay, which Saren plans to undo to allow Sovereign to trigger the Reaper invasion.

After fighting through heavy geth forces at the Conduit, Shepard confronts Saren at the Citadel. Saren is either killed by Shepard or commits suicide if Shepard convinces him to rebel. The Destiny Ascension, the Citadel's [[flagship]] with the Council on board, then requests assistance; Shepard must either risk heavy human casualties to save them or sacrifice them to pursue Sovereign. Sovereign then reanimates Saren's corpse to attack Shepard, while simultaneously fighting off the Alliance. Eventually, Saren's corpse is destroyed, and Sovereign is dispatched by the ''Normandy''. For prevailing, Humanity is either invited to join the Council if it was saved, or becomes its new leader if it was left to perish. Regardless, Shepard can nominate either Anderson or Udina to this new leadership position before leaving the proceedings, vowing to end the Reaper threat.

==Development==
''Mass Effect'' was developed by [[BioWare]] and directed by [[Casey Hudson]], who previously directed BioWare's 2003 title ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''.&lt;ref name="IGN interview 1"/&gt; Preproduction of the game began in early 2004, shortly after the [[Microsoft Windows]] version of ''Knights of the Old Republic'' was released.&lt;ref name="Xbox Gazette interview"/&gt; As the development team was already experienced with the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console, they decided to develop the game originally for its successor, the [[Xbox 360]], due to its improved processing power and development tools.&lt;ref name="Xbox Gazette interview"/&gt; A total of 130 people were involved in the development of the game and the first six to eight months were spent conceiving how the game would look.&lt;ref name="CVG interview"/&gt; ''Mass Effect'' uses the [[Unreal Engine 3]] as a groundwork, but on top of that the team developed additional components for advanced digital actors, space exploration, and squad combat, resulting in BioWare's largest programming project at the time.&lt;ref name="Xbox Gazette interview"/&gt; During the game's three- to four-year development cycle, most of the time had been devoted to the development of these technologies.&lt;ref name="Xbox Gazette interview"/&gt;

As BioWare wanted to create a big and memorable story, ''Mass Effect'' was envisioned as the first chapter of a trilogy from the very beginning, and having a considerable technological basis would help shorten the development cycle of its future sequels.&lt;ref name="Xbox Gazette interview"/&gt; Instead of designing a role-playing game where the player would control a blank protagonist, the developers wanted players to assume the role of a central character that would have to make important decisions.&lt;ref name="IGN interview 1"/&gt; According to Hudson, this approach would allow them to create a unique "level of intensity and cinematic power", while at the same time give the player the same role-playing customization as previous BioWare games.&lt;ref name="Amped Interview 2"/&gt; Choices and consequences were a high priority, as developers did not want players to follow a pre-determined path.&lt;ref name="IGN character creation"/&gt; Since the game would feature a wide range of dialogue options when the player interacts with in-game characters, the team created the dialogue wheel to help players know which responses belong to which emotions.&lt;ref name="IGN interview 2"/&gt; The use of digital actors allowed developers to create conversations where characters would speak by using facial expressions and body movement.&lt;ref name="IGN digital actors"/&gt;

Hudson explained that they wanted to evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of ''Knights of the Old Republic'' into a real-time third-person shooter [[User interface|interface]].&lt;ref name="IGN burning questions"/&gt; The combat was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface.&lt;ref name="Amped Interview 2"/&gt; It was also designed so that players would not need to press many buttons to pull off the squad's different attack combinations.&lt;ref name="IGN interview 3"/&gt; The team worked closely with [[Microsoft]] on several elements of the interface to make sure the combat was tactical enough,&lt;ref name="Guardian interview"/&gt; and went through a lot of trial and error to balance the combat between role-playing game and [[Shooter game|shooter]].&lt;ref name="Guardian interview"/&gt; Creating a great sense of discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations.&lt;ref name="Xbox Gazette interview"/&gt; Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, the tools and technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.&lt;ref name="Amped Interview 3"/&gt;

[[File:Jack Wall.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Jack Wall (composer)|Jack Wall]] was the main composer of ''Mass Effect''.]]

[[Drew Karpyshyn]], who previously served as a senior writer for ''Knights of the Old Republic'', was the lead writer for ''Mass Effect''.&lt;ref name="IGN Karpyshyn 1"/&gt; Despite the fact that each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behooved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas.&lt;ref name="IGN Karpyshyn 1"/&gt; One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes.&lt;ref name="IGN Karpyshyn 1"/&gt; It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue.&lt;ref name="IGN Karpyshyn 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Karpyshyn 2"/&gt; According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.&lt;ref name="IGN Karpyshyn 2"/&gt;

Films such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' were major influences on the atmosphere and artistic qualities of the game.&lt;ref name="Xbox Gazette interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unlimited Enabled"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spirits Within"/&gt; The team chose [[Jack Wall (composer)|Jack Wall]], who also penned the music for BioWare's 2005 title ''[[Jade Empire]]'', as the main composer of ''Mass Effect'' due to his ability to produce a wide range of musical styles.&lt;ref name="Xbox Gazette interview"/&gt; Hudson had a clear idea of what kind of music he wanted in the game, but gave Wall certain artistic freedom to express himself.&lt;ref name="Wall Interview 2"/&gt; According to Wall, the main vision was to "marry the electronic instrument palatte {{sic|&lt;!--envelop--&gt;}} of the late 70's/early 80's with more organic elements."&lt;ref name="Wall Interview 3"/&gt; Wall had never written this style of music before,&lt;ref name="Wall Interview 3"/&gt; but composer Sam Hulick helped him develop the electronic sound on a classic orchestral foundation.&lt;ref name="Xbox Gazette interview"/&gt; By the end of the project, composers [[Richard Jacques]] and David Kates joined Wall and Hulick to finish the score on time.&lt;ref name="Wall Interview 4"/&gt; While a total of 110 minutes of music was written for the game, all in-game and cinematic music was crafted as multiple stems to maximize their use and variety.&lt;ref name="Wall Interview 4"/&gt; The game [[Software release life cycle|went gold]] on October 22, 2007.&lt;ref name="IGN gold"/&gt;

''Mass Effect'' was released for the Xbox 360 on November 20, 2007, in North America.&lt;ref name="IGN Release Date"/&gt; However, the street date was broken in Australia on November 16, 2007, by [[EB Games]], which received copies of the game early and took it as a sign to begin distributing.&lt;ref name="IGN EB Games"/&gt; The game was released in both Standard and Limited Collector's Edition format. The Limited Collector's Edition included a bonus disc of exclusive ''Mass Effect'' background material, a soundtrack, and design galleries featuring more than 600 pieces of artwork with full audio commentaries.&lt;ref name="Collectors Edition"/&gt; A [[soundtrack album]] titled ''Mass Effect Original Soundtrack'', which features 37 tracks of the game and covers a duration of 1:15:59, was released in conjunction with the game.&lt;ref name="IGN soundtrack 1"/&gt; The album includes the song "[[M4 (EP)|M4 (Part II)]]" by Canadian [[Electronics in rock music|electronic rock]] band [[Faunts]], which is featured in the game during the [[Closing credits|end credits]].&lt;ref name="IGN soundtrack 2"/&gt;

A [[Microsoft Windows]] version [[porting|ported]] by [[Demiurge Studios]] was released on May 28, 2008. This version features optimized controls designed specifically for [[personal computer]]s, high-resolution graphics, a new user interface, and other minor changes.&lt;ref name="GameSpy PC version"/&gt; BioWare initially intended to use [[SecuROM]], a [[digital rights management]] software which would require online activation after installation and additional authentication checks every ten days. However, the company ultimately decided not to use it after listening to criticism from fans.&lt;ref name="SecuROM"/&gt; In 2012, ''Mass Effect'' was ported to [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 3]] console by [[Edge of Reality]], featuring lighting and visual effects improvements.&lt;ref name="PS3 release"/&gt; It was released digitally on the [[PlayStation Network]] and as part of the ''[[Mass Effect Trilogy]]'' compilation.&lt;ref name="PS3 release"/&gt; In 2015, ''Mass Effect'' was added to the [[List of Xbox 360 games compatible with Xbox One|list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games]] on [[Xbox One]].&lt;ref name="BC XONE"/&gt;

==Downloadable content==
''Mass Effect'' features two [[downloadable content]] packs. The first pack, ''Bring Down the Sky'', was released as a paid download for the Xbox 360 on March 10, 2008, and as a free download for Microsoft Windows on May 28, 2008.&lt;ref name="DLC1 Interview"/&gt; The pack is included in the PlayStation 3 version of the game, which was released on December 4, 2012.&lt;ref name="DLC1 PS3"/&gt; ''Bring Down the Sky'' introduces a new mission where the player must explore an asteroid using the Mako and prevent it from striking an Earth-like planet. It also includes a new alien race and additional side-quest content.&lt;ref name="DLC1 IGN impressions"/&gt; According to BioWare, the adventure takes 90 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name="DLC1 Interview"/&gt; Ryan Geddes of IGN highlighted the pack's included extras and "stunning" visuals,&lt;ref name="DLC1 IGN impressions"/&gt; while Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer]] criticized its lack of narrative weight and reuse of outpost maps that are also available in the base game.&lt;ref name="DLC1 EuroG Review"/&gt;

The second pack, ''Pinnacle Station'', was released as a paid download for the Xbox 360 and as a free download for Microsoft Windows on August 25, 2009.&lt;ref name="DLC1 PS3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLC2 IGN review"/&gt; However, it remains absent on the PlayStation 3 version of the game.&lt;ref name="DLC1 PS3"/&gt; The pack introduces a training facility where the player can compete in eight [[virtual reality]] combat scenarios, divided into four different game types like [[Deathmatch]] and [[Capture the flag]].&lt;ref name="DLC2 IGN review"/&gt; After beating the combat scenarios, the player needs to complete four more to unlock a special survival mode, which is the same as the previous survival challenges but requires players to last five minutes.&lt;ref name="DLC2 IGN review"/&gt; BioWare described ''Pinnacle Station'' as "a ''[[Fight Club]]''-style arena" and originally intended to include a similar arena in the base game, but the idea was ultimately dropped because they were not able to do it well enough.&lt;ref name="DLC2 announced"/&gt; The pack received mediocre reviews from critics,&lt;ref name="DLC2 metacritic"/&gt; who called it uninspiring and unnecessary.&lt;ref name="DLC2 IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLC2 GSpot review"/&gt;

Upon release, ''Mass Effect'' received critical acclaim from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]].&lt;ref name="Metacritic X360"/&gt; The game's [[interactive storytelling]] and cinematic design were highlighted very positively, while the combat and vehicle navigation were generally seen as the game's weakest features.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GI Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Kevin VanOrd of [[GameSpot]] described ''Mass Effect'' as "a great game with moments of brilliance and a number of small but significant obstacles that hold it back from reaching its true potential."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Similarly, IGN's Erik Brudvig considered it greater than the sum of its parts, stating that although ''Mass Effect'' features numerous technical issues, most of the game "is so expertly delivered that it can transcend its weaknesses."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner said that the game's interactive storytelling encourages [[Replay value|replay]] and that its detailed story "makes the relationships feel real—you care about your crew, and you really feel like you have a voice that resonates throughout the galaxy."&lt;ref name="GI Review"/&gt; Alex Dale of ''[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]]'' stated similar pros, stating that "never before has storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and never before has a player had so much freedom to dictate the course of a linear storyline."&lt;ref name="CVG review"/&gt; Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GT review"/&gt; Jennifer Tsao of [[1UP.com]] felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the [[lip sync]] had some issues.&lt;ref name="1UP review"/&gt; Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent [[frame rate]] and long [[Loading screen|loading times]].&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt;

Cameron Lewis of ''[[GamePro]]'' praised the game's story, depth, and presentation,&lt;ref name="GamePro review"/&gt; while Paul Curthoys of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' remarked that the game "bothers with emotions and moments that most games don't concern themselves with", describing it as "a great [[science-fiction]] novel in video game form."&lt;ref name="OXM review"/&gt; In contrast, ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' concluded that the [[space opera]] setting failed to provide "the myth and exotica to adequately follow ''[[Star Wars]]''".&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; The publication also criticized the cast of characters and overall tone, saying that ''Mass Effect'' "strives so hard to be taken seriously that it winds up feeling relentlessly dour."&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; Kristan Reed of Eurogamer noted the game's slow start and overwhelming setting, observing that it would confuse players before they know what the main game is about.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt;

The combat was generally criticized for its unbalanced mechanics and poor artificial intelligence of the squad members.&lt;ref name="GI Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; ''Edge'' commented that the game's role-playing elements did not blend well with its action,&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; while IGN criticized the squad mechanics for not having enough weight, stating that the squad members "are quite often no more useful than cannon fodder to draw the enemy away from you."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; The inventory management was also a subject of criticism, with 1UP.com describing it as painful and tedious.&lt;ref name="1UP review"/&gt; The galaxy exploration was favorably compared to the 1986 [[Adventure game|adventure]] game ''[[Starflight]]'' and the number of optional missions was highlighted positively,&lt;ref name="CVG review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpy review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameCritics review"/&gt; but the Mako sections were disparaged for their rocky planetary design and clumsy combat mechanics.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; The Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 versions of the game received similar criticism to the Xbox 360 version.&lt;ref name="GSpot PC review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN PC review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN PS3 review"/&gt;

===Sales===
In the United States, ''Mass Effect'' debuted at #6 on [[The NPD Group]]'s video game sales chart for November 2007, with sales of 473,000 copies.&lt;ref name=gamasutrasales/&gt; [[The simExchange]] had previously forecast 328,000 sales for the period.&lt;ref name="3 Weeks Sales"/&gt; By the following month, the game was absent from NPD's top 10.&lt;ref name=gisales1/&gt; ''Mass Effect'' proceeded to sell over one million units worldwide within fewer than three weeks on shelves, according to Microsoft vice president [[Jeff Bell (executive)|Jeff Bell]].&lt;ref name="3 Weeks Sales"/&gt; Sales rose to 1.6 million copies after six weeks of availability,&lt;ref name=gamedailysales/&gt; and [[VentureBeat]]'s Dean Takahashi noted in March 2008 that the game was "expected to cross 2 million in sales, generating an estimated $120 million".&lt;ref name=venturebeatsales/&gt; In November 2008, the game's Xbox 360 version received a "Gold" certification from the [[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]], indicating lifetime sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="UK Gold"/&gt; In April 2011, it was reported that both ''Mass Effect'' and its sequel have combined sold more than seven million units worldwide.&lt;ref name="7 million units"/&gt;

===Accolades===
''Mass Effect'' received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the 2007 [[Spike Video Game Awards]],&lt;ref name="Spike winners"/&gt; Roleplaying Game of the Year at the 11th Annual [[Interactive Achievement Awards]],&lt;ref name="DICE Awards"/&gt; and Best RPG at the IGN Best of 2007 Awards.&lt;ref name="IGN Awards RPG Overall"/&gt; In addition, ''[[The New York Times]]'' selected ''Mass Effect'' as its Game of the Year.&lt;ref name="NYT Best Game"/&gt; In 2008, IGN editors ranked the game number 1 on their list of Top 25 Xbox 360 games.&lt;ref name="IGN Top 25"/&gt;

===Controversy===
''Mass Effect'' has an optional subplot where the player can develop a romantic relationship with a non-player character. If the relationship becomes more intimate, a [[cutscene]] containing partial [[nudity]] and sexual activity is shown. The scene first came under scrutiny in an article by [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] blogger Kevin McCullough, who employed statements such as "''Mass Effect'' can be customized to sodomise whatever, whomever, however, the game player wishes", and "with its over the net capabilities virtual orgasmic rape is just the push of a button away."&lt;ref name="Townhall"/&gt; The article was criticized by the gaming community and long-time anti-obscenity campaigner [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], who said that "this contrived controversy is absolutely ridiculous."&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt; Although McCullough ultimately issued an apology, he still considered the material offensive.&lt;ref name="Apology"/&gt;

Similarly, a [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] program by [[Martha MacCallum]] discussed the sexual content of the game.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt; MacCallum stated that the game "leaves nothing to the imagination" and features the ability for players to "engage in full graphic sex."&lt;ref name="Top 10 controversies"/&gt; Self-proclaimed psychology specialist Cooper Lawrence and video game journalist [[Geoff Keighley]] were also interviewed. Lawrence described sexual content in video games as teaching their active users to consider women as objects of desire valued solely for their sexuality. She added that the game's player character is a man who decides how many women he wants to be with.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt; Keighley focused on challenging the accuracy of her statements and asked her if she actually played the game, to which she responded "No".&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt; BioWare's parent company [[Electronic Arts]] requested a correction from Fox News, but they simply responded that the company had been offered a chance to appear on the channel.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt;

After watching someone play the game for about two-and-a-half hours, Lawrence eventually retracted her earlier statements.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt; She added that she had been told the game was similar to [[pornography]], and noted that she "has seen episodes of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' that are more sexually explicit."&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt; In the interim, largely as a reaction from an offended gaming community, her latest book attracted many customer reviews on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] which rated it one star out of five. Many of these reviews satirically noted that they had not read her book, but heard from someone else that the book was bad, and thus voted low.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt; ''Mass Effect'' was also banned in [[Singapore]] for a short time before it was lifted with an M18 rating. Censors in the country said that a scene with an alien and human female caressing was the main reason why the game was not allowed to be sold in video game stores.&lt;ref name="Singapore bans ME"/&gt;

==Sequel==
{{main|Mass Effect 2}}
Since ''Mass Effect'' was planned as the first chapter of a trilogy, development of a sequel began shortly before the game was released.&lt;ref name="Starting development"/&gt; The sequel, entitled ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on January 26, 2010, and for PlayStation 3 on January 18, 2011. With the import of a completed [[saved game]] of the original ''Mass Effect'', the player can impact the story of ''Mass Effect 2'' in numerous ways.&lt;ref name="IGN ME2 Review"/&gt; The sequel was a critical success and received multiple year-end awards, including Game of the Year at the 2011 D.I.C.E. Awards and Best Game at the 2011 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] Awards.&lt;ref name="AIAS Game of the Year"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BAFTA Game of the Year"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Metal Slug'''''|メタルスラッグ|Metaru Suraggu}}, also called '''''Metal Slug (3D Version)''''' (メタルスラッグ(3D版)) to distinguish it from the original ''[[Metal Slug]]'', is a [[third-person shooter]] [[Shoot 'em up#Run and gun|run and gun]] [[video game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]]. It was developed and published by [[SNK Playmore]] and was released only in Japan on June 29, 2006 due to mostly negative reviews from critics. It is the first game of the series to be presented in [[3D computer graphics|3D]]. None of the original ''Metal Slug'' team were involved with the title.

The game had no definite title when it was first unveiled in [[Tokyo Game Show]] back in 2004. In [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] of 2005, [[SNK Playmore]] revealed the game to be called "Metal Slug: Evolution".&lt;ref name="e305_snkcrep"&gt;{{cite web| title      = E3 2005 report on SNK-Capcom| work       = snk-capcom.com| url        = http://www.snk-capcom.com/news/archives/00000026.htm| accessdate = 2009-05-07|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080318130009/http://www.snk-capcom.com/news/archives/00000026.htm |archivedate = March 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was later changed to just "Metal Slug".

Although only the Japanese version has been released, the Japanese version contains menus that are mostly in English, as well as English voice acting. Japanese subtitles and dialogue are also available.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the year 2030, two years after the first Metal Slug game and before Metal Slug 2. Series antagonist [[Metal Slug (series)#Characters|General Morden]] becomes allies with Oguma, president of Oguma Enterprises and world leader of technology. Because this alliance could only stand to further strengthen Morden's military power, [[Metal Slug (series)#Characters|Marco Rossi]], [[Metal Slug (series)#Characters|Fio Germi]], [[Metal Slug (series)#Characters|Tarma Roving]], and [[Metal Slug (series)#Characters|Eri Kasamoto]] set out to dissolve both parties. Recurring boss character [[Metal Slug (series)#Characters|Allen O'Neil]] also returns to oppose the player.

==Gameplay==
''Metal Slug'' maintains many features from the 2D entries; characters use an arsenal of various guns, grenades and explosives, and vehicles. The game also introduces full three-dimensional movement to the series to coincide with its 3D presentation, which uses [[super deformed]] characters.

Upgrades and customization are some of the largest new features. Players can upgrade each character's combat abilities, categorized into Pellet, Power, Hit Rate, and Machine. These abilities allow characters to increase the damage, "splash" radius, and accuracy of their weapons and vehicle handling, respectively. Each character begins with a full proficiency in different categories. For example, Marco starts off with a full Hit Rate skill while Fio starts with a completely upgraded Pellet skill.

Another new feature is a grade system, which ranks the player according to their performance on each of the game's 12 levels. Achieving the highest rank, the S rank, allows the player to collect medals, which are used for upgrading character attributes.

Playing through the game also awards Skill Points to the player, which can be used to upgrade 4 other abilities, which affect the amount of damage a character can withstand, their ability to evade enemy attacks, and more.

The game also includes the option to customize the titular Metal Slug to their own liking, with the ability to switch out its "core," treads, weapons, and armor. An in-game laboratory can be used to build custom parts for the vehicle.

==Reception==
''Metal Slug'' has received mixed reviews. NTSC-uk gave the game a 2 out of a possible 10, citing its poor graphics, barren environments, and overall boring gameplay.&lt;ref name="review_ntscuk"&gt;{{cite web| title      = Review of Metal Slug on NTSC-uk| work       = ntsc-uk.com| url        = http://www.ntsc-uk.com/review.php?platform=ps2&amp;game=MetalSlug3D| accessdate = 2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] scored a 5/10, saying, "It's a glimpse of something special waiting to happen, of a no-nonsense attitude towards combat that could be developed into a series worthy of the torch that it has chosen to bear."&lt;ref name="edgerev_metacritic"&gt;{{cite web| title      = Edge Magazine Review on Metacritic| work       = metacritic.com| url        = http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps2/metalslug3d| accessdate = 2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three buffered mults - Today's completed builds... (2014-12-18 12.32.13 by c-g.).jpg|thumb|Custom built mult circuits and panels]]
A '''mult box''' is "a metal box with multiple outputs of a single audio source (one microphone connected to twenty jacks so that twenty people can record that microphone)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euonline.org/members/continui/audioendearment/index.html |publisher=NPR |first= Mark |last=Greenhouse |title=Audio Terms of Endearment |date= July 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mult box is sometimes called a '[[press box]]', but that term is usually reserved for the sports media's section of an arena. It may also be called a '''press mult box''' or '''press bridge'''.&lt;ref name=View&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garypalamara.com/Articles_Press%20Conference%202.htm|last=Palamara|first=Gary|publisher=Radio World|title=The View From the Back of the Room - II: Tips for Reporters and Others Covering Press Events|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[sound engineer]] connects several [[microphone]]s to allow all of them to get clean, high-quality audio.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;

Reporters use a mult box frequently at [[press conference]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearslutz.com/board/remote-possibilities-acoustic-music-location-recording/331423-mult-box-set-up-press-feed.html |title=Mult Box Set Up for Press Feed |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when politicians give such interviews in small spaces, where not all the reporters in a [[press pool]] can access the interviewee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/rick-santorums-way-win-run-campaign-shoestring-budget-162734670--abc-news.html |publisher=Yahoo News |authors=Shushanna Walsh and Michael Falcone |title=Rick Santorum's Way to Win? Run a Campaign on a Shoestring Budget |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
A whole set of [[etiquette]] and [[mores]] has developed amongst [[journalist]]s governing the use of mult boxes.  Because it is often difficult to get a good [[sound recording]] from a [[Dictation machine|digital recorder]] for later broadcast or [[:wikt:transcribe|transcription]] for newspaper reporting, journalists have developed informal rules for their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsjournalists.com/forum/index.php?topic=57499.0|author="Johnny Dangerously" ([[pseudonym]])|title=Mult box procedure and etiquette|publisher=[[Sportsjournalists.com]] |date=June 16, 2008|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the media should treat the sound engineer well, because while reporters can be selfish and competitive with each other, and the equipment can go wrong in many ways, the engineer allows all of them to get a good signal.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;  It is also extremely important to show up early to press conferences; this "early bird gets the worm" habit allows one to test equipment, to avoid problems caused by the chaos of most press conferences, and to work cooperatively with the engineer.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;

The [[NCAA]] has a specific, written policy on the use of mult boxes for all NCAA championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.turner.ncaa.com/dr/ncaa/ncaa/release/sites/default/files/files/NewsMediaPress%20Conferences.pdf|author=unknown|title=NCAA Championship (News, Media and Press Conferences) |publisher=[[NCAA]]|year=2016|accessdate=Oct 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
[[United States]] government agencies usually provide a mult box for media use at press conferences.&lt;ref&gt;See ''e.g.'', http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2012/120323.html [[NTSB]] press release; accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they are not always consistent; the [[United States Department of Energy]] sometimes makes a mult box available, but then does not make a "media avail with speakers"; yet at other times does ''not'' allow a mult box but follows it up with a "press availability".&lt;ref name=Energy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/articles/tomorrow-secretary-chu-visit-south-carolina-attend-small-business-summit-highlight-clean|publisher=United States Department of Energy|title=TOMORROW: Secretary Chu to Visit South Carolina to Attend Small Business Summit, Highlight Clean Energy Innovations With Rep. Clyburn (press release)|date=August 22, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some state government agencies or courts also may provide such equipment for free to media, but charge a fee to rent it for private events held on state property.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', in [[Ohio]], [http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/PIO/MediaRequestInfo/default.asp [[Supreme Court of Ohio]]'s Guidelines for News Organizations Broadcasting, Televising, Recording and Photographing Sessions of Court], [http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/events/YourEvent/index.aspx Ohio Statehouse's webpage on "Your Event at the Statehouse"], and [http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/Communications/Media/UseOfTapeRecorders.aspx Ohio Statehouse's webpage on "Use of Tape Recorders at the Ohio Statehouse For News Media and Others"]; all accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colleges and universities provide the use of a mult box ''gratis'' to media who need it to record large academic events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], speaker, or [[funeral]],&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2012/05/commencement-events-may-10-11-at-vanderbilt-university/ [[Vanderbilt University]] press release], [http://www.cianewswire.com/2012/05/mediaalert_hfhk.html [[The Culinary Institute of America]] press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310024625/http://www.cianewswire.com/2012/05/mediaalert_hfhk.html |date=2013-03-10 }}, and [http://www.vt.edu/in-memoriam/dec12-service.html [[Virginia Tech]] press information web page] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805200257/http://www.vt.edu/in-memoriam/dec12-service.html |date=2012-08-05 }}; both accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but charge for leasing to certain organizations.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://www.css.washington.edu/Rental-List [[University of Washington]] Classroom Support Services "Rental List" web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620195509/http://www.css.washington.edu/Rental-List |date=2010-06-20 }} and [http://www.css.washington.edu/Fee-Categories University of Washington web page listign which groups are charged what rates]; see also [http://www.nyu.edu/campusmedia/events/rates.html [[New York University]] web page for Events Media Services Rates] and [http://www.nyu.edu/campusmedia/events/policies.html New York University policies web page]; all accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Larger houses of worship, such as a [[basilica]] or [[cathedral]], may provide a mult box for certain religious services, but not others, depending on their policies and the nature of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] or [[eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://archphila.org/press%20releases/pr001946.htm [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]] press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703053610/http://archphila.org/press%20releases/pr001946.htm |date=2012-07-03 }}; accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Large media events, such as the [[Grammy Awards]], [[Alamo Bowl]], etc., often provide a mult box for media at their press conferences as a convenience.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'' [http://www.alamobowl.com/main/media_schedule.php Valero Alamo Bowl media schedule &amp; info web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414130344/http://www.alamobowl.com/main/media_schedule.php |date=2012-04-14 }} and [http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-05-2012-400-am Grammy Awards press release]; both accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation==
A mult box can be an extraordinarily expensive piece of audio-visual equipment to purchase,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} so many organizations rent them from a communications company or government agency.  Larger venues may make them available to the media for free, but rent them to private parties.

In 2011, the [[Foreign_relations_of_the_African_Union#Diplomatic_missions|United States Mission to the African Union]] donated a [[state of the art]] mult box to the cash-starved [[African Union]] in a formal ceremony, in which they also presented new [[intern]]s who will be trained to use it.&lt;ref name=AU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usau.usmission.gov/-mult-box-grant-to-the-auc-09/22/11.html|last=|first=|publisher=United States Mission to the African Union|title=United States Mission to the African Union donates Audio Visual Broadcast Media Mult Box to the AUC|date=September 22, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Theatre of Costa Rica''' ({{lang-es|'''Teatro Nacional de Costa Rica'''}}) is [[Costa Rica]]'s [[List of national theatres|national theatre]], located in the central section of [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]. Construction began in 1891, and it opened to the public on 21 October 1897 with a performance of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. 

The National Theatre stood as a cultural asset of the country during a time when coffee exports were a source of its success. It presents high quality performances, with artistic criteria being very high. 

The building is considered the finest historic building in the capital, and it is known for its exquisite interior which includes its lavish furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baker, C.P.|title=Costa Rica|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] [[Eye Witness Travel Guides]]|year=2005|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction history==
[[File:Teatro National de Costa Rica - inside.jpg|thumb|upright|The foyer of the ''Teatro Nacional de Costa Rica'']]
Constructed in the late 19th century, when San Jose's population was only around 19,000 people, the theatre presented many private performances. Its only real competition was the ''Teatro Mora'' (also called the Municipal Theatre, or ''Teatro Municipal''), that existed for many years before the National Theatre, until it was destroyed and deemed unsafe by an earthquake. 

To finance the construction of a theatre suitable for name "National Theatre", the [[President of Costa Rica]], [[José Joaquín Rodríguez Zeledón]] decided to place a tax on coffee, then the principal export product. Later, one [[coffee]] planter begged the government to remove the export tax on his product and put it on [[rice]] and [[beans]] (also principal export products of the time).

There were many problems during the early period of construction. However, the construction errors were corrected by an Italian engineer who was brought in to direct the process. It took seven years to finish the theatre, and the inauguration took place on 21 October 1897.

The front of the theatre features statues of [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. There are several monuments by the entry walkway including [[Frédéric Chopin]]. The inside features the [[mural]] ''Allegory of Coffee and Bananas'' by Milanese artist [[Aleardo Villa]], which is featured on the five [[Costa Rican colón|colón]] bill.

==The theatre today==
As well as having performances several times a week, the theatre is a [[tourist attraction]]. Performances by the National Symphonic Orchestra (NSO) take place as part of orchestra's regular season, and include both Costa Rican and foreign composers.

'''''No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel''''' is an [[autobiography]] by [[fashion model]], photographer, author and [[talent agent]] [[Janice Dickinson]]. It was published in hardcover format in 2002 by [[ReganBooks]], an imprint of [[HarperCollins]]. The author's friend [[make-up artist]] [[Way Bandy]] advised her to begin putting her past experiences down on paper as a form of therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining [[sobriety]], she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted [[book publisher]] [[Judith Regan]] who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' that pressure from [[Bill Cosby]] and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of [[sexual assault]] and [[rape]] by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in [[Lake Tahoe]], California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she was telling the truth and explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.

The book recounts Dickinson's early life where she states she experienced [[child abuse]] from her father, and moves forward describing her experiences throughout her career as a model. Dickinson explains her struggle with [[substance dependence]] upon drugs and alcohol during her career. The author discusses her time as a representative for companies including [[Virginia Slims]], [[Max Factor]], and [[Hush Puppies]]; and her success appearing on the covers of magazines including: ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmo]]''. While performing work as a model she takes the time to gain knowledge about the craft of photography and fashion. Dickinson describes how she originated the term "[[supermodel]]". ''No Lifeguard on Duty'' cautions about the tendency towards insecurity in celebrity culture.

''No Lifeguard on Duty'' received a favorable reception from multiple publications. [[Film rights]] to the book were purchased by [[Warner Bros.]] in 2004. ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' praised the author's comedic style in the work. [[Knight Ridder|Knight Ridder Newspapers]] wrote positively of the author's courage at describing difficult experiences from her past. ''[[The New York Observer]]'' found the writing style of the book to have a good flow throughout. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote: "Dickinson comes across as a triumphant survivor."&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt;

Dickinson's book had a positive impact on her career. Because of reading the book, [[Tyra Banks]] decided to bring Dickinson on board as a judge on her new program ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' in 2003. Dickinson served as a judge on the program for a total of four seasons before being replaced by [[Twiggy Lawson]]. [[Oxygen Network]] subsequently hired her for its new program centered on the author's efforts to start her own company; the program launched in 2006 titled: ''[[The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency]]''.

==Writing process==
Janice Dickinson's friend [[make-up artist]] [[Way Bandy]] recommended she use the writing process to help heal from her past experiences.&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt; She began to do so as part of her addiction recovery during a [[twelve-step program]].&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt; She put her notes down on legal pads and they became numerous over time.&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt; By the time Dickinson began to compile her writing into book format she had become established in her career and resided in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] with her two children.&lt;ref name="kerwin" /&gt; She started formally putting her notes together into a book after successfully gaining [[sobriety]].&lt;ref name="kerwin" /&gt;

She got in touch with [[book publisher]] [[Judith Regan]] who agreed to help her publish the book after a brief phone call, without first receiving a draft of the work.&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wallace"&gt;Wallace 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Los Angeles Magazine]]'', Dickinson recalled the process of pitching her book to Regan: "I got a book deal without even turning in one shred of a writing sample. I was having an invincible moment. I told her how difficult it was for me growing up with an abusive father, how when I went to New York to become a model I was rejected for a year for being 'too ethnic.' Judith said, 'Okay, I'm in.'"&lt;ref name="wallace" /&gt;

[[File:Janice Dickinson 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Janice Dickinson]] in 2014]]
The author explained to ''Los Angeles Magazine'' her reasoning for including in the book a graphic phrase used by [[Jack Nicholson]] after his lovemaking session with her: "The reason that line made the book is because he told me not to say anything. And I will never, ever respond to anybody—man, woman, vegetable, or mineral—who tells me to keep my mouth shut. Alter what I've been through, I don't think so, pal."&lt;ref name="wallace" /&gt;

Dickinson explained in an interview that she authored the work to communicate to others to publicly reveal their past negative experiences as a way to heal from trauma.&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt; She stated: "I wrote this book to urge people not to keep secrets. I still suffer. The memories are still vivid. I made a lot of mistakes. I was shaped by my mistakes. But the past is done. The future's up to me."&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt;

==Contents summary==
[[Janice Dickinson]] describes her early life where she suffered [[child abuse]] and [[physical abuse]] at the hands of her father.&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kerwin"&gt;Kerwin 2002&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that her three sisters and mother also experienced abuse from her father.&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt; She recounts her ups and downs during her career while finding success in the fashion industry.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt; She emphasizes how bravery is important to success, and explains how she remained firm on her request for [[United States dollar|US$]]20,000 for a modeling position when the market figure at the time was only $5,000.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt; Throughout the process she experiences emotional pain from relationships that lack depth, and learns for herself about the harms of [[substance dependence]].&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt; Incidents related to her drug addiction problems include ingesting [[heroin]] from [[Gia Carangi]] prior to a photography session in [[Italy]], and an experience in a state of [[alcohol intoxication]] falling off a [[runway (fashion)|fashion runway]] for [[Valentino Garavani]] and landing upon [[Sophia Loren]].&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt;

The author discusses her time as a representative for companies including [[Virginia Slims]], [[Max Factor]], and [[Hush Puppies]].&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt; She writes of her success appearing on the covers of magazines including: ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmo]]''.&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt; Professional photographers including [[Francesco Scavullo]], [[Norman Parkinson]], [[Irving Penn]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Peter Beard]], and [[Michael Reinhardt]] work with her in [[photoshoot]]s.&lt;ref name="fitchtner" /&gt; While performing work as a model she takes the time to gain knowledge about the craft of photography and fashion.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt;

In the book she asserts that her experiences helped influence models who came after her including [[Cindy Crawford]] and [[Christy Turlington]].&lt;ref name="wallace" /&gt; She writes that she was the first to use the term "[[supermodel]]" and refers to herself as such.&lt;ref name="wallace" /&gt; She recounts a particular exchange with her agent Monique Pillard who asked her: "Janice, you are working night and day. Who do you think you are, superman?"&lt;ref name="schoenberg"&gt;Schoenberg 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Dickinson responded: "No, honey. I'm supermodel."&lt;ref name="schoenberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate2002"&gt;The Advocate 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickinson remembers relationships with fellow celebrities including [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Mick Jagger]], and [[Jack Nicholson]].&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt; She enjoys her celebrity status and her time with friends [[John Belushi]], [[Truman Capote]], and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name="wallace" /&gt; Belushi and Dickinson enable each other's predilections for abusing drugs.&lt;ref name="weiss" /&gt; She regularly spends time at [[Studio 54]] during this period.&lt;ref name="wallace" /&gt; Dickinson recounts a darker side of celebrity, and writes that she trusted in [[Bill Cosby]] when he informed her he could help her career in [[show business]], only to experience verbal anger from him when she said she was too tired to engage in sexual activity with him.&lt;ref name="weiss" /&gt;

She was supported during her career by her friendship with actor [[Bruce Willis]] and her positive connections with her sisters.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt; She reflects on the nature of her marriages and looks back on her prior self-indulgent lifestyle.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt; She explains to the reader how personal achievement may result from the allure of success, and simultaneously cautions against harmful byproducts of behavioral insecurity inherent in the mystique of celebrity.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Tyra Banks 2012 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|After reading ''No Lifeguard on Duty'', [[Tyra Banks]] decided to make Janice Dickinson a judge on her television program ''[[America's Next Top Model]]''.&lt;ref name="amatangelo" /&gt;]]
''No Lifeguard on Duty'' received a favorable review from ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name="publishersweekly"&gt;''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The review concluded: "The book is sometimes predictable and psychologically simplistic, but Dickinson comes across as a triumphant survivor. Her willingness to recognize her own flaws makes it easy to relate to her positive message and should inspire readers searching for solutions to career and personal conflicts."&lt;ref name="publishersweekly" /&gt; The review praised the author's ability at being: "honest enough to acknowledge the stimulating aspects of success and glamour, explaining why they lure insecure personalities and imprison them past the point of no return."&lt;ref name="contemporaryauthors" /&gt; ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' reviewed the book and wrote: "What keeps the book from becoming too tawdry is Dickinson's sense of humor. She applies a healthy dose to both her conquests and disaster's alike."&lt;ref name="kerwin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="contemporaryauthors"&gt;''[[Contemporary Authors]]'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 article, [[Knight Ridder|Knight Ridder Newspapers]] characterized the book as: "a brave, profane memoir of her escape from childhood abuse into the even more risky whirl of bright lights, big cities and spiraling self-destruction."&lt;ref name="fitchtner"&gt;Fitchtner 2002&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent article in 2003 by Knight Ridder Newspapers wrote: "what makes Dickinson's tome stand out from all the other Hollywood memoirs is that she has a cheeky sense of humor about her self-absorption."&lt;ref name="perry"&gt;Perry 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Weiss]] of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote: "I read ''No Lifeguard on Duty'' at once and wasn't disappointed. Janice Dickinson is a funny and fluid narrator."&lt;ref name="weiss"&gt;Weiss 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Of the author's path to success recounted in the book, the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' wrote: "Janice Dickinson had a cometlike trajectory as an early supermodel in the 1980s, which she has recounted in her raunchy life story".&lt;ref name="fitchett"&gt;Fitchett 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
While reading Dickinson's book, [[English people|English]] [[novelist]] [[Jackie Collins]] ran into the author at a bookstore and asked the fellow author to lunch to discuss their mutual experiences.&lt;ref name="kresse"&gt;Kresse 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Janice Dickinson landed a television role as a judge on the program ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' due to ''No Lifeguard on Duty''.&lt;ref name="amatangelo"&gt;Amatangelo 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Show creator [[Tyra Banks]] explained to ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' her decision process: "The reason why I hired Janice Dickinson is because I read her book (''No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel''), and that book represented every single thing that I have never done. Every single thing that I have never experienced."&lt;ref name="amatangelo" /&gt;

Banks elaborated that she wanted a judge on the program that had gone through issues in her modeling career that she herself had not: "I sit all the time and talk to girls and say, 'Don't drink. Don't smoke. Don't go out. Don't do this. I never did it.' But there's only so much you can preach to someone if you've never done it. I thought I could have someone like Janice because she's so outrageous."&lt;ref name="amatangelo" /&gt; Banks stated that she thought Dickinson provided a warning to models not to follow the path she had taken because it had proved dangerous:" When she's telling a girl, 'Don't do this,' she's saying, 'Don't do this because it didn't work for me.' I thought it was a good balance."&lt;ref name="amatangelo" /&gt;

After serving as a judge on the program for four seasons, Dickinson's spot was filled with [[Twiggy Lawson]] in 2005 for the show's fifth season.&lt;ref&gt;AP Worldstream 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year, [[Oxygen Network]] hired Dickinson for its new reality modeling television program which at the time was initially titled ''The Janice Dickinson Project''.&lt;ref name="aponline2005" /&gt; It centered on her efforts to launch her own business with a modeling agency.&lt;ref name="aponline2005"&gt;AP Online 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Her television show launched in 2006, titled: ''[[The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 18, 2014 interview with Dickinson on ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', she stated the initial version of ''No Lifeguard on Duty'' was different from what became the final published product.&lt;ref name="davidbauder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="billcarter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mattsedensky" /&gt; Dickinson said she wrote about a traumatic experience where she said [[Bill Cosby]] [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] her in 1982 at a hotel in [[Lake Tahoe]], California.&lt;ref name="davidbauder"&gt;Bauder 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billcarter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="emilychow"&gt;Chow 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  She stated that Cosby supplied her with [[red wine]] and then medicated her with drugs and subsequently [[rape]]d her at the hotel.&lt;ref name="billcarter"&gt;Carter 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mattsedensky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bueno2014"&gt;Bueno 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dickinson, both Cosby himself and his attorneys persuaded the author and her publisher HarperCollins to delete mention of the incident from her book prior to publication.&lt;ref name="davidbauder" /&gt; A few hours after the interview was publicized on ''Entertainment Tonight'', [[Netflix]] made the decision to postpone its Cosby comedy film special ''[[Bill Cosby 77]]'' from its lineup.&lt;ref name="davidbauder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elber2014"&gt;Elber 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Singer, an attorney representing Cosby, made a statement in which he asserted Dickinson was not being truthful in her account.&lt;ref name="billcarter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mattsedensky"&gt;Sedensky 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of ''Entertainment Tonight'' to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program.&lt;ref name="kevinfrazier"&gt;Frazier 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a [[Polaroid camera]] of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe in order to support her assertions.&lt;ref name="roig"&gt;Roig-Franzia 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview with [[Kevin Frazier]] she stated her account was the truth: "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I have to speak up and you have to be able to go in and just be brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward."&lt;ref name="kevinfrazier" /&gt; She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: "The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm sitting here today. And I don't care about what Cosby or networks or anybody says, you will hear me."&lt;ref name="kevinfrazier" /&gt;

'''Nušićijada''' is an annual [[comedy festival]] held in the town of [[Ivanjica]], in the [[Moravica District|Moravica]] region of southwestern [[Serbia]].

==History==
;1968–72
The festival began as a celebratio of film comedy from 1968 to 1972, which attracted the cultural elite of then [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The festival had a ''Round Scene with a Corner''. The festival bears the name of the famous Serbian comedy playwright, [[Branislav Nušić]], who used the sentence "You’re bound for Ivanjica!" as a punchline in his comedies, indicating the 19th century threat of exile to this town. Later it became the festival’s slogan and the invitation to Ivanjica. In 1972, the festival ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOUT NUŠIĆIJADA|url=http://www.nusicijada.rs/en/nusicijada/|work=nusicijada.rs|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2010–17
[[File:Nušićijada Official Logo.png|thumb|right|2010–17 Nušićijada logo]]
In 2008, a citizen petition for reviving the festival was signed by over 10% of the population. A citizen organisation named KudeS (Cultural Decentralization of Serbia) was formed and led the process of organizing the new festival. After the local Assembly adopted the proposal, the Municipality of Ivanjica, Ivanjica Culture Centre and Ivanjica Tourism Organisation joined the partnership, and these four organizations organised Nušićijada beginning in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bojović|first=Beba|title="Nušićijada" vratila sjaj staroj varoši|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Srbija/205603/Nusicijada-vratila-sjaj-staroj-varosi|work=blic.rs|accessdate=1 September 2013|language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trtović|first=V.|title=Ivanjica opet u znaku Nušića|url=http://www.pressonline.rs/svet/balkan/131404/ivanjica-opet-u-znaku-nusica.html|work=pressonline.rs|accessdate=1 September 2013|language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the organizers, the 2015 Nušićijada attracted attention of more than 55,000 visitors, the most since founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rekordno masovno lečenje smehom zabeleženo na ivanjičkoj Nušićijadi|url=http://www.nusicijada.rs/nusicijada-zabelezila-rekordnu-posecenost/|accessdate=12 September 2015|work=nusicijada.rs|date=4 September 2015|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 Nušićijada attracted 55,000 visitors again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sedma Nušićijada oborila sve rekorde, ne odstupajući od kulturnih okvira i pravih vrednosti|url=http://www.nusicijada.rs/sedma-nusicijada-oborila-sve-rekorde-ne-odstupajuci-od-kulturnih-okvira-i-pravih-vrednosti/|accessdate=20 September 2016|work=nusicijada.rs/|date=31 August 2016|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2018–present
In March 2018, the municipality's president and local leader of ruling [[Serbian Progressive Party]], made a decision to expel KudeS (leader of the festival's revival and main organizer) from the list of event's organizers.&lt;ref name="2018expel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=D.|first1=K.|title=SNS stavio Nušićijadu „pod kontrolu“|url=https://www.danas.rs/kultura/sns-stavio-nusicijadu-pod-kontrolu/|accessdate=27 March 2018|work=danas.rs|date=27 March 2018|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2018Bexpel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kao u Nušićevoj komediji: Organizatori "Nušićijade" izbačeni iz festivala koji su stvorili|url=https://www.blic.rs/kultura/vesti/kao-u-nusicevoj-komediji-organizatori-nusicijade-izbaceni-iz-festivala-koji-su/ev3l45s|accessdate=27 March 2018|work=blic.rs|date=27 March 2018|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was widely seen as politically motivated, as former event's participants have satirically mocked the [[President of Serbia]] and leader of Serbian Progressive Party [[Aleksandar Vučić]].&lt;ref name="2018expel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2018Bexpel" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11971">In early [[Greek music]] [[music theory|theory]], an '''octave species''' (εἶδος τοῦ διὰ πασῶν, or σχῆμα τοῦ διὰ πασῶν) is a sequence of [[incomposite interval]]s ([[ditone]]s, [[minor third]]s, [[whole tone]]s, [[semitone]]s of various sizes, or [[quarter tone]]s) making up a complete [[octave]] {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=231–32}}. The concept was also important in Medieval and Renaissance music theory.

==Ancient Greek theory==
[[File:Greek Dorian enharmonic genus.png|thumb|300px|Greek Dorian octave species in the enharmonic genus, showing the two component tetrachords {{audio|Greek Dorian mode on E, enharmonic genus.mid|Play}}]]
[[File:Greek Dorian chromatic genus.png|thumb|300px|Greek Dorian octave species in the chromatic genus {{audio|Greek Dorian mode on E, chromatic genus.mid|Play}}]]
[[File:Dorian diatonic.png|thumb|right|300px|Greek Dorian octave species in the diatonic genus {{audio|Phrygian mode E.mid|Play}}]]
Greek theorists used two terms interchangeably to describe what we call species: ''eidos'' (εἶδος) and ''skhēma'' (σχῆμα), defined as "a change in the arrangement of incomposite [intervals] making up a compound magnitude while the number and size of the intervals remains the same" ({{harvnb|Aristoxenus|1954|loc=92.7–8 &amp; 92.9–11}} (da Rios), translated in {{harvnb|Barbera|1984|loc=230}}). Cleonides (the Aristoxenian tradition) described (in the diatonic genus) three species of [[perfect fourth|diatessaron]], four of [[perfect fifth|diapente]] and seven of [[octave|diapason]]. Ptolemy in his "Harmonics" called them all generally "species of primary consonances" (εἴδη τῶν πρώτων συμφωνιῶν). [[Boethius]], who inherited Ptolemy's generalization under the term "species primarum consonantiarum" (Inst. mus. IV,14{{Full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--Unless there is a very good reason not to, this should be referenced to Bower's translated edition.--&gt;), expanded species theory of Greeks; along with the traditional orderings of three primary species he introduced three further their orderings {{harv|Boethius|1989|loc=149}}. For epistemology of the Antiquity music theory, the most important of all was the octave species, because "from the species of the consonance of the diapason arise what are called ''modes''" {{harv|Boethius|1989|loc=153}}.

=== Octave species ===
The basis of octave species was the smaller category of species of the [[perfect fourth]], or ''diatessaron''; when filled in with two intermediary notes, the resulting four notes and three consecutive intervals constitute a "[[tetrachord]]" {{harv|Gombosi|1951|loc=22}}. The species defined by the different positioning of the intervals within the tetrachord in turn depend upon [[Genus (music)|genus]] first being established {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229}}. Incomposite in this context refers to intervals not composed of smaller intervals.

[[File:Greek Phrygian enharmonic genus.png|thumb|300px|Greek Phrygian octave species in the enharmonic genus {{audio|Greek Phrygian mode on E, enharmonic genus.mid|Play}}]]
Most Greek theorists distinguish three genera of the tetrachord: [[Enharmonic genus|enharmonic]], [[Chromatic genus|chromatic]], and [[Diatonic genus|diatonic]]. The enharmonic and chromatic genera are defined by the size of their largest incomposite interval (major third and minor third, respectively), which leaves a composite interval of two smaller parts, together referred to as a ''pyknon''; in the diatonic genus, no single interval is larger than the other two combined {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229}}. The earliest theorists to attempt a systematic treatment of octave species, the harmonicists (or school of Eratocles) of the late fifth century BC, confined their attention to the enharmonic genus, with the intervals in the resulting seven octave species being {{harv|Barker|1984–87|loc=2:15}}:

Species of the [[perfect fifth]] (''diapente'') are then created by the addition of a whole tone to the intervals of the tetrachord. The first, or original species in both cases has the ''pyknon'' or, in the diatonic genus, the semitone, at the bottom {{harv|Cleonides|1965|loc=41}} and, similarly, the lower interval of the ''pyknon'' must be smaller or equal to the higher one {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229–30}}. The whole tone added to create the species of fifth (the "tone of disjunction") is at the top in the first species; the remaining two species of fourth and three species of fifth are regular rotations of the constituent intervals, in which the lowest interval of each species becomes the highest of the next ({{harvnb|Cleonides|1965|loc=41}}; {{harvnb|Barbera|1984|loc=233}}). Because of these constraints, tetrachords containing three different incomposite intervals (compared with those in which two of the intervals are of the same size, such as two whole tones) still have only three species, rather than the six possible permutations of the three elements {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=232}}. Similar considerations apply to the species of fifth.

The species of fourth and fifth are then combined into larger constructions called "systems". The older, central "characteristic octave", is made up of two first-species tetrachords separated by a tone of disjunction, and is called the Lesser Perfect System {{harv|Gombosi|1951|loc=23–24}}. It therefore includes a lower, first-species fifth and an upper, fourth-species fifth. To this central octave are added two flanking conjuct tetrachords (that is, they share the lower and upper tones of the central octave). This constitutes the Greater Perfect System, with six fixed bounding tones of the four tetrachords, within each of which are two movable pitches. {{harvnb|Ptolemy|1930|loc=D. 49–53}} {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=235}} labels the resulting fourteen pitches with the (Greek) letters from Α ([[Alpha (letter)|Alpha α]]) to Ο ([[Omega (letter)|Omega Ω]]). (A diagram is available at [[Musical system of ancient greece#Systêma ametabolon, an overview of the Tone System|systema ametabolon]])

The Lesser and Greater Perfect Systems exercise constraints on the possible octave species. Some early theorists, such as Gaudentius in his ''Harmonic Introduction'', recognized that, if the various available intervals could be combined in any order, even restricting species to just the diatonic genus would result in twelve ways of dividing the octave (and his 17th-century editor, [[Marcus Meibom]], pointed out that the actual number is 21), but "only seven species or forms are melodic and symphonic" {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=237–39}}. Those octave species that cannot be mapped onto the system are therefore rejected {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=240}}.

==Medieval theory==
In chant theory beginning in the 9th century, the ''New Exposition'' of the composite treatise called ''Alia musica'' developed an eightfold [[Musical mode|modal system]] from the seven diatonic octave species of ancient Greek theory, transmitted to the West through the Latin writings of [[Martianus Capella]], [[Cassiodorus]], [[Isidore of Seville]], and, most importantly, Boethius. Together with the species of fourth and fifth, the octave species remained in use as a basis of the theory of modes, in combination with other elements, particularly the system of [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos|octoechos]] borrowed from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] {{harv|Powers|2001}}.

Species theory in general (not just the ''octave'' species) remained an important theoretical concept throughout Middle Ages. The following appreciation of species as a structural basis of a mode, found in the ''Lucidarium'' (XI, 3) of [[Marchetto of Padua|Marchetto]] (ca. 1317), can be seen as typical:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We declare that those who judge the mode of a melody exclusively with regard to ascent and descent cannot be called musicians, but rather blind men, singers of mistake... for, as [[Berno of Reichenau|Bernard]] said, "species are dishes at a musical banquet; they create modes" {{harv|Herlinger|1985|loc=393-395}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Opening Ceremony Plate Spinning.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Plate Spinners]]'''Plate spinning''' is a circus manipulation art where a person spins [[Plate (dishware)|plates]], [[Bowl (vessel)|bowls]] and other flat objects on poles, without them falling off. Plate spinning relies on the [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] effect, in the same way a [[top]] stays upright while spinning. Spinning plates are sometimes gimmicked, to help keep the plates on the poles. 

Many [[Chinese acrobatics]] troupes feature plate spinning, usually in combination with [[contortion]] or [[acrobatic]] skills. These usually feature performers holding several plates in each hand spinning on sticks. 

Western plate spinning performers usually present comedy acts and typically feature one performer with an assistant, spinning multiple plates on sticks held vertically in stands.

Other forms of plate manipulation include plate waltzing, where plates are spun on their edges on a table top, and plate juggling, where plates are manipulated and thrown by the performers. Some performers have combined several of these elements into restaurant or kitchen-themed acts.
 
The [[Guinness World Record]] for spinning multiple plates is held by David Spathaky, assisted by Debbie Woolley, who spun 108 plates simultaneously in Bangkok, Thailand, on television in 1996. He had previously held and broken his own record four times since 1986.

==In popular culture==
[[Image:Efteling Carnaval Festival Loeki China.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Chinese Plate Spinners at [[Carnival Festival|Carnaval Festival]], [[Efteling]]]]
The tune "[[Sabre Dance]]" is often played in the background. This was a popular act on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (by Erich Brenn[http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/erich-brenn-plate-spinner]) and other American [[variety show|variety]] and [[talent show]]s during the early years of American television. [[Tom Griswold]], co-host of ''[[The Bob &amp; Tom Show]]'', a syndicated American comedy radio program, occasionally says he wishes he could see a plate spinner on TV again and wants to book one for his staff's annual Christmas party, which [[Chick McGee]] cites as further evidence that Griswold is out of touch with contemporary entertainment. In an episode of the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'', at the [[Springfield Retirement Castle]] talent show, one participant does a similar act, but uses the [[dentures]] of several of the residents.  Plate spinning was often seen in [[HBO]]'s prison drama ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', where an unnamed prisoner would often be seen spinning a book on the tip of a pen.

On British television, the popular game show ''[[The Generation Game]]'' would regularly feature a plate spinner demonstrating his skills, then inviting the contestants to have a go - with smashing results. During the 1960s &amp; 1970s Wolfgang Bartchelli popularised plate spinning in Europe and regularly appeared on television. From the 1980s onward, plate spinner [[Andrew Van Buren]] regularly appeared and still can be seen presenting this format on game shows, on television and performing around the world.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''''Shadows over Balkan''''' ({{lang-sr|Сенке над Балканом}} / Senke nad Balkanom), also known as '''''Black Sun''''' is a [[Cinema of Serbia|Serbian]] [[Crime film|crime]] [[Television show|television series]] created by [[Dragan Bjelogrlić]]. Besides Bjelogrlić, [[screenplay]] was also done by [[Danica Pajović]], [[Dejan Stojiljković]] and [[Vladimir Kecmanović]], based on a story written by Stevan Koprivica. The series was done in co-production with [[Cobra Film]], [[Radio Television of Serbia]], [[Skopje Film Studio]], [[Iskra (film production)|Iskra]], [[Radio Televizija Republike Srpske|RTRS]], [[Macedonian Radio Television]] and [[The Film Agency of the Republic of Macedonia]].

The series is set in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] during the [[Interwar period]]  and follows the story of two [[Belgrade]] police department [[Police Inspector|inspectors]]. The first season is set during the period just before the [[6 January Dictatorship]] and follows the attempts of the two inspectors to solve the cases of [[Human sacrifice|sacrificial murders]] which were shaking the Belgrade public.

Dragan Bjelogrlić, [[Andrija Kuzmanović]], [[Marija Bergam]], [[Aleksandr Galibin]], [[Nenad Jezdić]], [[Gordan Kičić]], [[Nebojša Dugalić]], [[Sebastian Cavazza]] and [[Toni Mihajlovski]] are in the lead roles. The first season ran from 22. October 2017 to 24. December 2017 on the [[RTS1]] channel, as well as on many other television channels from former Yugoslavia. The filming of the first season took place between October 2016 and June 2017, while the second season will be filmed during 2018 and will be airing in 2019. The first season was received very well by both the audience and critics, although it caused some controversy. Production, acting, editing and costume design have all been praised, as well as the themes the series deals with.

== Premise ==
The series is divided in three seasons and encompasses the period between 1928 and 1940.&lt;ref name="senke6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/magazine/sr/story/411/film-i-tv/2577156/zavrseno-snimanje-prvog-dela-serije-senke-nad-balkanom.html|title=Završeno snimanje prvog dela serije „Senke nad Balkanom“|publisher=[[Radio Television of Serbia]] |date =  |accessdate = 28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first season covers the period just before the assassination of the Croatian Member of National Assembly [[Stjepan Radić]] at the [[Parliament of Yugoslavia|National Assembly of the Serbs, Croatians and Slovenians]] and the subsequent establishment of [[6 January Dictatorship|the dictatorship]].

[[Belgrade]] in between two World Wars was chosen as the main setting for the series. At the center of events we find the main characters – fifty year old criminal police inspector Andra Tanasijević Tane and his new associate, a young [[Forensic pathology|forensic]] by the name of Stanko Pletikosić. Belgrade is portrayed as a place where crime consists of classic [[Robbery|robberies]] and [[Murder|murders]], but whose biggest problems are wars between [[opium]] [[cartel]]s, which use the city as just another route for [[smuggling]] the expensive and precious drug further into [[Europe]] and [[United States]].

The plot of the first season starts with a very peculiar and brutal murder which occurs at a [[Costume party|costume ball]] where most of the Belgrade's [[social elite]] is gathered.&lt;ref name="senke4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondo.rs/a1052492/Zabava/TV/Senke-nad-Balkanom-druga-epizoda.html|title=SENKE NAD BALKANOM: Još jedno jezivo ubistvo!|publisher=mondo.rs |date =  |accessdate = 29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspector Tanasijević soon realizes that the cause of the frequent eerie events, which are beginning to grow in number by the day, is an [[Relic|ancient relic]] – [[Holy Lance]] (with which [[Jesus]] was pierced through on the [[Crucifixion|cross]]) – to which mystical powers are ascribed.&lt;ref name="senke2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/magazine/ci/story/401/film-i-tv/2912664/senke-nad-balkanom-veceras-stizu-na-male-ekrane.html|title=„Сенке над Балканом“ вечерас стижу на мале екране!|date=|publisher=[[Radio Television of Serbia]]|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He realizes that there are people who are ready to do anything to have it in their possession and is sucked into the entangled web of crime of which all the obscure interest groups from the Balkans from that time are part of the Russian [[White army]] of general [[Pyotr Wrangel|Vrangel]], the secret police of the [[Soviet Union]] ([[OGPU]] and [[NKVD]]), [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], [[IMRO]], [[Yugoslav Communists|Yugoslav communists]], the underbelly of Belgrade and [[secret society]] called [[Thule Society|Thule]].&lt;ref name="senke3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurir.rs/zabava/pop-kultura/2948551/senke-nad-balkanom-razotkrivaju-tajne-slobodnih-zidara-masoni-nisu-sekli-glave-ali-su-krojili-istoriju-srbije|title=SENKE NAD BALKANOM RAZOTKRIVAJU TAJNE SLOBODNIH ZIDARA: Masoni nisu sekli glave ali su krojili istoriju Srbije|publisher=[[Kurir (Newspapers)|Kurir]] |date =  |accessdate = 28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the traces of the committed crimes, the inspector starts looking for relic with one goal in mind – to remove it from Belgrade and prevent more innocent deaths.

== Roles ==
[[Dragan Bjelogrlić]] played the main role of inspector Tane, and he was also the [[Film producer|producer]] and [[Film director|director]].&lt;ref name="Slobodnaevropa" /&gt;

[[Gordan Kičić]] played the role of Alimpije Mirić, one of the main antagonists. He said that he saw the [[Screenplay (TV series)|screenplay]] as far back as 2014. He filmed his scenes in the first season from October 2016 to May 2017.  He didn’t film his scenes in continuity but in parts which lasted a couple of days.&lt;ref name="kicićintervju"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pandurević|first1=Dragana|last2=Milenković|first2=Stefan|title=Gordan Kičić za NOIZZ: Tajna Alimpija Mirića iz "Senki nad Balkanom"|url=https://noizz.rs/intervju/gordan-kicic-za-noizz-tajna-alimpija-mirica-iz-senki-nad-balkanom/rh24ksj|website=Noizz.rs|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=sr-RS|date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nenad Jezdić]], who plays the antagonist by the name of Krojač (Tailor), at first wished to play the role of inspector Tane.&lt;ref name="mandaibiković" /&gt; The role of Krojač was his last available choice. Slovenian actor [[Sebastian Cavazza]] got the role of Gabriel Maht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osvojio žensku publiku: Ko je markantni Sebastijan Kavaca iz serije “Senke nad Balkanom”?|url=http://www.gloria.rs/price/osvojio-zensku-publiku-ko-je-markantni-sebastijan-kavaca-iz-serije-senke-nad-balkanom/|website=Gloria|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=sr-RS|date=31 December  2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The role of general [[Pyotr Wrangel|Vrangel]] went to the Russian actor [[Aleksandr Galibin]], who remarked that he was delighted to play such an important historical figure: "It is such a precious thing to me to be playing such an important historical figure as general Vrangel was. I am particularly glad that we are filming in this church, where his body rests. That is especially touching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serbia|first1=RTS, Radio televizija Srbije, Radio Television of|title=Александар Галибин у серији "Сенке над Балканом"|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/rts/ci/rtspredstavlja/story/210/snima-se/2553156/aleksandar-galibin-u-seriji-senke-nad-balkanom.html|website=RTS.rs|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=sr-RS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second season, the Slovenian actor [[Jernej Šugman]], who passed away in December 2017, was supposed to play the role of [[Anton Korošec]] minister of internal affairs of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Sio1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teran Košir|first1=Alenka|last2=Mrevlje|first2=Než|title=Bjelogrlić: Magnifico je v Srbiji precej večja zvezda, kot si misli #intervju|url=https://siol.net/trendi/film/dragan-bjelogrlic-magnifico-je-v-srbiji-vecja-zvezda-kot-si-misli-intervju-456215|website=Sio1NET.|accessdate=31 January 2018|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Stanko Pletikosić was supposed to be played by [[Miloš Biković]], with whom Bjelogrlić already collaborated on "[[Montevideo, God Bless You!]]", but Biković gave up because of the obligations he had in Russia. [[Andrija Kuzmanović]] got the role in the end who also acted in "Montevideo".&lt;ref name="mandaibiković"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radanov|first1=Ljubomir|title=BJELOGRLIĆ POSLE SMRTI KUMA PROMENIO SCENARIO: Mandinu ulogu izbrisao iz serije Senke nad Balkanom|url=http://www.kurir.rs/zabava/pop-kultura/2944521/bjelogrlic-posle-smrti-kuma-promenio-scenario-mandinu-ulogu-izbrisao-iz-serije-senke-nad-balkanom|website=kurir.rs|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=sr-RS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montenegro]] the series is aired on [[RTCG|RTCG 1]], and in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] on [[MRT 1]]. The series debuted in Macedonia at the 38. [[Manaki Brothers Film Festival]] in [[Bitola]] on 25 September 2017, and Dragan Bjelogrlić, [[Tomi Salkovski]] (co-producer), [[Igor Ivanov Izi]] (director on one of the episodes) as well as the actors Marija Bergam, Jana Stojanovska, [[Pero Arsovski]] and [[Petar Atanovski]] addressed the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janković|first1=Zoran|title=„Senke nad Balkanom“ predstavljene i na festivalu u Bitolju «  FCS|url=http://www.fcs.rs/16118/|website=Filmski centar Srbije|accessdate = 22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There was a great controversy in [[Croatia|Croatian]] media for not airing the first season, and the reasons cited were that it was due to the character of [[Ante Pavelić]] and also that Dragan Bjelogrlić himself forbade it. Bjelogrlić dismissed these claims and said that the main reason for the series not airing in Croatia was because no channel acquired the rights to air.&lt;ref name="Драганбјелогрлићновости" /&gt;

The series was to start airing in [[Russia]] in December 2017.&lt;ref name="senke2"/&gt; In [[Slovenia]] it’s been airing since 7 January 2018. on [[Planet TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://siol.net/planet-tv/filmi-serije/na-planet-prihaja-najbolj-provokativna-serija-balkana-454552|title=Na Planet TV prihaja najbolj provokativna serija Balkana|publisher=siol.net |date = 27 December 2017 |accessdate = 27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The managing director of RTS [[Dragan Bujošević]] confirmed in an interview for [[Večernje novosti|Večernje Novosti]] on 14 January 2018 that RTS won’t be airing the second season because of the high price Cobra Film asked for.&lt;ref name="BujosevicNovosti"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matović|first1=D.|last2=Adžić|first2=M.|title=Dragan Bujošević za “Novosti”: Hajku na "Nemanjiće" podmetnuli na "tviteru"|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/scena.147.html:706101-Dragan-Bujosevic-za-Novosti-Hajku-na-Nemanjice-podmetnuli-na-tviteru|website=www.novosti.rs|accessdate = 15 January 2018|language=sr-Latn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for [[N1 (television)|N1]] TV on 3 January 2018.

Bjelogrlić gave 2019 as the year in which the second season will be airing.{{fact|date=November 2018}} The name of the series was translated into English as "[[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]]" which refers to the symbol that can be frequently in the series and also "Shadows over Balkan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Sun / Senke nad Balkanom|url=https://films.sff.ba/en/detail/?film=Black-Sun|website=Sarajevo Film Festival|accessdate = 26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dragan Bjelogrlić first got interested in the time period in which the series is set while filming the TV series as well as the movie version of [[Montevideo, God Bless You!]] He got interested in [[Interwar period|this period]] because he knew very little of it and he also thought that the Serbian public in general isn’t well informed about it: "Our destiny was such that we never learned much about that time period, it was almost never talked about. And those were important and in a way intense times, especially in Yugoslavia." &lt;ref name="пивљанин"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pivljanin|first1=Ranko|title=GOST "BLICA" Dragan Bjelogrlić: Srbi ne menjaju nameštaj, a ne politički sistem za koji se slažemo da ne valja|url=https://www.blic.rs/vesti/drustvo/gost-blica-dragan-bjelogrlic-srbi-ne-menjaju-namestaj-a-ne-politicki-sistem-za-koji/4ledhm1|accessdate = 30 December 2017|work=Blic.rs|date = 14 August 2017|language=sr-RS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slobodnaevropa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Katavić|first1=Ivan|title=Bjelogrlić: Nije sjajno kada imate bolju prošlost nego sadašnjost|url=https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/intervju-dragan-bjelogrlic/28686990.html|website=Radio Slobodna Evropa|accessdate = 30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Yugoslavia was called "[[Illegal drug trade in Colombia|Colombia of Europe]]" between the two Wars also served as an inspiration to him.&lt;ref name="БарандаСтудио" /&gt;

In his article for [[Blic]] he wrote that he didn’t want to compromise on any part of the show’s creation: "Shadows over Balkan is a piece for which I tried to make no compromises. There were no compromises on any level and in any phase of the show’s production. From the [[Screenplay (TV series)|screenplay]], [[Storytelling|story]], [[theme (narrative)|theme]]s, national divisions, [[aesthetics]], direction to the [[Film budgeting|budget]] and cost.

'''Spuds MacKenzie''' is a fictional dog character created for use in an extensive  advertising campaign marketing [[Anheuser-Busch brands#Bud Light|Bud Light]] beer in the late 1980s. The Spuds MacKenzie [[mascot]] and campaign were created by a 23-year-old art director, Jon Moore. At the time he was working at Needham, Harper &amp; Steers, a Chicago, Illinois, advertising agency. The dog first showed up in a Bud Light [[Super Bowl XXI]] ad in 1987.&lt;ref name="pet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullterrierdallas.com/FamousBullies/spudgirl.htm |title=Spuds McKenzie: Official Party Animal |publisher=Bull Terrier Club of Dallas |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the height of his popularity, large amounts of Spuds merchandise was available, such as [[plush toy]]s and [[t-shirt]]s where the dog was seen surfing a wave or ''Hanging Twenty''.&lt;ref name="SALTY"&gt;{{cite news|title=Salty Dog History|url=https://saltydogpaddle.org/salty-dog-history.html|accessdate=6 October 2018|publisher=''saltydogpaddle.org''|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dog, a [[Bull Terrier]], was not without its share of [[controversy]]. Shortly after Spuds' rise to fame it was learned that the dog, who was portrayed as male in the commercials, was actually female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Zorn |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-09-13/news/8703090112_1_jackie-oles-honey-tree-evil-eye-spuds-mackenzie |title=Eric Zorn.

(Posted: September 13, 1987) |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1987-09-13 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ads were also the subject of attacks and calls for censorship by [[temperance movement|temperance]]-oriented groups. Soon after the ads were first aired in 1987, Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] began his own media campaign, claiming that the beer maker was using Spuds to appeal to children for the purpose of getting them interested in their product at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teetotaler Thurmond Raps Spuds McKenzie|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Teetotaler-Thurmond-Raps-Spuds-MacKenzie-Beer-Promotion/id-03e7a81bdc59e057aa34abefeaa82cce|accessdate=23 November 2012|newspaper=Associated Press|date=13 November 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By Christmas 1987, more legal action resulted from Budweiser's use of ads featuring Spuds dressed as Santa, which is illegal in states such as Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spuds Can't Promote Beer Dressed as Santa|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Spuds-Can-t-Promote-Beer-Dressed-as-Santa/id-46558bab3fdc7f357896effdc47163f2|accessdate=23 November 2012|newspaper=Associated Press|date=2 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]], along with [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]], alleged that [[Anheuser-Busch]] was pitching the dog to children. Although the [[Federal Trade Commission]] found no evidence to support that allegation, Anheuser-Busch decided to retire Spuds in 1989, claiming that the character's image had started to overshadow the product.

The character appeared in Bud Light's advertisement in [[Super Bowl LI]] as a ghost helping a man named Brian reunite with his friends in an homage to [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. The house number in this advertisement's last segment is 1989, paying homage to the year Spuds was retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Kate|title=Bud Light is bringing back a controversial mascot who once helped sales soar 20%|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bud-light-spuds-mackenzie-super-bowl-ad-2017-2|work=Business Insider|date=February 2, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dog's real name was '''Honey Tree Evil Eye ''' or ''Evie'' for short (October 7, 1983 – May 31, 1993).&lt;ref name="SALTY"/&gt; She was from [[Malvern, Pennsylvania]], but moved to [[Warsaw, Indiana]] at a very young age.

The '''Ständeklausel''' (''[[Estates of the realm|estates]]-clause'') was a principle in poetic theatre, by which attempts were made to transfer the principles of [[French literature of the 17th century|Classicist French drama]] into German theatre. It is often connected with [[Johann Christoph Gottsched]]. It stated that only kings, princes and other people of high rank were to be shown in tragedies and that those of the middle classes could only be shown onstage in comedies. It also demarcated audiences in theatre concessions granted by ancien regime princes - only theatres in courts were allowed to put on tragedies (including ballets and serious [[opera]]s), while the rapidly proliferating Volkstheaters were only allowed to put on comedies, including [[Opéra comique|comic operas]] and pantomimes. It was broken by the onset of [[Bourgeois tragedy]] such as ''[[Love and Intrigue]]''.

'''Suicide''' (sometimes abbreviated to "suey"), or otherwise referred to as "elimination", is a [[game]] typically played by [[children]] and [[teenagers]]. The rules vary widely from place to place;{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} those given below are not necessarily a "standard" form of the rules.

==Setup==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Suicide requires at least two players, and can have as many as can be accommodated by the playing area.  The playing area comprises a hard surface, such as [[concrete]], and a large, flat [[wall]], and is usually outdoors. The game also requires a [[rubber ball]] or a [[tennis ball]].

Suicide may be played in teams, but is most commonly played individually.

==Gameplay==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
The object of the game is to be the last remaining player.  In order to stay in the game, players have to avoid being "pegged" out.

When the game begins, a player throws the ball against the wall.  If the ball bounces off the wall and then hits the ground, other players are free to grab the ball and re-throw it.  If the ball is caught by another player before it hits the ground, the player who threw the ball must run and touch the wall.  Until the player touches the wall, they are "open" to be "pegged" (i.e., struck hard with a thrown ball) by the player who caught it. If a player comes into contact with the ball but fails to catch it, they are also "open" to be "pegged".

Note: for games featuring more sensitive players, it may be acceptable, instead of pegging a player who is open to get them out, to throw the ball at the wall before the player "tags up" (touches the wall). The no-pegging rule must be stated before the game begins.  If someone is pegged with the ball when the no-pegging rule is in effect, then it would be the same as if the player had simply missed the wall on the return.

==Alternate Gameplay (Continuous Play Option)==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
There is no object—continuous play.

When the game begins, a player throws the ball against the wall.  The ball is "in-play".  If the ball bounces off the wall and then hits the ground, other players are free to grab the ball and re-throw.  Players must throw any "in-play" ball from where it was caught.

A player throwing the ball after the catch of an "in-play" ball will be "open" when:
* The ball is caught by another player before it hits the ground
* The thrown ball does not hit the wall on the fly (see note on "chink" below)
* The thrown ball misses, or never reaches the wall

A ball that simultaneously hits the wall and the ground at the same time (also sometimes called a "chink") is legal, and the throwing player is not open.

A player who did not throw the ball is "open" when they touch the ball, but do not catch it for any reason. While a player is "open"  they may be "pegged" (i.e. struck hard with a thrown ball) until they touch the wall.  An "open" player may be "pegged" any number of times until they touch the wall. A player throwing a "pegging" ball that misses all "open" players becomes "open" themselves and must touch the wall.

==Penalties==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Roughhousing is acceptable in most games, including setting picks and tripping up players attempting to go for the ball or go for the wall.  It is not permissible, however, to physically interfere with a player who is throwing the ball, nor is it permissible to stand against the wall and prevent other players from touching it when they need to.  Doing either of those constitutes a [[Foul (sports)|penalty]]. Fighting and overly rough play may also draw a penalty.

The "no-pegging" rule may be waived for penalties, but if it is not, then a player who receives a penalty gets an automatic out.

Another penalty is enforced for the practice known as "wall-hugging."  Wall-hugging, in its purest form, occurs when a player positions themselves so that they are in constant contact with the wall.  Therefore, in theory, if the ball hits them, they automatically become "safe", since they are already in contact with the wall.  This is considered unfair and is dealt with accordingly.

A player who wall-hugs, which is officially called when a player stands against the wall at the moment the ball contacts it (unless they are touching the wall to save themselves), is considered open.  In order to be safe, the offending player is required to run to the other side of the court (either an opposite wall or an arbitrary marker set up beforehand) and then run back and touch the wall.

Wall-hugging can be modified to some arbitrary point before the wall (usually several steps away). In this case, even without touching the wall, players can be penalized as if they were wall-hugging.

An "out" based system is applied in many games, where three outs causes a player to leave the game and, in some cases, endure a "punishment" as described below. Another commonly used substitute for "outs" is the usage of a predetermined number of "lives", which can be lost the same way as in the "outs" system, or in some variants even be gained.

In some games that allow pegging, a player who is pegged for three outs (or loses all "lives") is forced to stand facing the wall with their hands on the wall, in a position similar to a police 'pat-down' stance (often referred to as "Bottoms Up"). The player who pegged them last is then allowed to peg them from any distance as hard as possible either one or three times depending on the severity of the rules. Variations of this rule are that three players are mutually selected to peg the victim once each, that the punishing player can choose to "give" one or more of their three pegs to other players, or that all players are allowed one peg each at the victim, which can include 10 or more players in a larger game. The punishing players often aim for the head or buttocks of the victim. Headhunting may be allowed in this punishment ritual even when it is not allowed in normal play.

==Strategies==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Suicide games are usually won by those who have expert dexterity and the ability to run and throw the ball fast.  There are a number of offensive and defensive strategies that players can employ.

* Some players deliberately avoid the ball at all costs.  While this is looked down upon, it is a legal strategy.  The goal for these players is to simply stay out of trouble.  The problem usually arises when others notice their behavior (made blatant by allowing ball to roll through their legs without any attempt to stop it) and begin to target them specifically.  The best way to avoid the ball is to stand as far back from the wall as possible, behind all the other players if possible.  Not only is this technically the safest place to be but it also allows them to be the furthest player back, who may peg anyone they wish to if the ball trickles back far enough.
* Cunning players may rely on "striking," which is deliberately pegging another player with the ball even when they aren't open.  Although the player who strikes is putting themselves in the open, the goal is to catch another player unawares and, in the confusion, touch the wall before the victim can.  The victim hopefully will be the target of whoever catches the ball.
* Some players choose to stand as close as possible to the wall without actually being penalized for wall-hugging. The goal for them is to try to grab the ball whenever convenient and quickly send it back into play.  If they are open, they rely on their close proximity to the wall to become safe immediately.  A method which is usually employed by these players is to "sky" the ball, meaning they throw the ball very hard against the wall in an upward direction so that it will balloon in the air over the other players.  Though this makes it easier for other players to catch the ball, it allows adequate time for the thrower to race to the wall to become safe; usually they reach the wall before the ball is even caught.  The downside to this strategy is that it is less effective if the no-pegging rule is in effect.  Also, these players may have a greater tendency to double-touch or be "struck" by strikers.

In general, players should avoid throwing the ball so that it comes off the wall either as a roller or a line drive.  The harder the ball is to catch, the better the throw.  Balls that fly high in the air are dangerous for they may be caught on the fly.

==Calling Out==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
There are various elaborations on the base game concept which involve the use of "calling out" phrases in specific situations to enact special rules.

If the game is played with a fence behind the court used and a "lives" system is being utilized, "watermelon" rules may be applied.  If the ball seems as if it is about to go over the fence, any player can call out "watermelon".  If the ball goes over the fence, those players gain a "life".  If it doesn't, they lose one.  "Watermelon" must be called out before the ball is within a short distance of the fence.

There is also a "freeze" rule used in some occasions (in some places it's renamed "challenge", or "reach"), wherein whenever a player catches the ball from a long distance away from the wall, any other player may call out "freeze", meaning the person who has caught the ball must stop where they stand and throw the ball. When reaching the wall is impossible for the player, some games allow for the player to call "relay" and pass the ball to a player within reach of the wall. An American variation of this rule allows the "frozen" player 2 options: throw the ball and risk a life on if it hits the wall, or drop it directly onto the ground below them and run for the wall.

'''The Juice Media''' ('''TJM''') is an Australian film and media company, that produces contemporary political and social satire. They are known for their Internet series Honest Government Ads and Juice Rap News.

TJM has been at the centre of a number of political controversies including the use of the "Australien" logo that is at the heart of a Bill to change the Australian Criminal Code Act as well as the divisive Australia Day piracy video.

== History ==

TJM was founded by [[Giordano Nanni]], an Australian [[historian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person194914|title=DR GIORDANO NANNI - The University of Melbourne|date=2012-09-11|access-date=2018-06-11|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911052814/https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person194914|archivedate=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[author]], [[Satire|satirist]] and [[Video production|video producer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://logancij.com/speaker/giordano/|title=Giordano Nanni|work=The Logan CIJ Symposium|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; TJM started publishing on [[YouTube|YouTube]] in May 2008 with the first episode of [[Juice Rap News]] premiering on 4 October 2009.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKRw8GAAtm27q4R3Q0kst_g|title=thejuicemedia|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2016 Juice Media launched the Honest Government ad series with Visit Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thejuicemedia.com/about/|title=About - The Juice Media|work=The Juice Media|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2017 TJM released the controversial ''Australia Day'' (Piracy parody).

== Controversy ==

=== Australien Coat of Harms ===
[[File:Australien Govt - Coat of Harms - by THEJUICEMEDIA.png|thumb|Australien Coat of Harms as created by The Juice Media]]The Australien Coat of Harms was created as the backdrop to the fictitious Department of Genuine Satire for the Honest Government Adverts. There are a number of notable differences between the fictitious Coat of Harms and the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Commonwealth Coat of Arms]] that it lampoons including:

* A stylised alien head replacing the Commonwealth star
* The heads of the emu and kangaroo have been replaced with surveillance cameras
* The bar under the star has been replaced with a buffering bar
* The 6 state emblems on the shield have been replaced with a pirate ship
* The "Australia" wording under the shield has been replaced with "Not the Real Logo"

In September 2017 TJM received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of the satirical logo no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public about the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/thejuicemedia/status/906104236789841920/photo/1|title=theJuice on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]] to amend the [[Criminal law of Australia|Criminal Code Act 1995]].

The summary for the Bill was stated as:&lt;blockquote&gt;Amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to: introduce new offences for a person recklessly or intentionally representing themselves to be, or to be acting on behalf of, or with the authority of, a Commonwealth entity or service; and introduce a new injunction power to allow authorised persons to seek injunctive relief to prevent a person from engaging in conduct in contravention of the new offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The case for the amendments to the Bill were presented in the Senate by the [[Attorney general|Attorney-General]] [[The Honourable|Hon.]] [[George Brandis]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia"&gt;{{Citation|last=thejuicemedia|title=George Brandis on Genuine Satire|date=2017-11-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLzPuNL0BKU|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a number of public submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee overseeing the proposed amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/ImpersonatingaCommBody/Submissions|title=Submissions|last=7111;|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the submissions were pieces from [[Australian Lawyers for Human Rights]] and [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]] both of which expressed concerns with the Bill with regards to freedom of speech and lack of safeguards and ambiguous wording in the Bill that could result in legal action being taken against critics and satirists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=310dc8e6-72ba-4760-9f6e-4ac8ae2a2147&amp;subId=561090|title=Australian Lawyers for Human Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=Parliament of Australia|access-date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/australian-government-wants-give-satire-boot|title=Australian Government Wants to Give Satire The Boot|last=Nazer|first=Daniel|date=2017-10-20|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alhr.org.au/2017-alhr-human-rights-report-card/|title=2017 ALHR Human Rights Report Card - ALHR|date=2018-01-11|work=ALHR|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is unfortunate that the Australian government cannot distinguish between impersonation and satire. But it is especially worrying because the government has proposed legislation that would impose jail terms for impersonation of a government agency. Some laws against impersonating government officials can be appropriate (Australia, like the U.S., is seeing telephone scams from fraudsters claiming to be tax officials). But the proposed legislation in Australia lacks sufficient safeguards. Moreover, the recent letter to Juice Media shows that the government may lack the judgment needed to apply the law fairly.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171023/07223238458/australian-lawmakers-propose-outlawing-parody-having-sense-humor.shtml|title=Australian Lawmakers Propose Outlawing Parody, Having A Sense Of Humor|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This was a sentiment echoed by [[Adam Bandt|Adam Bandt]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] in a speech to parliament in which he addressed the topics of freedom of speech and the rights to "mercilessly troll government".&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia"/&gt;

[[Nick McKim|Senator Nick McKim]] is on record as saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Where does this leave satire in Australia?

On 24 January 2017 TJM released a [[parody]] of a well known [[Copy protection|anti-piracy]] ad, colloquially dubbed "[[You Wouldn't Steal a Car]]", called Australia Day (Piracy parody).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thejuicemedia|title=Australia Day (Piracy parody)|date=2017-01-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UytdM-x3cv4|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video compared the celebration of [[Australia Day]] (Jan 26), which marks the arrival of the [[First Fleet]],  to a number of infamous events in history. The events depicted include [[Nazism|Nazi's]] "[[Final Solution]]", dropping of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Hiroshima]] and [[September 11 attacks|Sep 11 attacks on the Twin Towers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4158072/Ad-compares-Australia-Day-September-11.html?ito=social-twitter_DailyMailAU|title=Ad compares Australia Day to celebrating September 11|last=|first=|date=|work=UK Daily Mail|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/this-video-compares-the-settling-of-australia-to-911-hiroshi|title=This Video Compares Australian Settlement To 9/11, Hiroshima And The Holocaust|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video was released as part of the Change the Date campaign (#[[changethedate]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2018/01-02/australia-dystopia/|title=Australia Dystopia|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which calls for changing the date of Australia Day by [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]], [[Torres Strait Islands|Torres Straight]] Islander and wider community groups.&lt;blockquote&gt;''Many believe celebrating on January 26 is insensitive as the arrival of the First Fleet marked the beginning of a brutal history which saw mass killings of Indigenous Australians.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-25/invasion-day-video-compares-australia-day-to-september-11/8211630?pfmredir=sm|title='You wouldn't celebrate September 11': Ad compares Australia Day to tragic world events|date=2017-01-25|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This video incited a great deal of debate, especially in social media, with a lot of negative sentiments expressed especially at the comparison of Jan 26 to other historical dates:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I understand the sentiment, but these are really poor examples. Not one of these events resulted in the creation of a sustainable society/civilisation," Shaun Fielding said.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[National Australia Day Council]] said in response:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though 26 January marks this specific event, today Australia Day celebrations reflect contemporary Australia: our diverse society and landscape, our remarkable achievements and our bright future. It also is an opportunity to reflect on our nation's history, and to consider how we can make Australia an even better place in future," &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2017 the Australia Day celebrations in [[Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]] were cancelled and replaced with more culturally inclusive celebrations 2 days later on Jan 28. This was seen as a litmus test for the #changethedate movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-24/fremantle-divided-over-cancellation-of-australia-day-festivities/8207954|title='An act of betrayal': City divided over Australia Day cancellation|date=2017-01-24|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internet based Australian satirical news show consisting of a rapped "news report" with [[social commentary]] using comical [[Rapping|rap lyrics]].

== Honest Government Ads ==
[[File:Honest Government Ads - Behind The Scenes.jpg|thumb|Behind the scenes with voice-actor Lucy Cahill at The Juice Media]]
The Honest Government Ads are filmed in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They are written by Giordano Nanni who creates the series in collaboration with Lucy Cahill. Actors appearing in the series are credited as Ellen Burbidge, Zoë Amanda Wilson and Matylda Buczko-Koren with Lucy Cahill also being credited with the voice overs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These videos are a satirical take on [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] advertising. Each video targets a current social or political issue and highlights potential consequences of the Government's position and policy on that issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themandarin.com.au/86230-new-crimes-impersonating-federal-agencies-poorly-drafted/|title=Critics say new crimes of 'impersonating' federal agencies are poorly drafted {{!}} The Mandarin|date=2017-11-22|work=The Mandarin|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"And an increasingly popular way of sharing the ‘honest truth' about political events is through satirical videos, something that The Juice Media does brilliantly. They bring attention to the ridiculousness of political and worldwide events, not only by making people laugh but by being blunt about what is going on and how people are being taken advantage of. Not everyone agrees with their left wing politics, but it gets people talking."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.magnetofilms.co.uk/charity-video-with-bite/|title=Charity video with bite - using satire to provoke action|date=2018-01-10|work=Magneto Films|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:The Juice Media filming of Honest Government Ads.jpg|thumb|Filming Honest Government Ads with Ellen Burbidge]]In an [[Al Jazeera English]] article looking at Satire in the [[Donald Trump|Trump]] era Giordano Nanni was included in the discussion talking about the use of satire to help keep governments honest. 

As part of the Honest Government ad series TJM has published three ads which are mock tourism ads highlighting the history and ongoing effects of [[Colonialism|colonial rule]] in certain countries. These have been produced for [[Australia]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

[[File:Thidambu_Nritham.jpg|thumb|Thidambu Nritham]]
'''Thidambu Nritham''' (dance with the replica of the deity) is a ritual dance performed in Temples of [[North Malabar]]. This is one among many rich art traditions of North Malabar. It is mainly performed by [[Namboothiri]]s, and rarely other [[Brahmin]] communities like [[Shivalli]], [[Karhade]] and [[Havyaka]].
North Malabar is well renowned for its deep rooted culture and tradition. This northern part of present [[Kerala State]] is home for several prominent religious destinations that make it a heaven for several unique religious and ritual art forms including Theyyam. Thidambu Nritham is one such ritual art form.

Thidambu nritham, as the name conveys, is an elegant dance carrying the decorated image of the deity ( thidambu) on the head.&lt;ref name="ManoramaOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulf.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/mmonline.dll/portal/ep/contentView.do?channelId=&amp;contentId=732865&amp;catId=&amp;BV_ID=@@@|title=Malayala Manorama online : Thidambu Nritham|first=Home|accessdate=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5umQ9Ri9V?url=http://gulf.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/mmonline.dll/portal/ep/contentView.do?channelId=&amp;contentId=732865&amp;catId=&amp;BV_ID=@@@|archivedate=2010-12-06|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==

This art form is staged both inside and outside the temple.  Ten persons are needed for staging this dance. The dance is performed with the decorated deity of the [[Devi]] carried on the head. Foot work is most important and this is executed to the rhythms of the drums.  Thidambu nritham is commonly performed by [[Namboothiris]] (Kerala Brahmins). There shall be seven musicians and two lamp-bearers.&lt;ref name="MyKerala"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.my-kerala.com/tour/art/thitambu-nritham.shtml |title=Kerala dotcom : Thidambu Nritham of Temples|first=Home|accessdate=|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5umQ9tkwy?url=http://www.my-kerala.com/tour/art/thitambu-nritham.shtml |archivedate = 2010-12-06|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All the performers are male. The musicians are from [[Marar]] or [[Pothuval]] community and the lamp-bearers are from [[Pushpakan]] (Unni), [[Nambeesan]], [[Variar]], Unnithiricommunities.

===Costumes===

The dancer wears a striking costume a skirt of pleated cloth, a silk vest, earrings, bangles, necklaces and a decorated turban called ushnipeetam. The performance unfolds in various stages like Urayal, invoking the deity,Thakiladi adantha, Chembada, Pamchan etc. The dancer is usually accompanied by a group of artistes, five of whom play the percussions and two hold aloft the lamps.&lt;ref name="PreKerala"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prekerala.com/kerala/dance-forms/livinglegend.htm|title=Puraana Keralam : Temple Arts viz Thidambu Nritham|first=Home|accessdate=}} {{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This ritual art form is believed to be over 600–700&amp;nbsp;years old and follows the principles of dance laid down in Natyasasthra the ancient treatise on performing arts compiled by Sage Bharatha in the second century B.C.

The origin of Thitambu Nritham cannot be easily traced. Tulu Brahmins who had migrated to the North Malabar during Kolathiri might have introduced this dance from Karnataka where a form of "Nritham" called "Darsana Bali" was in vogue. Replicas are made of bamboo with which a beautiful frame with intricate designs is created. The priestly dancer, clad in the traditional style after performing the usual rituals, comes out of the sanctorum, and standing under the flag, holds aloft the replica weighing about 10&amp;nbsp;kg on his head and starts the divine dance.
Another legend goes like this : A Namboothiri used to sit in meditation under a nux vomica tree [Botanical name : Stricnos nuxvomica; Mal. - "Kaanjiram"]. He had sores all over his body. The fruit that occasionally fell on his body gave him excruciating pain. In agony he cried out a curse : "Let this tree bear no fruit any longer". Even today the tree bears no fruit, though it has leaves. It is interesting that during the festival, the dancing Namboothiri priests place the idols of various gods in a small "Mandapam" under the tree. People pay obeisance to the deities here.&lt;ref name="India9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india9.com/i9show/Thidambu-Nritham-25517.htm|title=India Arts :Indian Temple Arts of Kerala|first=Home|accessdate=|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5umQAKtqk?url=http://www.india9.com/i9show/Thidambu-Nritham-25517.htm |archivedate = 2010-12-06|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
[[File:Thitambu Nritham(4).jpg|thumb|Thidambu Nritham performed at Sree Someswari Temple, [[Koovery]]]]
Thidambu Nritham begins with "Kotti Urayikkal", drumming in different rhythm, which would persuade the performer and the viewer to an equal extent. The performer will dance with the rhythm holding the “Thidambu” on his head and will create a holy atmosphere.
This unique ritual art form has undergone changes over the period of time. Even though the basic concepts of Thidamabu Nritham have not changed, slight change happened in its Thaalam, which has added more novelty and variety to this art.
There is no scope for emotional expressions in this art. An exception is famous "Kootippiriyal" (parting of lord Krishna and Balarama) at Trichambaram. The occasion is very touching with thousands watching with tearful joy, Krishna and Balarama playing about wildly until the former runs after the milkman carrying milk, and the latter returns to his dwelling some distance away. There is a legend woven round the Thitambu Nritham of Thrichambaram. There was an ardent devotee of lord Krishna - a Namboothiri. He visited the temple everyday, seeking Krishna's blessings. Time flew. He grew old, so old that he could not walk up to the temple half a kilometer away. Inwardly crushed at his physical incapacity, he prayed : "Krishna, my dear, I cannot come to you; forgive me". Legend has it that, that night, lord Krishna ran up to him with his brother Balarama and danced along what is called "Pookkottu Nada" just in front of the Namboothiri's house. The wonder and delight of the Namboothiri can well be imagined. The famous festival at Trichambaram which goes on from 22nd Kumbham to 6th Meenam (middle March) is in celebration of that event. During the festival, the "Melsaanthis" of Trichambaram and Mazhoor (Balarama's temple) hold aloft the replicas of the two deities and dance to the scintillating rhythm of percussion instruments.

==History==

===Origin of jammer and Thummer===
The [[jammer keyboard]] was invented by [[Jim Plamondon]] in September 2003, whereupon he founded Thumtronics to design its "Thummer(tm)-brand jammer" and bring it to market, the trade name was to emphasize the unique thumb-control feature. Prototype Thummers were produced, but the effort to commercialize them failed, and Thumtronics was disbanded in mid-2009.

However the concepts developed and publicized by the company are still being developed by alternate-keyboard enthusiasts.

==="Jammer" versus the "Thummer" name===
Just as [[Kleenex]](tm) is a trademarked brand of [[facial tissue]], and the [[Stratocaster]](tm) is a [[trademark]]ed [[brand]] of [[electric guitar]], the ''Thummer'' was intended to be a trademarked brand of "a new kind of musical instrument." The term ''jammer'' was introduced to give that "new kind of musical instrument" a generic, non-trademarked name.

===Design Goals===
Thumtronics' design goals for the Thummer, which continue to influence the independent development of jammers, were the 7 "E"s:

# Easy: Facilitate the rapid acquisition of a self-sustaining level of musical competence in both composition and performance.
# Expressive: Offer more [[expressive potential (electronic music)|expressive potential]] than most musical instruments.
# Ergonomic: Place significantly less stress on its player's body than the average traditional musical instrument.
# Ergonomic: Place the keys and other controls within easy, fast reach.
# Expansive: Expand the frontiers of music-making, by (a) providing a single interface for the performance of the music of all known past and present human cultures, and (b) enabling the exploration and control of new tonalities (via effects such as Dynamic tonality).
# Everywhere: Be sufficiently portable to go everywhere, from concert hall to campfire.
# Everyone: Affordable (once in high-volume production) by people living at the First World's poverty level.

# At least one thumb-operated expressive control (such as the thumb-operated joysticks found on [[Gamepad#Seventh Generation|seventh-generation video game controllers]]).
# Optionally, other expressive controls, such as internal motion-sensors (such as those found in the [[Wii Remote]] video game controller), foot-pedals, breath controllers, etc.

== Advantages over a standard keyboard ==
The Thummer was intended to have these advantages over a piano-style keyboard
{| class="wikitable"
! Advantage !! Reason
|- style="vertical-align:top"
|Simple to learn ||Music intervals are mapped to the same vector: a consistent angle and spacing
|-style="vertical-align:top"
|Easy to play ||only one fingering needs be learned, instead of the 24 (12 for each hand) needed for the standard keyboard
|-style="vertical-align:top"
|Fast to play||The average distance the fingers need to move is reduced by a factor of 10 or more: 
* from centimeters to millimeters for a I-IV-V7-I chord progression,
* from decimeters  to centimeters for an octave shift
|-style="vertical-align:top"
| Greater musical intervals can be played by each hand at once || 2 octave rage in normal hand position using 4 fingers, 3-4 octaves if the thumb is used
|-style="vertical-align:top"
| More notes can be played ||due to the ability to play several [[consonant]] notes at once.
|-style="vertical-align:top"
| example ||a 9th, 10th 12th and 15th chord can be played easily with the hand in normal position
* up to a four-octave span can be played by turning the hand sideways
* 1-3 consonant keys may be played by a fingertip.
|-style="vertical-align:top"
|multiple concordant notes can be played with one finger||consonant notes are placed adjacent to each other
|-style="vertical-align:top"
| Variety of novel glissandos || a glissando of fourths, fifths and major seconds are easily played
|-style="vertical-align:top"
| Separate expressiveness controls for each hand 
| Allows twice the choice of expressive options, e.g. [[Sustain pedal]]
|-style="vertical-align:top"
| Capable of more sounds than a traditional keyboard||has two keyboards which each can be assigned to a separate instrument
* has controls providing more degrees of freedom than a traditional keyboard instrument, so in principle can offer greater expressiveness
* places notes in a pattern that matches the natural harmonics.
|-style="vertical-align:top"
|separate keys for flat and sharp notes||this unique feature allows more accurate, [[just tuning]] of the notes of the keyboard, as well as a host of tuning options, such as the [[Bohlen–Pierce scale]]
|-style="vertical-align:top"
|Lightweight and portable||smaller and lighter than a guitar
|-
|}

== Limitations and disadvantages over a standard keyboard ==

* The distance between chromatic intervals is greater
* Not all chord inversions are easy to finger
* Some reviewers believe chromatic scales are harder to play
* Harder to learn than the piano in C major
* No teachers or body of pedagogy
* Fingering techniques are still being developed
* No formal theory of play has been developed, although one is under development, and related to standard jazz "jamming" techniques.
* High cost of hexagonal keyboards relative to the standard keyboard (given current sales volumes)

=== Design Rationale ===
Of the large number of [[Isomorphic keyboard|isomorphic]] note assignments possible, the Thummer's Wicki-Hayden format was chosen since all notes of the major and minor scales fall under the fingers and the relative simplicity of relating it to conventional music notation.
[[File:Jammer Basic fingering.png|thumb|Standard fingering position. Note the small travel distance to many notes.]]
All chords found in conventional chord progressions (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi and viii, as well as others), in most inversions, can be easily played in the jammer arrangement with minimal hand movement.

This layout also places the octaves ascending vertically, increasing the notes playable at once, easing chord inversions and greatly reducing the time needed to move to a new note.

==Ergonomic Factors==
No one became expert on a Thummer, however [[Fitts law]] {link} predicts that the jammer will be very significantly faster to play that a conventional keyboard.
The expected playing speed is (log base 2 (30% smaller key / ~1000% distance decrease), or about 75% less to time find and press an average key.

==Commercially available==
Some isomorphic keyboards are commercially available, including:
* [http://www.c-thru-music.com/cgi/?page=prod_axis-64 AXIS-64], uses the [http://www.c-thru-music.com/cgi/?page=layout Harmonic Table] note-layout
* The Stagi Hayden Duet Concertina uses the [http://www.concertina.com/gaskins/wicki Wicki-Hayden] note-layout (known as the 'Hayden' layout by concertina players), it may only be available second-hand.

==Software==
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090125094835/http://www.wicki.org.uk/ Wicki.org.uk], free UK site containing  Java, Flash, and PC applications to enable users to play their alpha-numeric keyboard to sound 12 equal tempered pitches using Wicki/Hayden or [[Jankó keyboard]] layout.

The '''UWF Television Championship''', promoted by the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (United States)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], started out as the '''Mid-South Television Championship''' in 1984 and was then represented by a medal. It was renamed when Mid-South Wrestling changed its name to the UWF in 1986 and the title medal was replaced by a belt. The TV title was the mid-level wrestlers' title during its existence.  The title's final appearance was during Nikita Koloff's interview on the November 28, 1987 edition of World Championship Wrestling, with Koloff then declaring the NWA TV Title was the only TV Title.

'''Winter guard''' is an indoor [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]] sport derived from military ceremonies or veterans organizations ceremonies. Unlike traditional [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]], Winter Guard is performed indoors, usually in a gymnasium or an indoor arena. Performances make use of recorded music rather than a live band or orchestra. Winter guard was invented in the United States, which remains the predominant scene for the sport.

Winter Guard ensembles commonly perform at judged competitions officiated by local and regional associations using criteria developed by [[Winter Guard International]]. In most states, they have a cadet guard and high school guard.

==Team roles==

A Winter Guard generally consists of performing members under the direction of an instructional staff. The staff of a winter guard team ("the guard") are drawn from many different specialties, which sometimes overlap: there are equipment instructors (sometimes one for the unit, sometimes broken out into the individual sections), dance instructors, and drill instructors. The equipment instructors create the choreography performed with equipment and teach it to the guard. The dance instructors create and teach the movement [[choreography]] in the show. The drill instructors focus on the position of the guard members relative to one another and to the boundaries of the performance area, in addition to where each member goes at which specific time during the performance. In some cases, all of these roles are fulfilled by one sole director.

A winter guard team usually has a captain, who is one of the performing members who leads and represents the guard. The captain may assume minor administrative duties and lead the team when instructors are not available. The captain is also the representative of the guard during awards ceremonies or retreat.

The number of members on a winter guard team varies widely from five to approximately 45.

==Performance conventions==

The duration of winter guard shows depends on the class in which the guard is performing. In competition settings, each winter guard team is allotted a set amount of time to set up staging (including a vinyl floor if the guard is using one, and any props associated with the performance), place all equipment, perform the show, and remove staging, props, and equipment. Setup and tear-down typically run two minutes each, and performances run around five minutes. Judges impose penalties on teams that run past the allotted time.

Unlike traditional [[Color guard (flag spinning)]] teams, which perform outdoors on a football field or parade route accompanied by a [[marching band]] or [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum corps]], winter guard teams perform indoors to recorded music.

In competitions, winter guard teams are judged in the areas of talent, precision, creativity, and horizontal orchestration (how all the elements create the larger picture/effect). Performances incorporate equipment, props, and dance moves.

Judges must keep a running commentary on a tape recorder or digital recorder. The judges record the score on a designated sheet to be reviewed by the individual guard instructor(s). After every one in a class has competed and their scores have been tallied, if the instructor(s) so choose they may meet with all the judges to discuss in depth why they received the score they did, ways to improve, what they are doing right etc. The goal of all parties involved, is to have the performers, staff, and the programs grow and learn.

==Equipment==

Three primary types of equipment are used in winter guard: flags, rifles, and sabres (other items can be used to demonstrate artistic effects.) Such equipment is used in shows to demonstrate a team's technical ability. Rubber tape, such as electrical tape, is often used to cover the equipment and give it a uniform appearance and protect it from damage during the activity.

===Flags===

The most fundamental piece of equipment in color guard or winter guard shows is the flag. While winter guard flags take many different sizes and shapes, a standard size is a six-foot pole (metal) with a Three-foot "silk", often of a custom design. Smaller flags called "swing flags" are shortened poles with large silks connected to them. These poles are often plastic so they move more fluidly. These flags are often incorporated into the artistic element of the performance, even though they are not practical for tossing or spinning, due to the weight and length of the silk. Other flags may range from 5 feet to 7 feet depending upon the intended effect of the piece of equipment. Longer flags are not practical to spin or toss but generally serve as holders for large pieces of material.

===Rifles===

Shaped similar to actual [[rifle|rifles]], the rifles used in winter guard are made of solid or hollowed-out lightweight wood and weigh 2&amp;ndash;5 pounds (about 1&amp;ndash;2.25 kilograms). Most winter guard rifles have a length of 30&amp;ndash;39 inches (about 76&amp;ndash;99 centimeters) and are composed of seven parts:
# The '''neck''' of the rifle. The neck is where the trigger would be on a firearm rifle. Right-handed drop-spins are performed using the neck of the rifle as the axis for the spin, and the neck is also used in common tosses.
# The '''bolt''' is a long silver or black strip of metal or plastic connected to the body of the rifle by screws, made to look like the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] on a firearm.
# The '''body''' of the rifle is the middle section and the majority of the mass of the rifle.
# The '''strap''', a long [[leather]] strap that reaches from the butt end of the rifle to about two-thirds of the way to the nose of the rifle. The strap has functional and visual purposes, and it is also used to produce a snapping sound. The strap is similar to a firearm's sling.
# The '''swivel''' or '''clip''' is the metal piece that attaches the strap to the body of the rifle. This is the most common location for left-hand placement when executing a regular left-handed toss.
# The final part of the rifle is the '''butt''', the heavier, back end of the rifle.
# The "tip" is at the end of the thin, long part of the rifle and is located on the opposite side of where the "butt" is.

Rifles can be made out of both [[wood]] and [[plastic]]. Some people prefer plastic because they are all the same weight and size, unless you order a bigger or smaller one. Others prefer wood because they're heavier and more durable. They are all exactly the same. Some people prefer wood because it is less slick and they can weight it the way they want to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/.|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plastic Rifles ====
Usually rookies, people new to color guard, will use plastic rifles. They tend to be a little more forgiving and easier to handle. Some people may not like plastic rifles because they can become slick and hard to handle, either when its raining or just from the sweat from the users hands. Some plastic rifles come with a manufacture guarantee that they will not break under normal usage. Because most are made out of a material called [[polyethylene]], this makes the rifle sturdy and harder to break. The material can also be colored so that different teams can use different colored rifles. Sometimes, though, the material can warp after several bad drops which can lead to a bad spin while the rifle is in the air. Plastic rifles may also start to smell after prolonged use, some say that after a long time it will tend to smell like sweat because of the performers hands. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/.|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wooden Rifles ====
Wooden rifles can be hard to use because they are all slightly different and may not be weighted the same, this is why people that are more familiar with rifles use them and not usually rookies. Most wooden rifles are made of either [[Populus|poplar]] or [[aspen]] wood. It is recommended to tape wooden rifles as to keep the ends protected and make it more durable, the tape can also be used for cosmetics. [[Electrical tape]] is the first choice of most winter guards because you can get the tape in whatever color is desired to match the show. Water is the main antagonist to wooden rifles, it can destroy a rifle and make it completely not usable, but if cared for properly and used correctly they can last for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sabres===

[[Sabre]]s are elegant pieces of equipment used in winter guard. The length of sabres can range from about 30&amp;ndash;39 inches (about 76&amp;ndash;99 centimeters). They can either be plastic, metal, or plastic covered metal- though metal is more commonly used. Some metal sabres on the market are intricately decorated with engravings or etchings along the blade.  These more intricately designed sabres tend to be more expensive.

Sabres have two main parts: the blade and the hilt. The blade has a pointed but dull end, and the length of the blade is dull as well. Some winter guard team members wrap their sabres in electrical tape, as they do with rifles. As with rifles, a piece of black or non-white tape placed near the center of rotation is used as a "spotter", making it easier to locate the fast-moving blade while it is rotating in the air. Sabres are used primarily by more advanced guard members.

==Dance==

[[File:Winter Guard Preview Show 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|2012 Winter Guard Preview Show]]Guard members incorporate many different styles of dance into their shows. The most common styles of dance used are modern, contemporary, lyrical, jazz, and ballet. The different styles of dance are chosen depending on the different types of music chosen and the themes of the shows.  Dance is usually incorporated into the equipment work, and is performed seamlessly throughout the show.

==Winter Guard International==

[[Winter Guard International]] is not only a national competition but it is also an organization that has been around for many years. Unlike other traditional sports the rules and regulations have been changed and altered many times since the activity has started. There are judges who judge separate elements of a show – such as general effect, movement, equipment, and penalty points – and score the groups accordingly.

Because this activity not only exists in the United States but all around the world, major competitions worldwide are sanctioned and managed by Winter Guard International. This is the governing organization that makes and changes the rules and regulations for this activity. The rules that are written by WGI apply to every Winter Guard group competing in the World Championships no matter what country they are from. The World Championships are held every year in the United States. Most recently they have been held at the [[UD Arena|
University of Dayton Arena]] in Dayton, Ohio with some prelims and semi-finals held elsewhere around the Dayton area and Cincinnati area.

The phrase "Sport of the Arts" is frequently associated with WGI. Winter guard is described by saying "it brings music to life through performance in a competitive format."

==Divisions and classes==

Because not every color guard has the same skill level, population, or resources available, WGI uses a class division system to help remedy this.  There are two divisions, '''Scholastic''' and '''Independent'''.  These divisions include the classes (in descending order) Independent: Independent World Class, Independent Open Class, Independent A Class. Scholastic: Scholastic World,  Scholastic Open, Scholastic National A Class, Scholastic Regional A, AA, and AAA. Novice Class and Cadet Class.

Guard teams can be chosen to move to a higher class, but they can only move down a class after a period of inactivity or after a WGI review. For every competition, any team which achieves a score higher than a predetermined threshold is automatically moved up, or "bumped", to the class above its current position, even mid-season.

The '''Scholastic division''' is made up of guards that have members that all attend the same high school or a feeder school of that high school. There are many colleges and universities that sponsor their own winter guards as well, but these guards typically compete as Independent guards. Scholastic guards vary greatly in their ability and resources because they are more dependent on support from sources other than the members themselves, such as their school's band and school funding.

In the Scholastic division, there are three classes: '''Scholastic A''', '''Scholastic Open''', and '''Scholastic World'''. More divisions may exist at the local/regional level, such as Regional A, or Novice. In many places there is also a middle school class, often called '''Cadet'''. Scholastic A teams tend to be a step above the regional level and are the lowest level to compete in WGI. Scholastic Open teams are an intermediate level for competition. The Scholastic World division includes the highest caliber of winter guard teams.

The '''Independent division''' is composed of winter guard teams that do not associate themselves with a school (the exception being university teams). Additionally, these kinds of guards can be much more selective of their members, choosing to be gender-specific or to only have certain numbers of members.

In the Independent division, much like the Scholastic division, there are the three classes: '''Independent A''', '''Independent Open''' and '''Independent World'''.  The breakdown of skill level and placement mirrors that of the Scholastic division. There are age restrictions in the Independent A and Open classes. A member can perform with an Independent A class group if they are 22 or younger as of March 31 of that year. A member can perform with an Independent Open class group if they are 23 or younger as of March 31 of that year.

==Winter guard circuits==

Although the goal of many winter guards is to compete in the WGI World Championships, most guard competitions take place in regional winter guard circuits. One such circuit is the AIA circuit, or Atlantic Indoor Association circuit in which teams across Virginia, Washington D.C., and North Carolina participate. These circuits are loosely organized and may not be formally affiliated with WGI. In many cases the circuits predate WGI by a number of years. For example, the Midwest Color Guard Circuit celebrated their 50th anniversary season in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midwestcolorguard.com/ MidWest Color Guard Circuit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They may also have different competitive structures with additional classes to those in WGI. Circuit classes often will include beginner or novice guards such as '''Cadet''', '''Novice''', '''B''', '''Regional AAA''',  '''Regional AA''', '''Regional A''', and '''Regional Open'''. Circuits generally score using WGI standards and judges whether they are formally affiliated with WGI or not.

In addition, the winter guard activity is growing outside of the United States. In Europe, Color Guard Nederland (Netherlands) (CGN) and Winter Guard United Kingdom (WGUK) have recently affiliated with organizations from France and Germany to form the [[European Indoor Arts Alliance]] (EIAA) with the goal of creating a European Union-wide platform for the growth of the color guard activity in Europe, where the scholastic branch of the activity does not exist.
