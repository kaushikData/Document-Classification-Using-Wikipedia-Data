'''(7888) 1993 UC''' is a [[near-Earth object|near-Earth]] [[minor planet]] in the [[list of Apollo asteroids|Apollo group]].&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;  It was discovered by [[Robert H. McNaught]] at the [[Siding Spring Observatory]] in [[Coonabarabran, New South Wales]], Australia, on October 20, 1993.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; The asteroid has an observation arc of 23 years and has a well determined orbit.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; Its estimated size is 2.3 to 5.2&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/close.html "NEO Earth Close Approach Tables"],  Retrieved on 21 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2013, the asteroid passed 49 [[lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] or {{convert|0.12598|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth at a relative velocity of {{convert|21.8|km/s|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; The approach posed no threat to Earth.  (7888) 1993 UC is not classified as a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] (PHA) because its Earth MOID ([[Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance]]) is only 0.089 AU,&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; and only objects with an Earth MOID less than 0.05 AU are considered PHAs.&lt;ref&gt;NASA/JPL [http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#pha "NEO Program FAQ"],  Retrieved on 21 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was discovered to be a [[binary asteroid]] by [[Arecibo Observatory]] in March 2013.&lt;ref name="Binary"/&gt;

On April 29, 2146, the asteroid will pass {{convert|0.0346|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from asteroid [[4 Vesta]].&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;

'''{{mp|2004 FU|162}}''' is a subkilometer-sized [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Aten asteroid|Aten group]].

It has only been observed once, on 31 March 2004, by the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR) team at [[Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site]] in Socorro, New Mexico, and remains a [[lost asteroid]] as of 2017.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-obj" /&gt; The estimated 4 to 6 meter sized body has made one of the [[List of asteroid close approaches to Earth|closest known approaches]] to Earth.

== Description ==

On 31 March 2004, at 15:35 [[UTC]], it passed within approximately 1 [[Earth radius]] ({{Earth radius}}) or 6,400 kilometers of the surface of the Earth (or 2.02&amp;nbsp;{{Earth radius}} from its center). By comparison, [[geostationary]] satellites orbit at 5.6 {{Earth radius}} and [[GPS]] satellites orbit at 3.17 {{Earth radius}} from the center of the Earth.

{{As of|2008}} this is the [[List of notable asteroids#Record-setting close approaches to Earth|third or fourth closest approach]].&lt;!-- 1972 grazer was at 57 km, 1990 grazer was about 100km, possible 2006 grazer altitude not available --&gt; The first observation of {{mp|2004 FU|162}} was not announced until 22 August 2004.

It was only observed four times in the space of 44 minutes and could not be followed up. Nevertheless, "the orbit is quite determinate and, given the exceptional nature of this close approach, the object is now receiving a designation".&lt;ref name="hohm"/&gt; No [[precovery]] images have been found.

{{mp|2004 FU|162}} is estimated to be only 6 meters in diameter.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  This means that it would burn up from [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric friction]] before striking the ground in the case of an Earth [[impact event|impact]].

On 26 March 2010, it may have come within 0.0825&amp;nbsp;AU (12.3 million km) of Earth,&lt;ref name=horizons /&gt; but with an [[Uncertainty Parameter U|uncertainty parameter]] of 9,&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; the orbit is poorly determined.

Another, larger near-Earth asteroid, [[2004 FH]] passed just two weeks prior to {{mp|2004 FU|162}}.

The '''Arctic realm''' is one of the planet's twelve [[marine realm]]s, as designated by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[Nature Conservancy]]. It includes the coastal regions and [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] of the [[Arctic Ocean]] and adjacent seas, including the [[Arctic Archipelago]], [[Hudson Bay]], and the [[Labrador Sea]] of northern [[Canada]], the seas surrounding [[Greenland]], the northern and eastern coasts of [[Iceland]], and the eastern [[Bering Sea]].

The Arctic realm transitions to the Temperate Northern Atlantic realm in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Basin]], and the [[Temperate Northern Pacific]] realm in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific Basin]].

==Ecoregions==
The Arctic realm is further subdivided into 19 [[marine ecoregion]]s:

*[[Greenland|North Greenland]]
*[[North and East Iceland]]
*[[East Greenland Shelf]]
*[[West Greenland Shelf]]
*[[Northern Grand Banks-Southern Labrador]]
*[[Northern Labrador]]
*[[Baffin Bay-Davis Strait]]
*[[Hudson Complex]]
*[[Lancaster Sound]]
*[[High Arctic Archipelago]]
*[[Beaufort-Admunsen-Viscount Melville-Queen Maud]]
*[[Beaufort Sea-continental coast and shelf]]
*[[Chukchi Sea]]
*[[Eastern Bering Sea]]
*[[East Siberian Sea]]
*[[Laptev Sea]]
*[[Kara Sea]]
*[[North and East Barents Sea]]

The '''Barents Sea Opening (BSO)''' is an [[oceanographic]] term for the Western [[Barents Sea]], the sea area between [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] in the south of [[Svalbard]] and the northern extremity of [[Norway]] through which a [[water mass]] of [[Atlantic]] origin flows into the [[Arctic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=AtlanticHeat&gt;{{cite journal|last=Årthun|first=M.|author2=Eldevik, T.|author3= Smedsrud, L. H.|author4= Skagseth, Ø.|author5= Ingvaldsen, R. B.|title=Quantifying the Influence of Atlantic Heat on Barents Sea Ice Variability and Retreat*|journal=Journal of Climate|date=1 July 2012|volume=25|issue=13|pages=4736–4743|doi=10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00466.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inflow of relative warm water into the [[Arctic Ocean]] occurs not only through the Barents Sea Opening, but also through [[Fram Strait]] which is much deeper. The [[internal energy]] entering the colder waters has an influence on the [[atmosphere]] and the [[sea ice]] above and therefore possibly on the global [[climate]].

==Oceanographic measurements==
The [[Norwegian Polar Institute]] performs about six
[[hydrography|hydrographic]] survey per year across the Barents Sea Opening from {{coord|71.58|N|20|E}} to {{coord|73.58|N|20|E}} since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingvaldsen|first=Randi B.|title=Velocity field of the western entrance to the Barents Sea|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=1 January 2004|volume=109|issue=C3|doi=10.1029/2003JC001811}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A set of [[Current meter|oceanographic current meters]] captures the seasonal cycle of the inflow since 1997. Roughly every 30 [[Nautical mile|nm]] two instruments are deployed, one at 50 [[m]] depth, and another 15 [[m]] above the [[sea floor]].

'''Cave-Shrine of Chinguaro''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[church architecture|church]] and [[cave church|cave]] located in [[Güímar]] on [[Tenerife]] ([[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]]). It was the traditional [[palace]] of the [[Guanches|Guanche]] King of the [[Menceyato de Güímar]], [[Acaimo]].

In this cave, the ancient Guanches worshiped the [[Virgin of Candelaria]] (Patron Saint of the Canary Islands) as the goddess [[Chaxiraxi]] of their [[Traditional Berber religion|traditional faith]]. This [[deity]] was worshiped in the Canary Islands until the [[Crown of Castille|Castillian]] [[conquest of the Canary Islands|conquest]] of the archipelago. The icon was later identified with the [[Virgin Mary]] and was moved by the Guanches themselves to the [[Cave of Achbinico]] in [[Candelaria, Tenerife|Candelaria]]. This cave was the first [[Christian shrines|shrine]] devoted to the Virgin of Candelaria, and the first aboriginal Guanche shrine to contain a [[Christianity|Christian]] idol in the Canary Islands. However, the Guanches at the time still generally adhered to their traditional religion.

The cave is also a place of great archaeological importance.

{{Infobox Observatory}}
The '''Chilbolton Observatory''' is a facility for atmospheric and radio research located on the edge of the village of [[Chilbolton]] near [[Stockbridge, Hampshire|Stockbridge]] in [[Hampshire]], England.  The facilities are run by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]] Radio Communications Research Unit of the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] and form part of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]].

== Overview ==

The Chilbolton Observatory operates many pieces of research equipment associated with [[radar]] propagation and [[meteorology]]. {{As of|2007}}, these include [http://www.chilbolton.rl.ac.uk/facilities.htm]:
* An [[S band]] Doppler [[weather radar]] with its distinctive, fully steerable, 25 metre parabolic antenna. This equipment can be referred to as '''CAMRa''' ('''Chilbolton Advanced Meteorological Radar''').
* An [[L band]] Clear-air radar
* A [[W band]] bistatic zenith radar
* A [[UV]] [[Raman scattering|Raman]] [[Lidar]]
* Multiple [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]] radiometers
* Multiple [[rain gauge]]s

The observatory also hosts the UK's [[LOFAR]] station.

== Timeline of projects ==

* 1998 - CLARE'98 Cloud Lidar and Radar experiment [https://web.archive.org/web/20061009093137/http://www.chilbolton.rl.ac.uk/clare.htm], which eventually fed into the [[European Space Agency]] EarthCARE programme [http://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPearthcare.html]
* 2001 to 2004 - CLOUDMAP2 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060510202214/http://www.cloudmap2.rl.ac.uk/] project to assist in [[Numerical weather prediction]] models
* 2006 - Chilbolton Observatory joined forces with several European Space Agency sites to verify the L band radio transmissions from the [[GIOVE-A]] satellite [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM21VMVGJE_Improving_0.html]
* 2006 - [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Cirrus and Anvils: European Satellite and Airborne Radiation measurements project
* 2008 - In-Orbit Test (IOT) performed for GIOVE-B
* 2008-9 - APPRAISE [https://web.archive.org/web/20090625103936/http://ncasweb.leeds.ac.uk/appraise/], during which the CAMRa and Lidar were used to direct airborne measurements in mixed-phase clouds
* 2010 - [[LOFAR]] station UK608 constructed

== History ==
[[File:Equipment rooms at Chilbolton Observatory - geograph.org.uk - 811894.jpg|thumb|right|The equipment rooms at the Observatory]]
Construction of Chilbolton Observatory started in 1963. It was built partially on the site of [[RAF Chilbolton]], which was decommissioned in 1946. Several sites around the south-east of England were considered for the construction. The site at Chilbolton, on the edge of [[Salisbury Plain]], was chosen in part because of excellent visibility of the horizon and its relative remoteness from major roads whose cars could cause interference.

The facility was opened in April 1967. Within several months of being commissioned the [[azimuth]] bearing of the antenna suffered a catastrophic failure. [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] were contracted to repair the bearing and devised a system to replace the failed part while leaving the 400 [[tonne]] dish ostensibly in-place.

Originally, the antenna was engaged in [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] [[radio astronomy]], but now operates as a S and L band radar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3034">A '''closure''' experiment in atmospheric science is a combination of different measurement techniques to describe the current state of the investigated system as fully as possible, and to find inaccuracies in one or some of the methods involved. The comparison of different types of measurement often involves model calculations, which may also be tested in this process.

A common example for closure experiments are [[aerosol]] studies. Aerosols can be studied from space, from aircraft, and from the surface. The different properties of aerosols (chemical composition, particle size, particle number concentration, optical absorptivity, thermal emissivity, index of refraction, pattern of light scattering, etc.) require very different kinds of measurement techniques. Different instruments have been developed to perform each technique, and researchers usually specialize in one or a few of them. Due to the logistic efforts required to bring different groups of researchers with different measurement techniques together, such experiments stand out among routine experiments that are more focused on one or a few techniques and have fewer participants.

An aerosol closure experiment might look like this:
* Individual aerosol particles are sampled, and their size and shape are determined under an electron microscope;
* A [[lidar]] emits a laser beam into the aerosol plume and detects the backscatter signal;
* An aerosol flow is led through optical detectors that record the size distribution of the particles;
* The sunlight attenuated by the aerosol is measured by a [[sun photometer]], yielding the [[optical depth]] of the aerosol layer;
* the spectral [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of sunlight, as well as the [[scattering]] properties of the aerosol are measured by spectrometers;
* The extent and total reflectivity of the aerosol plume are observed by a satellite radiometer.

Additionally, measurements can be performed within the plume or outside, by means of [[remote sensing]], from the surface, from aircraft, and from satellites in space. Different viewing geometries again introduce complexity, which can be assessed in closure experiments.

Algorithms exist, for example, to predict the optical properties from a given particle shape, size distribution, and index of refraction. Closure is achieved if the predictions of such an algorithm agree (within the limits of measurement uncertainty) with the optical properties that have been derived from the independent radiation measurements; if the lidar information about the vertical distribution of the aerosol sums up to the total optical depth determined by the sun photometer; etc.

Although a comparatively unusual type of volcano, they are widespread in the world and in geologic history. [[metamorphism|Metamorphosed]] ash flow [[tuff]]s are widespread in the [[Precambrian]] rocks of northern [[New Mexico]], which indicates that caldera complexes have been important for much of Earth's history. [[Yellowstone National Park]] is on three partly covered caldera complexes. The [[Long Valley Caldera]] in eastern [[California]] is also a complex volcano; the [[San Juan Mountains]] in southwestern [[Colorado]] are formed on a group of [[Neogene]]-age caldera complexes, and most of the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] rocks of [[Nevada]], [[Idaho]], and eastern California are also caldera complexes and their erupted ash flow tuffs. The [[Bennett Lake Caldera]] in [[British Columbia]] and the [[Yukon Territory]] is another example of a Cenozoic ([[Eocene]]) caldera complex.

[[File:SevenlakesAlaska.JPG|thumb|Taiga forest in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge]]
The '''Cook Inlet taiga''' [[ecoregion]], in the [[taiga|Taiga and Boreal forests]] [[Biome]], is located in [[Alaska]].

==Setting==
This ecoregion is located around the upper [[Cook Inlet]] on the south-central coast of Alaska, sheltered by mountains on all sides. This coast has a gentle landscape and a relatively mild climate for Alaska with 380&amp;ndash;680&amp;nbsp;mm of rainfall per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0603|name=Cook Inlet taiga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The plant life here is varied for Alaska, a mixture of conifers and other trees, shrubs and herbs, with the dominant trees being black spruce ''([[Picea mariana]])'', white spruce ''([[Picea glauca]])'', the large Sitka spruce ''([[Picea sitchensis]])'', quaking aspen ''([[Populus tremuloides]])'', balsam poplar ''([[Populus balsamifera]])'', black cottonwood ''([[Populus trichocarpa]])'' and paper birch ''([[Betula papyrifera]])''. The spruce forest is regularly renewed following severe damage by [[spruce bark beetle]] infestations.

==Fauna==
This area is rich in wildlife including [[grey wolf|grey wolves]], bears and [[Canada lynx]]. The [[Kenai River]] is home to five species of [[Pacific salmon]] including the largest [[chinook salmon]] in the world. Birds include large numbers of [[bald eagle]]s and wintering [[snow goose|snow geese]] from [[Wrangell Island]] who gather in the mouth of the Kenai River before their spring migration.

==Threats and preservation==
[[File:WaterlilliesKNWR.jpg|thumb|pond with water lilies bordered by spruce forest, Kenai NWR]]
The Kenai River, [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]] areas are the most populated part of Alaska and a base for logging and the oil and gas industries on the [[Kenai Peninsula]]. There is also some clearance for farming in Palmer and [[Point MacKenzie, Alaska|Point MacKenzie]]. Nonetheless natural habitats remain very well preserved although wildlife of the Kenai Peninsula has become isolated from that of the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]] and the west side of Cook Inlet, and therefore from the rest of Alaska. Protected areas include  [[Kenai National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Chugach State Park]], [[Nancy Lake State Recreation Area]] and the [[Susitna Flats State Game Refuge|Susitna Flats]].

'''Diamond willow''' is a type of tree with wood that is deformed into diamond-shaped segments with alternating colors. This is most likely the result of attack by a [[fungus]] (''[[Valsa sordida]]'' and possibly others), which causes [[canker]]s to form in the wood in response to the infection.&lt;ref name=lutz&gt;H.J. Lutz, "Observation on 'diamond willow,' with Particular Reference to Its Occurrence in Alaska", The American Midland Naturalist 60(1):176-185, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond willow is prized by [[wood carver]]s and [[furniture]] makers for its strong contrasting colors (red and white) and its sculptural irregularity of shape. 

There are at least six different [[species]] that have been identified as being susceptible to diamonding, including ''[[Salix bebbiana]]'', the most common diamond willow,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/salbeb/all.html US Forest Service: ''S. bebbiana'']&lt;/ref&gt; plus ''[[Salix pseudomonticola|S. pseudomonticola]]'', ''[[Salix arbusculoides|S. arbusculoides]]'', ''[[Salix discolor|S. discolor]]'', ''[[Salix scouleriana|S. scouleriana]]'', and ''[[Salix alaxensis|S. alaxensis]]''. 

The diamonding is usually found with a [[branch]] at its center or is found in the Y of a tree. Diamonding in willow does not seem to be specific to an area that willows grow in, and where one bunch of willow will have diamonds, the next clump of willows may have none at all. Although diamond willow is often thought of as being a northern phenomenon, of the [[boreal forest]], there is mention of diamond willow growing as far south as [[Missouri]].

== Diamond formation and shape ==
The tree grows diamond-shaped cankers in response to the fungus. The cankers seem to result from the tree growing away from the site of attack. This usually happens at the crotch of a branch on a larger branch or main [[Plant stem|stem]]. If the branch is relatively small it seems to die very quickly. If the branch is larger, it may continue to grow and the diamond is formed on the branch and the stem. By growing away from the fungus, new layers of growth occur further and further away from the site of the fungal attack. Thus the affected area gets larger and deeper. If the tree has been affected in several places close together, then the diamonds run into each other. This can result in pronounced ridges if some [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] continues to survive, or it may strangle the small ridge of sapwood, which then dies. 

The shape of the diamonds seems to vary from one clump of willow to the next, although there may be some general tendencies within a single species. Some stems will form long narrow diamonds; others will be short and wide. Usually all the diamonds on the stems in one clump will have similar growth patterns. If the new layers of sapwood do not move back very much each year, then the diamonds will be deep bowl- or cleft-shaped. These stems will be able to survive longer than those whose diamonds are flat 

The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] that is left overtop of the diamond changes quite markedly from the bark over the living sapwood. Depending on the species of willow, the living bark is usually smoother and slightly lighter in color. The bark over the diamond usually becomes rougher and somewhat darker. It also becomes tougher and adheres much more to the underlying wood. The sapwood is white to cream in color—again depending on the species, but also on the location. The heartwood is reddish brown. This color tends to darken with exposure to light over a number of years.

If one stem in a clump of willow is affected, then all of them are likely to be. However, the neighboring clump may be completely without diamonds. [[Quaking Aspen]] (''[[Populus tremuloides]]'') has been known to bear depressions that resemble diamonding.&lt;ref name=lutz/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2813">'''''Dušni Brav''''' ({{lang-sr|{{lang|sr|душни брав}}}}; "Soul Ram" (also referred to as ''Dušno'')) ; refers to a practice of [[Christianized]] [[animal sacrifice]]s amongst the [[Serbian Orthodox]]. It involves the ritualistic slaughter of a [[domestic sheep|lamb]] for a funeral feast (''Daća'').

It is believed that the sacrifice of the ''Dušni Brav'' is meant to pacify and appease the departed's soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Smiljana Djordjević|title=Dušno: Blood sacrifice in the posthumous customs of Colonist Serbs in Omoljica|work=Kurban in the Balkans|year=2007|location=Belgrade|publisher=Serbian Academy of Science and Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The practice involves the blood sacrifice of a sheep (душни брав, ''dušni brav'') to the soul of the deceased. The animal is slaughtered in the deceased's backyard or property, on the day of their [[funeral]] or on the 40-day and/or year anniversary (годишњица, "godišnjica") of their death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Smiljana Djordjević|title=Dušno: Blood sacrifice in the posthumous customs of Colonist Serbs in Omoljica|work=Kurban in the Balkans|year=2007|location=Belgrade|publisher=Serbian Academy of Science and Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheep must be the same gender as the deceased, and about the same age. No other animal but a white sheep may be sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.graduzice.org/userfiles/files/obicaji.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the sacrifice, a white cloth is put on top of the sacrificial sheep and a candle is lit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Nadko Nodilo|title=Religija Srba i Hrvata|work=Rad Jugoslovenske Akademije|year=1889|location=Zagreb|publisher= Jugoslavenska akademija znanosti i umjetnosti}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sacrifice, the sheep is roasted and prepared, and the white cloth is placed upon it again and it is served with [[Koliba]] at the Daća (funeral feast). Before eating the Dušni Brav it is proper etiquette to cross oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Smiljana Djordjević|title=Dušno: Blood sacrifice in the posthumous customs of Colonist Serbs in Omoljica|work=Kurban in the Balkans|year=2007|location=Belgrade|publisher=Serbian Academy of Science and Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''e-st@r-II''' ('''Educational Satellite @ Polytechnic University of Turin 2''') is a [[miniaturized satellite]] designed and built by [[Polytechnic University of Turin]], as part of the "Fly Your Satellite" program of the [[European Space Agency]].

==Launch and deployment== 
It is a  [[CubeSat]] satellite, placed in orbit by Arianespace with Soyuz Booster, VS14 flight, on April 25, 2016 at 21:02 GMT (23:02 CEST) from Europe's spaceport in [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]] . The main payload of the launch was [[Sentinel-1B]] from program [[Global Monitoring for Environment and Security|Copernicus]] and  [[MICROSCOPE (satellite)|Microscope]] designed by the CNES, the French space agency.

In addition to e-st@ r-II there was other two CubeSats 1U ([http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/aausat-3.htm AAUSAT 4], [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/oufti-1 .htm OUFTI 1]) they were packed aboard the Soyuz. These small satellites, each measuring just 10 × 10 × 11&amp;nbsp;cm in height, have been developed by teams of university students through ESA programs.

E-st@ r-II is the successor of [[e-st@r]], the first Italian CubeSat and the first Cubesat of the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]].

More than 30 students have been working on this project, with the unique opportunity of practical experience of space applications.

E-st@r-II is a 1U CubeSat developed for demonstrating the autonomous active attitude control capabilities based on magnetic actuation: in fact, the payload is an Active Attitude Determination and Control System. The commissioning phase foresees that the payload is deactivated leaving the satellite in its free tumbling motion, without any attitude stabilization. The A-ADCS starts its work when commanded from GCS, controlling the angular velocities and the attitude of the satellite.

The primary scientific objectives of e-st@r-II mission are:
* to demonstrate the capability of autonomous determination, control and manoeuver, through the development and test in orbit of an A-ADCS entirely designed and manufactured by students
* to test in orbit COTS technology and self-made hardware

E-st@r-II is a follow-on of e-st@r-I, the first Italian CubeSat and the first satellite of Politecnico di Torino to be inserted on orbit.
More than 30 students worked on this project, using a unique opportunity of hands-on experience on space applications.
It will demonstrate the ability of determining (with gyros and magnetometers) and actively controlling its attitude.
The bus functionalities, as a basis for other CubeSats, will be demonstrated: it is a step towards future missions and applications.

Once deployed into orbit, e-st@r-II will begin transmitting signals to Earth approximately 30 minutes after activation. Signals can be picked up by anyone with common amateur radio equipment. 
To celebrate the launch of this second CubeSat, e-st@r-II,  the  world amateur radio community  are invited in a contest to listen out for  satellite.

Currently the team that developed the satellite, the CubeSatTeam of Politecnico di Torino, is actively working on development of the  Next model:  3-STAR, a 3U CubeSat.

'''Eflatun Pınar''' ({{lang-tr|Eflatunpınar}}, "Plato's Spring") is the name given to a spring, which rises up from the ground, and the stone-built pool monument built at the time of the [[Hittite Empire]]. The spring lies inside the [[Lake Beyşehir National Park]], {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Konya]], and drains into [[Lake Beyşehir]] in central [[Anatolia]] at ancient [[Pisidia]] region. During the [[Late Bronze Age]], a sacred pool monument was built here in [[trachyte]] ashlar masonry dedicated to the sacred spring cult of ancient [[Hittites|Hittite]]s. The monument was interpreted as a shrine to [[Plato]] during the medieval (Seljuk) period.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Overview==
Eflatun Pınar's location near the lake shore corresponds to an almost exact level with other important ruins on the opposite shore, those of [[Kubadabad Palace]], which were built by [[Seljuk Sultanate of Anatolia|Seljuk]]s.

Eflatun Pınar was briefly examined by the [[University of Oxford]] archaeologist Dr. Lucia Nixon in her paper on [[Çatalhöyük]], and she makes use of [[F.W.Hasluck]]'s early-20th century work. The site remains largely unexplored to date.

The most important measure in the energy balance of Chad is the total consumption of 200.00 million kWh of electric energy per year. Per capita this is an average of 13 kWh. Chad can provide itself completely with self-produced energy. The total production of all electric energy producing facilities is 215 m kWh, also 108% of own requirements. The rest of the self-produced energy is either exported into other countries or unused. Along with pure consumptions the production, imports and exports play an important role. Other energy sources such as natural gas or crude oil are also used.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worlddata.info/africa/chad/energy-consumption.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Chad’s ability to achieve increased energy access and poverty reduction is constrained by significant challenges in the power sector. It currently only has about 125 MW of installed generation capacity to serve a population of 14.5 million people. As a result, Chad’s government is working to expand its electricity supply and encourage investment in the energy sector to stimulate the economy. Chad is endowed with the tenth-largest oil reserves in Africa, as well as wind and solar resource potential. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/chad&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enlil and Ninlil''' or the '''Myth of Enlil and Ninlil''' or '''Enlil and Ninlil: The begetting of Nanna''' is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[creation myth]], written on [[clay tablet]]s in the mid to late 3rd millennium [[Anno Domini|BC]].

==Compilation==

The first lines of the [[myth]] were discovered on the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], catalogue of the [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] section (CBS), tablet number 9205 from their excavations at the [[temple]] [[library]] at [[Nippur]]. This was translated by [[George Aaron Barton]] in 1918 and first published as ''"Sumerian religious texts"'' in ''"[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]"'', number seven, entitled "A Myth of [[Enlil]] and [[Ninlil]]".&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian inscriptions, p. 52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|year=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablet is {{convert|6.5|in|cm}} by {{convert|4.5|in|cm}} by {{convert|1.2|in|cm}} at its thickest point. Barton noted that [[Theophilus G. Pinches]] had published part of an equivalent [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] version of the same story in 1911, noting ''"The two texts in general agree closely, though there are minor variations here and there."''&lt;ref name="England)1908"&gt;{{cite book|author=Society of Biblical Archæology (London, England)|title=Theophilus G. Pinches in Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, Volume 33 f. 85|year=1911|publisher=The Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tablet from the same collection, number 13853 was used by [[Edward Chiera]] to restore part of the second column of Barton's tablet in ''"Sumerian Epics and Myths"'', number 77.&lt;ref name="Chiera1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Chiera|title=Sumerian epics and myths, 77, p. 5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEFCPgAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=1964|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] included CBS  tablets 8176, 8315, 10309, 10322, 10412, 13853, 29.13.574 and 29.15.611.

==Story==

The story opens with a description of the city of Nippur, its [[wall]]s, [[river]], [[canal]]s and [[water well|well]], portrayed as the home of the gods and, according to Kramer ''"that seems to be conceived as having existed before the creation of man."'' A.R. George suggests ''"According to a well-known tradition, represented by the myth of Enlil and Ninlil, time was when Nippur was a city inhabited by gods not men, and this would suggest that it had existed from the very beginning."'' He discusses Nippur as the "first city" ([[URU (city Sumerogram)|uru]]-sag, 'city-head(top)') of Sumer.&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. R. George|title=Babylonian topographical texts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zw0TQ1MrhOkC&amp;pg=PA442|accessdate=29 May 2011|year=1992|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=978-90-6831-410-6|pages=442–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conception of Nippur is echoed by Joan Goodnick Westenholz, describing the setting as "civitas dei", existing before the "[[axis mundi]]".&lt;ref name="BorrásBarcelona2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miguel Ángel Borrás|author2=Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona|title=Joan Goodnick Westenholz, The Foundation Myths of Mesopotamian Cities, Divine Planners and Human Builder in La fundación de la ciudad: mitos y ritos en el mundo antiguo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yPVFGPr0aoC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=29 May 2011|year=2000|publisher=Edicions UPC|isbn=978-84-8301-387-8|pages=48–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''"There was a city, there was a city -- the one we live in. Nibru (Nippur) was the city, the one we live in. Dur-jicnimbar was the city, the one we live in. [[Id-sala]] is its holy river, Kar-jectina is its quay. Kar-asar is its quay where boats make fast. Pu-lal is its freshwater well. [[Id-nunbir-tum]] is its branching canal, and if one measures from there, its cultivated land is 50 [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|sar]] each way. Enlil was one of its young men, and Ninlil was one its young women.''"&lt;ref name="ETCSL"&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.2.1&amp;charenc=j# Enlil and Ninlil., Black, J.A., Cunningham, G., Robson, E., and Zólyomi, G., The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, Oxford 1998-.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The story continues by introducing the goddess [[Nun-bar-ce-gunu]] warning her daughter Ninlil about the likelihood of romantic advances from Enlil if she strays too near the river. Ninlil resists Enlil's first approach after which he entreats his minister [[Nuska]] to take him across the river, on the other side the couple meet and float downstream, either bathing or in a boat, then lie on the bank together, kiss, and conceive [[Suen]]-Acimbabbar, the [[moon god]]. The story then cuts to Enlil walking in the [[Ekur]], where the other gods [[arrest]] him for his relationship with Ninlil and exile him from the city for being ritually impure.

As Enlil was going about in the [[ki (cuneiform)|Ki]]-ur, the fifty great gods and the seven gods who decide destinies had Enlil arrested in the [[ki (cuneiform)|Ki]]-ur. Enlil, ritually impure, leave the city! [[Nunamnir]], ritually impure, leave the city! Enlil, in accordance with what had been decided, Nunamnir, in accordance with what had been decided, Enlil went. Ninlil followed.''"&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

There follows three similar episodes as Enlil leaves the city, speaking to as the keeper of the city gate (''"keeper of the holy barrier"'' or ''"man of the pure lock"''), the man who guards [[Id-kura]]; the Sumerian river of the underworld (similar to the river [[Styx]] in [[Greek Mythology]]) and lastly SI.LU.IGI, the underworld ferryman (similar to [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]). Each time Enlil tells these characters ''"When your lady Ninlil comes, if she asks after me, don't you tell her where I am!"''. Ninlil follows him asking each ''"When did your lord Enlil go by?"'' To this, Enlil (in disguise) tells her ''"My lord has not talked with me at all, O loveliest one. Enlil has not talked with me at all, O loveliest one"'' upon which Ninlil offers to [[have sex with]] him and each time they conceive another god. Two of the offspring are gods of the underworld, [[Nergal]]-Meclamta-ea and [[Ninazu]]. The third god, [[Enbilulu]] is called the ''"inspector of canals"'', however Jeremy Black has linked this god to management of irrigation.&lt;ref name="BlackBlack2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy A.

{{cquote|''"You are lord! You are king! Enlil, you are lord! You are king! Nunamnir, you are lord! You are king! You are supreme lord, you are powerful lord! Lord who makes flax grow, lord who makes barley grow, you are lord of heaven, lord plenty, lord of the earth! You are lord of the earth, lord plenty, lord of heaven! Enlil in heaven, Enlil is king! Lord whose pronouncements cannot be altered at all! His primordial utterances will not be changed! For the praise spoken for Ninlil the mother, praise be to the Great Mountain, Father Enlil!''"&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

==Discussion==
Jeremy Black discusses the problems of serial pregnancy and multiple births along with the complex psychology of the myth. He also notes that there are no moral overtones about Enlil being ritually impure.&lt;ref name="BlackBlack2006"/&gt; Ewa Wasilewska noted about the location of the tale that ''"Black and Green suggest the Sumerians located their underworld in the east mountains where the entrance to [[Kur]] was believed to exist. He (Enlil) was thus the 'King of the Foreign Lands/Mountains,' where the underworld to which he was banished and from which he returned, was located."''&lt;ref name="Wasilewska2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewa Wasilewska|title=Creation stories of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMj1tyho3CoC&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=29 May 2011|year=2000|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-681-2|pages=77–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Payne has suggested that the initial scene of the courtship takes place on the bank of a canal instead of a river.&lt;ref name="Payne1959"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Payne|title=The canal builders: the story of canal engineers through the ages, p. 22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0cgAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=29 May 2011|year=1959|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman Behrens has suggested a ritual context for the myth where dramatic passages were acted out on a voyage between the Ekur and the sanctuary in Nippur.&lt;ref name="Leick1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwendolyn Leick|title=A dictionary of ancient Near Eastern mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhnw5olUQXAC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=29 May 2011|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-19811-0|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerrold Cooper has argued for a more sociological interpretation, explaining about the creation of gods who seem to perform as substitutes for Enlil, he suggests the purpose of the work is ''"to tell the origins of four gods"'' and that it ''"explains why one (Suen) is shining in the heavens, while the other three dwell in the Netherworld"''. Cooper also argues that the text uses local geographical placenames in regard to the netherworld.&lt;ref name="Penglase1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Penglase|title=Greek Myths and Mesopotamia: Parallels and Influence in the Homeric Hymns and Hesiod|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5nrlIoCyxAC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=29 May 2011|date=24 March 1997|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-15706-3|pages=40–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the analysis of [[Thorkild Jacobsen]], Dale Launderville has suggested the myth provides evidence that Sumerian society prohibited [[premarital sex]] in a discussion entitled ''"Channeling the Sex Drive Toward the Creation of Community"''. He discusses the attributes of the gods ''"(1) the moon god was regarded as rejuvenating living things; (2) Nergal was associated occasionally with agricultural growth but more often with [[Plague (disease)|plague]], [[:wikt:pestilence|pestilence]], [[famine]] and [[sudden cardiac death|sudden death]]; (3) Ninazu and (4) Enbilulu were forces that ensured successful [[agriculture]]."'' He concludes that the narrative exonerates Enlil and Ninlil indicating nature to have its way even where societal conventions try to contain sexual desire.&lt;ref name="Launderville2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dale Launderville|title=Celibacy in the Ancient World: Its Ideal and Practice in Pre-Hellenistic Israel, Mesopotamia, and Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDe0gv9GJQcC&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=29 May 2011|date=1 July 2010|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5697-6|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minerva-Vedder-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|Mosaic of [[Minerva]] by [[Elihu Vedder]] ([[Thomas Jefferson Building]]). Beneath the mosaic is an inscription from Horace's ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'': "Nil invita Minerva, quae monumentum aere perennius exegit, and translated as, Not unwilling, Minerva raises a monument more lasting than bronze."]]
The '''''Epistles''''' (or '''''Letters''''') of [[Horace]] were published in two books, in 20 BCE and 14 BCE, respectively.

*'''''Epistularum liber primus''''' ('''''First Book of Letters''''') is the seventh work by Horace, published in the year 20 BCE. This book consists of 20 Epistles. The phrase ''[[sapere aude]]'' ("dare to be wise") comes from this collection of poems.
*'''''Epistularum liber secundus''''' ('''''Second Book of Letters''''') was published in the year 14 BC. This book consists of 3 Epistles. However, the third epistle – the [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]] – is usually treated as a separate composition.

== Background ==
As one commentator has put it: "Horace's ''Epistles'' may be said to be a continuation of his Satires in the form of letters... But few of the epistles are [actually] letters except in form..."&lt;ref name="Lonsdale"&gt;The Works of Horace Rendered into English Prose by James Lonsdale M.A. and Samuel Lee M.A. London: MacMillan and Co., 1883. Edition is available on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|159}} They do indeed contain an excellent specimen of a letter of introduction (I.9); a piece of playful banter (I.14); pieces of friendly correspondence (I.3, I.4 and I.5); while the last, ''Epistle'' I.20, is inscribed 'To His Book," and forms a sort of epilogue to the ''Epistles'' he had already written. However, as a rule, the Epistles "are compositions like those which Pope, following the manner of Horace, has made familiar to us as Moral Essays."&lt;ref name="Lonsdale"/&gt;{{rp|159}}

The ''Epistles'' were published about four years after the first three books of ''Odes,'' and were introduced by a special address to his patron [[Maecenas]], as his ''Odes,'' ''Epodes,'' and ''Satires'' had been.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Horace |volume=13 |pages=687-691}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|687–91}} The form of composition may have been suggested by some of the satires of [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]], which were composed as letters to his personal friends...&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;{{rp|690}} "From the ''Epistles''... we gather that [Horace] had gradually adopted a more retired and meditative life, and had become fonder of the country and of study, and that while owing allegiance to no school or sect of philosophy, he was framing for himself a scheme of life, was endeavoring to conform to it, and was bent on inculcating it in others."&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;{{rp|690}}

"In both his ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'', Horace shows himself a genuine moralist, a subtle observer and true painter of life, and an admirable writer." But in spirit the ''Epistles'' are more philosophic, more ethical and meditative. Like the ''Odes'' they exhibit the twofold aspects of Horace's philosophy, that of temperate Epicureanism and that of more serious and elevated conviction.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;{{rp|690}}

== Book 1 ==
Book 1 contains 20 Epistles.&lt;ref name="Lonsdale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horace, The Complete Works, ed. by Charles E. Bennett and John Carew Rolfe. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1901. Edition is available on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''I.1 – On the Importance of Philosophy''' - ''(Dedication to [[Maecenas]], Horace's Patron)
:1-19 – Horace excuses himself to Maecenas for giving up the composition of lyric poetry, but he is better suited to philosophy as he grows older. However, he is not bound to any particular philosophic school.
:20-40 – Wisdom is the true business of life; yet most of us must be content with but a moderate share of it: wisdom too is the only power which can tame our passions.
:41-69 – Men will do and suffer anything to avoid poverty, but they will do nothing to gain virtue, which is more precious than gold. A clear conscience makes a man truly a king.
:70-93 – He cannot follow the popular ideas, because he sees that they all tend one way - namely, to money-making. Besides, not only do men differ from one another in their pursuits, but no man is ever consistent with himself.
:94-108 – External inconsistencies are noticed at once, while those of life and practice are passed over. This epistle ends with a joke on the Stoic doctrine of the perfect man.
*'''I.2 – Homer: The Teacher of True Philosophy''' – ''(Addressed to Lollius Maximus)''
:1-31 – Horace begins by demonstrating, in the manner of the Stoic philosophers, the merit of Homer as a teacher of morals.
:32-71 – Men will take more trouble for bad deeds than for good, and more for the body than the mind. Yet, without contentment and peace of mind, material acquisitions cannot be enjoyed. Avarice and envy are always beggars, and remorse comes after anger. Youth is the time to learn self-control. He shall always adhere to the philosophy of moderation.
*'''I.3 – A Literary Staff''' – ''(Addressed to Julius Florus)''
:To Julius Florus, who was serving on the staff of Tiberius Claudius Nero. The letter consists mainly of inquiries and observations as to the literary pursuits of members of the staff; and concludes with a hope that the quarrel between Florus and Munatius has ended in a reconciliation.
*'''I.4 – An Exhortation to Contentment''' – ''(Addressed to [[Albius Tibullus]], the Elegaic Poet)''
:Horace urges his friend to enjoy each passing hour, and suggests that a visit to his Sabine Farm may divert him.
*'''I.5 – An Invitation''' – ''(Addressed to Manlius Torquatus, to whom Horace also wrote Ode IV.7)''
:Horace invites his friend to dinner – Tomorrow is a holiday and Torquatus may well forget his occupations for a time. Horace then extols the virtues of wine (see also Ode III.21); and describes the preparations he is making for the banquet.
*'''I.6 – On Philosophic Indifference''' – ''(Addressed to Numicius)''
:Equanimity is happiness – Fear and desire alike disturb our peace of mind. You will find this maxim true if you seek the chief good in any other pursuit – 1) in riches, 2) in political honors, 3) in sumptuous living, or 4) in love and trifling. 
*'''I.7 – An Independent Spirit''' – ''(Addressed to Maecenas)''
:1-24 – Horace excuses himself to Maecenas for not keeping his promise to come to Rome, on the ground that it would be dangerous to his health. He feels that this reason will satisfy Maecenas, as being a friend who has always had a sincere regard for his welfare.
:25-45 – If Maecenas would want him to always be at Rome, then Horace must have back his health and youth. He must be free, even if freedom costs him the loss of all Maecenas' favors. Horace would give back all, as Telemachus refused the horses which were unsuited to his poor and rocky island.
:46-95 – The story of Volteius Mena and his patron L. Marcius Philippus, with an implied allusion to the relationship between Horace and Maecenas. The attainment of our wishes does not always make us happy.
*'''I.8 – A Word of Warning''' – ''(Addressed to Celsus Albinovanus, who was serving on the staff of Tiberius in the province of Asia)''
:This letter seems to be a reply. Horace speaks of his own fickleness and discontent, and gently recommends moderation to Celsus in prosperity.
*'''I.9 – A Letter of Recommendation''' – ''(Addressed to Tiberius)''
:This letter is written to the future emperor Tiberius, in behalf of Titius Septimius, to whom Ode II.6 is addressed.
*'''I.10 – The Advantages of Country Life''' – ''(Addressed to [[Aristius Fuscus]], to whom Ode I.22 is also addressed)''
:This epistle begins with Horace contrasting his own love of the country with his friend's fondness for the town; then follows the praise of Nature; and finally the poet dwells on the superior happiness that moderate means and contentment afford, compared with riches and ambition.
*'''I.11 – On Contentment''' – ''(Addressed to Bullatius)''
:To Bullatius who is travelling to Ionia – Change of scene does not alter the mind. If the mind is tranquil, the meanest and least interesting of places seem agreeable.
*'''I.12 – Consolation''' – ''(Addressed to Iccius, to whom Ode I.29 is also addressed)''
:Horace advises Iccius, who is now steward of Agrippa's property in Sicily, to be content, and compliments him on pursuing the study of philosophy. He then encourages him to cultivate the friendship of Pompeius Grosphus, and tells him the news at Rome.
*'''I.13 – Instructions to a Messenger''' – ''(Addressed to Vinius Asina)''
:Horace sends a copy of his ''Odes'' to Augustus by a friend of his court circles – Vinius Asina. The poet writes a playful note of instruction to the messenger, whom he likens (on account of his name "Asina") to a beast of burden.
*'''I.14 – Master to Bailiff''' – 
:Horace writes a letter to his bailiff, who dislikes the country and longs to return to city life; while Horace, detained at Rome, has his heart in the country.
*'''I.15 – A Request for Information'''  – ''(Addressed to Numonius Vala)''
:Horace has decided to spend the winter at the seashore, and now writes to his friend for information about the climate and resources of Velia and Salernum.
*'''I.16 – Happiness Depends Upon Virtue''' – ''(Addressed to Quinctius Hirpinus, to whom Ode II.11 is also addressed)''
:1-16 – Horace describes the simple attractions of his Sabine Farm.
:17-45 – Advice to his friend not to value too highly the admiration of the masses – their honors can be taken away.
:46-62 – Many a man who seems to be good is actuated by fear, not love – his morality is hollow.
:63-79 – The miser is a slave to his money. The good man is free and fearless, come what will.
*'''I.17 – On True Independence''' – ''(Address to Scaeva)''
:Horace shows that one may observe proper deference towards a patron without sacrificing one's self-respect. He gives some humorous directions for gaining the favor of great men.
*'''I.18 – On the Proper Demeanor Towards a Patron''' – ''(Addressed to Lollius Maximum)''
:As in ''Epistle'' I.17, Horace assures a friend that he can show proper deference to a patron, without laying himself open to the charge of obsequiousness.
*'''I.19 – The Poet on His Critics''' – ''(Addressed to Maecenas)''
:The ''Odes'' (Books I–III) had evidently met with unfavorable criticism outside the small circle of the poet's friends. He points out to Maecenas the injustice of the charges which have been made against him, and expresses contempt for his detractors.
*'''I.20 – Epilogue''' – ''(Addressed to His Book)''
:Horace warns his book of ''Epistles'' of the fate that attends publishing. He compares it to a young and beautiful slave, and foretells its destiny – 1) Success until it falls into the hands of the vulgar; 2) Banishment to the provinces; 3) An old age spent in schools.

==Book 2==
Book 2 consists of 3 ''epistles.'' However, the third epistle – the ''Ars Poetica'' – is usually treated as a separate composition. (For further discussion, see the Wikipedia article on the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'').

*'''II.1 – On Popular Taste and Judgment''' – ''(Dedication to Augustus)''
:Horace dedicates his second collection of ''Epistles'' to Augustus, who had apparently urged him to undertake something in the line of dramatic or epic poetry. He complains of the poor taste shown by the general public, especially in regard to the drama, and says that he is unwilling to make an attempt in that line. For epic poetry he has no ability.
*'''II.2 – A Renunciation of Lyric Poetry''' – ''(Addressed to Julius Florus, to whom ''Epistle'' I.3 is also addressed)
:Horace expresses at greater length the same general sentiments as in ''Epistle'' I.1 – He intends to devote himself to philosophy and to write only in the field represented by the ''Satires'' and ''Epistles.''
*'''II.3 – ''Ars Poetica'' – The Art of Poetry''' – ''(Addressed to The Pisos)''
:''(For further discussion, see the Wikipedia article on the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'')''
:''The ''Ars Poetica'' is dedicated to Horace's friend [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 15 BCE)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso]] (the Roman senator and consul) and his two sons.''
:1-23 – Unity and simplicity are necessary in a poem.
:24-37 – We, who would be poets, must guard against all extremes.
:38-44 – We must well consider our powers before we write.
:45-72 – We may coin new words when necessary, but this must be done with care: words, like all other things, are subject to change.
:73-85 – The various kinds of poetry: epic, elegiac, dramatic, lyric.
:86-98 – We must suit our style to the different kinds of poetry.
:99-118 – The words also must be suitable to the character in whose mouth the poet puts them.
:119-152 – A writer should follow the traditions of the Muse; or, if he strikes out something new, must be consistent. No better guide can we follow than Homer.
:153-178 – A writer too should observe the characteristics of each age of man.
:179-188 – Some things should be represented on the stage, others related to the spectators.
:189-201 – Certain rules not to be transgressed. The role of the Chorus.
:202-219 – Of the music of the stage, and how it changes with the fortunes and manners of the people.
:220-250 – The Satyric drama, which accompanied the tragedy, is not the same as comedy, and has its rules and wholesome restraints.
:251-274 – On the Iambic and Spondee. The Greek taste is to be followed, rather than the license of the Roman poets, in respect to meter.
:275-294 – The origin of tragedy &amp; its development. To it succeeded the old comedy – vigorous, but scurrilous. The Latin poets deserve some praise, but their great fault is their careless, slovenly style.
:295-308 – Genius cannot afford to dispense with the rules of art. The critic has his place in literature.
:309-322 – Knowledge is the foundation of good writing. Poetry without sense is but a harmonious trifling.
:323-333 – The Greeks had genius; the Romans are a money-getting race.
:334-346 – The object of the poet should be to give instruction and delight.
:347-360 – We do not expect perfection in a poem, but we do expect care and pains.
:361-365 – A short comparison between poetry and painting.
:366-390 – Mediocrity in poetry is insufferable – For this reason, be careful before you publish.
:391-407 – The origins and office of poetry in early days.
:408-418 – Genius is necessary for a poet – and yet, without art and study, genius will fail.
:419-452 – Let poets avoid flatterers. Quinctilius was an honest friend, whose mission it was to tell an author unpleasant truths.
:453-476 – A poet goes as mad as Empedocles; let all beware of him and keep out of the way of one who will not be helped.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14065">A '''functional group''' is  merely a set of species, or collection of organisms, that share alike characteristics within a community. Ideally, the lifeforms would perform equivalent tasks based on domain forces, rather than a common ancestor or evolutionary relationship. This could potentially lead to analogous structures that overrule the possibility of [[homology (biology)|homology]]. More specifically, these beings produce resembling effects to external factors of an inhabiting system.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 2: Functional Groups." ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology.'' N.p.: n.p., n.d. 9-25. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that a majority of these creatures share an [[ecological niche]], it is practical to assume they require similar structures in order to achieve the greatest amount of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. This refers to such as the ability to successfully reproduce to create offspring, and furthermore sustain life by avoiding alike predators and sharing meals.

==Scientific investigation==
Rather than the idea of this concept based upon a set of theories, functional groups are directly observed and determined by research specialists. It is important that this information is witnessed first-hand in order to state as usable evidence. Behavior and overall contribution to others are common key points to look for. Individuals use the corresponding perceived traits to further link genetic profiles to one another. Although, the life-forms themselves are different, variables based upon overall function and performance are interchangeable. These groups share an indistinguishable part within their [[Energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]], providing a key position within [[food chain]]s and relationships within environment(s).&lt;ref&gt;'''Vassiliki, Markantonatou.''' "Marine Biodiversity Wiki." ''Functional Groups -''. N.p., n.d. Web. 30 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is an ecosystem and why is that important? An ecosystem is the biological organization that defines and expands on various environment factors- [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] and [[biotic component|biotic]], that relate to simultaneous interaction.&lt;ref&gt;"Ecosystem.org." Ecosystem. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it be a producer or relative consumer, each and every piece of life maintains a critical position in the ongoing survival rates of its own surroundings. As it pertains, a functional groups shares a very specific role within any given ecosystem and the process of cycling vitality.

==Categories==
There are generally two types of functional groups that range between flora and specific animal populations. Groups that relate to vegetation science, or flora, are known as plant functional types. Also referred to as PFT for short, those of such often share identical photosynthetic processes and require comparable nutrients. As an example, plants that undergo photosynthesis share an identical purpose in producing chemical energy for others.&lt;ref&gt;"The Ecosystem and How It Relates to Sustainability." The Concept of the Ecosystem. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, those within the animal science range are called guilds, typically sharing feeding types. This could be easily simplified when viewing [[trophic level]]s. Examples include primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, and quaternary consumers.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 2: Functional Groups." ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology.'' N.p.: n.p., n.d. 9-25. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diversity ==
Functional diversity is often referred to as the "value and the range of those species and organismal traits that influence [[ecosystem function]]ing”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Functional Diversity|last1=Tilman|first1=David|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780122268656|edition=3|location=New York|pages=109–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits of an organism that make it unique, for example, way it moves, gathers resources, reproduces, or the time of year it is active &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fetzer|first=Ingo|last2=Johst|first2=Karin|last3=Schäwe|first3=Robert|last4=Banitz|first4=Thomas|last5=Harms|first5=Hauke|last6=Chatzinotas|first6=Antonis|date=2015-12-01|title=The extent of functional redundancy changes as species' roles shift in different environments|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=112|issue=48|pages=14888–14893|doi=10.1073/pnas.1505587112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4672811|pmid=26578806}}&lt;/ref&gt; add to the overall diversity of an entire [[ecosystem]], and therefore enhance the overall function, or productivity, of that ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilman|first1=David|date=2001|title=Diversity and Productivity in a Long-Term Grassland Experiment|journal=Science|volume=294|issue=843|pages=843–845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional diversity increases the overall productivity of an ecosystem by allowing for an increase in niche occupation.

Organismal level functional diversity, which adds to the overall functional diversity of an ecosystem, is important for conservation efforts, especially in systems used for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=B|date=1992|title=Biodiversity and ecological redundancy|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=6|issue=1|pages=18–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional diversity can be difficult to measure accurately, but when done correctly, it provides useful insight to the overall function and stability of an ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petchey|first1=O.L|last2=Gaston|first2=K.J|date=2002|title=Functional diversity (FD), species richness and community composition|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=5|pages=402–411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Redundancy ==
Functional redundancy refers to the phenomenon that species in the same ecosystem fill similar roles, which results in a sort of "insurance" in the ecosystem. Redundant species can easily do the job of a similar species from the same functional niche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Jordan|date=2002|title=Functional redundancy in ecology and conservation|journal=Synthesizing Ecology|volume=98|issue=1|pages=156–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible because similar species have adapted to fill the same niche overtime. Functional redundancy varies across ecosystems and can vary from year to year depending on multiple factors including habitat availability, overall species diversity, competition among species for resources, and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naeem|first1=S|date=1998|title=Species redundancy and ecosystem reliability|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variation can lead to a fluctuation in overall ecosystem production. It is not always known how many species occupy a functional niche, and how much, if any, redundancy is occurring in each niche in an ecosystem. It is hypothesized that each important functional niche is filled by multiple species. Similar to functional diversity, there is no one clear method for calculating functional redundancy accurately, which can be problematic. One method is to account for the number of species occupying a functional niche, as well as the abundance of each species. This can indicate how many total individuals in an ecosystem are performing one function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ricotta|first1=C. et al.|date=2016|title=Measuring the functional redundancy of biological communities: A quantitative guide|journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|volume=8|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on conservation ==
Studies relating to [[Functional diversity (ecology)|functional diversity]] and redundancy occur in a large proportion of conservation and ecological research. As the human population increases, the need for ecosystem function subsequently increases. In addition, habitat destruction and modification continue to increase, and suitable habitat for many species continues to decrease, this research becomes more important. As the human population continues to expand, and urbanization is on the rise, native and natural landscapes are disappearing, being replaced with modified and managed land for human consumption. Alterations to landscapes are often accompanied with negative side effects including fragmentation, species losses, and nutrient runoff, which can effect the stability of an ecosystem, productivity of an ecosystem, and the functional diversity and functional redundancy by decreasing species diversity.

It has been shown that intense land use affects both the species diversity, and functional overlap, leaving the ecosystem and organisms in it vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Labierte|first1=E. et al.|date=2010|title=. Land use intensification reduces functional redundancy and response diversity in plant communities|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=13|issue=1|pages=76–86|pmid=19917052|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01403.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, bee species, which we rely on for pollination services, have both lower functional diversity and species diversity in managed landscapes when compared to natural habitats, indicating that anthropogenic change can be detrimental for organismal functional diversity, and therefore overall ecosystem functional diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forrest|first1=J.R|last2=Thorp|first2=R. W|last3=Kremen|first3=C|last4=Williams|first4=N.M|date=2015|title=Contrasting patterns in species and functional trait diversity of bees in an agricultural landscape|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|volume=52|pages=706–715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research demonstrated that the functional redundancy of herbaceous insects in streams varies due to stream velocity, demonstrating that environmental factors can alter functional overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poff|first1=N.L et al.|date=2002|title=Redundancy among three herbivorous insects across an experimental current velocity gradient|journal=Community Ecology|volume=134|issue=4|pages=262–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; When conservation efforts begin, it is still up for debate whether preserving specific species, or functional traits is a more beneficial approach for the preservation of ecosystem function. Higher species, diversity can lead to an increase in overall ecosystem productivity, but does not necessarily insure the security of functional overlap. In ecosystems with high redundancy, losing a species (which lowers overall functional diversity) will not always lower overall ecosystem function due to high functional overlap, and thus in this instance it is most important to conserve a group, rather than an individual. In ecosystems with dominant species, which contribute to a majority of the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomas]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s output, it may be more beneficial to conserve this single species, rather than a functional group.

.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaksic|first1=F.M|date=2003|title=How much functional redundancy is out there, or are we willing to do away with potential back up species?|journal=How Landscapes Change|volume=162|pages=255–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges ===
Understanding functional diversity and redundancy, and the roles each play in conservation efforts is often hard to accomplish because the tools with which we measure diversity and redundancy cannot be used interchangeably. Due to this, recent empirical work most often analyzes the effects of either functional diversity or functional redundancy, but not both. This does not create a complete picture of the factors influencing ecosystem production. In ecosystems with similar and diverse vegetation, functional diversity is more important for overall [[ecosystem stability]] and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=TIlman|first1=David et al.|date=1997|title=The influence of functional diversity and composition on ecosystem proceeses|journal=Science|volume=277|issue=5330|pages=1300–1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, in contrast, functional diversity of native bee species in highly managed landscapes provided evidence for higher functional redundancy leading to higher fruit production, something humans rely heavily on for food consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sydenham|first1=M.A et al.|date=2016|title=The effects of habitat management on the species: phylogenetic and functional diversity of bees are modified by the environmental context|journal=Ecology and Evolution|volume=6|issue=4|pages=961–973}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent paper has stated that until a more accurate measuring technique is universally used, it is too early to determine which species, or functional groups, are most vulnerable and susceptible to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouchet|first1=M.A|last2=Villeger|first2=S|last3=Mason|first3=N.W|last4=Mouillot|first4=D|date=2010|title=Functional diversity measures: an overview of their redundancy and their ability to discriminate community assembly rules|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=24|pages=867–876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, understanding how extinction affects ecosystems, and which traits are most vulnerable can protect ecosystems as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petchey|first1=O.L.|last2=Gaston|first2=K.J|date=2002|title=Extinction and the loss of functional diversity|journal=The Royal Society|volume=25|pages=1721–1729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Ganadhara}}
'''Gandharva''' is a name used for distinct heavenly beings in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]; it is also a term for skilled singers in [[Indian classical music]].

==In Hinduism==
[[File:Apsara Gandharva Dancer Pedestal Tra Kieu.jpg|thumb|Gandharva (right) with an Apsara, 10th century, [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], Vietnam]]

In [[Hinduism]], the gandharvas ([[Sanskrit]]: गन्धर्व, ''gandharva'', [[Assamese language|Assamese]]: গন্ধৰ্ব্ব ''gandharbba'', Bengali: গন্ধর্ব "gandharba", [[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ಗಂಧರ್ವ, [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: கந்தர்வர், [[Telugu language|Telugu]]: గంధర్వ ''Gandharvudu'', [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]: ഗന്ധർവൻ) are male nature spirits, husbands of the [[Apsaras]]. Some are part [[animal]], usually a [[bird]] or [[horse]]. They have superb musical skills. They guarded the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] and made beautiful music for the gods in their palaces. Gandharvas are frequently depicted as singers in the court of Gods.

Gandharvas act as messengers between the gods and humans. In Hindu law, a [[gandharva marriage]] is one contracted by mutual consent and without formal rituals.

Gandharvas are mentioned extensively in the epic [[Mahabharata]] as associated with the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] (as dancers and singers) and with the [[yaksha]]s, as formidable warriors. They are mentioned as spread across various [[Gandharva Kingdom|territories]].

===Parentage===

Various parentage is given for the gandharvas. They are called the creatures of [[Prajapati]], of [[Brahma]], of [[Kashyap|Kasyapa]], of the Munis, of [[Arishta]], or of [[Vāc]].&lt;ref name=vacdef&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUezTfym7CAC&amp;pg=PA346 |title=A Sanskrit-English dictionary: etymologically and philologically arranged, by Sir Monier Monier-Williams |via=[[Google Books]]|date= |accessdate=2012-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Buddhism==
[[File:Guardian of Phra Meru Mas of Bhumibol Adulyadej - Dhatarattha (left side).jpg|thumb|Dhṛtarāṣṭra, one of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] and the king of gandharvas.]]
A gandharva ([[Sanskrit]]) or gandhabba ([[Pali|Pāli]]) ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 乾闥婆 ''Kendatsuba'') is one of the lowest-ranking [[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]] in [[Buddhist]] cosmology. They are classed among the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Cāturmahārājikakāyika]] devas, and are subject to the Great King {{IAST|Dhṛtarāṣṭra}}, Guardian of the East. Beings are reborn among the gandharvas as a consequence of having practiced the most basic form of [[Śīla|ethics]] (Janavasabha-sutta, DN.18). It was considered embarrassing for a monk to be born in no better birth than that of a gandharva.

Gandharvas can fly through the air, and are known for their skill as musicians. They are connected with trees and flowers, and are described as dwelling in the scents of bark, sap, and blossom.  They are among the beings of the wilderness that might disturb a monk meditating alone.

The terms gandharva and [[yaksha|{{IAST|yakṣa}}]] are sometimes used for the same person; {{IAST|yakṣa}} in these cases is the more general term, including a variety of lower deities.

===In Rebirth===
In the ''Mahātanhasankhaya Sutta'' in the ''[[Majjhima Nikāya]]'', [[Gautama Buddha]] explains to his [[bhikkhu]]s that an [[embryo]] develops when three conditions are met: the woman must be in the correct point of her menstrual cycle, the woman and man must have sexual intercourse, and a gandhabba must be present. According to the commentary to this sutta, in this instance the word ''gandhabba'' doesn't mean a celestial deva, but a being enabled to be born by its [[Karma#In_Buddhism|kamma]].&lt;ref name="MN38"/&gt;

===Notable Gandharvas===
Among the notable gandharvas are mentioned (in DN.20 and DN.32) Panāda, Opamañña, {{IAST|Naḷa}}, Cittasena, Rājā. Janesabha is probably the same as Janavasabha, a rebirth of King [[Bimbisara|Bimbisāra]] of [[Magadha]].  Mātali the Gandharva is the charioteer for [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]].

Timbarū ([[Tumburu]]) was a chieftain of the gandharvas. There is a romantic story told about the love between his daughter Bhaddā Suriyavacchasā (Sanskrit: Bhadrā Sūryavarcasā) and another gandharva, Pañcasikha (Sanskrit: Pañcaśikha). Pañcasikha fell in love with Suriyavacchasā when he saw her dancing before Śakra, but she was then in love with Sikhandī (or Sikhaddi), son of Mātali the charioteer. Pañcasikha then went to Timbarū's home and played a melody on his lute of ''beluva''-wood, on which he had great skill, and sang a love-song in which he interwove themes about the Buddha and his [[arhat]]s.

Later, Śakra prevailed upon Pañcasikha to intercede with the Buddha so that Śakra might have an audience with him. As a reward for Pañcasikha's services, Śakra was able to get Suriyavacchasā, already pleased with Pañcasikha's display of skill and devotion, to agree to marry Pañcasikha.

Pañcasikha also acts as a messenger for the [[Four Heavenly Kings]], conveying news from them to Mātali, the latter representing Śakra and the [[Trayastrimsa|{{IAST|Trāyastriṃśa}}]] devas.

''Gandharva'' or ''gandhabba'' is also used in a completely different sense, referring to a being (or, strictly speaking, part of the causal continuum of consciousness) in a liminal state between death and rebirth.

==In Indian classical music==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
There are many singers known as gandharvas for their mastery of [[Indian classical music]]. All of them, at one time or another, were theater actors who performed in various musicals. Their style of music is known as ''Kula Sangeet'' in Marathi, literally "hereditary music". They are regarded as masters of Indian classical music by the vast majority of the general population, predominantly in the state of [[Maharashtra]].

'''''Journey to the Centre of the Earth''''' is the third album by English keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]], released on 3 May 1974 by [[A&amp;M Records]]. It is a live recording of the second of his two concerts at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] on 18 January 1974, the premiere of his 40-minute orchestral rock piece based on [[Jules Verne]]'s science fiction [[Journey to the Center of the Earth|novel of the same name]]. It tells the story of Professor Lidenbrook, his nephew Axel, and their guide Hans, who follow a passage to the Earth's centre originally discovered by Arne Saknussemm, an Icelandic [[alchemy|alchemist]]. Wakeman performs with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], the [[English Chamber Choir]], and a group of hand-picked musicians for his rock band, which later became the English Rock Ensemble. Actor [[David Hemmings]] narrates the story.

''Journey to the Centre of the Earth'' was overall well received by music critics. It reached No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], the first album from A&amp;M to do so, and peaked at No. 3 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States. It was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in October 1974 for selling 500,000 copies. The album earned Wakeman a nomination for an [[Ivor Novello Award]] and a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance|Best Pop Instrumental Performance]]. In 1999, Wakeman released a sequel album ''[[Return to the Centre of the Earth]]''. After the original score was presumed lost, Wakeman was reunited with it in 2009 and re-recorded the album three years later with 18 minutes of music previously cut due to time constraints.

==Background==
By mid-1973, Wakeman had been with the [[progressive rock]] band [[Yes (band)|Yes]] for almost two years, and he had released his debut solo effort, ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (album)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'', to critical acclaim. For his next release Wakeman wished to make an album that told a story with its music, something that he had been inspired to do so since his father took him to see a performance of the symphonic fairy tale ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' by [[Sergei Prokofiev]] which features a narrator telling the story and an orchestra illustrating the action.&lt;ref name=reuters2012/&gt; Wakeman had wanted to do an orchestral rock piece based on the 1864 science fiction novel ''[[A Journey to the Center of the Earth|Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]'' by [[Jules Verne]] as early as November 1971, but he put the project on hold until he had finished recording ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII'' in October 1972,{{sfn|Concert Programme|1974|p=1}} and had accumulated some money and had written some music for it.&lt;ref name=mm1974/&gt;

The project developed in December 1972 when Wakeman took part in the [[Tommy (album)#London Symphony Orchestra version|orchestral concerts]] of [[The Who]]'s rock opera ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'' at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, which featured the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], the [[English Chamber Choir]], conductor [[David Measham]], and musical arranger [[Wil Malone]]. Wakeman told his idea for ''Journey to the Centre of the Earth'' to the show's producer [[Lou Reizner]], who put him in contact with Measham to further discuss plans.{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=11}}{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=12}} Wakeman then produced a demo tape that contained a rough outline of the overall structure of the music using a [[Minimoog]] synthesiser, [[Mellotron]], [[Rhodes piano]] and [[clavinet]] and presented it to Measham, indicating where the orchestral parts were to be placed.{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=12}} After Measham agreed to be involved, Wakeman met with his manager [[Brian Lane (manager)|Brian Lane]] to pitch the idea of performing it with an orchestra, choir, and a rock band.{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=12}} As the cost of recording the album in a studio was too high, Wakeman's label [[A&amp;M Records]] agreed to have the work recorded live in concert. To help finance the project, Wakeman sold several of his cars and "mortgaged himself up to the hilt" to cover the estimated £40,000 in costs.{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=15}}

After the album received the [[green-light]] from A&amp;M Records, Wakeman worked on the music "on and off" through 1973 and had assistance with the orchestral and choir arrangements with Malone and Danny Beckerman;{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=13}} the latter first met Wakeman during a Yes tour of Australia.&lt;ref name=mm1974/&gt; A typical session had Malone devising chords and melody lines while Beckerman wrote the parts out on a score, which took several hours. It was Malone's first attempt at writing for a symphony orchestra' he had not received classical training.&lt;ref name=mm1974/&gt; The original score lasted 55 minutes but it was reduced to 40 so it could fit the time constraints of an LP.&lt;ref name=reuters2012&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-journey-reissue/wakeman-reworks-rock-epic-journey-to-centre-of-earth-idUSBRE8AD0US20121114|title=Wakeman reworks rock epic Journey to Centre of Earth|first=Mike|last=Collett-White|date=14 November 2012|accessdate=2 December 2012|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malone called the project a challenge and "completely different" to what he had been involved with previously.&lt;ref name=mm1974/&gt; A&amp;M Records had wanted Wakeman to select a group of known musicians to play in his rock band, but he opposed to the idea as he intended for the public to like the album for its music rather than the performers.{{sfn|Wakeman|1995|p=120}} Wakeman chose a group that he used to play with at the Valiant Trooper, a pub in [[Holmer Green]] in Buckinghamshire.{{sfn|Concert Programme|1974|p=7}} "I'd played with them for fun quite a bit on Sunday evenings...I was playing keyboards with the lads when I thought, they could play ''Journey'' for me. I'm sure they could do the concert and do it well".{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=13}} He picked vocalists Ashley Holt of [[Warhorse (British band)|Warhorse]] and [[Gary Pickford-Hopkins]] from Wild Turkey, drummer [[Barney James]], also of Warhorse, bassist Roger Newell, and guitarist Mike Egan, who had also played on ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII''.{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=13}}{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=14}}&lt;ref name=melody1973/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPNOTES/&gt; The first bassist picked was [[Dave Wintour]], also a performer on ''Six Wives''.&lt;ref name=melody1973/&gt; Actor and singer [[Richard Harris]] was the first choice to narrate the story but he was unavailable, so Wakeman picked actor [[David Hemmings]].{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=14}}&lt;ref name=LPNOTES/&gt;

==Composition==
The 40-minute piece is in four distinct sections: "The Journey", "Recollection", "The Battle", and "The Forest".&lt;ref name=LPNOTES/&gt; Wakeman wrote all the lyrics and narration.&lt;ref name=mm1974/&gt; Wakeman was not confident with his lyric writing, and admitted that his first set of lyrics were "really bad" which prompted a rewrite. His band nicknamed him "Longfellow".&lt;ref name=mm1974/&gt; "The Forest" includes an excerpt of ''[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]'' by [[Edvard Grieg]].&lt;ref name=LPNOTES&gt;{{cite AV media notes|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rick-Wakeman-Journey-To-The-Centre-Of-The-Earth/release/449230|title=Journey to the Centre of the Earth|id=AMLH 63621|year=1974|publisher=A&amp;M Records|others=Rick Wakeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===
German Professor Lidenbrook discovers an old parchment that detailed a journey to the centre of Earth undertaken by Arne Saknussemm, an Icelandic [[alchemy|alchemist]]. The parchment, when decoded into Latin and translated by Lidenbrook's nephew Axel, reveals an entrance to the route in the extinct volcano of [[Snæfellsjökull]] in Iceland. The pair embark on their journey with their guide Hans.&lt;ref name=LPNOTES/&gt;

Upon entering the volcano they pass a lava gallery and find themselves in an intersection of two paths. Lidenbrook chooses the eastern tunnel, but after three days it had taken the trio to a dead end. They returned with just one day's supply of water, reaching the intersection weak and tired. After sleep, they continued their journey and Hans hears flowing water behind a wall of rock and attacks it with a pick axe, revealing a stream of boiling water they named the Hansbach.

The three temporarily separate, and a lone Axel becomes increasingly frightened. Thinking of those who he had left at home, he cries and runs through a tunnel blindly. He almost gives up, but suddenly hears Lidenbrook's voice in the distance and calculates he is just four miles apart and sets off to reunite. At one point the ground beneath Axel collapses and he finds himself with Lidenbrook and Hans in a giant mushroom forest nearby cliffs and sea.

The trio build a raft and set sail for a port they named after Axel's fiancee, Port Grauben. Five days into their sail, they witness a battle between an ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'' and ''[[Plesiosaurus]]''. The ''Ichthyosaurus'' wins, and the travellers are hit with a four-day storm and take shelter by some overhanging rocks. The storm had caused them to travel only some miles north of Port Grauben, so they set on land to track Saknussem's original route once more. They cross a plain of bones and into a forest inhabited by giant [[Mastodon]]s led by a 12-ft high [[Proteus]], a mythological human. Stunned, the three flee the forest for the Lidenbrook Sea and enter a dark tunnel that plunged deep into rock which they blast through with dynamite. The explosion causes an earthquake, and they become trapped in an active volcano shaft which projects them to the surface of the Earth by [[Mount Etna]] in [[Sicily]].

===Concerts===
[[File:Royalfestivalhall.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal Festival Hall where ''Journey'' was recorded.]]
The concerts and album were first announced in October 1973,&lt;ref name=melody1973&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zenponies.com/yitp/1973/oct/oct13_73.html|title=Rick Wakeman to Go Solo|date=13 October 1973|work=Melody Maker|accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organised during a break when Yes were touring ''[[Tales from Topographic Oceans]]''. Two sell-out performances were held at 6&amp;nbsp;and 8&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Friday 18 January 1974 at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London, attended by 3,000 people each.{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=17}}{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=18}} Rehearsals took place at Farmyard Studios in [[Little Chalfont]], owned by Trevor Morais and on the day of the shows, began at 9 a.m.{{sfn|Concert Programme|1974|p=2}}&lt;ref name=mm1974/&gt; Each performance lasted for one hour and forty minutes.&lt;ref name=melody1973/&gt; Performing with Wakeman and his band were the London Symphony Orchestra and the English Chamber Choir conducted by Measham. A projection screen was placed above the stage, initially to display stock footage of mountains and caves, but permission was granted from [[20th Century Fox]] to show excerpts from the [[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|1959 adventure film]] of the same name to accompany the music.{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=18}}&lt;ref name=mm1974&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/rick-wakeman-sentimental-journey|title=Rick Wakeman: Sentimental Journey|first=Chris|last=Welch|date=19 January 1974|newspaper=Melody Maker|accessdate=27 November 2018|via=Rock's Backpages|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial plan was to have the concerts filmed for a prospective home video release when it was "commercially viable", but it did not come into fruition.&lt;ref name=melody1973/&gt;

The shows were introduced with an excerpt of [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 1]] by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]. The first half was taken up by "Catherine Parr", "Catherine Howard", and "Anne Boleyn" from ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII'', with comical pieces "A Road to Ruin" and a comical rendition of "[[Twelfth Street Rag]]" with bajos, minstrel dancers, and accompanying footage of [[Laurel and Hardy]] and various silent films.{{sfn|Concert Programme|1974|p=2}}&lt;ref name=MM19740126&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/rick-wakeman--festival-hall-london|title=Rick Wakeman: Festival Hall, London|first=Chris|last=Welch|date=26 January 1974|newspaper=Melody Maker|accessdate=28 November 2018|via=Rock's Backpages|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=missinghalf&gt;Track listing from ''Treasure Chest Volume 3 – The Missing Half'', released by Voiceprint in 2002. Catalogue number VPTCCD3.&lt;/ref&gt; Wakeman thought the segment would be a disaster as the film arrived at the venue shortly before the first performance and resorted to improvising on the piano without knowing what the footage was.&lt;ref name=mmapril1974/&gt; Wakeman wanted the first half to be "musical and entertaining" and a way of easing ''Journey'' to the audience, which made up the second half of the program.&lt;ref name=mm1974/&gt;{{sfn|Concert Programme|1974|p=2}}{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=17}} The encore was The Pearl and Dean Piano Concerto, a humorous piece based on various television and film music.&lt;ref name=MISSINGHALF/&gt; News reporter [[Chris Welch]] attended the shows and noted: "Several members of the choir could be seen jiving during the more rhythmic moments, and when Rick played some beautiful classical piano, approving nods could be detected from the massed ranks of the orchestra".&lt;ref name=MM19740126/&gt; A party was held after the second show which Wakeman did not attend due to exhaustion. According to Welch, "He was driven home – asleep".&lt;ref name=MM19740126/&gt;

===Post-production===
Wakeman had hoped to record both concerts and select the best performance of the two, but the London Symphony Orchestra requested double pay if this went ahead. He then took "the frightening decision of only recording the second performance and hoping there weren't too many mistakes".{{sfn|Wooding|1978|pp=16–17}} The performance was recorded using [[Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio]] which housed a 16-track studio fitted in an [[Airstream]] trailer.&lt;ref name=LPNOTES/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmapril1974&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/rick-wakeman-british-groups-have-gone-over-the-top|title=Rick Wakeman: British Groups Have Gone Over The Top|first=Chris|last=Welch|date=13 April 1974|newspaper=Melody Maker|accessdate=27 November 2018|via=Rock's Backpages|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first half of the second show was recorded, initially as a test to see if the equipment worked correctly. It remained unreleased until 2002 as part of Wakeman's limited edition box set ''Treasure Chest''.&lt;ref name=MISSINGHALF&gt;{{cite AV media notes|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rick-Wakeman-The-Missing-Half/release/9882658|title=The Missing Half|year=2002|id=VPTCCD3|publisher=Voiceprint Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recordings were produced by Wakeman, and mixed by him and engineer Paul Tregurtha at [[Morgan Studios]] in London from 21 to 29 January 1974.&lt;ref name=LPNOTES/&gt; They encountered a number of problems during this time. Wakeman said: "Someone in the street had accidentally kicked out the vocal mike cable just before we started recording. So we boosted up the vocals that were picked up on the other mikes".&lt;ref name=mmapril1974/&gt; A [[snare drum]] and its microphone broke during the performance, and Hemmings re-recorded some narration in the studio after a tape change occurred during of one of his passages. There were four bars of "complete shambles" between the orchestra and the band, so an identical passage that occurred later in the performance was inserted.&lt;ref name=mmapril1974/&gt;

The original plan was for A&amp;M Records to produce the album quickly for a February 1974 release, but the additional time required to fix the recordings and a shortage of vinyl at the time caused the label to push the release to early April. This sparked concern from management for potential bootleg recordings of the concert to be sold to the public. A&amp;M reported that a later release would "tie in more conveniently with Wakeman's plans" as he had resumed touring with Yes during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zenponies.com/yitp/1974/feb/feb02_74.html|title=Wakeman LP Delay Stirs Pirate Fears|date=2 February 1974|work=Billboard|accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakeman heard cuts of the album during the subsequent Yes tour, rejecting several of them. "I just didn't like the sound, and it was worth doing it properly for the sake of a few extra days".&lt;ref name=mmapril1974/&gt; Another factor in the delay was a paper shortage as the original album design consisted of a [[Gatefold|gatefold sleeve]] with an 8-page booklet, but the designer refused to reduce the package to a standard sleeve.&lt;ref name=mmapril1974/&gt;

==Release==
Upon its arrival at A&amp;M Records, the finished album was poorly received among management; they refused to sell it.{{sfn|Wakeman|1995|p=123}} However, as Wakeman was under contract with A&amp;M in the United States, a cassette was sent to co-founder [[Jerry Moss]] in California, who subsequently agreed to release the record.{{sfn|Wakeman|1995|p=124}} According to Wakeman, the album received 50,000 advanced orders.&lt;ref name=mmapril1974/&gt;

Released on 3 May 1974, ''Journey to the Centre of the Earth'' [[List of number-one albums from the 1970s (UK)#1974|topped]] the [[UK Albums Chart]] for one week, the first album from A&amp;M to do so. It peaked at No. 3 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart for two weeks in July during a stay of 27 weeks.{{sfn|Snider|2008|p=172}} The album became a multimillion-dollar seller in six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Music: Rock Goes to College | date=23 September 1974 | work=Time Magazine | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908764,00.html | accessdate = 21 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakeman received an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for the album,{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=22}} and it earned him a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance|Best Pop Instrumental Performance]].{{sfn|Snider|2008|p=172}} The record was [[RIAA certification|certified]] gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in September 1974,&lt;ref name=gold75/&gt; and a year later in Brazil. It was subsequently released in the four-channel [[Quadraphonic#CD-4 (Compatible Discrete 4) / Quadradisc|Quadradisc CD-4]] format. The album has sold 14 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Rick Wakeman, six wives and one hell of a party | date=1 May 2009 | work=The Times | url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6200354.ece | accessdate = 28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, marking the album's 25th anniversary, Wakeman released a sequel titled ''[[Return to the Centre of the Earth]]''. The story follows a group of adventurers who attempt to follow the previous expedition to the Earth's centre as discovered by Saknussemm.

In 2002, Wakeman released the 8-CD compilation box set ''Treasure Chest'' which contained the previously unreleased first half of the second concert at the Royal Festival Hall.&lt;ref name=MISSINGHALF/&gt; The recording was presumed to have been wiped, but a rough mix was accidentally discovered on a poorly conditioned and mislabelled tape initially used as a guide for the mastering, and was digitally remastered. The CD also contained Hemmings record narration in five dialects during a recording session when he and Wakeman had been drinking while the album was being mixed.&lt;ref name=MISSINGHALF/&gt;

In May 2016, a 3 CD+DVD Super Deluxe Edition box set was released containing a new remaster of the original album, live performances from 1974 and 1993, and a DVD-Audio with a Quad surround sound mix and [[Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab]] mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rick-Wakeman-Journey-To-The-Centre-Of-The-Earth/release/8851392|title=Journey to the Centre of the Earth [Super Deluxe Edition]|year=2016|publisher=A&amp;M Records|id=5363450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
The album received some negative reaction upon its release, with music critics having described the record as a "classical pastiche...genuinely appalling" and "brutal synthesiser overkill".{{sfn|Shuker|2005|p=210}} ''Journey'' however, was well received by others. A journalist for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' missed the Royal Festival Hall concert, but thought on record the music "comes over magnificently ... a striking work which only occasionally lapses into pretentiousness".{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=21}} Music journalist [[Chris Welch]] of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' thought the album was "entertaining, fresh and disalarmingly unpretentious ... This could be a score for a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] musical – tuneful, but with epic overtones". Welch noted Wakeman's "familiarity of the story" and his "close observance to detail engenders a warmth to the work, which made it a resounding success as a concert performance".{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=21}} In a retrospective review, Mike DeGange of [[Allmusic]] called the album "one of progressive rock's crowning achievements" and noted "interesting conglomerations of orchestral and synthesized music".&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r65308|pure_url=yes}} |title=Journey to the Centre of the Earth |accessdate=10 April 2011 |first=Mike |last=DeGange |work=Allmusic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 re-recording==
Wakeman presumed the original conductor's score to the piece, which had been kept in storage, was lost following the collapse of his management company [[MAM Records]] in the early 1980s. He recalled that no one had knowledge of its location thereafter, but wished not to rewrite it as he thought it would not live up to the quality of the original.&lt;ref name=reuters2012/&gt; In 2009 however, a box arrived at his house which stayed in his garage for about five months before Wakeman looked through it and found the original score at the bottom which by then had suffered from water damage.&lt;ref name=2012NOTES/&gt; The score was digitised and pieced together in the course of a year with assistance from conductor and arranger [[Guy Protheroe]], resulting in a new studio re-recording of the album with the 18 minutes of music that had been previously cut. It was recorded from July to September 2012 with the Orion Orchestra, the English Chamber Choir, and members of his rock band, the English Rock Ensemble.&lt;ref name=2012NOTES&gt;{{cite AV media notes|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rick-Wakeman-Journey-To-The-Centre-Of-The-Earth/release/4087436|title=Journey to the Centre of the Earth [2012 Re-Recording]|year=2012|id=CRP13-11-12|publisher=Classic Rock}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters2012/&gt; As Hemmings died in 2003, the narration is voiced by actor [[Peter Egan]].&lt;ref name=reuters2012/&gt; Released on 20 November 2012, the new album is packaged with a one-off magazine published by ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' and a replica of the 1974 Royal Festival Hall concert program and 132-page booklet.&lt;ref name=2012NOTES/&gt;

In [[physics]], the '''kinetic energy''' of an object is the [[energy]] that it possesses due to its [[motion (physics)|motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
It is defined as the [[work (physics)|work]] needed to accelerate a body of a given mass from rest to its stated [[velocity]]. Having gained this energy during its [[acceleration]], the body maintains this kinetic energy unless its speed changes. The same amount of work is done by the body when decelerating from its current speed to a state of rest.

In [[classical mechanics]], the kinetic energy of a non-rotating object of [[mass]] ''m'' traveling at a [[speed]] ''v'' is {{smallmath|f=\frac{1}{2}mv^2}}. In [[Special relativity|relativistic mechanics]], this is a good approximation only when ''v'' is much less than the [[speed of light]].

The standard unit of kinetic energy is the [[joule]].

==History and etymology==
The adjective ''kinetic'' has its roots in the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word κίνησις ''[[-kinesis|kinesis]]'', meaning "motion". The dichotomy between kinetic energy and [[potential energy]] can be traced back to [[Aristotle]]'s concepts of [[actuality and potentiality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Logic in Reality |edition=illustrated |first1=Joseph |last1=Brenner |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-8375-4 |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jnj5E6C9UwsC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jnj5E6C9UwsC&amp;pg=PA93 Extract of page 93]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle in [[classical mechanics]] that ''E ∝ mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' was first developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Johann Bernoulli]], who described kinetic energy as the ''living force'', ''[[vis viva]]''. [[Willem 's Gravesande]] of the Netherlands provided experimental evidence of this relationship. By dropping weights from different heights into a block of clay, [[Willem 's Gravesande]] determined that their penetration depth was proportional to the square of their impact speed. [[Émilie du Châtelet]] recognized the implications of the experiment and published an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Judith P. Zinsser |title=Emilie du Chatelet: Daring Genius of the Enlightenment|publisher=Penguin|year= 2007|isbn=0-14-311268-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''kinetic energy'' and ''work'' in their present scientific meanings date back to the mid-19th century. Early understandings of these ideas can be attributed to [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]], who in 1829 published the paper titled ''Du Calcul de l'Effet des Machines'' outlining the mathematics of kinetic energy. [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], later Lord Kelvin, is given the credit for coining the term "kinetic energy" c. 1849–51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Crosbie Smith, M. Norton Wise|title=Energy and Empire: A Biographical Study of Lord Kelvin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=866| isbn=0-521-26173-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Theodore Merz|title=A History of European Thought in the Nineteenth Century|publisher=Blackwood|year=1912|page= 139|isbn=0-8446-2579-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Energy]] occurs in many forms, including [[chemical energy]], [[thermal energy]], [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[gravitational energy]], [[electric energy]], [[elastic energy]], [[nuclear binding energy|nuclear energy]], and [[rest energy]]. These can be categorized in two main classes: [[potential energy]] and kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the movement energy of an object. Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-kinetic-energy|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinetic energy may be best understood by examples that demonstrate how it is transformed to and from other forms of energy. For example, a [[cyclist]] uses [[food energy|chemical energy provided by food]] to accelerate a [[bicycle]] to a chosen speed. On a level surface, this speed can be maintained without further work, except to overcome [[drag (physics)|air resistance]] and [[friction]]. The chemical energy has been converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion, but the process is not completely efficient and produces heat within the cyclist.

The kinetic energy in the moving cyclist and the bicycle can be converted to other forms.  For example, the cyclist could encounter a hill just high enough to coast up, so that the bicycle comes to a complete halt at the top.  The kinetic energy has now largely been converted to gravitational potential energy that can be released by freewheeling down the other side of the hill.  Since the bicycle lost some of its energy to friction, it never regains all of its speed without additional pedaling. The energy is not destroyed; it has only been converted to another form by friction. Alternatively, the cyclist could connect a [[Bottle dynamo|dynamo]] to one of the wheels and generate some electrical energy on the descent.  The bicycle would be traveling slower at the bottom of the hill than without the generator because some of the energy has been diverted into electrical energy.  Another possibility would be for the cyclist to apply the brakes, in which case the kinetic energy would be dissipated through friction as [[heat]].

Like any physical quantity that is a function of velocity, the kinetic energy of an object depends on the relationship between the object and the observer's [[frame of reference]]. Thus, the kinetic energy of an object is not [[Galilean invariance|invariant]].

[[Spacecraft]] use chemical energy to launch and gain considerable kinetic energy to reach [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]].  In an entirely circular orbit, this kinetic energy remains constant because there is almost no friction in near-earth space. However, it becomes apparent at re-entry when some of the kinetic energy is converted to heat. If the orbit is [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] or [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]], then throughout the orbit kinetic and [[potential energy]] are exchanged; kinetic energy is greatest and potential energy lowest at closest approach to the earth or other massive body, while potential energy is greatest and kinetic energy the lowest at maximum distance. Without loss or gain, however, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy remains constant.

Kinetic energy can be passed from one object to another. In the game of [[billiards]], the player imposes kinetic energy on the cue ball by striking it with the cue stick. If the cue ball collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically, and the ball it hit accelerates its speed as the kinetic energy is passed on to it. [[Collisions]] in billiards are effectively [[elastic collision]]s, in which kinetic energy is preserved. In [[inelastic collision]]s, kinetic energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound, binding energy (breaking bound structures).

[[Flywheel]]s have been developed as a method of [[flywheel energy storage|energy storage]].  This illustrates that kinetic energy is also stored in rotational motion.

Several mathematical descriptions of kinetic energy exist that describe it in the appropriate physical situation. For objects and processes in common human experience, the formula ½mv² given by [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian (classical) mechanics]] is suitable. However, if the speed of the object is comparable to the speed of light, [[special relativity|relativistic effects]] become significant and the relativistic formula is used. If the object is on the atomic or [[sub-atomic scale]], [[quantum mechanical]] effects are significant, and a quantum mechanical model must be employed.

==Newtonian kinetic energy==

===Kinetic energy of rigid bodies===
In [[classical mechanics]], the kinetic energy of a ''point object'' (an object so small that its mass can be assumed to exist at one point), or a non-rotating [[rigid body]] depends on the [[mass]] of the body as well as its [[speed]]. The kinetic energy is equal to 1/2 the [[Multiplication|product]] of the mass and the square of the speed. In formula form:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} =\tfrac{1}{2} mv^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the speed (or the velocity) of the body. In [[SI]] units, mass is measured in [[kilogram]]s, speed in [[metres per second]], and the resulting kinetic energy is in [[joule]]s.

For example, one would calculate the kinetic energy of an 80&amp;nbsp;kg mass (about 180&amp;nbsp;lbs) traveling at 18&amp;nbsp;metres per second (about 40&amp;nbsp;mph, or 65&amp;nbsp;km/h) as
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 80 \,\text{kg} \cdot \left(18 \,\text{m/s}\right)^2 = 12,960 \,\text{J} = 12.96 \,\text{kJ}&lt;/math&gt;

When a person throws a ball, the person does [[work (physics)|work]] on it to give it speed as it leaves the hand. The moving ball can then hit something and push it, doing work on what it hits. The kinetic energy of a moving object is equal to the work required to bring it from rest to that speed, or the work the object can do while being brought to rest: '''net force × displacement = kinetic energy''', i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;F s =\tfrac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since the kinetic energy increases with the square of the speed, an object doubling its speed has four times as much kinetic energy. For example, a car traveling twice as fast as another requires four times as much distance to stop, assuming a constant braking force. As a consequence of this quadrupling, it takes four times the work to double the speed.

The kinetic energy of an object is related to its [[momentum]] by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} = \frac{p^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;p\;&lt;/math&gt; is momentum
:&lt;math&gt;m\;&lt;/math&gt; is mass of the body

For the ''translational kinetic energy,'' that is the kinetic energy associated with [[rectilinear motion]], of a [[rigid body]] with constant [[mass]] &lt;math&gt;m\;&lt;/math&gt;, whose [[center of mass]] is moving in a straight line with speed &lt;math&gt;v\;&lt;/math&gt;, as seen above is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; E_\text{t} =\tfrac{1}{2} mv^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;m\;&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body
:&lt;math&gt;v\;&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of the [[center of mass]] of the body.

The kinetic energy of any entity depends on the reference frame in which it is measured. However the total energy of an isolated system, i.e. one in which energy can neither enter nor leave, does not change over time in the reference frame in which it is measured. Thus, the chemical energy converted to kinetic energy by a rocket engine is divided differently between the rocket ship and its exhaust stream depending upon the chosen reference frame. This is called the [[Oberth effect]]. But the total energy of the system, including kinetic energy, fuel chemical energy, heat, etc., is conserved over time, regardless of the choice of reference frame. Different observers moving with different reference frames would however disagree on the value of this conserved energy.

The kinetic energy of such systems depends on the choice of reference frame: the reference frame that gives the minimum value of that energy is the [[center of momentum]] frame, i.e. the reference frame in which the total momentum of the system is zero. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the [[invariant mass]] of the system as a whole.

====Derivation====
The work done in accelerating a particle with mass ''m'' during the infinitesimal time interval ''dt'' is given by the dot product of ''force'' '''F''' and the infinitesimal ''displacement ''d'''x'''''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} d t = \frac{d \mathbf{p}}{d t} \cdot \mathbf{v} d t = \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{v} \cdot d (m \mathbf{v})\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where we have assumed the relationship '''p'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;'''v''' and the validity of [[Newton's Second Law]]. (However, also see the special relativistic derivation [[Kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|below]].)

Applying the [[product rule]] we see that:
:&lt;math&gt;  d(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}) = (d \mathbf{v}) \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} \cdot (d \mathbf{v}) =  2(\mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{v}).&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, (assuming constant mass so that ''dm''=0), we have,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} \cdot d (m \mathbf{v}) = \frac{m}{2} d (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}) = \frac{m}{2} d v^2  = d \left(\frac{m v^2}{2}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Since this is a [[total differential]] (that is, it only depends on the final state, not how the particle got there), we can integrate it and call the result kinetic energy. Assuming the object was at rest at time 0, we integrate from time 0 to time t because the work done by the force to bring the object from rest to velocity ''v'' is equal to the work necessary to do the reverse:
:&lt;math&gt; E_\text{k} = \int_0^t \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{x} = \int_0^t \mathbf{v} \cdot d (m \mathbf{v}) = \int_0^v d \left(\frac{m v^2}{2}\right) = \frac{m v^2}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This equation states that the kinetic energy (''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the [[integral]] of the [[dot product]] of the [[velocity]] ('''v''') of a body and the [[infinitesimal]] change of the body's [[momentum]] ('''p'''). It is assumed that the body starts with no kinetic energy when it is at rest (motionless).

===Rotating bodies===
If a rigid body Q is rotating about any line through the center of mass then it has [[rotational energy|''rotational kinetic energy'']] (&lt;math&gt;E_\text{r}\,&lt;/math&gt;) which is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of its moving parts, and is thus given by:

:&lt;math&gt; E_\text{r} = \int_Q \frac{v^2 dm}{2} = \int_Q \frac{(r \omega)^2 dm}{2} = \frac{\omega^2}{2} \int_Q {r^2}dm = \frac{\omega^2}{2} I = \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} I \omega^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ω is the body's [[angular velocity]]
* ''r'' is the distance of any mass ''dm'' from that line
* &lt;math&gt;I\,&lt;/math&gt; is the body's [[moment of inertia]], equal to &lt;math&gt;\int_Q {r^2}dm&lt;/math&gt;.

(In this equation the moment of [[inertia]] must be taken about an axis through the center of mass and the rotation measured by ω must be around that axis; more general equations exist for systems where the object is subject to wobble due to its eccentric shape).

===Kinetic energy of systems===
A system of bodies may have internal kinetic energy due to the relative motion of the bodies in the system. For example, in the [[Solar System]] the planets and planetoids are orbiting the Sun. In a tank of gas, the molecules are moving in all directions. The kinetic energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of the bodies it contains.

A macroscopic body that is stationary (i.e. a reference frame has been chosen to correspond to the body's [[center of momentum]]) may have various kinds of [[internal energy]] at the molecular or atomic level, which may be regarded as kinetic energy, due to molecular translation, rotation, and vibration, electron translation and spin, and nuclear spin. These all contribute to the body's mass, as provided by the special theory of relativity. When discussing movements of a macroscopic body, the kinetic energy referred to is usually that of the macroscopic movement only. However all internal energies of all types contribute to body's mass, inertia, and total energy.

===Frame of reference===

The speed, and thus the kinetic energy of a single object is frame-dependent (relative): it can take any non-negative value, by choosing a suitable [[inertial frame of reference]]. For example, a bullet passing an observer has kinetic energy in the reference frame of this observer. The same bullet is stationary to an observer moving with the same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero kinetic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the total kinetic energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the inertial reference frame, unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case, the total kinetic energy has a non-zero minimum, as no inertial reference frame can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the system's [[invariant mass]], which is independent of the reference frame.

The total kinetic energy of a system depends on the [[inertial frame of reference]]: it is the sum of the total kinetic energy in a [[center of momentum frame]] and the kinetic energy the total mass would have if it were concentrated in the [[center of mass]].

This may be simply shown: let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; be the relative velocity of the center of mass frame ''i'' in the frame ''k''.
Since &lt;math&gt;\textstyle v^2 = (v_i + V)^2 = (\mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{V}) \cdot (\mathbf{v}_i + \mathbf{V}) = \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_i + 2 \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{V} + \mathbf{V} \cdot \mathbf{V} = v_i^2 + 2 \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{V} + V^2&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} = \int \frac{v^2}{2} dm = \int \frac{v_i^2}{2} dm + \mathbf{V} \cdot \int \mathbf{v}_i dm + \frac{V^2}{2} \int dm. &lt;/math&gt;

However, let &lt;math&gt; \int \frac{v_i^2}{2} dm = E_i &lt;/math&gt; the kinetic energy in the center of mass frame, &lt;math&gt; \int \mathbf{v}_i dm &lt;/math&gt; would be simply the total momentum that is by definition zero in the center of mass frame, and let the total mass: &lt;math&gt; \int dm = M &lt;/math&gt;. Substituting, we get:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Class/intro_physics_1/intro_physics_1/node64.html Physics notes - Kinetic energy in the CM frame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611231147/http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Class/intro_physics_1/intro_physics_1/node64.html |date=2007-06-11 }}. [[Duke University|Duke]].edu. Accessed 2007-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E_\text{k} = E_i + \frac{M V^2}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the kinetic energy of a system is lowest to center of momentum reference frames, i.e., frames of reference in which the center of mass is stationary (either the [[center of mass frame]] or any other [[center of momentum frame]]). In any different frame of reference, there is additional kinetic energy corresponding to the total mass moving at the speed of the center of mass. The kinetic energy of the system in the [[center of momentum frame]] is a quantity that is invariant (all observers see it to be the same).

===Rotation in systems===
It sometimes is convenient to split the total kinetic energy of a body into the sum of the body's center-of-mass translational kinetic energy and the energy of rotation around the center of mass ([[rotational energy]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E_\text{k} = E_t + E_\text{r} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is the total kinetic energy
:''E''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the translational kinetic energy
:''E''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''rotational energy'' or ''angular kinetic energy'' in the rest frame

Thus the kinetic energy of a tennis ball in flight is the kinetic energy due to its rotation, plus the kinetic energy due to its translation.

==Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies==
{{See also|Mass in special relativity|Tests of relativistic energy and momentum}}

If a body's speed is a significant fraction of the [[speed of light]], it is necessary to use relativistic mechanics to calculate its kinetic energy. In [[special relativity]] theory, the expression for linear momentum is modified.

With ''m'' being an object's [[rest mass]], '''v''' and ''v'' its velocity and speed, and ''c'' the speed of light in vacuum, we use the expression for linear momentum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=m\gamma \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Integration by parts|Integrating by parts]] yields
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} = \int \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{p}= \int \mathbf{v} \cdot d (m \gamma \mathbf{v}) = m \gamma \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} - \int m \gamma \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{v} = m \gamma v^2 - \frac{m}{2} \int \gamma d (v^2)&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}\!&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_\text{k} &amp;= m \gamma v^2 - \frac{- m c^2}{2} \int \gamma d (1 - v^2/c^2) \\
    &amp;= m \gamma v^2 + m c^2 (1 - v^2/c^2)^{1/2} - E_0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; is a [[constant of integration]] for the [[indefinite integral]].
Simplifying the expression we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_\text{k} &amp;= m \gamma (v^2 + c^2 (1 - v^2/c^2)) - E_0 \\
    &amp;= m \gamma (v^2 + c^2 - v^2) - E_0 \\
    &amp;= m \gamma c^2 - E_0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; is found by observing that when &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v }= 0 , \ \gamma = 1\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; E_\text{k} = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;, giving
:&lt;math&gt;E_0 = m c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
resulting in the formula
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} = m \gamma c^2 - m c^2 = \frac{m c^2}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} - m c^2&lt;/math&gt;

This formula shows that the work expended accelerating an object from rest approaches infinity as the velocity approaches the speed of light. Thus it is impossible to accelerate an object across this boundary.

The mathematical by-product of this calculation is the [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula—the body at rest must have energy content

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{rest} = E_0 = m c^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;

At a low speed (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;), the relativistic kinetic energy is approximated well by the classical kinetic energy. This is done by [[binomial approximation]] or by taking the first two terms of the [[Taylor expansion]] for the reciprocal square root:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} \approx m c^2 \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} v^2/c^2\right) - m c^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v^2&lt;/math&gt;

So, the total energy &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; can be partitioned into the rest mass energy plus the Newtonian kinetic energy at low speeds.

When objects move at a speed much slower than light (e.g. in everyday phenomena on Earth), the first two terms of the series predominate. The next term in the Taylor series approximation

:&lt;math&gt; E_\text{k} \approx m c^2 \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} v^2/c^2  + \frac{3}{8} v^4/c^4\right) - m c^2 =  \frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{3}{8} m v^4/c^2&lt;/math&gt;

is small for low speeds. For example, for a speed of {{convert|10|km/s|mph|abbr=on}} the correction to the Newtonian kinetic energy is 0.0417&amp;nbsp;J/kg (on a Newtonian kinetic energy of 50&amp;nbsp;MJ/kg) and for a speed of 100&amp;nbsp;km/s it is 417&amp;nbsp;J/kg (on a Newtonian kinetic energy of 5&amp;nbsp;GJ/kg).

The relativistic relation between kinetic energy and momentum is given by

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} - m c^2&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be expanded as a [[Taylor series]], the first term of which is the simple expression from Newtonian mechanics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; E_\text{k} \approx \frac{p^2}{2 m} -  \frac{p^4}{8 m^3 c^2} . &lt;/math&gt;
This suggests that the formulae for energy and momentum are not special and axiomatic, but concepts emerging from the equivalence of mass and energy and the principles of relativity.

===General relativity===
{{see also|Schwarzschild geodesics}}
Using the convention that
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\alpha \beta} \, u^{\alpha} \, u^{\beta} \, = \, - c^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[four-velocity]] of a particle is
:&lt;math&gt;u^{\alpha} \, = \, \frac{d x^{\alpha}}{d \tau} &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\tau \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[proper time]] of the particle, there is also an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle in [[general relativity]].

If the particle has momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p_{\beta} \, = \, m \, g_{\beta \alpha} \, u^{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;

as it passes by an observer with four-velocity ''u''&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;, then the expression for total energy of the particle as observed (measured in a local inertial frame) is
:&lt;math&gt;E \, = \, - \, p_{\beta} \, u_{\text{obs}}^{\beta} &lt;/math&gt;

and the kinetic energy can be expressed as the total energy minus the rest energy:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{k} \, = \, - \, p_{\beta} \, u_{\text{obs}}^{\beta} \, - \, m \, c^2 \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the case of a metric that is diagonal and spatially isotropic (''g''&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;,''g''&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;,''g''&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;,''g''&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;). Since
:&lt;math&gt;u^{\alpha} = \frac{d x^{\alpha}}{d t} \frac{d t}{d \tau} = v^{\alpha} u^{t} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; is the ordinary velocity measured w.r.t. the coordinate system, we get
:&lt;math&gt;-c^2 = g_{\alpha \beta} u^{\alpha} u^{\beta} = g_{t t} (u^{t})^2 + g_{s s} v^2 (u^{t})^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''u''&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;u^{t} = c \sqrt{\frac{-1}{g_{t t} + g_{s s} v^2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus for a stationary observer (''v''= 0)
:&lt;math&gt;u_{\text{obs}}^{t} = c \sqrt{\frac{-1}{g_{t t}}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus the kinetic energy takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} = - m g_{tt} u^t u_{\text{obs}}^t - m c^2 = m c^2 \sqrt{\frac{g_{tt}}{g_{tt} + g_{ss} v^2}} - m c^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Factoring out the rest energy gives:
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} = m c^2 \left( \sqrt{\frac{g_{tt}}{g_{tt} + g_{ss} v^2}} - 1 \right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression reduces to the special relativistic case for the flat-space metric where
:&lt;math&gt;g_{t t} = -c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{s s} = 1 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In the Newtonian approximation to general relativity
:&lt;math&gt;g_{t t} = - \left( c^2 + 2 \Phi \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{s s} = 1 - \frac{2 \Phi}{c^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Φ is the Newtonian [[gravitational potential]]. This means clocks run slower and measuring rods are shorter near massive bodies.

==Kinetic energy in quantum mechanics==
{{further|Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)}}

In [[quantum mechanics]], observables like kinetic energy are represented as [[Operator (physics)|operators]]. For one particle of mass ''m'', the kinetic energy operator appears as a term in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and is defined in terms of the more fundamental momentum operator &lt;math&gt;\hat p&lt;/math&gt;. The kinetic energy operator in the [[Relativistic quantum mechanics#Non-relativistic and relativistic Hamiltonians|non-relativistic]] case can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\hat T = \frac{\hat p^2}{2m}.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that this can be obtained by replacing &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\hat p&lt;/math&gt; in the classical expression for kinetic energy in terms of [[momentum]],
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} = \frac{p^2}{2m}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[Schrödinger picture]], &lt;math&gt;\hat p&lt;/math&gt; takes the form &lt;math&gt;-i\hbar\nabla &lt;/math&gt; where the derivative is taken with respect to position coordinates and hence

:&lt;math&gt;\hat T = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The expectation value of the electron kinetic energy, &lt;math&gt;\langle\hat{T}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, for a system of ''N'' electrons described by the [[Wave function|wavefunction]] &lt;math&gt;\vert\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a sum of 1-electron operator expectation values:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\hat{T}\rangle = \bigg\langle\psi \bigg\vert \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{-\hbar^2}{2 m_\text{e}} \nabla^2_i \bigg\vert \psi \bigg\rangle = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_\text{e}} \sum_{i=1}^N \bigg\langle\psi \bigg\vert \nabla^2_i \bigg\vert \psi \bigg\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the electron and &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplacian]] operator acting upon the coordinates of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; electron and the summation runs over all electrons.

The [[Density functional theory|density functional]] formalism of quantum mechanics requires knowledge of the electron density ''only'', i.e., it formally does not require knowledge of the wavefunction.  Given an electron density &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;, the exact N-electron kinetic energy functional is unknown; however, for the specific case of a 1-electron system, the kinetic energy can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; T[\rho]  =  \frac{1}{8} \int \frac{ \nabla \rho(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \nabla \rho(\mathbf{r}) }{ \rho(\mathbf{r}) } d^3r &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T[\rho]&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker|von Weizsäcker]] kinetic energy functional.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2777">'''Kramers' opacity law''' describes the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of a medium in terms of the ambient [[density]] and [[temperature]], assuming that the opacity is dominated by [[ionization|bound-free absorption]] (the absorption of light during ionization of a bound [[electron]]) or [[free-free absorption]] (the absorption of light when scattering a free ion, also called [[bremsstrahlung]]).&lt;ref&gt;Phillips (1999), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often used to model [[radiative transfer]], particularly in [[stellar atmosphere]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (1996), p. 274–276.&lt;/ref&gt;  The relation is named after the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[physicist]] [[Hendrik Kramers]], who first derived the form in 1923.&lt;ref name="Carroll274"&gt;Carroll (1996), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general functional form of the opacity law is

&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\kappa} \propto \rho T^{-7/2},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\kappa}&lt;/math&gt; is the resulting average opacity, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; the temperature of the medium.  Often the overall opacity is inferred from observations, and this form of the relation describes how changes in the density or temperature will affect the opacity.

==Calculation==

The specific forms for bound-free and free-free are

Bound-free:
&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\kappa}_{bf} = 4.34 \times 10^{25} \frac{g_{bf}}{t}Z(1+X) \frac{\rho}{\rm g/cm^3} \left(\frac{T}{\rm K}\right)^{-7/2} {\rm \, cm^2 \, g^{-1}},
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Bremsstrahlung|Free-free]]:
&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\kappa}_{ff} = 3.68 \times 10^{22} g_{ff}(1 - Z)(1 + X) \frac{\rho}{\rm g/cm^3} \left(\frac{T}{\rm K}\right)^{-7/2} {\rm \, cm^2 \, g^{-1}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Thomson scattering|Electron-scattering]]:
&lt;math&gt;
\bar{\kappa}_{es} = 0.2 (1+X) {\rm \, cm^2 \, g^{-1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;g_{bf}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_{ff}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Gaunt factor]]s (quantum mechanical correction terms) associated with bound-free and free-free transitions respectively. The &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is an additional correction factor, typically having a value between 1 and 100.  The opacity depends on the number density of electrons and ions in the medium, described by the fractional abundance (by mass) of elements heavier than [[hydrogen]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, and the fractional abundance (by mass) of hydrogen &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Carroll274"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38260">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Pennsylvania''' designated under the [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] (CERCLA) [[environmental law]].  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of November 29, 2010, there were 95 [[Superfund]] sites on the National Priorities List in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two additional sites are currently proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  Twenty-eight sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

Among the '''longest rivers of Mexico''' are 26 streams of at least {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}}. In the case of rivers such as the [[Colorado River|Colorado]], the length listed in the table below is solely that of the [[main stem]].&lt;ref name = "USGS Kammerer"&gt;{{cite web|last = Kammerer| first = J.C. |title = Largest Rivers in the United States|url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1987/ofr87-242/|publisher = United States Geological Survey |date = September 1, 2005|accessdate = July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] and [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]], it is the combined lengths of two river systems that share a [[delta (river)|delta]].&lt;ref name="Mexico Statistics"/&gt; In the case of the [[Nazas River|Nazas]] and [[Aguanaval River|Aguanaval]], it is the combined lengths of separate rivers that flow into the same [[Endorheic basin|closed basin]].&lt;ref name="Mexico Statistics"/&gt;

Three rivers in this list cross international boundaries or form them. The Colorado and the [[Rio Grande]] (Río Bravo del Norte or Río Bravo) begin in the United States and flow into Mexico, while the Usumacinta begins in [[Guatemala]] and flows into Mexico.&lt;ref name = "maps"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Road Atlas| publisher = Rand McNally &amp; Company|year = 2008|location = Chicago, Illinois|isbn = 0-528-93961-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adventure Map"/&gt; 

The primary source for the length, watershed, and [[surface runoff]] data in the table below is the 10th&amp;nbsp;edition of ''Statistics on Water in Mexico'', published by the National Water Commission in Mexico (CONAGUA); exceptions are as noted. [[U.S. state]]s and [[departments of Guatemala]] appear in italics in the "States" column.

==Possible real location reference for story==
The corresponding location in reality has been the topic of speculation, as no confirming evidence has been found. [[Jeffrey H. Tigay]] suggests that in the Sumerian version, through its association with the sun god Utu, "(t)he Cedar Mountain is implicitly located in the east, whereas in the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] versions, Gilgamesh's destination (is) removed from the east" and "explicitly located in the north west, in or near Lebanon".&lt;ref name="Tigay2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey H.

'''National Kitchens''' were [[restaurant]]s established in a [[British Government]] initiative during the [[First World War]] to feed people cheaply and economically, at a time when food supplies were scarce because of the [[German Empire|German]] [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-boat campaign]].

==History==
Before the outbreak of war in 1914, the [[United Kingdom]] relied on imported food to feed the population; as much as 60 percent of food stocks had come from abroad. In wartime, the increased costs of shipping together with a complete lack of any government controls led to a rapid rise in the price of food, especially meat and bread. In addition, the [[Imperial German Navy]] had launched an unrestricted submarine blockade; in April 1917, a record 550,000 tons of shipping had been sunk.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Peter (2012), ''First World War Britain'', Shire Books {{ISBN|978-0-74781-098-8}} (p. 41)&lt;/ref&gt; During the first years of the war, voluntary organisations began to open "communal kitchens" in various parts of the country. However, their public image was dreadful and only the poorest people made use of them. One government official stated: "It was thought that Public Kitchens were to be inflicted on the poor as some kind of punishment for a crime unstated". The newly created [[Ministry of Food]] adopted the idea of community kitchens but realised that they would have to be much better presented.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, L Margaret (1986) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LbxwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=lloyd+george+%22national+kitchens%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAmoVChMInoTxys3gxwIVhWnbCh2-PwGb#v=onepage&amp;q=lloyd%20george%20%22national%20kitchens%22&amp;f=false ''British Food Policy During the First World War''], Unwin Hyman, {{ISBN|978-0049421899}} (pp. 151-152)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Bryce Evans, the government was highly sensitive to possible criticism of the National Kitchens as being [[soup kitchens]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forrest|first1=Adam|title=The time when the government tried to feed everybody|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33275833|website=BBC News Magazine|accessdate=7 July 2015|ref=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food Control]] stated that the National Kitchens "must not resemble a soup kitchen for the poorest section of society" and should instead be places for "ordinary people in ordinary circumstances".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; A meal of soup, meat and vegetables was available for as little as [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]], equivalent to roughly £1 today. However, in some kitchens there was nowhere to sit&lt;ref name ="Teasdale"&gt;Teasdale, Vivien, ''Huddersfield in the Great War'', Pen &amp; Sword (2015), {{ISBN|978-1783463565}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in others patrons had to bring their own mugs and plates. In order to further distance them from charitable canteens, the kitchens were run in a businesslike manner: in at least one kitchen it was possible to "buy your Sunday dinner on Saturday"; the ability to show the means to pay for a meal in advance, and to make reservations as at a restaurant, would contribute to the image that the Kitchens were for "ordinary people."&lt;ref name=Inglis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Inglis|first1=G. I. S.|title=Kensington in the Great War|date=September 30, 2014|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Military|isbn=178303288X|ref=Inglis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first National Kitchen was opened by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in [[Westminster Bridge Road]], [[London]], on 21 May 1917.&lt;ref name ="Beckett"&gt;Beckett, Ian Frederick William (2006), ''Home Front 1914-1918: How Britain Survived the Great War'', The National Archives, {{ISBN|978-1-903365-81-6}} (p. 124)&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1918 there were 363 National Kitchens. The kitchens were partly funded by the state and could typically feed up to 2,000 people per day.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; They were mainly staffed by volunteers, particularly well-to-do women who were anxious to "do their bit" for the war effort; serving in the kitchens became known as "canteening".&lt;ref&gt;Doyle p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical menu comprised:
* soup
* [[Roasting|roast meat]]
* [[meat pie]]s
* [[fish]]
* [[suet pudding]]s
* milk puddings
* [[scone]]s
* [[cake]]s

The '''North Central Rockies forests''' is a [[temperate coniferous forest]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. This region gets more rain on average than the [[South Central Rockies forest]]s and is notable for containing the only inland populations of many species from the [[Pacific]] coast.

==Setting==
This ecoregion is located in the [[Rocky Mountains]] regions of southeastern [[British Columbia]], southwestern [[Alberta]], northwestern [[Montana]] and northern [[Idaho]]. The climate here is varied. Areas west of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] experience greater precipitation and the moderating effects of the [[Pacific Ocean]], while areas east of the Divide experience a drier, more continental climate. In the Canadian portion of the ecoregion, mean annual temperatures range from {{convert|3.5|°C|°F}} in the east to {{convert|5.5|°C|°F}} west, summer mean temperatures range from {{convert|12.5|°C|°F}} to {{convert|14.5|°C|°F}}, and average winter temperatures range from {{convert|-3.5|°C|°F}} to {{convert|-6.5|°C|°F}}. [[Valley]]s experience warm, wet summers and mildly cold, snowy winters, while [[subalpine zone]]s experience cool, wet summers with the possibility of [[frost]]s, and very cold, snowy winters. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is moderate to high, with valleys usually receiving between {{convert|500|mm|in}} and {{convert|800|mm|in}}, and high elevations receiving well over {{convert|1000|mm|in}}.

==Flora==
This ecoregion is predominately [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forest]]. Lower elevation forests are dominated by western hemlock (''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]''), western red cedar (''[[Thuja plicata]]'') and subalpine fir (''[[Abies lasiocarpa]]''), with smaller populations of [[lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta''), douglas-fir (''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]''), western white pine (''[[Pinus monticola]]'') and western larch (''[[Larix occidentalis]]''). Subalpine zones are dominated by Engelmann spruce (''[[Picea engelmanni]]''), subalpine fir (''Abies lasiocarpa''), and, in areas affected by fire, lodgepole pine (''Pinus contorta''). This ecoregion also contains meadows, foothill grasslands, riverside woodlands, and [[tree line]]/[[alpine zone]] communities.

==Fauna==
Mammals of the North Central Rockies forests include the [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[grizzly bear]] (''Ursus arctos horriblus''), [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo''), [[woodland caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus caribou''), [[American black bear|black bear]] (''[[cinnamon bear|Ursus americanus cinnamomum]]''), [[mountain goat]] (''Oreamnos americanus''), [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemonius''), [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), Rocky Mountain [[elk]] (''[[Rocky Mountain elk| Cervus canadensis nelson]]''), [[moose]] (''Alces alces''), [[coyote]] (''Canis latrans''), [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor''), [[bobcat]] (''Lynx rufus''), [[fisher (animal)| fisher]] (''Martes pennanti''), and [[American marten]] (''Martes americana'').

==Conservation status and protected areas==
Though large portions of this ecoregion are intact and protected, its conservation status is listed as "vulnerable". The main threats to this ecoregion's integrity are resource extraction and development, increasing human activity, logging, mining, livestock grazing and the introduction of exotic species.
Protected areas in this ecoregion include [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in northwestern Montana, [[Yoho National Park|Yoho]] and [[Kootenay National Park]]s in southeastern [[British Columbia]], [[Waterton Lakes National Park]] in far southwestern [[Alberta]] and the [[Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness]] in northeastern [[Idaho]].

'''Overexploitation''', also called '''overharvesting''', refers to harvesting a [[renewable resource]] to the [[point of diminishing returns]]. Continued overexploitation can lead to the destruction of the resource. The term applies to [[natural resource]]s such as: wild [[medicinal plant]]s, [[Pasture|grazing pasture]]s, [[Game (food)|game animals]], [[fish stocks]], [[forests]], and [[Aquifer|water aquifers]].

In [[ecology]], overexploitation describes one of the five main activities threatening global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Wilcoveetal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilcove |first=D. S. |first2=D. |last2=Rothstein |first3=J. |last3=Dubow |first4=A. |last4=Phillips |first5=E. |last5=Losos |year=1998 |title=Quantifying threats to imperiled species in the United States |journal=BioScience |volume=48 |issue= |pages=607–615 |doi=10.2307/1313420 |jstor= 1313420 |url= http://www.unc.edu/courses/2006spring/geog/144/001/www/readings/wilcove2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists use the term to describe populations that are harvested at a rate that is unsustainable, given their natural rates of mortality and capacities for reproduction. This can result in extinction at the population level and even extinction of whole species. In [[conservation biology]] the term is usually used in the context of human economic activity that involves the taking of biological resources, or organisms, in larger numbers than their populations can withstand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford. (1996). Oxford Dictionary of Biology. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used and defined somewhat differently in [[fisheries]], [[hydrology]] and [[natural resource management]].

Overexploitation can lead to resource destruction, including [[extinction]]s. However it is also possible for overexploitation to be sustainable, as [[#Fisheries|discussed below]] in the section on fisheries. In the context of fishing, the term [[overfishing]] can be used instead of overexploitation, as can [[overgrazing]] in [[stock management]], [[overlogging]] in [[forest management]], [[overdrafting]] in [[aquifer]] management, and [[endangered species]] in species monitoring. Overexploitation is not an activity limited to humans. Introduced predators and herbivores, for example, can overexploit native [[flora]] and [[fauna]].

==History==
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|right|When the giant flightless birds called [[moa]] were overexploited to the point of extinction,&lt;ref name=Holdaway /&gt; the giant [[Haast's eagle]] that preyed on them also became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennyson |first=A. |author2=Martinson, P. |year=2006 |title=Extinct Birds of New Zealand |publisher=Te Papa Press |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-909010-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Concern about overexploitation is relatively recent, though overexploitation itself is not a new phenomenon. It has been observed for millennia. For example, ceremonial cloaks worn by the Hawaiian kings were made from the [[mamo]] bird; a single cloak used the feathers of 70,000 birds of this now-extinct species. The [[dodo]], a flightless bird from [[Mauritius]], is another well-known example of overexploitation.  As with many island species, it was naive about certain predators, allowing humans to approach and kill it with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Fryer |date=2002-09-14 |title=Bringing the dodo back to life |work=BBC News |accessdate=2006-09-07 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2255991.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the earliest of times, [[hunting]] has been an important human activity as a means of survival. There is a whole history of overexploitation in the form of overhunting. The [[overkill hypothesis]] ([[Quaternary extinction event]]s) explains why the [[megafauna]]l extinctions occurred within a relatively short period of time. This can be traced with [[human migration]]. The most convincing evidence of this theory is that 80% of the North American large mammal species disappeared within 1000 years of the arrival of humans on the western hemisphere continents.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. Martin&lt;/ref&gt;  The fastest ever recorded extinction of [[megafauna]] occurred in [[New Zealand]], where by 1500 AD, just 200 years after settling the islands, ten species of the giant [[Moa|moa birds]] were hunted to extinction by the [[Māori people|Māori]].&lt;ref name=Holdaway&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holdaway |first=R. N. |authorlink= |author2=Jacomb, C. |year=2000 |title=Rapid Extinction of the Moas (Aves: Dinornithiformes): Model, Test, and Implications |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/gibbs/efb413/moa.pdf |volume=287 |issue=5461 |pages=2250–2254 |doi=10.1126/science.287.5461.2250 |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=10731144 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527164824/http://www.esf.edu/efb/gibbs/efb413/moa.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-27 |df= |bibcode=2000Sci...287.2250H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of extinctions occurred later with European settlement.

In more recent times, overexploitation has resulted in the gradual emergence of the concepts of [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], which has built on other concepts, such as [[sustainable yield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larkin |first=P.

==Overview==
Overexploitation doesn't necessarily lead to the destruction of the resource, nor is it necessarily unsustainable. However, [[resource depletion|depleting]] the numbers or amount of the resource can change its quality. For example, [[Livistona rotundifolia|footstool palm]] is a wild palm tree found in Southeast Asia. Its leaves are used for thatching and food wrapping, and overharvesting has resulted in its leaf size becoming smaller.

==Tragedy of the commons==
[[File:Cows on Selsley Common - geograph.org.uk - 192472.jpg|thumb|left|Cows on [[Selsley Common]]. The [[tragedy of the commons]] is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur.]]

The [[tragedy of the commons]] refers to a dilemma described in an article by that name written by [[Garrett Hardin]] and first published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |first=Garrett |last=Hardin |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |year=1968 |pages=1243–1248 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |pmid=5699198|bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H }} Also available [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to [[Tragedy of the commons#Garrett Hardin's essay|Hardin's essay]] is an example which is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur. This example was first sketched in an 1833 pamphlet by [[William Forster Lloyd]], as a hypothetical and simplified situation based on medieval [[land tenure]] in Europe, of herders sharing a [[Common land|common]] on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze. In Hardin's example, it is in each herder's interest to put each succeeding cow he acquires onto the land, even if the [[carrying capacity]] of the common is exceeded and it is temporarily or permanently damaged for all as a result. The herder receives all of the benefits from an additional cow, while the damage to the common is shared by the entire group. If all herders make this individually rational economic decision, the common will be overexploited or even destroyed to the detriment of all. However, since all herders reach the same rational conclusion, overexploitation in the form of [[overgrazing]] occurs, with immediate losses, and the pasture may be degraded to the point where it gives very little return.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons." (Hardin, 1968)&lt;ref name=hardin68 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the course of his essay, Hardin develops the theme, drawing in many examples of latter day commons, such as [[national park]]s, the atmosphere, oceans, rivers and [[fish stocks]]. The example of fish stocks had led some to call this the "tragedy of the fishers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Bowles |title=Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=27–29 |year=2004 |isbn=0-691-09163-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme running through the essay is the growth of human populations, with the [[Earth]]'s finite resources being the general common.

The tragedy of the commons has intellectual roots tracing back to [[Aristotle]], who noted that "what is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=E. |year=1992 |chapter=The rudiments of a theory of the origins, survival, and performance of common-property institutions |editor-first=D. W. |editor-last=Bromley |title=Making the Commons Work: Theory, Practice and Policy |location=San Francisco |publisher=ICS Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to [[Hobbes]] and his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feeny |first=D. |year=1990 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons: Twenty-two years later |journal=Human Ecology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1007/BF00889070 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite situation to a tragedy of the commons is sometimes referred to as a [[tragedy of the anticommons]]: a situation in which rational individuals, acting separately, collectively waste a given resource by underutilizing it.

The tragedy of the commons can be avoided if it is appropriately regulated. Hardin's use of "commons" has frequently been misunderstood, leading Hardin to later remark that he should have titled his work "The tragedy of the unregulated commons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fe20060726sh.html |title=Will commons sense dawn again in time? |work=The Japan Times Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fisheries==
[[File:Bluefin-big.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] is currently seriously overexploited. Scientists say 7,500 tons annually is the sustainable limit, yet the fishing industry continue to harvest 60,000 tons.]]

In [[wild fisheries]], overexploitation or [[overfishing]] occurs when a [[fish stock]] has been fished down "below the size that, on average, would support the long-term [[maximum sustainable yield]] of the fishery".&lt;ref&gt;[[NOAA]]: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/fishwatch/glossary.htm ''FishWatch glossary''] Retrieved 2 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, overexploitation can be sustainable.

When a fishery starts harvesting fish from a previously unexploited stock, the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of the fish stock will decrease, since harvesting means fish are being removed. For sustainability, the rate at which the fish replenish biomass through reproduction must balance the rate at which the fish are being harvested. If the harvest rate is increased, then the stock biomass will further decrease. At a certain point, the maximum harvest yield that can be sustained will be reached, and further attempts to increase the harvest rate will result in the collapse of the fishery. This point is called the [[maximum sustainable yield]], and in practice, usually occurs when the fishery has been fished down to about 30% of the biomass it had before harvesting started.&lt;ref&gt;Bolden, E.G., Robinson, W.L. (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PL6r1Ir_x_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Wildlife+ecology+and+management%22&amp;ei=ugW6SpjREJCINMbR1L8P#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Wildlife ecology and management''] 4th ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ. {{ISBN|0-13-840422-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to fish the stock down further to, say, 15% of the pre-harvest biomass, and then adjust the harvest rate so the biomass remains at that level. In this case, the fishery is sustainable, but is now overexploited, because the stock has been run down to the point where the sustainable yield is less than it could be.

Fish stocks are said to "collapse" if their biomass declines by more than 95 percent of their maximum historical biomass. [[Atlantic cod]] stocks were severely overexploited in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to their abrupt collapse in 1992.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; Even though fishing has ceased, the cod stocks have failed to recover.&lt;ref name=Frank/&gt; The absence of cod as the [[apex predator]] in many areas has led to [[trophic cascade]]s.&lt;ref name=Frank/&gt;

About 25% of world fisheries are now overexploited to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grafton | first1 = RQ | authorlink3 = Ray Hilborn | last2 = Kompas | first2 = T | last3 = Hilborn | first3 = RW | year = 2007 | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5856/1601 | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5856| page = 1601 | doi=10.1126/science.1146017 | bibcode=2007Sci...318.1601G | pmid=18063793}}&lt;/ref&gt; These depleted fisheries can often recover if fishing pressure is reduced until the stock biomass returns to the optimal biomass. At this point, harvesting can be resumed near the maximum sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = AA | year = 2003 | title = Managing to the margins: the overexploitation of fisheries | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–106 | doi = 10.1890/1540-9295(2003)001[0102:MTTMTO]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tragedy of the commons]] can be avoided within the context of fisheries if fishing effort and practices are regulated appropriately by [[fisheries management]]. One effective approach may be assigning some measure of ownership in the form of  [[individual transferable quota]]s (ITQs) to fishermen. In 2008, a large scale study of fisheries that used ITQs, and ones that didn't, provided strong evidence that ITQs help prevent collapses and restore fisheries that appear to be in decline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn14762-guaranteed-fish-quotas-halt-commercial-freeforall.html  New Scientist: Guaranteed fish quotas halt commercial free-for-all]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=12253181 A Rising Tide: Scientists find proof that privatising fishing stocks can avert a disaster] The Economist, 18th Sept, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water resources, such as [[lake]]s and [[aquifer]]s, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don't recharge). Overexploitation occurs if a water resource, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate, that is, at a rate that exceeds the practical sustained yield. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. An aquifer which has been overexploited is said to be [[Overdrafting|overdrafted]] or depleted.  Forests enhance the recharge of [[aquifer]]s in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation: UN Report|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|archivedate=2001-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Conrad2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/byauthor/244797 |last= Conrad|first= C.|title= Forests of eucalyptus shadowed by questions |date= 2008-06-21|publisher= [[Arizona Daily Star]]|accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206103926/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/byauthor/244797 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as [[nitrate]]s, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean.

This has led to the concept of [[peak water]].

==Forest resources==
{{see|Overlogging}}
[[File:Gordon River Clearcut.jpg|thumb|right|Clear cutting of old growth forests in Canada.]]

[[Forest]]s are overexploited when they are [[Logging|logged]] at a rate faster than [[reforestation]] takes place. Reforestation competes with other land uses such as food production, livestock grazing, and living space for further economic growth. Historically utilization of forest products, including timber and fuel wood, have played a key role in human societies, comparable to the roles of water and cultivable land. Today, developed countries continue to utilize timber for building houses, and wood pulp for [[paper]]. In developing countries almost three billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;http://atlas.aaas.org/pdf/63-66.pdf Forest Products&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term economic gains made by [[Deforestation|conversion of forest]] to agriculture, or overexploitation of wood products, typically leads to loss of long-term income and long term biological productivity. [[West Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[Southeast Asia]] and many other regions have experienced lower revenue because of overexploitation and the consequent declining timber harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0905.htm|title=Destruction of Renewable Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered species==
[[File:Overgrazing.JPG|thumb|right|It is not just humans that overexploit resources. [[Overgrazing]] can be caused by native fauna, as shown in the upper right. However, past human overexploitation (leading to elimination of some predators) may be behind the situation.]]

Overexploitation threatens one-third of endangered [[vertebrate]]s, as well as other groups. Excluding edible fish, the illegal [[wildlife trade|trade in wildlife]] is valued at $10 billion per year.  Industries responsible for this include the trade in [[bushmeat]], the trade in [[Chinese medicine]], and the [[fur trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Hemley 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or [[CITES]] was set up in order to control and regulate the trade in endangered animals.  It currently protects, to a varying degree, some 33,000 species of animals and plants. It is estimated that a quarter of the endangered vertebrates in the United States of America and half of the endangered mammals is attributed to overexploitation.&lt;ref name=Wilcoveetal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Primack |first=R. B. |year=2002 |title=Essentials of Conservation Biology |edition=3rd |location=Sunderland |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=0-87893-719-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All living organisms require resources to survive. Overexploitation of these resources for protracted periods can deplete natural stocks to the point where they are unable to recover within a short time frame. Humans have always harvested food and other resources they have needed to survive.  Human populations, historically, were small, and methods of collection limited to small quantities. With an exponential increase in human population, expanding markets and increasing demand, combined with improved access and techniques for capture, are causing the [[exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] of many species beyond sustainable levels.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 1992, Fitzgibon ''et al.'' 1995, Cuarón 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In practical terms, if continued, it reduces valuable resources to such low levels that their exploitation is no longer sustainable and can lead to the [[extinction]] of a species, in addition to having dramatic, unforeseen [[keystone species|effects]], on the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frankham |first=R. |last2=Ballou |first2=J. D. |last3=Briscoe |first3=D. A. |year=2002 |title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-63014-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overexploitation often occurs rapidly as markets open, utilising previously untapped resources, or locally used species.

[[File:Conuropsis carolinensisAWP026AA2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carolina parakeet]] was hunted to extinction.]]

Today, overexploitation and misuse of natural resources is an ever-present threat for [[species richness]].  This is more prevalent when looking at [[island ecology]] and the species that inhabit them, as islands can be viewed as the world in miniature.  Island [[Endemism|endemic]] populations are more prone to [[extinction]] from overexploitation, as they often exist at low densities with reduced reproductive rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dowding |first=J.

As another example, when the humble [[Erinaceus europaeus|hedgehog]] was introduced to the Scottish island of [[Uist]], the population greatly expanded and took to consuming and overexploiting shorebird eggs, with drastic consequences for their breeding success.  Twelve species of [[Bird|avifauna]] are affected, with some species numbers being reduced by 39%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=D. B. |last2=Fuller |first2=R.

Where there is substantial human migration, civil unrest, or war, controls may no longer exist.  With civil unrest, for example in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Rwanda]], firearms have become common and the breakdown of food distribution networks in such countries leaves the resources of the natural environment vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=R. F. |year=1990 |title=Farewell to Africa |journal=Audubon |volume=92 |issue= |pages=1547–1551 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals are even killed as target practice, or simply to spite the government.  Populations of large primates, such as [[gorilla]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s, [[ungulate]]s and other mammals, may be reduced by 80% or more by hunting, and certain species may be eliminated altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkie |first=D.

Overall, 50 bird species that have become extinct since 1500 (approximately 40% of the total) have been subject to overexploitation,&lt;ref&gt;The LUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* [[Pinguinus impennis|Great Auk]] – the penguin-like bird of the north, was hunted for its feathers, meat, fat and oil.
* [[Carolina parakeet]] – The only parrot species native to the eastern United States, was hunted for crop protection and its feathers.

Other species affected by overexploitation include: 

* The international trade in fur: [[chinchilla]], [[vicuña]], [[giant otter]] and numerous cat species
* Insect collectors: butterflies
* Horticulturists: New Zealand mistletoe (''Trilepidia adamsii''), orchids, cacti and many other plant species

==Cascade effects==
[[Image:Kelp forest.jpg|thumb|left|Overexploiting [[sea otter]]s resulted in [[cascade effect]]s which destroyed [[kelp forest]] ecosystems.]]

Overexploitation of species can result in knock-on or [[cascade effect]]s. This can particularly apply if, through overexploitation, a habitat loses its [[apex predator]]. Because of the loss of the top predator, a [[Overpopulation in wild animals|dramatic increase]] in their [[prey]] species can occur. In turn, the unchecked prey can then overexploit their own food resources until population numbers dwindle, possibly to the point of extinction.

A classic example of cascade effects occurred with [[sea otters]]. Starting before the 17th century and not phased out until 1911, sea otters were hunted aggressively for their exceptionally warm and valuable pelts, which could fetch up to $2500 US. This caused cascade effects through the [[kelp forest]] ecosystems along the Pacific Coast of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Estes |first=J. A. |first2=D. O. |last2=Duggins |first3=G. B. |last3=Rathbun |year=1989 |title=The ecology of extinctions in kelp forest communities |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251–264 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1989.tb00085.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sea otters’ primary food sources is the [[sea urchin]]. When hunters caused sea otter populations to decline, an [[ecological release]] of sea urchin populations occurred. The sea urchins then overexploited their main food source, [[kelp]], creating urchin barrens, areas of seabed denuded of kelp, but carpeted with urchins. No longer having food to eat, the sea urchin became [[locally extinct]] as well. Also, since kelp forest ecosystems are homes to many other species, the loss of the kelp caused other cascade effects of secondary extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dayton |first=P. K. |first2=M. J. |last2=Tegner |first3=P. B. |last3=Edwards |first4=K. L. |last4=Riser |year=1998 |title=Sliding baselines, ghosts, and reduced expectations in kelp forest communities |journal=Ecol. Appl. |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=309–322 |doi=10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008[0309:SBGARE]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, when only one small group of 32 sea otters survived in a remote cove, an international treaty was signed to prevent further exploitation of the sea otters. Under heavy protection, the otters multiplied and repopulated the depleted areas, which slowly recovered. More recently, with declining numbers of fish stocks, again due to overexploitation, [[Orcinus orca|killer whales]] have experienced a food shortage and have been observed feeding on sea otters, again reducing their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krebs |first=C. J. |year=2001 |title=Ecology |edition=5th |location=San Francisco |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |isbn=0-321-04289-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ozone''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|z|oʊ|n}}, or '''trioxygen''', is an inorganic [[molecule]] with the [[chemical formula]] '''{{Chem|O|3|}}'''. It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively [[pungent]] smell. It is an [[allotrope]] of [[oxygen]] that is much less stable than the [[diatomic]] allotrope {{Chem|O|2}}, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to {{Chem|O|2}} or [[dioxygen]]. Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) and  electrical discharges within the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the [[ozone layer]] of the [[stratosphere]], which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

Ozone's odour is reminiscent of [[chlorine]], and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as {{val|0.1|ul=ppm}} in air. Ozone's O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be [[diamagnetic]]. In [[standard conditions]], ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue [[liquid]] and finally a violet-black [[solid]]. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point.&lt;ref name=streng&gt;{{Cite journal

It is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations.

Ozone is a powerful [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] (far more so than dioxygen) and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidising potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about {{val|0.1|u=ppm}}. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.

==Nomenclature==
The [[trivial name]] ''ozone'' is the most commonly used and [[preferred IUPAC name]]. The systematic names ''2λ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-trioxidiene'' and ''catena-trioxygen'', valid [[IUPAC]] names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. The name ''ozone'' derives from ''ozein'' (ὄζειν), the [[greek language|Greek]] verb for smell, referring to ozone's distinctive smell.

In appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as [[trioxidane]] with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, ''trioxidanylidene'' may be used as a context-specific systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule. In even more specific context, this can also name the non-radical singlet ground state, whereas the diradical state is named ''trioxidanediyl''.

''Trioxidanediyl'' (or ''ozonide'') is used, non-systematically, to refer to the substituent group (-OOO-). Care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context-specific name for ozone given above.

==History==
[[File:Schönbein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] (18 October 1799 – 29 August 1868)]]
[[File:Smyths revised ozonometer, 1865. (9660571191).jpg|right|thumb|A prototype ozonometer built by John Smyth in 1865]]
In 1785, the Dutch chemist [[Martinus van Marum]] was conducting experiments involving electrical sparking above water when he noticed an unusual smell, which he attributed to the electrical reactions, failing to realize that he had in fact created ozone.&lt;ref name="colostate"/&gt; 

A half century later, [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] noticed the same pungent odour and recognized it as the smell often following a bolt of [[lightning]]. In 1839, he succeeded in isolating the gaseous chemical and named it "ozone", from the Greek word ''{{lang|el|ozein}}'' ({{lang|el|ὄζειν}}) meaning "to smell".&lt;ref name="ozo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubin |first=Mordecai B.|year=2001 |title=The History of Ozone: The Schönbein Period, 1839–1868 |journal=[[Bull.

For much of the second half of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, ozone was considered a healthy component of the environment by naturalists and health-seekers. [[Beaumont, California|Beaumont]], [[California]] had as its official slogan "Beaumont: Zone of Ozone", as evidenced on postcards and Chamber of Commerce letterhead.&lt;ref&gt;Redlands Chamber of Commerce Collection, City Archives, A.K. Smiley Public Library, Redlands, CA&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists working outdoors often considered the higher elevations beneficial because of their ozone content. "There is quite a different atmosphere [at higher elevation] with enough ozone to sustain the necessary energy [to work]", wrote naturalist [[Henry Henshaw]], working in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Henshaw to William Brewster, July 2, 1902, Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Seaside air was considered to be healthy because of its believed ozone content; but the smell giving rise to this belief is in fact that of halogenated seaweed metabolites.&lt;ref name="ashfield"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/6044238/The-science-behind-that-fresh-seaside-smell.html|title=The science behind that fresh seaside smell|accessdate=|work = The Telegraph |last = O'Connell|first = Sanjida|date = 18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of ozone's appeal seems to have resulted from its "fresh" smell, which evoked associations with purifying properties. Scientists, however, noted its harmful effects. In 1873 [[James Dewar]] and [[John Gray McKendrick]] documented that frogs grew sluggish, birds gasped for breath, and rabbits’ blood showed decreased levels of oxygen after exposure to "ozonized air", which "exercised a destructive action".&lt;ref name="Anstie"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anstie|first1=Francis|title=Clinic of the Month: Dr. McKendrick on Ozone|journal=The Practitioner: A Journal of Therapeutics and Public Health|date=1874|volume=12|issue=January–June|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrsvAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; Schönbein himself reported that chest pains, irritation of the [[mucous membranes]] and difficulty breathing occurred as a result of inhaling ozone, and small mammals died.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Mordecai B.|title=THE HISTORY OF OZONE.

The only thoroughly well-ascertained knowledge concerning the physiological effect of ozone, so far attained, is that it causes irritation and œdema of the lungs, and death if inhaled in relatively strong concentration for any time."&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=L.|last2=Flack|first2=M.|title=The Physiological Influence of Ozone|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=28 December 1911|volume=84|issue=573|pages=404–415|doi=10.1098/rspb.1911.0086|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/84/573/404|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], ozone was tested at [[Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital]] in London as a possible [[disinfectant]] for wounds.  The gas was applied directly to wounds for as long as 15 minutes. This resulted in damage to both bacterial cells and human tissue. Other sanitizing techniques, such as irrigation with [[antiseptics]], were found preferable.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoker |first=George | title=The Surgical Uses of Ozone| journal =Lancet |volume=188 |issue=4860 | year = 1916 | page = 712 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)31717-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
Ozone is colourless or pale blue gas (blue when liquefied), slightly soluble in water and much more soluble in inert non-polar solvents such as [[carbon tetrachloride]] or fluorocarbons, in which it forms a blue solution. At {{convert|161|K}}, it condenses to form a dark blue [[liquid]]. It is dangerous to allow this liquid to warm to its boiling point, because both concentrated gaseous ozone and liquid ozone can detonate. At temperatures below {{convert|80|K}}, it forms a violet-black [[solid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people can detect about 0.01 μmol/mol of ozone in air where it has a very specific sharp odour somewhat resembling [[chlorine bleach]]. Exposure of 0.1 to 1 μmol/mol produces headaches, burning eyes and irritation to the respiratory passages.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book

Even low concentrations of ozone in air are very destructive to organic materials such as latex, plastics and animal lung tissue.

Ozone is [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]], with all its electrons paired. In contrast, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], containing two unpaired electrons.

==Structure==
According to experimental evidence from [[microwave spectroscopy]], ozone is a bent molecule, with C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] (similar to the [[water]] molecule). The O – O distances are {{convert|127.2|pm|Å|abbr=on|lk=on}}.

The arrangement possesses an overall [[bond order]] of 1.5 for both sides.

==Reactions==
Ozone is among the most powerful [[oxidizing]] agents known, far stronger than O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also unstable at high concentrations, decaying into ordinary oxygen. Its [[half-life]] varies with atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air movement. In a sealed chamber with a fan that moves the gas, ozone has a half-life of approximately one day at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Half-life time of ozone as a function of air conditions and movement McClurkin, J.D.*#1, Maier, D.E.2. {{DOI|10.5073/jka.2010.425.167.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unverified claims assert that ozone can have a half life of as short as thirty minutes under atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Resources/FAQs/ozone.html – Earth Science FAQ: Where can I find information about the ozone hole and ozone depletion?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601061532/http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Resources/FAQs/ozone.html |date=2006-06-01 }} ''Goddard Space Flight Center'', National Aeronautics and Space Administration, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 {{chem|O|3}} → 3 {{chem|O|2}}

This reaction proceeds more rapidly with increasing temperature. [[Deflagration]] of ozone can be triggered by a spark and can occur in ozone concentrations of 10 [[wt%]] or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/jpg/papersb/full%20papers/K-106.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jlp.2005.07.020|title=Explosion properties of highly concentrated ozone gas|year=2005|last1=Koike|first1=K|last2=Nifuku|first2=M|last3=Izumi|first3=K|last4=Nakamura|first4=S|last5=Fujiwara|first5=S|last6=Horiguchi|first6=S|journal=Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries|volume=18|page=465|issue=4–6|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327085613/http://www.iitk.ac.in/che/jpg/papersb/full%20papers/K-106.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone can also be produced from oxygen at the anode of an electrochemical cell. This reaction can create smaller quantities of ozone for research purposes.

This can be observed as an unwanted reaction in a Hoffman gas apparatus during the electrolysis of water when the voltage is set above the necessary voltage.

===With metals===
Ozone will oxidize most [[metal]]s (except [[gold]], [[platinum]], and [[iridium]]) to [[oxide]]s of the metals in their highest [[oxidation state]]. For example:

: {{chem|Cu}} + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|Cu|O}} + {{chem|O|2}}

===With nitrogen and carbon compounds===
Ozone also oxidizes [[nitric oxide]] to [[nitrogen dioxide]]:
: NO + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|O|2}}
This reaction is accompanied by [[chemiluminescence]]. The {{chem|N|O|2}} can be further oxidized:
: {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|3}} + {{chem|O|2}}
The {{chem|N|O|3}} formed can react with {{chem|N|O|2}} to form {{chem|N|2|O|5|link=Dinitrogen pentoxide}}.

Solid [[nitronium perchlorate]] can be made from NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and {{chem|O|3}} gases:
: {{chem|N|O|2}} + {{chem|Cl|O|2}} + 2 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|O|2|Cl|O|4}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}}

Ozone does not react with ammonium [[Salt_(chemistry)|salt]]s, but it oxidizes [[ammonia]] to [[ammonium nitrate]]:
: 2 {{chem|N|H|3}} + 4 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|N|H|4|N|O|3}} + 4 {{chem|O|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Ozone reacts with [[carbon]]&lt;!--graphite?--&gt; to form [[carbon dioxide]], even at room temperature:
: C + 2 {{chem|O|3}} → {{chem|C|O|2}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}}

===With sulfur compounds===
Ozone oxidises [[sulfide]]s to [[sulfate]]s. For example, [[lead(II) sulfide]] is oxidised to [[lead(II) sulfate]]:
: PbS + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Sulfuric acid]] can be produced from ozone, water and either elemental [[sulfur]] or [[sulfur dioxide]]:
: S + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
: 3 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

In the [[gas phase]], ozone reacts with [[hydrogen sulfide]] to form sulfur dioxide:
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In an [[aqueous]] solution, however, two competing simultaneous reactions occur, one to produce elemental sulfur, and one to produce [[sulfuric acid]]:
: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → S + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
: 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

===With alkenes and alkynes===
{{main|ozonolysis}}
Alkenes can be oxidatively cleaved by ozone, in a process called [[ozonolysis]], giving alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, depending on the second step of the workup.

:[[File:Ozonolysis scheme.svg]]

Ozone can also cleave alkynes to form a [[acid anhydride]] or [[diketone]] product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey|first= P. S. |chapter=Chapter 2| title=Ozonation in Organic Chemistry |volume=2 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York, NY |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-12-073102-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the reaction is performed in the presence of water, the anhydride hydrolyzes to give two [[carboxylic acid]]s.

:[[File:Ozonolysis-alkyne.png|none|450px]]

Usually ozonolysis is carried out in a solution of [[dichloromethane]], at a temperature of −78&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. After a sequence of cleavage and rearrangement, an organic ozonide is formed. With reductive workup (e.g. [[zinc]] in [[acetic acid]] or [[dimethyl sulfide]]), ketones and aldehydes will be formed, with oxidative workup (e.g. aqueous or alcoholic [[hydrogen peroxide]]), carboxylic acids will be formed.&lt;ref name="OrgChem"&gt;{{cite book

===Other substrates===

All three [[atom]]s of ozone may also react, as in the reaction of [[tin(II) chloride]] with [[hydrochloric acid]] and ozone:
: 3 SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + {{chem|O|3}} → 3 SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Iodine perchlorate can be made by treating [[iodine]] dissolved in cold [[anhydrous]] [[perchloric acid]] with ozone:
: I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 I(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Combustion===
Ozone can be used for [[combustion]] reactions and combustible gases; ozone provides higher temperatures than burning in [[dioxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The following is a reaction for the combustion of [[carbon subnitride]] which can also cause higher temperatures:

: 3 {{chem|C|4|N|2}} + 4 {{chem|O|3}} → 12 CO + 3 {{chem|N|2}}

Ozone can react at cryogenic temperatures. At {{convert|77|K}}, atomic [[hydrogen]] reacts with liquid ozone to form a hydrogen [[superoxide]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]], which [[dimerizes]]:&lt;ref name="Horvath M. 1985. pg 44"&gt;{{cite book|year=1985|title=Ozone|pages=44–49|author1=Horvath M. |author2=Bilitzky L. |author3=Huttner J. |isbn=978-0-444-99625-1|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: H + {{chem|O|3}} → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O
: 2 HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|H|2|O|4}}

===Reduction to ozonides===
Reduction of ozone gives the [[ozonide]] anion, O{{sup sub|−|3}}. Derivatives of this anion are explosive and must be stored at cryogenic temperatures. Ozonides for all the [[alkali metal]]s are known. KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, RbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be prepared from their respective superoxides:
: KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Although KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be formed as above, it can also be formed from [[potassium hydroxide]] and ozone:&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 2 KOH + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 KO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
NaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and LiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must be prepared by action of CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in liquid NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on an [[ion exchange resin]] containing Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft2nd|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NaO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
A solution of [[calcium]] in ammonia reacts with ozone to give to ammonium ozonide and not calcium ozonide:&lt;ref name="Horvath M. 1985. pg 44"/&gt;
: 3 Ca + 10 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 {{chem|O|3}} → Ca·6NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Applications===
Ozone can be used to remove [[iron]] and [[manganese]] from [[water]], forming a [[precipitate]] which can be filtered:
: 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
: 2 Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 MnO(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
Ozone will also oxidize dissolved [[hydrogen sulfide]] in water to [[sulfurous acid]]:
: 3 {{chem|O|3}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These three reactions are central in the use of ozone based well water treatment.

Ozone will also detoxify [[cyanide]]s by converting them to [[cyanate]]s.
: CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|CNO|-}} + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Ozone will also completely decompose [[urea]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1985|title=Ozone|pages=259, 269–270|author1=Horvath M. |author2=Bilitzky L. |author3=Huttner J. |isbn=978-0-444-99625-1|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Spectroscopic properties==

Ozone is a bent [[triatomic molecule]] with three vibrational modes: the symmetric stretch (1103.157&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), bend (701.42&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and antisymmetric stretch (1042.096&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=B4000064&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=800#ref-1|title = Ozone |date = |accessdate = |website =NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology |publisher =U.S. Department of Commerce |last = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symmetric stretch and bend are weak absorbers, but the antisymmetric stretch is strong and responsible for ozone being an important minor [[greenhouse gas]]. This IR band is also used to detect ambient and atmospheric ozone although UV based measurements are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapterurl = https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/Ed2008Up2010/Part-I/WMO8_Ed2008_PartI_Ch16_Up2010_en.pdf|chapter= Chapter 16: Measurement of Ozone|title = Part I: Measurement of Meteorological Variables|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = World Meteorological Organization|first = |deadurl =yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160331164807/https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/Ed2008Up2010/Part-I/WMO8_Ed2008_PartI_Ch16_Up2010_en.pdf|archivedate =31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electronic spectrum of ozone is quite complex. An overview can be seen at the MPI Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Ozone/O3_overview_log.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Max Planck Institute – Mainz|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the bands are dissociative, meaning that the molecule falls apart to {{nobr|O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} after absorbing a photon. The most important absorption is the Hartley band, extending from slightly above 300&amp;nbsp;nm down to slightly above 200&amp;nbsp;nm. It is this band that is responsible for absorbing UV&amp;nbsp;C in the stratosphere.

On the high wavelength side, the Hartley band transitions to the so-called Huggins band, which falls off rapidly until disappearing by ~360&amp;nbsp;nm. Above 400&amp;nbsp;nm, extending well out into the NIR, are the Chappius and Wulf bands. There, unstructured absorption bands are useful for detecting high ambient concentrations of ozone, but are so weak that they do not have much practical effect.

There are additional absorption bands in the far UV, which increase slowly from 200&amp;nbsp;nm down to reaching a maximum at ~120&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Ozone in Earth's atmosphere==
[[File:Atmospheric ozone.svg|thumb|The distribution of atmospheric ozone in partial pressure as a function of altitude]][[File:Nimbus ozone Brewer-Dobson circulation.jpg|thumb|Concentration of ozone as measured by the [[Nimbus program|Nimbus-7]] satellite]]
[[File:IM ozavg ept 200006.png|thumb|Total ozone concentration in June 2000 as measured by EP-TOMS satellite instrument]]
The standard way to express total ozone levels (the amount of ozone in a given vertical column) in the atmosphere is by using [[Dobson unit]]s. Point measurements are reported as [[mole fraction]]s in nmol/mol (parts per billion, ppb) or as [[concentration]]s in μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The study of ozone concentration in the atmosphere started in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozmeas.htm|title=Measured Ozone Depletion| work= Ozone-Information.com| accessdate=2014-01-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130914112129/http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozmeas.htm |archivedate = 2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ozone layer===
{{Main|Ozone layer}}

====Location and production====
The highest levels of ozone in the atmosphere are in the [[stratosphere]], in a region also known as the [[ozone layer]] between about 10&amp;nbsp;km and 50&amp;nbsp;km above the surface (or between about 6 and 31 miles). However, even in this "layer", the ozone concentrations are only two to eight parts per million, so most of the oxygen there is dioxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, at about 210,000 parts per million by volume.&lt;ref name=“Hultman”&gt;{{cite book | last= Hultman | first= G. Eric | date= 1980-01-01 | title= The Ozone Survival Manual |url= |location= |publisher= McGraw-Hill |page= |isbn= 9780915498734 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone in the stratosphere is mostly produced from short-wave ultraviolet rays between 240 and 160&amp;nbsp;nm. Oxygen starts to absorb weakly at 240&amp;nbsp;nm in the Herzberg bands, but most of the oxygen is dissociated by absorption in the strong '''[[Schumann–Runge bands]]''' between 200 and 160&amp;nbsp;nm where ozone does not absorb. While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121&amp;nbsp;nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest: O2, Lyman-alpha|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Keller-Rudek|first = Hannelore|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015120/http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of ozone creation and destruction is called the [[Chapman cycle]] and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen

:{{chem|O|2}} + [[photon]] (radiation λ &lt; 240 nm) → 2 O
followed by reaction of the oxygen atom with another molecule of oxygen to form ozone.
:O + {{chem|O|2}} + M → {{chem|O|3}} + M

where "M" denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction. The ozone molecule can then absorb a UV-C photon and dissociate

{{chem|O|3}} → O + {{chem|O|2}} + kinetic energy

The excess kinetic energy heats the stratosphere when the O atoms and the molecular oxygen fly apart and collide with other molecules. This conversion of UV light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule as in the previous step to form more ozone. In the clear atmosphere, with only nitrogen and oxygen, ozone can react with the atomic oxygen to form two molecules of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:{{chem|O|3}} + O → 2 {{chem|O|2}}

An estimate of the rate of this termination step to the cycling of atomic oxygen back to ozone can be found simply by taking the ratios of the concentration of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The termination reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the presence of certain free radicals, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), nitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). In the second half of the 20th Century the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining, mostly because of increasing concentrations of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFC) and similar [[Haloalkane|chlorinated and brominated organic molecules]]. The concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], the ban on the production of many [[Ozone depletion|ozone depleting]] chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st Century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations.

====Importance to surface-dwelling life on Earth====
[[Image:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|thumb|Levels of ozone at various altitudes and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation. Essentially all UVC (100–280&amp;nbsp;nm) is blocked by dioxygen (at 100–200&amp;nbsp;nm) or by ozone (at 200–280&amp;nbsp;nm) in the atmosphere. The shorter portion of this band and even more energetic UV causes the formation of the ozone layer, when single oxygen atoms produced by UV [[photolysis]] of dioxygen (below 240&amp;nbsp;nm) react with more dioxygen. The ozone layer itself then blocks most, but not quite all, sunburn-producing UVB (280–315&amp;nbsp;nm). The band of UV closest to visible light, UVA (315–400&amp;nbsp;nm), is hardly affected by ozone, and most of it reaches the ground.]]

Ozone in the ozone layer filters out sunlight wavelengths from about 200&amp;nbsp;nm UV rays to 315&amp;nbsp;nm, with ozone peak absorption at about 250&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr0205255|title=Photolysis of Atmospheric Ozone in the Ultraviolet Region|year=2003|last1=Matsumi|first1=Yutaka|last2=Kawasaki|first2=Masahiro|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=103|issue=12|pages=4767–82|pmid=14664632}} See the graphical absorption of ozone in two of its absorption bands, as a function of wavelength.&lt;/ref&gt; This ozone UV absorption is important to life, since it extends the absorption of UV by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air (which absorb all wavelengths &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;nm) through the lower UV-C (200–280&amp;nbsp;nm) and the entire UV-B band (280–315&amp;nbsp;nm). The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290&amp;nbsp;nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful at the top of the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of [[vitamin D]] in humans.

The ozone layer has little effect on the longer UV wavelengths called UV-A (315–400&amp;nbsp;nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage, and while it probably does cause long-term skin damage in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see [[ultraviolet]] for more information on near ultraviolet).

===Low level ozone===
{{Main|Tropospheric ozone|Photochemical smog}}

Low level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant.&lt;ref name=who-Europe&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/112199/E79097.pdf Health Aspects of Air Pollution with Particulate Matter, Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide]. WHO-Europe report 13–15 January 2003 (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; It is not emitted directly by [[Internal combustion engine|car engines]] or by industrial operations, but formed by the reaction of sunlight on air containing [[Volatile organic compound|hydrocarbon]]s and [[nitrogen oxide]]s that react to form ozone directly at the source of the pollution or many kilometers down wind.

Ozone reacts directly with some hydrocarbons such as [[aldehyde]]s and thus begins their removal from the air, but the products are themselves key components of [[photochemical smog|smog]]. Ozone [[photolysis]] by UV light leads to production of the [[hydroxyl radical]] HO• and this plays a part in the removal of hydrocarbons from the air, but is also the first step in the creation of components of smog such as [[peroxyacyl nitrates]], which can be powerful eye irritants. The atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days; its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground, the above-mentioned reaction giving HO•, and by reactions with OH and the peroxy radical HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =Stevenson| year=2006|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2005JD006338.shtml|title=Multimodel ensemble simulations of present-day and near-future tropospheric ozone| publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|accessdate=2006-09-16|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of significant reduction in agricultural yields because of increased ground-level ozone and pollution which interferes with [[photosynthesis]] and stunts overall growth of some plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2003-07-31|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/view.php?id=23565|title=Rising Ozone Levels Pose Challenge to U.S. Soybean Production, Scientists Say|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arb.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutters|first=Randall|date=March 1999|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/abstracts/94-345.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040217151427/http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/abstracts/94-345.htm|archivedate=2004-02-17|title=Statewide Potential Crop Yield Losses From Ozone Exposure|publisher=California Air Resources Board|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] is proposing a secondary regulation to reduce crop damage, in addition to the primary regulation designed for the protection of human health.

Certain examples of cities with elevated ozone readings are [[Houston, Texas]], and [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. Houston has a reading of around 41 nmol/mol, while Mexico City is far more hazardous, with a reading of about 125 nmol/mol.&lt;ref name="arb.ca.gov"/&gt;

====Ozone cracking====
[[File:Ozone cracks in tube1.jpg|thumb|right|Ozone cracking in [[natural rubber]] tubing]]
Ozone gas attacks any [[polymer]] possessing olefinic or [[double bond]]s within its chain structure, such as [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]], and [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, the rate of crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding [[antiozonant]]s, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. [[Ozone cracking]] used to be a serious problem in car tires,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Layer|first1=Robert W.|last2= Lattimer|first2= Robert P.|title = Protection of Rubber against Ozone|journal = Rubber Chemistry and Technology|date = July 1990|volume = 63|number =3|pages = 426-450| doi = 10.5254/1.3538264}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, but it is not an issue with modern tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like [[gasket]]s and [[O-ring]]s, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. [[Fuel line]]s made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a [[Direct Current|DC]] [[electric motor]] can accelerate ozone cracking. The [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.

====Ozone as a greenhouse gas====
Although ozone was present at ground level before the [[Industrial Revolution]], peak concentrations are now far higher than the pre-industrial levels, and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1998|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/TOP08-98/page004.html|title=Tropospheric Ozone in EU – The consolidated report|publisher=European Environmental Agency|accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710143636/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|archivedate=2006-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone acts as a [[greenhouse gas]], absorbing some of the [[infrared]] energy emitted by the earth. Quantifying the greenhouse gas potency of ozone is difficult because it is not present in uniform concentrations across the globe. However, the most widely accepted scientific assessments relating to [[climate change]] (e.g. the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] [[Third Assessment Report]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2001|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/|title=Climate Change 2001|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-09-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913043522/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/|archivedate=2006-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the [[radiative forcing]] of tropospheric ozone is about 25% that of [[carbon dioxide]].

The annual [[global warming potential]] of tropospheric ozone is between 918–1022 tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]]/tons tropospheric ozone. This means on a per-molecule basis, ozone in the troposphere has a [[radiative forcing]] effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as [[carbon dioxide]]. However, tropospheric ozone is a short-lived [[greenhouse gas]], which decays in the atmosphere much more quickly than [[carbon dioxide]]. This means that over a 20-year span, the [[global warming potential]] of tropospheric ozone is much less, roughly 62 to 69 tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] / ton tropospheric ozone.&lt;ref&gt;Life Cycle Assessment Methodology Sufficient to Support Public Declarations and Claims, Committee Draft Standard, Version 2.1. Scientific Certification Systems, February 2011. Annex B, Section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its short-lived nature, tropospheric ozone does not have strong global effects, but has very strong radiative forcing effects on regional scales. In fact, there are regions of the world where tropospheric ozone has a [[radiative forcing]] up to 150% of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://acdb-ext.gsfc.nasa.gov/Data_services/cloud_slice/ NASA GODDARD HOMEPAGE FOR TROPOSPHERIC OZONE NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Code 613.3, Chemistry and Dynamics Branch].

===Ozone air pollution===
[[File:Alder showing ozone discolouration.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alnus rubra|Red Alder]] leaf, showing discolouration caused by ozone pollution&lt;ref name=EONASA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OzoneWx/|accessdate=2008-10-11|title=Watching Our Ozone Weather|date=2003-08-22|author=Jeannie Allen|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:SignboardAirQualityHouston.JPG|thumb|Signboard in [[Gulfton, Houston|Gulfton]], [[Houston]] indicating an ozone watch]]
[[Ozone precursors]] are a group of pollutants, predominantly those emitted during the combustion of [[fossil fuels]]. Ground-level ozone pollution ([[tropospheric ozone]]) is created near the Earth's surface by the action of daylight [[ultraviolet|UV]] rays on these precursors. The ozone at ground level is primarily from fossil fuel precursors, but [[methane]] is a natural precursor, and the very low natural background level of ozone at ground level is considered safe. This section examines the health impacts of fossil fuel burning, which raises ground level ozone far above background levels.

There is a great deal of evidence to show that ground-level ozone can harm lung function and irritate the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref name="who-Europe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/document/E82790.pdf Answer to follow-up questions from CAFE (2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909162153/http://www.euro.who.int/document/E82790.pdf |date=2005-09-09 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to ozone (and the pollutants that produce it) is linked to premature [[death]], [[asthma]], [[bronchitis]], [[heart attack]], and other cardiopulmonary problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=[[EPA]] Course Developers |title=Health Effects of Ozone in the General Population |url=https://www.epa.gov/ozone-pollution-and-your-patients-health/health-effects-ozone-general-population |publisher=[[EPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18629332"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weinhold B |title=Ozone nation: EPA standard panned by the people |journal=Environ.

Long-term exposure to ozone has been shown to increase risk of death from [[respiratory illness]]. A study of 450,000 people living in United States cities saw a significant correlation between ozone levels and respiratory illness over the 18-year follow-up period. The study revealed that people living in cities with high ozone levels, such as Houston or Los Angeles, had an over 30% increased risk of dying from lung disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jerrett |first1=Michael |last2=Burnett |first2=Richard T. |last3=Pope |first3=C.

Air quality guidelines such as those from the [[World Health Organization]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[European Union]] are based on detailed studies designed to identify the levels that can cause measurable ill [[health effect]]s.

According to scientists with the US EPA, susceptible people can be adversely affected by ozone levels as low as 40 nmol/mol.&lt;ref name="pmid18629332"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1440818 | title=Ozone Overload: Current Standards May Not Protect Health | journal=Environ.

In the USA, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] directs the EPA to set [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] for several pollutants, including ground-level ozone, and counties out of compliance with these standards are required to take steps to reduce their levels. In May 2008, under a court order, the EPA lowered its ozone standard from 80 nmol/mol to 75 nmol/mol. The move proved controversial, since the Agency's own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol/mol.&lt;ref name="pmid18629332"/&gt; Many public health and environmental groups also supported the 60 nmol/mol standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comments of the American Lung Association, Environmental Defense, Sierra Club on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Proposed Revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone July 11, 2007 – 72 FR 37818 |url=http://www.lungusa.org/get-involved/advocate/advocacy-documents/Comments-to-the-Environmental-Protection-Agency-re-National-Ambient-Air-Quality-Standard-for-Ozone.PDF |format=PDF |publisher=Lungusa.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710051224/http://www.lungusa.org/get-involved/advocate/advocacy-documents/Comments-to-the-Environmental-Protection-Agency-re-National-Ambient-Air-Quality-Standard-for-Ozone.PDF |archivedate=July 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Health Organization]] recommends 51 nmol/mol.

On January 7, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for the pollutant ozone, the principal component of smog:

:... EPA proposes that the level of the 8-hour primary standard, which was set at 0.075 μmol/mol in the 2008 final rule, should instead be set at a lower level within the range of 0.060 to 0.070 μmol/mol, to provide increased protection for children and other ‘‘at risk’’ populations against an array of {{Chem|O|3}} – related adverse health effects that range from decreased lung function and increased respiratory symptoms to serious indicators of respiratory morbidity including emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes, and possibly cardiovascular-related morbidity as well as total non- accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/fr/20100119.pdf National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone]. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Proposed rule&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2015, the EPA published a final rule with an effective date of December 28, 2015 that revised the 8-hour primary NAAQS from 0.075 ppm to 0.070 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/26/2015-26594/national-ambient-air-quality-standards-for-ozone|title=Federal Register {{!}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone|website=www.federalregister.gov|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has developed an [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI) to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. Under the current standards, eight-hour average ozone mole fractions of 85 to 104 nmol/mol are described as "unhealthy for sensitive groups", 105 nmol/mol to 124 nmol/mol as "unhealthy", and 125 nmol/mol to 404 nmol/mol as "very unhealthy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airinfonow.org/html/ed_ozone.html What is Ozone?] airinfonow.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone can also be present in [[indoor air pollution]], partly as a result of electronic equipment such as photocopiers. A connection has also been known to exist between the increased pollen, fungal spores, and ozone caused by thunderstorms and hospital admissions of [[asthma]] sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=W. |last =Anderson |author2=G.J.

In the [[Victorian era]], one British folk myth held that the smell of the sea was caused by ozone. In fact, the characteristic "smell of the sea" is caused by [[dimethyl sulfide]], a chemical generated by [[phytoplankton]]. Victorian British folk considered the resulting smell "bracing".&lt;ref&gt;University of East Anglia press release, [http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/research/reshigh/cloning Cloning the smell of the seaside], February 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heat waves====
Ozone production rises during heat waves, because plants absorb less ozone. It is estimated that curtailed ozone absorption by plants was responsible for the loss of 460 lives in the UK in the hot summer of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Physiology===
{{See also|Trioxidane}}
Ozone, along with reactive forms of oxygen such as [[superoxide]], [[singlet oxygen]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and [[hypochlorite]] ions, is produced by [[white blood cell]]s and other biological systems (such as the roots of [[Tagetes|marigold]]s) as a means of destroying foreign bodies. Ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds. Also, when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen [[free radical]]s, which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many [[Organic compound|organic molecules]]. Moreover, it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of [[inflammation]]. The cause-and-effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and what it does is still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations, since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions. A team headed by Paul Wentworth Jr. of the Department of Chemistry at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] has shown evidence linking the antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway of the human [[Immune system|immune response]] to the production of ozone. In this system, ozone is produced by antibody-catalyzed production of [[trioxidane]] from water and neutrophil-produced singlet oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Story of O| first=Roald |last=Hoffmann| journal=American Scientist|volume=92|issue= 1|page=23|date=January 2004|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/29647?&amp;print=yes| doi=10.1511/2004.1.23 |accessdate=2006-10-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925011907/http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/29647?&amp;print=yes |archivedate = 2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When inhaled, ozone reacts with compounds lining the lungs to form specific, cholesterol-derived metabolites that are thought to facilitate the build-up and pathogenesis of [[atherosclerotic plaques]] (a form of [[heart disease]]). These metabolites have been confirmed as naturally occurring in human atherosclerotic arteries and are categorized into a class of secosterols termed ''[[atheronals]]'', generated by [[ozonolysis]] of cholesterol's double bond to form a [[atheronals|5,6 secosterol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Smith|first = LL|title = Oxygen, oxysterols, ouabain, and ozone: a cautionary tale|journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 318–24 |year = 2004|pmid = 15223065|doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.04.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a secondary condensation product via aldolization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evidence for Ozone Formation in Human Atherosclerotic Arteries|doi=10.1126/science.1089525|author=Paul Wentworth|year=2003|journal=Science|volume=302|pmid=14605372|last2=Nieva|first2=J|last3=Takeuchi|first3=C|last4=Galve|first4=R|last5=Wentworth|first5=AD|last6=Dilley|first6=RB|last7=Delaria|first7=GA|last8=Saven|first8=A|last9=Babior|first9=BM|last10=Janda|first10=K.

Ozone has been implicated to have an adverse effect on plant growth: "... ozone reduced total chlorophylls, carotenoid and carbohydrate concentration, and increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) content and ethylene production. In treated plants, the ascorbate leaf pool was decreased, while lipid peroxidation and solute leakage were significantly higher than in ozone-free controls. The data indicated that ozone triggered protective mechanisms against oxidative stress in citrus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Iglesias |first = Domingo J. |author2=Ángeles Calatayuda |author3=Eva Barrenob |author4=Eduardo Primo-Milloa |author5=Manuel Talon|title = Responses of citrus plants to ozone: leaf biochemistry, antioxidant mechanisms and lipid peroxidation|journal = Plant Physiology and Biochemistry|volume = 44|issue = 2–3|pages = 125–131|year = 2006|doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2006.03.007|pmid = 16644230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety regulations===
Because of the strongly oxidizing properties of ozone, ozone is a primary irritant, affecting especially the eyes and respiratory systems and can be hazardous at even low concentrations. The Canadian Centre for Occupation Safety and Health reports that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure. Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-o-zone.cc/research/abstracts/OSHC.pdf What are the main health hazards associated with breathing in ozone?], Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; To protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, [[U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 μmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and [[NIOSH]] has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 μmol/mol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH)]: NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95)&lt;/ref&gt; Work environments where ozone is used or where it is likely to be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA PEL. Continuous monitors for ozone are available from several suppliers.

==Production==
[[File:THC 2003.902.021 E. H. Johnson Ozone Production.jpg|thumb|right | Ozone production demonstration, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1926]]

Ozone generators are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These ozone generators can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour. Ozone often forms in nature under conditions where O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will not react.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Ozone used in industry is measured in μmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water.

Temperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light). Old generation methods will produce less than 50% of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air, as opposed to very dry air. New generators, using electrolytic methods, can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production.

===Corona discharge method===
[[File:Shkarkese elektrike.jpg|thumb|A homemade ozone generator. Ozone is produced in the corona discharge|alt=]]
This is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the "hot spark" coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a [[Corona discharge|corona discharge tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=Smith, L. I.; Greenwood, F. L. and Hudrlik, O. |collvol=3|collvolpages=673 |volume=26|pages=63|year=1946|title=A laboratory ozonizer|prep=cv3p0673}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3–6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce [[nitrogen oxide]]s as a by-product. Use of an [[air dryer]] can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. Use of an [[oxygen concentrator]] can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.

===Ultraviolet light===
UV ozone generators, or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ozone generators, employ a light source that generates a narrow-band ultraviolet light, a subset of that produced by the Sun. The Sun's UV sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dohan |first=J. M. |author2=W. J. Masschelein |year=1987 |journal=Ozone Sci. Eng.|title=Photochemical Generation of Ozone: Present State-of-the-Art |volume=9 |pages=315–334 |doi=10.1080/01919518708552147 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UV ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators tend to be less expensive.  However UV ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], for example). Production of ozone is one of the [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation#Potential dangers|potential dangers]] of [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and [[spa]] applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.

===Cold plasma===
In the cold plasma method, pure oxygen gas is exposed to a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by [[dielectric barrier discharge]]. The diatomic oxygen is split into single atoms, which then recombine in triplets to form ozone.

Cold plasma machines utilize pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about 5% ozone. They produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given space of time compared to ultraviolet production. However, because cold plasma ozone generators are very expensive, they are found less frequently than the previous two types.

The discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons (micro discharges) in a gap between two electrodes. In order to evenly distribute the micro discharges, a dielectric [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing.

Some cold plasma units also have the capability of producing short-lived allotropes of oxygen which include O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. These species are even more reactive than ordinary {{chem|O|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gujral, et al|first=Sarbjeet Singh|year=2013|title=Ozone Therapy: A Milestone in the Treatment of Ailments|url=http://www.iglobaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/8.-Sarbjeet-S-Gujral-et-al-IGJPS-2013_edited.pdf|journal=Indo Global Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=167–173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrolytic===
Electrolytic ozone generation (EOG) splits water molecules into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
In most EOG methods, the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20–30% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high [[overpotential]] required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are [[lead dioxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Foller, Peter C. |author2=Tobias, Charles W. |title=The Anodic Evolution of Ozone|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume=129|issue=3|pages=506|doi=10.1149/1.2123890|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; or boron-doped diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Arihara, Kazuki |author2=Terashima, Chiaki |author3=Fujishimam Akira |title= Electrochemical Production of High-Concentration Ozone-Water Using Freestanding Perforated Diamond Electrodes|journal= Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume= 154|issue= 4|pages= E71|doi= 10.1149/1.2509385|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special considerations===
Ozone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases (because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen) and must therefore be produced on site. Available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes. At production capacities higher than 20&amp;nbsp;kg per hour, a gas/water tube heat-exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high-voltage electrodes on the gas-side. The regime of typical gas pressures is around {{convert|2|bar|lk=on}} absolute in oxygen and {{convert|3|bar}} absolute in air. Several megawatts of [[electric power|electrical power]] may be installed in large facilities, applied as one phase AC [[Electric current|current]] at 50 to 8000&amp;nbsp;Hz and peak [[voltage]]s between 3,000 and 20,000 volts. Applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency.

The dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The cooler the water, the better the ozone synthesis. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration (but the lower the net ozone produced). At typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.

Because of the high reactivity of ozone, only a few materials may be used like [[stainless steel]] (quality 316L), [[titanium]], [[aluminium]] (as long as no moisture is present), [[glass]], [[polytetrafluorethylene]], or [[polyvinylidene fluoride]]. [[Viton]] may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). [[Hypalon]] may be used with the restriction that no water come in contact with it, except for normal atmospheric levels. [[Embrittlement]] or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like [[O-rings]].

[[Silicone rubber]]s are usually adequate for use as [[gaskets]] in ozone concentrations below 1 wt%, such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples.

===Incidental production===
Ozone may be formed from {{chem|O|2}} by electrical discharges and by action of high energy [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[Arc suppression|Unsuppressed arcing]] in electrical contacts, motor brushes, or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts [{{chem|O|2}} → 2O]. Free radicals of oxygen in and around the arc recombine to create ozone [{{chem|O|3}}].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lab Note #106 ''Environmental Impact of Arc Suppression'' | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | accessdate = October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[electrical equipment]] generate significant levels of ozone. This is especially true of devices using [[high voltage]]s, such as [[Air ioniser|ionic air purifiers]], [[laser printer]]s, [[photocopier]]s, [[electroshock weapon|tasers]] and [[arc welding|arc welders]]. [[Electric motor]]s using [[brush (electric)|brush]]es can generate ozone from repeated [[spark gap|spark]]ing inside the unit. Large motors that use brushes, such as those used by elevators or hydraulic pumps, will generate more ozone than smaller motors.

Ozone is similarly formed in the [[Catatumbo lightning|Catatumbo lightning storms]] phenomenon on the [[Catatumbo River]] in [[Venezuela]], though ozone's instability makes it dubious that it has any effect on the ozonosphere.&lt;ref name="Zulia"&gt;[http://www.agenciadenoticias.luz.edu.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4965&amp;Itemid=151 ¿Relámpagos del Catatumbo regeneran la capa de ozono?]. Agencia de noticias de la [[Universidad del Zulia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the world's largest single natural generator of ozone, lending calls for it to be designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="meteo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire in the Sky|url=http://www.meteogroup.co.uk/uk/home/weather/weather_news/news_archive/archive/2007/november/ch/f540146dcc/article/fire_in_the_sky.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721215231/http://www.meteogroup.co.uk/uk/home/weather/weather_news/news_archive/archive/2007/november/ch/f540146dcc/article/fire_in_the_sky.html|archivedate=2011-07-21|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, ozone can be produced by [[electrolysis]] using a [[9 volt battery]], a pencil graphite rod [[cathode]], a [[platinum]] wire [[anode]] and a 3 [[molar (concentration)|molar]] [[sulfuric acid]] [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ibanez|first=Jorge G. |author2=Rodrigo Mayen-Mondragon |author3=M. T. Moran-Moran|year=2005|title=Laboratory Experiments on the Electrochemical Remediation of the Environment. Part 7: Microscale Production of Ozone|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=82|issue=10|page=1546|url=http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2005/Oct/abs1546.html|accessdate=2006-05-10|doi=10.1021/ed082p1546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[half cell]] reactions taking place are:

: 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Table of standard electrode potentials|ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;]] = −1.53 [[Volt|V]])
: 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 V)
: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (ΔE&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.23 V)

In the net reaction, three equivalents of water are converted into one equivalent of ozone and three equivalents of [[hydrogen]]. Oxygen formation is a competing reaction.

It can also be generated by a [[high voltage]] [[Electric arc|arc]]. In its simplest form, high voltage AC, such as the output of a [[Neon-sign transformer]] is connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc. The resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone.

It is often desirable to contain the ozone. This can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube. The inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source. The other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube. A source of dry  {{chem|O|2}} is applied to the bottom port. When high voltage is applied to the foil leads, [[electricity]] will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form {{chem|O|3}} and {{chem|O|2}} which will flow out the top port. The reaction can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;

: 3 {{chem|O|2}} — ''electricity'' → 2 {{chem|O|3}}

==Applications==

===Industry===
The largest use of ozone is in the preparation of [[pharmaceuticals]], [[synthetic lubricants]], and many other commercially useful [[organic compounds]], where it is used to sever [[carbon]]-carbon bonds.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; It can also be used for [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]]ing substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ozonesolutions.com/Ozone_Color_Removal.html|work = Ozone Information|title = Ozone and Color Removal| accessdate = 2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common [[chlorine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoigné |first= J.|title=Handbook of Environmental Chemistry, Vol. 5 part C|pages=83–141|year=1998 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone has a very high [[oxidation potential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ozone-information.com/Oxidation_Potential_Ozone.html|title=Oxidation Potential of Ozone| work= Ozone-Information.com| accessdate=2008-05-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080419034421/http://www.ozone-information.com/Oxidation_Potential_Ozone.html |archivedate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone does not form [[organochlorine]] compounds, nor does it remain in the water after treatment. Ozone can form the suspected carcinogen [[bromate]] in source water with high [[bromide]] concentrations. The U.S. [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 μmol/mol residual [[free chlorine]] in the pipes, based on results of regular testing. Where [[Electric power|electrical power]] is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. Once it has decayed, it leaves no taste or odour in drinking water.

Although low levels of ozone have been advertised to be of some disinfectant use in residential homes, the concentration of ozone in dry air required to have a rapid, substantial effect on airborne pathogens exceeds safe levels recommended by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. Humidity control can vastly improve both the killing power of the ozone and the rate at which it decays back to oxygen (more humidity allows more effectiveness). [[Spore]] forms of most pathogens are very tolerant of atmospheric ozone in concentrations at which asthma patients start to have issues.

Industrially, ozone is used to:

Ozone is a [[reagent]] in many [[organic reactions]] in the laboratory and in industry. [[Ozonolysis]] is the cleavage of an [[alkene]] to [[carbonyl]] compounds.

Many hospitals around the world use large ozone generators to decontaminate operating rooms between surgeries. The rooms are cleaned and then sealed airtight before being filled with ozone which effectively kills or neutralizes all remaining bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Boer |first1=Hero E.

Ozone can be used to detoxify [[cyanide]] wastes (for example from [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[mining]]) by oxidising cyanide to [[cyanate]] and eventually to [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bollyky |first= L. J.|title=Ozone Treatment of Cyanide-Bearing Wastes, EPA Report 600/2-77-104|year=1977 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |location=Research Triangle Park, N.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumers===
{{see also|Air purifier#Potential ozone hazards}}
Devices generating high levels of ozone, some of which use ionization, are used to sanitize and deodorize uninhabited buildings, rooms, ductwork, woodsheds, boats and other vehicles.

In the U.S., [[air purifier]]s emitting low levels of ozone have been sold. This kind of air purifier is sometimes claimed to imitate nature's way of purifying the air without filters and to sanitize both it and household surfaces. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has declared that there is "evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is not effective at removing many odor-causing chemicals" or "viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants". Furthermore, its report states that "results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these [human safety] standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturer’s operating instructions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ozonegen.html EPA report on consumer ozone air purifiers]. Epa.gov. Retrieved on 2012-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozonated water is used to launder clothes and to sanitize food, drinking water, and surfaces in the home. According to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), it is "amending the [[food additive]] regulations to provide for the safe use of ozone in gaseous and aqueous phases as an [[Antimicrobial|antimicrobial agent]] on food, including meat and poultry." Studies at [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]] demonstrated that 0.3 μmol/mol levels of ozone dissolved in filtered tapwater can produce a reduction of more than 99.99% in such food-borne microorganisms as salmonella, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and ''Campylobacter''. This quantity is 20,000 times the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]-recommended limits stated above.&lt;ref name="food"&gt;{{cite web|last=Montecalvo |first=Joseph |author2=Doug Williams |title=Application of Ozonation in Sanitizing Vegetable Process Washwaters |publisher=California Polytechnic State University |url=http://www.cwtozone.com/files/articles/Food_Produce/Article%20-%20Veg.%20Process%20washwater.pdf |accessdate=2008-03-24 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528140629/http://www.cwtozone.com/files/articles/Food_Produce/Article%20-%20Veg.%20Process%20washwater.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Long| first=Ron| year=2008| url=http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715132442/http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf| archivedate=2011-07-15| format=PDF| title=POU Ozone Food Sanitation: A Viable Option for Consumers &amp; the Food Service Industry}} (the report also shows that tapwater removes 99.95% of pathogens from lettuce; samples were inoculated with pathogens before treatment)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is used in homes and [[hot tub]]s to kill bacteria in the water and to reduce the amount of chlorine or bromine required by reactivating them to their free state. Since ozone does not remain in the water long enough, ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross-contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with [[halogens]]. Gaseous ozone created by ultraviolet light or by corona discharge is injected into the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/mdbp/upload/2001_07_13_mdbp_alternative_disinfectants_guidance.pdf |format=PDF|title=Alternative Disinfectants and Oxidant Guidance Manual|date=April 1999|publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone is also widely used in treatment of water in aquariums and fish ponds. Its use can minimize bacterial growth, control parasites, eliminate transmission of some diseases, and reduce or eliminate "yellowing" of the water. Ozone must not come in contact with fish's gill structures. Natural salt water (with life forms) provides enough "instantaneous demand" that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ion to [[hypobromous acid]], and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes. If oxygen fed ozone is used, the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen, fish's gill structures will atrophy and they will become dependent on higher dissolved oxygen levels.

===Aquaculture===
Ozonation – a process of infusing water with ozone – can be used in aquaculture to facilitate organic breakdown. Ozone is also added to recirculating systems to reduce [[nitrite]] levels&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0959-8030(96)90006-X | last1 = Noble | first1 = A.C. | last2 = Summerfelt | first2 = S.T. | year = 1996 | title = Diseases encountered in rainbow trout cultured in recirculating systems |journal = Annual Review of Fish Diseases | volume = 6 |pages = 65–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through conversion into [[nitrate]]. If nitrite levels in the water are high, nitrites will also accumulate in the blood and tissues of fish, where it interferes with oxygen transport (it causes oxidation of the heme-group of [[haemoglobin]] from ferrous ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) to ferric ({{chem|Fe|3+}}), making haemoglobin unable to bind {{chem|O|2}}).&lt;ref name="Ferreira"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0044-8486(03)00524-6 | last1 = Ferreira | first1 = O| last2 = de Costa | first2 = O.T. | last3 = Ferreira | first3 = Santos | last4 = Mendonca | first4 = F. | year = 2004 | title = Susceptibility of the Amazonian fish, Colossoma macropomum (Serrasalminae), to short-term exposure to nitrite |journal = Aquaculture | volume = 232 |pages = 627–636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these apparent positive effects, ozone use in recirculation systems has been linked to reducing the level of bioavailable iodine in salt water systems, resulting in iodine deficiency symptoms such as goitre and decreased growth in Senegalese sole (''[[Solea senegalensis]]'') larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ribeiro | first1 = A.R.A. | last2 = Ribeiro | first2 = L. | last3 = Saele | first3 = Ø. | last4 = Hamre | first4 = K. | last5 = Dinis | first5 = M.T. | last6 = Moren | first6 = M. | title = Iodine-enriched rotifers andArtemiaprevent goitre in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) larvae reared in a recirculation system | journal = Aquaculture Nutrition | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2095.2009.00740.x | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozonate seawater is used for surface disinfection of [[haddock]] and [[Atlantic halibut]] eggs against nodavirus. Nodavirus is a lethal and vertically transmitted virus which causes severe mortality in fish. Haddock eggs should not be treated with high ozone level as eggs so treated did not hatch and died after 3–4 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaeng.2005.10.001 | last1 = Buchan | first1 = K. | last2 = Martin-Robinchaud | first2 = D. | last3 = Benfey | first3 = T.J. | last4 = MacKinnon | year = 2006 | first4 = A | last5 = Boston | first5 = L | title = The efficacy of ozonated seawater for surface disinfection of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) eggs against piscine nodavirus |journal = Aquacultural Engineering | volume = 35 |pages = 102–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone application on freshly cut pineapple and banana shows increase in flavonoids and total phenol contents when exposure is up to 20 minutes.

Ozone facilitates the extraction of some heavy metals from soil using [[EDTA]]. EDTA forms strong, water-soluble coordination compounds with some heavy metals ([[Lead|Pb]], [[Zinc|Zn]]) thereby making it possible to dissolve them out from contaminated soil.

A '''plate''', usually called '''anode''' in Britain,  is a type of [[electrode]] that forms part of a [[vacuum tube]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Edison {{US patent|307031}} "Electrical Indicator", Issue date: 1884&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually made of sheet metal, connected to a wire which passes through the glass envelope of the tube to a terminal in the base of the tube, where it is connected to the external circuit.  The plate is given a positive [[electric potential|potential]], and its function is to attract and capture the electrons emitted by the [[cathode]].  Although it is sometimes a flat plate, it is more often in the shape of a cylinder or flat open-ended box surrounding the other electrodes.

==Construction==
The plate must dissipate heat created when the electrons hit it with a high velocity after being accelerated by the voltage between the plate and cathode.   Most of the waste power used in a vacuum tube is dissipated as heat by the plate.  In low power tubes it is usually given a black coating, and often has "fins" to help it radiate heat.  In power vacuum tubes used in radio transmitters, it is often made of a [[refractory metal]] like [[molybdenum]]. and is part of a large [[heat sink]] that projects through the glass or ceramic tube envelope and is cooled by [[Glowing anode|radiation cooling]], forced air or water.&lt;ref&gt;C H Gardner (1965) [http://www.r-type.org/static/story.htm The Story of the Valve], Radio Constructor (See particularly the section "Glass Base Construction")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Tomer, ''Getting the most out of vacuum tubes'', Howard W. Sams, Indianapolis, USA 1960, Library of Congress card no. 60-13843, available on the Internet Archive.  Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary emission==
A problem in early vacuum tubes was ''[[secondary emission]]''; electrons striking the plate could knock other electrons out of the metal surface.  In some tubes such as [[tetrode]]s these ''secondary electrons'' could be absorbed by other electrods such as grids in the tube, resulting in a current out of the plate.  This current could cause the plate circuit to have [[negative resistance]], which could cause unwanted [[parasitic oscillation]]s.  To prevent this most plates in modern tubes are given a chemical coating which reduces secondary emission.

[[File:FA-18 Hornet breaking sound barrier (7 July 1999).jpg|thumb|[[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] jet aircraft at transonic speed producing [[Prandtl–Meyer expansion fan|supersonic expansion fans]] and a stern shockwave creating a [[vapor cone]]. The Prandtl–Glauert singularity was incorrectly predicted to occur under these conditions.]]
The '''Prandtl–Glauert singularity''' is the prediction by the [[Prandtl–Glauert transformation]] that infinite pressures would be experienced by an aircraft as it approaches the [[speed of sound]]. Because it is invalid to apply the transformation at these speeds, the predicted singularity does not emerge. This is related to the early-20th-century misconception of the impenetrability of the [[sound barrier]].

== Reasons of invalidity around Mach 1 ==
The Prandtl–Glauert transformation assumes linearity (i.e. a small change will have a small effect that is proportional to its size). This assumption becomes inaccurate at high Mach numbers and is entirely invalid in places where the flow reaches supersonic speeds, since sonic shock waves are instantaneous (and thus manifestly non-linear) changes in the flow. Indeed, one assumption in the Prandtl–Glauert transformation is approximately constant Mach number throughout the flow, and the increasing slope in the transformation indicates that very small changes will have a very strong effect at higher Mach numbers, thus violating the assumption, which breaks down entirely at the speed of sound.

This means that the [[singularity (mathematics)|singularity]] featured by the transformation near the sonic speed (''M=1'') is not within the area of validity. The aerodynamic forces are calculated to approach infinity at the so-called ''Prandtl–Glauert singularity''; in reality, the aerodynamic and thermodynamic perturbations do get amplified strongly near the sonic speed, but they remain finite and a singularity does not occur.  The Prandtl–Glauert transformation is a linearized approximation of compressible, inviscid potential flow.  As the flow approaches sonic speed, the nonlinear phenomena dominate within the flow, which this transformation completely ignores for the sake of simplicity.

== Prandtl–Glauert transformation ==
{{Main|Prandtl–Glauert transformation}}

[[File:Prandtl-glauert-transform.png|thumb|Plot of the [[Prandtl–Glauert transformation]] as a function of [[Mach number]].  Notice the infinite limit at Mach 1.]]
The Prandtl–Glauert transformation is found by linearizing the potential equations associated with compressible, inviscid flow.  For two-dimensional flow, the linearized pressures in such a flow are equal to those found from incompressible flow theory multiplied by a correction factor. This correction factor is given below:&lt;ref&gt;Erich Truckenbrodt: ''Fluidmechanik'' Band 2, 4. Auflage, Springer Verlag, 1996, p. 178-179 
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_{p} = \frac {c_{p0}} {\sqrt {|1-{M_{\infty}}^2|}}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*  c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the compressible [[pressure coefficient]]
*  c&lt;sub&gt;p0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[incompressible]] [[pressure coefficient]]
*  ''M&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the freestream Mach number.

This formula is known as "Prandtl's rule", and works well up to low-transonic Mach numbers  (M &lt; ~0.7).  However, note the limit:

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{M_{\infty} \to 1 }c_p = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

This obviously nonphysical result (of an infinite pressure) is known as the Prandtl–Glauert singularity.

== Reason for condensation clouds ==
The reason for the condensation cloud that is being observed is that humid air is entering a low-pressure region, which also reduces local density and temperature sufficiently to cause condensation. The vapour vanishes as soon as the pressure increases again to ambient levels.
In the case of objects at transonic speeds, the pressure increase happens at the [[shock wave#Recompression shock|shock wave]] location.
Condensation in free flows does not require supersonic flow. Given a humidity high enough, it can happen in purely subsonic flow over a wing or in the cores of wing tip and other vortices. This can often be observed on humid days on aircraft approaching an airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Cargolux/Boeing-747-8R7F-SCD/2450886/&amp;sid=674c6ac9a0c1c3d0146fa6fc632c5377|title=Aviation Photo #2450886: Boeing 747-8R7F/SCD - Cargolux|author=|date=|website=Airliners.net|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ricciocarpos natans''''' is the only species in the genus '''''Ricciocarpos''''', a genus of [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s in the family [[Ricciaceae]].&lt;ref name="Campbell 1918" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crandall-Stotler 2000" /&gt; It was formerly listed in 1759 as a species of ''[[Riccia]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], but then assigned to a new genus of its own in 1829 by [[August Carl Joseph Corda]].

Despite having many common features with the genus ''Riccia'',&lt;ref name="Campbell 1918" /&gt; its most obvious difference from that genus are the long sword-shaped purple scales that hang from the under surface of floating plants.&lt;ref name="Schuster VI" /&gt; The genus has occasionally appeared in the literature under the spelling '''''Ricciocarpus''''', but the spelling with an '''o''' is the original and accepted spelling.&lt;ref name="Grolle 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crandall-Stotler 2000" /&gt; The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] "''natans''" comes from the Latin word for "swimming", because plants typically float freely in ponds or quiet waters.

Plants of ''R. natans'' have two very different forms, depending on the conditions under which the plant grows. One form develops in plants that grow on land (terrestrial), and another form develops when plants grow floating in the water (aquatic). The terrestrial form develops into [[rosette (botany)|rosette]]s 25–35 millimetres across,&lt;ref name="Howe 1923" /&gt; of short and narrow branches having almost parallel sides. The more usual form is aquatic, and develops as broader, heart-shaped [[thallus]] with fewer branchings and long slender purple scales hanging from the underside. The two forms are so physically different from each other that they were originally thought to be different species.&lt;ref name="Schuster VI" /&gt;

''Ricciocarpos'' is distributed globally, being found almost everywhere except the polar regions&lt;ref name="Schuster VI" /&gt; though it is rare in parts of the tropics.&lt;ref name="Wigginton 2004" /&gt; It may form extensive floating colonies in quiet waters,&lt;ref name="Schofield 1985" /&gt; and grows readily in laboratory cultures.&lt;ref name="Bold 1987" /&gt; Although fertile plants are not unknown, mature plants bearing spore capsules are rarely found. It is therefore assumed that ''Ricciocarpos'' spreads primarily through [[vegetative reproduction]] as the plants break apart.&lt;ref name="Allison 1975" /&gt; It has been suggested that the aquatic forms remain sterile and that sexual reproduction is largely limited to terrestrial forms,&lt;ref name="Kashyap 1929" /&gt; but other sources maintain that terrestrial forms are normally sterile as well.&lt;ref name="Bold 1987" /&gt;

The '''Subatlantic''' is the current [[age (geology)|climatic age]] of the [[Holocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]. It started at about 2,500 years [[before present|BP]] and is still ongoing. Its average temperatures were slightly lower than during the preceding [[Subboreal]] and [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]]. During its course the [[temperature]] underwent several oscillations which had a strong influence on fauna and flora and thus indirectly on the evolution of human civilizations. With intensifying [[industrialisation]], human society started to stress the natural climatic cycles with increased [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/greenhousegases/industrialrevolution.html | title=Changes since the Industrial Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/co2.html | title=Help finding information &amp;#124; US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.edu/~vjd1/greenhouse.htm | title=The Greenhouse Effect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and stratigraphy ==
The term ''subatlantic'' was first introduced in 1889 by [[Rutger Sernander]]&lt;ref&gt;Sernander, R. (1889). Om växtlämningar i Skandinaviens marina bildningar. Bot. Not. 1889, p. 190-199, Lund.&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate it from [[Axel Blytt]]'s ''atlantic''.&lt;ref&gt;Blytt, A. (1876a). Immigration of the Norvegian Flora. Alb. Cammermeyer, Christiania (Oslo), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; It follows upon the previous ''subboreal''. According to [[Franz Firbas]] (1949) and Litt ''et al.'' (2001) it consists of the pollen zones IX and X.&lt;ref&gt;Firbas, F. (1949). Spät- und nacheiszeitliche Klimageschichte Mittel-Europas nördlich der Alpen. I. Allgemeine Waldgeschichte, p. 480, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Litt |first=T. |displayauthors=1 |first2=A. |last2=Brauer |first3=T. |last3=Goslar |first4=J. |last4=Merkt |first5=K. |last5=Bałaga |first6=H. |last6=Müller |first7=M. |last7=Ralska-Jasiewiczowa |first8=M. |last8=Stebich |first9=J. F. W. |last9=Negendank |year=2001 |title=Correlation and synchronisation of Lateglacial continental sequences in northern central Europe based on annually laminated lacustrine sediments |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=1233–1249 |doi=10.1016/S0277-3791(00)00149-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds in the scheme of [[Fritz Theodor Overbeck]] to the pollen zones XI and XII.&lt;ref&gt;Overbeck, F. (1950a). Die Moore Niedersachsens. 2. Aufl. Veröff. d. niedersächs. Amtes f. Landesplanung u. Statistik, Reihe A I, Abt. Bremen-Horn, vol. 3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In climate stratigraphy the subatlantic is usually subdivided into an '''older subatlantic''' and a '''younger subatlantic'''. The older subatlantic corresponds to pollen zone IX (or XI in an alternate nomenclature made of more zones) characterized in central and northern Europe by [[beech]] or [[oak]]-beech forests, the younger subatlantic to pollen zone X (or XII in the alternate nomenclature made of more zones).

In eastern [[Germany]] Dietrich Franke subdivides the subatlantic into four stages (from young to old):&lt;ref&gt;Franke, D. (2010). Regionale Geologie von Ostdeutschland&amp;nbsp;– Ein Wörterbuch.&lt;/ref&gt;

* youngest subatlantic: 1800 until present: [[modern history]]
* younger subatlantic: 1250 until 1800: [[High Middle Ages]], [[Late Middle Ages]], [[Early Modern Period]]
* middle subatlantic: 500 until 1250: [[migration period]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic migrations]]
* older subatlantic: 500 BC until 500 AD: pre-Roman [[iron age]], [[ancient Rome]] and start of migration period.

== Ages ==
The beginning of the subatlantic is usually defined as 2,400 calendar years [[before present|BP]] or 450 [[before Christ|BC]]. Yet this lower limit is by no means rigid. Some authors prefer to define the start of the subatlantic as 2,500 [[radiocarbon]] years which represents roughly 625 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mangerud |first=J. |first2=S.

According to Franz Firbas the changeover from the subboreal (pollen zone VIII) to the older subatlantic (pollen zone IX) is characterized by the recession of [[hazel]] and [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] and the simultaneous spreading of [[hornbeam]] due to anthropogenic influences. This recession was not synchronous. It occurred in the western reaches of the Lower [[Oder]] valley between 930 and 830 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jahns |first=S. |year=2000 |title=Late-glacial and Holocene woodland dynamics and land-use history of the Lower Oder valley, north-eastern Germany, based on two, AMS &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-dated, pollen profiles |journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=111–123 |doi=10.1007/BF01300061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in southwestern [[Poland]] this event had taken place already between 1170 and 1160 BC.&lt;ref name=Herking&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Herking |first=C.

The beginning of the younger subatlantic at 1250 AD coincides with the medieval population increase and distinguishes itself by an increase in [[pine]] and in indicator plants for human settlements. In [[Silesia]] this event can be dated between 1050 and 1270 AD.&lt;ref name=Herking /&gt; If one equates the onset of the younger subatlantic with the first maximum of beech occurrence it shifts back to [[Carolingian]] times around 700 AD.

[[File:2000 Year Temperature Comparison.png|thumb|Reconstructed temperatures of the earth during the last 2,000 years.]]
[[File:2006 temp anom-german.svg|thumb|Rising world average temperatures since 1880.]]

The summer temperatures of the subatlantic are generally somewhat cooler (by up to 1.0&amp;nbsp;°C) than during the preceding subboreal, the yearly average temperatures reduced by 0.7&amp;nbsp;°C. At the same time the winter [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]s augmented by up to 50%. Overall the climate during the subatlantic therefore tends to cooler and wetter conditions. The lower limit of the [[glacier]]s in [[Scandinavia]] descended during the subatlantic by 100 to 200 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dahl |first=S.

The beginning of the subatlantic opened at the middle of the first millennium BC with the so-called [[Roman Warm Period]] which lasted to the beginning of the 4th century. This corresponds broadly to [[classical antiquity]]. The optimum is marked by a temperature spike centered around 2,500 BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Broecker |first=W. S. |year=2001 |title=Was the Medieval Warm Period global? |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5508 |pages=1497–1499 |doi=10.1126/science.291.5508.1497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence in Europe the winter temperatures were raised by 0.6&amp;nbsp;°C during this period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bond |first=G. |first2=Bernd |last2=Kromer |first3=Juerg |last3=Beer |first4=Raimund |last4=Muscheler |first5=Michael N. |last5=Evans |first6=William |last6=Showers |first7=Sharon |last7=Hoffmann |first8=Rusty |last8=Lotti-Bond |first9=Irka |last9=Hajdas |first10=Georges |last10=Bonani |displayauthors=1 |year=2001 |title=Persistent Solar Influence on North Atlantic Climate During the Holocene |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5594 |pages=2130–2136 |doi=10.1126/science.1065680 |pmid=11739949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; yet on average were still by 0.3&amp;nbsp;°C lower than during the subboreal. [[Ice core]]s from [[Greenland]] also demonstrate a distinct temperature rise after the younger subboreal. The cooling that followed coincides with the [[Migration Period]]. It was not very pronounced and of short duration&amp;nbsp;– an average temperature drop of 0.2&amp;nbsp;°C and a winter temperature drop of 0.4&amp;nbsp;°C center around 350 AD (or 1,600 years BP). This climatic deterioration with the establishment of drier and cooler conditions might have forced the [[Huns]] to move west thus in turn triggering the migrations of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]]. At about the same time the [[Byzantine Empire]] reached its first acme and [[Christianity]] established itself in Europe as the leading [[monotheism|monotheistic religion]].

After this relatively short cool interlude the climate ameliorated again and reached between 800 and 1200 almost the values of the Roman Warm Period (used temperature proxies are sediments in the North Atlantic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keigwin |first=L. D. |year=1996 |title=The Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period in the Sargasso Sea |journal=Science |volume=274 |issue=5292 |pages=1504–1508 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5292.1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This warming happened during the [[High Middle Ages]] wherefore this event is known as ''Medieval Global Warming''  or the [[Medieval Warm Period]]. This warmer climate peaked around 850 AD and 1050 AD, and raised the [[tree line]] in [[Scandinavia]] and in [[Russia]] by 100 to 140 meters;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hiller |first=A. |last2=Boettger |first2=T. |last3=Kremenetski |first3=C. |year=2001 |title=Medieval climatic warming recorded by radiocarbon dated alpine tree-line shift on the Kola Peninsula, Russia |journal=The Holocene |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=491–497 |doi=10.1191/095968301678302931 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it enabled the [[Vikings]] to settle in [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. During this period the [[Crusades]] took place and the Byzantine Empire was eventually pushed back by the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The end of the Medieval Warm Period coincides with the early 14th century reaching a temperature minimum around 1350, and by the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]]. Many settlements were [[Abandonment (legal)|abandon]]ed and left [[Deserted medieval village#Deserted medieval villages|deserted]]. As a consequence, the population in [[Central Europe]] drastically receded by as much as 50 percent.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

After a short warming pulse around 1500, the [[Little Ice Age]] followed, lasting from c. 1550 until 1860. The [[Northern Hemisphere]] [[snow line]] descended by 100 to 200 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Porter |first=S. C. |year=1986 |title=Pattern and Forcing of Northern Hemisphere Glacier Variations during the Last Millennium |journal=Quaternary Research |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=27–48 |doi=10.1016/0033-5894(86)90082-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Human history during this time includes [[the Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and also major rebellious events like the [[Thirty Years War]] and the [[French Revolution]]. The beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] also dates back to this period, while [[Southeast Asia]] experienced the [[Dark ages of Cambodia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

From 1860 onwards, the temperatures started to rise again and initiated the modern climatic optimum. This warming was severely amplified by anthropogenic influences (i.e. increasing industrialisation, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and [[global warming]]). The modern warming shows a distinct temperature rise from the 1970s onwards.  According to NASA, this is not expected to change within the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global temperature rise|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/|website=NASA Climate Change|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Major greenhouse gas trends.png|thumb|300px|Evolutionary trends of greenhouse gases and CFCs]]

[[Ice core]] analyses from [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]] show a very similar evolution in greenhouse gases. After a temporary minimum during the preceding subboreal and atlantic the concentrations of [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrous oxide]] and [[methane]] slowly started to rise during the Subatlantic. Since 1800 onwards this rise has dramatically accelerated paralleling roughly the concomittant temperature rise. For example, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-concentration increased from 280 ppm to a recent value of nearly 400 [[parts per million|ppm]], methane from 700 to 1800 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from 265 to 320 ppb.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, E.

L. Miller (editors). Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable rise had already taken place at the changeover to the Holocene, but this process then took nearly 5,000 years. This sudden release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by human society represents an unprecedented experiment with unpredictable consequences for Earth's climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.desdemonadespair.net/2013/11/greenhouse-gas-concentrations-in.html | title=Greenhouse gas concentrations in atmosphere reach new record – 'Unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/2137673/greenhouse_gases_alone_are_causing_unprecedented_arctic_warming.html | title=Greenhouse gases alone are causing unprecedented Arctic warming}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-7-1.html | title=FAQ 7.1 - AR4 WGI Chapter 7: Couplings Between Changes in the Climate System and Biogeochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the same context the release of juvenile [[water]] tied up in fossil fuels like [[coal]], [[lignite]], [[gas]] and [[petrol]] is generally overlooked.

== Sea level ==
[[File:Post-Glacial Sea Level.png|thumb|300px|Post-glacial sea level rise.]]

During the 2,500 year duration of the subatlantic global [[sea level]] kept on rising by about 1 meter. This corresponds to a rather low rate of 0.4 millimeters per year. Yet at the end of the 19th century a drastic change can be witnessed with a rate increase to 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm per year in the period 1880 to 2000. In the last twenty years alone [[satellite]] measurements document a rise of 50 millimeters which corresponds to a sixfold increase on the pre-industrial rate and a new rise of 2.5 millimeters per year.

=== Evolution in the Baltic ===
Today's sea level was already reached during the oldest subatlantic by the [[Litorina transgression|third Litorina transgression]]. The sea level rise had amounted to 1 meter, since then it oscillated around the zero mark. The transgression established during the ''postlitorine phase'' the [[Limnea Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hupfer |first=Peter |year=1981 |title=Die Ostsee&amp;nbsp;– kleines Meer mit großen Problemen |location=Leipzig |publisher=BSB B. G. Teubner Verlagsgesellschaft |edition=Third |oclc=465125579 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is characterized by lower [[salinity]] compared with the preceding [[Littorina Sea]] due to an [[isostasy|isostatic]] shallowing of the [[Denmark|Danish]] sea straits ([[Great Belt]], [[Little Belt]] and [[Öresund]]). As a consequence the [[sea snail]] ''[[Littorina littorea]]'' was gradually replaced by the freshwater snail ''[[Limnaea ovata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hyvärinen, H. ''et al.'' (1988). The Litorina Sea and Limnea Sea in the northern and central Baltic. Donner, J. &amp; Raukas, A. (editors): Problems of the Baltic Sea History. Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fennicae, Series A, III. Geologica-Geographica, 148, p. 25–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the middle subatlantic about 1,300 years ago another rather weak sea level rise took place. Yet the salinity kept falling and therefore new freshwater species were able to immigrate. During the younger and youngest subatlantic about 400 years ago the Limnea Sea was replaced by the [[Mya Sea]] as distinguished by the immigration of the [[clam]] ''[[Mya arenaria]]'' which eventually gave way to the recent [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hessland |first=I. |year=1945 |title=On the Quaternary Mya Period in Europe |journal=Arkiv för Zoologi |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=1–51 |doi= |issn=0004-2110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution of the North Sea area ===
In the [[North Sea]] area, which had experienced a slight sea level fall and sea level stagnation during the subboreal, the renewed transgressive pulses of the [[Dunkerque transgression]] during the older subatlantic achieved the recent level.

== Vegetation history ==
The wet and cool older subatlantic (pollen zone IX a) is characterized in central Europe by an [[oak]] forest intruded more and more by [[beech]] (mixed oak forests with [[Tilia|lime]] and [[elm]] or mixed oak forests with [[Fraxinus|ash]] and beech). Humid terrains were generally occupied by [[alder]] and ash. The mixed oak forests lasted until the middle subatlantic (pollen zone IX b), which also had a wet but somewhat milder climate. Interspersed within the middle subatlantic are peaks in the occurrence of [[Fagus sylvatica|European beech]] and [[Carpinus betulus|European hornbeam]] (mixed oak forests with beech or mixed oak forests with elm, hornbeam and beech).

During the younger subatlantic (pollen zone X a), whose wet and temperate climate resembled already today's conditions, a mixed or an almost pure beech forest established itself. Anthropogenic influences (i. e. agricultural land uses, grazing and forestry) that date back to the [[bronze age]] started to become dominant. The actual youngest subatlantic (pollen zone X b) with its wet and temperate climate shows a distinct [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] gradient with decreasing rainfall from west to east. Natural and indigenous forest communities were severely diminished and more and more replaced by artificially managed forest communities.

In northwestern [[Germany]] mixed oak forests take up 40% amongst the total tree pollen during the older subatlantic and are therefore dominant. Afterwards their count starts fluctuating and they are definitely receding during the younger subatlantic. The percentage of elms and limes as members of the mixed oak forests yet stayed constant. Alders receded from 30 to 10%. [[Pine]] trees were also receding but peaked during the youngest subatlantic due to forestry. [[Hazel]] (15%), [[birch]] (5%) and [[willow]] (&lt; 1%) roughly kept their numbers. Significant was the spreading of beech (from 5 to 45%) and hornbeam (from 1 to 15%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmitz |first=H. |year=1956 |title=Die pollenanalytische Gliederung des Postglazials im nordwestdeutschen Flachland |journal=Eiszeitalter und Gegenwart |volume=6 |issue= |pages=52–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to H. M. Müller the spreading of beech was caused by an increase in humidity since 550 BC and later favoured by a decrease in human settlements during the migrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Müller |first=H. M. |year=1969 |title=Die spätpleistozäne und holozäne Vegetationsentwicklung im östlichen Tieflandsbereich der DDR zwischen Nördlichem und Südlichem Landrücken |journal=Wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen der Geographischen Gesellschaft der DDR |volume=10 |issue= |pages=155–165 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbs like [[cornflower]], [[atriplex]], [[sorrel]] and [[plantago]] also show a pronounced rise from 15 to 65% amongst the total pollen. [[Cereals]] were also on the increase&amp;nbsp;– they augmented from 5 to 30% and clearly document an expanding agriculture during the younger subatlantic.

In northern Germany ([[Holstein|Ostholstein]]) the vegetational evolution was very similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmitz |first=H. |year=1953 |title=Die Waldgeschichte Ostholsteins und der zeitliche Verlauf der postglazialen Transgression an der holsteinischen Ostseeküste |journal=Ber.

Amongst the tree pollen the mixed oak forest was able to keep its share of 30%. Alders were also retreating from 40 to 25%. Let alone small fluctuations birch, beech and hornbeam overall conserved their share (hornbeam showed a distinct peak at the beginning younger subatlantic). Pine trees were also augmenting during the youngest subatlantic.

Several distinct events could be recognized (from young to old):

* Spreading of pine trees (K) – at about 1800—due to forestry
* second beech peak (F 2)
* first beech peak (F 1) – at about 1300 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelsen, V. M. (1952). Pollenanalytiske undersogelser ved Bolle, et bidrag til Vegetationshistorien i subatlantisk tid. Nationalmuseets 3. afd. Arkaeologiske Landsbyundersegelser, 1, p. 109–132, Kopenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lower Saxony]] already at about 800 AD.
* fifth hazel peak  (C 5) – at about 200 to 400 AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schütrumpf |first=R. |year=1951 |title=Die pollenanalytische Untersuchung eisenzeitlicher Funde aus dem Rüder Moor, Kreis Schleswig |journal={{ill|Offa (journal)|lt=Offa|de|Offa (Zeitschrift)}} |volume=9 |pages=53–57 |issn=0078-3714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—due to climatic reasons

==Fauna and flora==

[[Fauna]]l diversity has severely suffered since the middle of the 19th century by forced industrialisation and the concomitant [[pollution]] of the environment. This trend has reached alarming proportions since 1975. According to the [[Living Planet Index]] [[vertebrates]] have so far suffered a loss of 40% of their species. [[Freshwater]] taxa have even been more severely affected&amp;nbsp;— they have lost up to 50%, mainly due to biotope loss and water pollution.  According to NASA, agriculture, fisheries and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised in the Northeastern United States.  In the Southeastern United States, increasing wildfires, insect outbreaks and tree diseases are causing widespread tree die-off.&lt;ref name="US Global Change Research Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=US Regional Effects|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/|website=NASA Global Climate Change|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''surface condenser''' is a commonly used term for a water-cooled [[shell and tube heat exchanger]] installed on the exhaust [[steam]] from a [[steam turbine]] in [[thermal power station]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert Thurston Kent]] (Editor in Chief)|title=Kents’ Mechanical Engineers’ Handbook|edition=Eleventh edition (Two volumes)|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons (Wiley Engineering Handbook Series)|year=1936|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Babcock&gt;{{cite book|author=Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.|title=Steam: Its Generation and Use|edition=41st|year=2005|isbn=0-9634570-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Elliott, Kao Chen, Robert Swanekamp (coauthors)|title=Standard Handbook of Powerplant Engineering|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1997|isbn=0-07-019435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] are [[heat exchangers]] which convert steam from its gaseous to its liquid state at a pressure below [[atmospheric pressure]]. Where cooling water is in short supply, an air-cooled condenser is often used.  An air-cooled condenser is however, significantly more expensive and cannot achieve as low a steam turbine exhaust pressure (and temperature) as a water-cooled surface condenser.

Surface condensers are also used in applications and industries other than the condensing of steam turbine exhaust in power plants.

==Purpose==
In thermal power plants, the purpose of a surface condenser is to [[condensation|condense]] the exhaust steam from a steam turbine to obtain maximum [[Thermal efficiency|efficiency]], and also to convert the turbine exhaust steam into pure water (referred to as steam condensate) so that it may be reused in the [[Water-tube boiler|steam generator]] or [[boiler]] as boiler feed water.

==Why it is required==
The steam turbine itself is a device to convert the [[heat]] in steam to mechanical [[Power (physics)|power]]. The difference between the heat of steam per unit mass at the inlet to the turbine and the heat of steam per unit mass at the outlet from the turbine represents the heat which is converted to mechanical power. Therefore, the more the conversion of heat per [[pound (mass)|pound]] or [[kilogram]] of steam to mechanical power in the turbine, the better is its efficiency. By condensing the exhaust steam of a turbine at a pressure below atmospheric pressure, the steam pressure drop between the inlet and exhaust of the turbine is increased, which increases the amount of heat available for conversion to mechanical power. Most of the heat liberated due to [[condensation]] of the exhaust steam is carried away by the cooling medium (water or air) used by the surface condenser.

==Diagram of water-cooled surface condenser==
[[Image:Surface Condenser.png|thumb|right|354px|Diagram of a typical water-cooled surface condenser]]
The adjacent diagram depicts a typical water-cooled surface condenser as used in power stations to condense the exhaust steam from a [[steam turbine]] driving an [[electrical generator]] as well in other applications.&lt;ref name=Babcock/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/eog/course422/ce6b3.html Air Pollution Control Orientation Course] from website of the Air Pollution Training Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kolmetz.com/pdf/ENERGY%20EFFICIENCY%20IMPROVEMENT.pdf Energy savings in steam systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225000/http://kolmetz.com/pdf/ENERGY%20EFFICIENCY%20IMPROVEMENT.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} ''Figure 3a, Layout of surface condenser'' (scroll to page 11 of 34 pdf pages)&lt;/ref&gt; There are many fabrication design variations depending on the manufacturer, the size of the steam turbine, and other site-specific conditions.

===Shell===
The shell is the condenser's outermost body and contains the heat exchanger tubes. The shell is fabricated from [[carbon steel]]  plates and is stiffened as needed to provide rigidity for the shell. When required by the selected design, intermediate plates are installed to serve as baffle plates that provide the desired flow path of the condensing steam. The plates also provide support that help prevent sagging of long tube lengths.

At the bottom of the shell, where the condensate collects, an outlet is installed. In some designs, a [[sump]] (often referred to as the hotwell) is provided. Condensate is pumped from the outlet or the hotwell for reuse as [[boiler feedwater]].

For most water-cooled surface condensers, the shell is under [partial] [[vacuum]] during normal operating conditions.

===Vacuum system===
[[Image:Ejector or Injector.svg|thumb|right|396px|Diagram of a typical modern injector or ejector.  For a [[injector|steam ejector]], the motive fluid is steam.]]
For water-cooled surface condensers, the shell's internal vacuum is most commonly supplied by and maintained by an external [[Injector|steam jet ejector]] system. Such an ejector system uses steam as the motive fluid to remove any non-condensible gases that may be present in  the surface condenser. 
The [[Venturi effect]], which is a particular case of [[Bernoulli's principle]], applies to the operation of steam jet ejectors.

Motor driven mechanical [[vacuum pump]]s, such as the [[liquid ring]] type, are also popular for this service.

===Tube sheets===
At each end of the shell, a sheet of sufficient thickness usually made of [[stainless steel]] is provided, with holes for the tubes to be inserted and rolled. The inlet end of each tube is also bellmouthed for streamlined entry of water. This is to avoid [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] at the inlet of each tube giving rise to erosion, and to reduce flow friction. Some makers also recommend plastic inserts at the entry of tubes to avoid eddies eroding the inlet end. In smaller units some manufacturers use ferrules to seal the tube ends instead of rolling. To take care of length wise [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] of tubes some designs have expansion joint between the shell and the tube sheet allowing the latter to move longitudinally. In smaller units some sag is given to the tubes to take care of tube expansion with both end water boxes fixed rigidly to the shell.

===Tubes===
Generally the tubes are made of [[stainless steel]], copper alloys such as brass or bronze, [[cupro nickel]], or [[titanium]] depending on several selection criteria.  The use of copper bearing alloys such as brass or cupro nickel is rare in new plants, due to environmental concerns of toxic copper alloys.  Also depending on the steam cycle water treatment for the boiler, it may be desirable to avoid tube materials containing copper.  Titanium condenser tubes are usually the best technical choice, however the use of titanium condenser tubes has been virtually eliminated by the sharp increases in the costs for this material. The tube lengths range to about 85&amp;nbsp;ft (26 m) for modern power plants, depending on the size of the condenser.  The size chosen is based on transportability from the manufacturers’ site and ease of erection at the installation site. The outer diameter of condenser tubes typically ranges from 3/4 inch to 1-1/4 inch, based on condenser cooling water friction considerations and overall condenser size.

===Waterboxes===
The tube sheet at each end with tube ends rolled, for each end of the condenser is closed by a fabricated box cover known as a waterbox, with flanged connection to the tube sheet or condenser shell. The waterbox is usually provided with man holes on hinged covers to allow inspection and cleaning.

These waterboxes on inlet side will also have flanged connections for cooling water inlet [[butterfly valve]]s, small vent pipe with hand [[valve]] for air venting at higher level, and hand operated drain [[valve]] at bottom to drain the waterbox for maintenance. Similarly on the outlet waterbox the cooling water connection will have large flanges, [[butterfly valve]]s, vent connection also at higher level and drain connections at lower level. Similarly [[thermometer]] pockets are located at inlet and outlet pipes for local measurements of cooling water temperature.

In smaller units, some manufacturers make the condenser shell as well as waterboxes of [[cast iron]].

==Corrosion==
On the cooling water side of the condenser:

The tubes, the tube sheets and the water boxes may be made up of materials having different compositions and are always in contact with circulating water. This water, depending on its chemical composition, will act as an [[electrolyte]] between the metallic composition of tubes and water boxes. This will give rise to electrolytic [[corrosion]] which will start from more anodic materials first.

'''''Sea water based condensers,''''' in particular when sea water has added chemical [[pollutants]], have the worst corrosion characteristics. River water with [[pollutants]] are also undesirable for condenser cooling water.

The corrosive effect of sea or river water has to be tolerated and remedial methods have to be adopted. One method is the use of [[sodium hypochlorite]], or [[chlorine]], to ensure there is no marine growth on the pipes or the tubes. This practice must be strictly regulated to make sure the circulating water returning to the sea or river source is not affected.

On the steam (shell) side of the condenser:

The concentration of undissolved gases is high over air zone tubes. Therefore, these tubes are exposed to higher corrosion rates. Some times these tubes are affected by stress corrosion cracking, if original stress is not fully relieved during manufacture. To overcome these effects of corrosion some manufacturers provide higher corrosive resistant tubes in this area.

===Effects of corrosion===
As the tube ends get corroded there is the possibility of cooling water leakage to the steam side contaminating the condensed steam or condensate, which is harmful to [[Steam generator (boiler)|steam generator]]s. The other parts of water boxes may also get affected in the long run requiring repairs or replacements involving long duration shut-downs.

===Protection from corrosion===
[[Cathodic protection]] is typically employed to overcome this problem. [[Sacrificial anode]]s of [[zinc]] (being cheapest) plates are mounted at suitable places inside the water boxes.  These zinc plates will get corroded first being in the lowest range of anodes. Hence these zinc anodes require periodic inspection and replacement. This involves comparatively less down time. The water boxes made of steel plates are also protected inside by epoxy paint.

==Effects of tube side fouling==
As one might expect, with millions of gallons of circulating water flowing through the condenser tubing from seawater or fresh water, anything that is contained within the water flowing through the tubes can ultimately end up on either the condenser tubesheet (discussed previously) or within the tubing itself.  Tube-side fouling for surface condensers falls into five main categories; particulate fouling like silt and sediment, biofouling like slime and [[biofilm]]s, scaling and crystallization such as calcium carbonate, macrofouling which can include anything from [[zebra mussel]]s that can grow on the tubesheet, to wood or other debris that blocks the tubing, and finally, corrosion products (discussed previously).

Depending on the extent of the fouling, the impact can be quite severe on the condenser's ability to condense the exhaust steam coming from the turbine.  As fouling builds up within the tubing, an insulating effect is created and the heat-transfer characteristics of the tubes are diminished, often requiring the turbine to be slowed to a point where the condenser can handle the exhaust steam produced.  Typically, this can be quite costly to power plants in the form of reduced output, increase fuel consumption and increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  This "derating" of the turbine to accommodate the condenser's fouled or blocked tubing is an indication that the plant needs to clean the tubing in order to return to the turbine's [[nameplate capacity]]. A variety of methods for cleaning are available, including online and offline options, depending on the plant's site-specific conditions.

== Other applications of surface condensers ==
* [[Vacuum evaporation]]
* Vacuum refrigeration
* [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|Ocean Thermal Energy (OTEC)]]
* Replacing barometric condensers in steam-driven ejector systems
* Geothermal energy recovery
* Desalination systems

==Testing==
National and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used in testing large condensers. In the U.S., [[ASME]] publishes several performance test codes on condensers and heat exchangers. These include ASME PTC 12.2-2010, Steam Surface Condensers,and PTC 30.1-2007, Air cooled Steam Condensers.

The '''Tasman Front''' is a relatively warm water east-flowing surface current and thermal boundary that separates the [[Coral Sea]] to the north and the [[Tasman Sea]] to the south.

In [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition, '''the Messiah's Donkey''' ([[Hebrew]]: חמורו של משיח) refers to the [[donkey]] &lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 98a&lt;/ref&gt; upon which the [[Messiah]] will arrive to redeem the world at the [[end times|end of days]]. In [[Modern Hebrew]] the phrase "the Messiah's donkey" is used to refer to someone who does the 'dirty work' on behalf of someone else.

The origin of the belief can be found in {{bibleref2|Zechariah|9:9}}: "... your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zachariah%209:9&amp;version=47 |title=Passage Lookup: Zachariah 9:9 |publisher=BibleGateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'king' referred to in this verse is interpreted by [[Chazal]] as referring to the Messiah.

In the discussion regarding this verse in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Sanhedrin]] 98a) a story is told of the Persian king Shevor, who asks 
Samuel one of the [[Amoraim]]: ''Why doesn't your Messiah come riding on a horse? If he lacks one, I'll be glad to provide him with one of my fast horses!'' In response to the ridicule of the king, Samuel answers: ''Do you have a horse that has a hundred shades of color?''  [As the donkey of the messiah will be such].

In the [[New Testament]] ({{bibleref2|Mark|11:1-11}}) it is told that as [[Jesus]] approached the [[Mount of Olives]], he sent two of his disciples to a nearby village to fetch him a donkey. Upon their return, Jesus then rode the donkey into Jerusalem where he was met by cheering crowds. According to the [[Christianity|Christian]] religious tradition, this was the fulfillment of the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9.

According to some Muslim historians and scholars the prophecy of the Messiah's Donkey was fulfilled when [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] travelling alone with one donkey and one servant. When he arrived in Jerusalem, he was greeted by [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]], who undoubtedly must have been amazed that the caliph of the Muslims, one of the most powerful people in world arriving on a donkey which fulfilled the prophecy in Zechariah 9:9: "... your king is coming to the arrival."{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Modern references==
In [[Israel]], the phrase "the Messiah's Donkey" can also refer to the controversial political-religious doctrine ascribed to the teachings of  [[Avraham Yitzhak Kook]] which claims that [[secular Jews]], which represent the material world, are an instrument in the hands of [[God]] whose purpose it was to establish the [[State of Israel]] and begin the process of redemption, but upon its establishment they would be required to step aside and allow the [[Religious]]-[[Haredi]] public to govern the state. According to this analogy, the secular Jewish public are the "donkey", while the Religious-Haredi public who would take their place represent a collective quasi-Messianic body. A book called ''The Messiah's Donkey'', which focuses on this issue, was published in 1998 by Seffi Rachlevsky and caused widespread controversy among the Jewish-Israeli public; according to [[Hassidic]] teaching the donkey is a symbol of the fact that the Messiah and Messianic age will not oppose the material world, but rather harness it for sacred purposes. Thus, the act of riding upon the donkey is a symbol of the sovereignty of the Messiah over the material world (represented by the donkey).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=16859 |title=עולם סוער - התפתחותו של הרב קוק : "חמורו של משיח" |publisher=Lib.cet.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Quiet Garden Trust''' is a non-profit organisation which encourages the provision of Quiet Gardens where people can set aside time for contemplation, prayer and renewal. The opening of the gardens is controlled by the respective owners, and the Trust plays a co-ordinating and resourcing role. There are currently about three hundred Quiet Gardens in eighteen countries, and the idea has grown to encompass quiet spaces in churches, schools, hospitals and prisons. The gardens are open to people of all faiths, for stillness and reflection.&lt;ref name="BbcQuiet"/&gt;

==History and founder==
The Quiet Garden Movement started in 1992, founded by Revd Philip Roderick, then the Director of the Chiltern Christian Training Programme in the [[Diocese of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Churchtimes"/&gt; The first Quiet Garden was a domestic garden in [[Stoke Poges]], [[Buckinghamshire]], belonging to Geoffrey Cooper, who was [[The Daily Telegraph]]’s aviation correspondent.&lt;ref name="TelegraphQuiet"/&gt;

Roderick is an [[Anglican ministry|Anglican priest]], a [[Percussion instrument|percussionist]], an educator and a writer who worked as a trainer in theology and spirituality for both laity and clergy.&lt;ref name="Episcopalmaryland"/&gt; Originally from [[South Wales]], he was brought up a [[Methodism|Methodist]], and read Philosophy and English at [[Swansea University]].&lt;ref name="Bowden-Pickstock2009"/&gt; Many threads are woven into his spiritual experience, including meditation, the monastic tradition and contact with other religions. He was ordained and became a university chaplain, and it was after visiting Christian communities in India and America during a [[sabbatical]] in 1992 that he realised the significance in the life of Jesus of withdrawing to a quiet place to spend time in solitude. It was this that led him to found the Quiet Garden Movement later that year.&lt;ref name="Bowden-Pickstock2009"/&gt;

The Quiet Garden Trust was registered as a charity by the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]] on 21 June 1994.&lt;ref name="Charitycommission"/&gt;

==Garden locations==
The Quiet Garden Movement has spread over the past twenty years to encompass about three hundred gardens in many parts of the world, not only in European countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Belgium, Finland, Austria, Switzerland and Cyprus, but also in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Uganda, Brazil, Haiti, Canada and the USA.&lt;ref name="QuietGardenLocations"/&gt;

The gardens vary widely in size, location and character.&lt;ref name="BbcQuiet"/&gt; Most cater for a broad public, but some were created to serve a particular community, such as the Quiet Garden on the edge of the [[Nsambya Hospital]] in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]] for [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] patients and carers.&lt;ref name="Roderick2007"/&gt; [[Polesworth Abbey]] in Warwickshire has created a [[sensory garden]] with fragrant herbal plants, designed in consultation with both sighted and partially sighted people,&lt;ref name="ArcworldNews"/&gt; and a Quiet Prison Garden in [[HM Prison Bedford]] (now closed) benefited both prisoners and staff.&lt;ref name="CPRE"/&gt;

Others are simply private gardens which people have decided to share. For example, Michael and Janet Chapman frequently open their three-acre garden just outside London. “We are lucky enough to have this lovely garden. To hog it all to ourselves would be like keeping an [[Old Master]] tucked away in the basement,” says Michael.&lt;ref name="TelegraphQuiet"/&gt;

==Ecumenism and diversity==
The Quiet Garden Movement transcends normal doctrinal barriers and denominational divisions. Although Roderick is an Anglican clergyman, the concept has been embraced by a diverse range of faiths.

A [[Quakers|Quaker]] group in [[Beverley]], [[Yorkshire]] celebrated its fiftieth anniversary by creating a Quiet Garden next to their [[Friends meeting house]].&lt;ref name="BbcQuaker"/&gt; The first Orthodox Quiet Garden was set up in the grounds of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] in [[Sifton, Manitoba]], Canada.&lt;ref name="ArchdioceseQuietgarden"/&gt; Other fellowships that have established Quiet Gardens include [[Alcester]] [[Baptists|Baptist]] Church,&lt;ref name="Alcesterbaptist"/&gt; Immanuel [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in [[San Jose, California]],&lt;ref name="QuietPlaces"/&gt; and a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic church]] in [[Stainforth, South Yorkshire]] that reclaimed derelict land with the help of prisoners from a nearby prison.&lt;ref name="ArcworldNews"/&gt; There is also a Quiet Garden at the [[Order of Saint Benedict|English Benedictine Monastery]] of [[Worth Abbey]] in [[Crawley]], [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref name="Worthabbey"/&gt;

In the words of Philip Roderick, "Openness to God in unexpected places is what it is all about. God is all over the place, we only have to open our ears and our eyes."&lt;ref name="Bowden-Pickstock2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1157">'''Toxic capacity''' can mean the [[toxicity]] of a substance, possibly in relation to a specific [[organism]] and '''toxic capacity''' can mean the capacity of an organism, organic system or [[ecosystem]] to contain a toxic substance or a selection of toxic substances (a compound) without showing signs of poisoning or dying.

==Toxic capacity among humans, children==
Generally people with less mass have a lower toxic capacity than people with larger mass.  In particular, children (who have lower mass compared to an adult) are more vulnerable to toxic effects of compounds.  The compounds do not have to be poisons but could be medications as well, which is why children's dosages are almost always less than those of an adult, and the overdose danger higher for children.

The '''turnoff point''' for a [[star]] refers to the point on the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] where it leaves the [[main sequence]] after the exhaustion of its main fuel.  It is often referred to as the '''main sequence turnoff'''.

By plotting the turnoff point of the stars in [[star clusters]], one can estimate the cluster's age.

==Stars with no turnoff point==
[[Red dwarfs]] are stars of 0.08-0.4 solar masses and are also referred to as class M stars.  Red dwarfs have sufficient [[hydrogen]] mass to sustain hydrogen [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] to [[helium]] via the [[proton-proton chain reaction]], but do not have sufficient mass to create the temperatures and pressures necessary to fuse helium to [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] or [[oxygen]] (see [[CNO cycle]]).  However, all their hydrogen is available for fusion, and the low temperatures and pressures mean the lifetimes of these stars on the main sequence from zero point to turn off point is measured in trillions of years.  For example, the lifespan of a star of 0.1 solar masses is 6 trillion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Iliadis | first = Christian | title = Nuclear Physics of Stars | publisher = [[Wiley-VCH]] | location = Weinheim | date = 2007 | isbn = 3-527-40602-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This lifespan greatly exceeds the current age of the [[universe]], therefore all red dwarfs are main sequence stars.  Even though extremely long lived, those stars will eventually run out of fuel.  Once all of the available hydrogen has been fused [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] stops and the remaining heated helium slowly cools by [[radiation]].  [[Gravity]] will contract the star from lack of expansive pressure from fusion until [[electron degeneracy pressure]] compensates.  The cooling star is now off the main sequence and is known as a helium [[white dwarf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Seeds | first = Michael | title = Horizons | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | location = Australia | date = 2006 | isbn = 0-495-01003-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protected forest area, '''Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh''', is located in the [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Trancarpathian region]] of [[Ukraine]] and belongs to the [[Carpathian Biosphere Reserve]]. It is the largest [[Old-growth forest|primeval]] [[Fagus sylvatica|beech]] forest worldwide with an area of 8800 ha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urwälder im Zentrum Europas.

In 1992, Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh primeval beech forest was designated as [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Later, several other primeval and old-growth beech forests in Europe were included (in 2007 and 2011) in the UNESCO World Heritage Site [[Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1133/multiple=1&amp;unique_number=1777|title=Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well.&lt;br&gt;
As a primeval beech forest, Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh is an important research hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsl.ch/de/wald/biodiversitaet-naturschutz-urwald/naturwaldreservate/waldforschung-ukraine.html|title=Kooperation in der Waldforschung zwischen der WSL und der Ukraine|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215000041/https://www.wsl.ch/de/wald/biodiversitaet-naturschutz-urwald/naturwaldreservate/waldforschung-ukraine.html|archive-date=2017-12-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a 10 ha (200 x 500 m) research sample plot was installed in [[Mala Uholka]] as part of a Swiss-Ukrainian research project, and in 2010 a full [[Forest inventory|statistical inventory]] of the primeval forest was carried out.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inventory of the Largest Primeval Beech Forest in Europe.

== Results of the 2010 forest inventory ==
The forest inventory took place on a forest area of 10 300 ha, 8800 ha of which are primeval forests. The rest is considered to be natural forest. During the fieldwork, 314 sample plots, each 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in area, were surveyed. Within each plot, all trees with a [[Diameter at breast height|diameter at breast height (DBH)]] of 6 cm and more were measured. 97% of all the 6779 trees measured were [[Fagus sylvatica|European beech (''Fagus sylvatica'' L.)]]. The oldest beech trees were nearly 500 years. The largest tree was a [[Ulmus glabra|wych elm (''Ulmus glabra'' Huds.)]] with a DBH of 150 cm, whereas the largest beech tree had a DBH of 140 cm. 10 beech trees per hectare had a DBH of at least 80 cm. The number of living trees consisted of 435 trees per hectare with a [[basal area]] of 36.6 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ha and volume of 582 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/ha. In addition, the volume of standing and lying deadwood was 163 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/ha. The vertical structure of this forest consisted of mainly three layers. Most gaps in the canopy cover were not larger than the crown of a canopy tree. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ecotourism ==
Two ecological hiking trails have been created for visitors to the primeval beech forest of Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh:
# [http://cbr.nature.org.ua/marshrut/uhl1.htm Through the primeval beech forest of Mala Uholka (The Mala Uholka hiking trail)]: This trail guides visitors to [[Druzhba (city)|Druzhba]] (Engl. “Friendship”), the longest karst cave in the Ukrainian [[Carpathians]], and to [[Karstovyi Mist]] (Engl. “Karst or Stone Bridge”), a limestone formation in the form of an arch.
# [http://cbr.nature.org.ua/marshrut/uhl2.htm Through the primeval beech forest of Velyka Uholka (The Velyka Uholka hiking trail)]: This trail guides visitors to [[Molochnyi Kamin]] (Engl. “Milky Stone”), a karst cave where [[Paleolithic]] people belonging to the bear-hunting culture used to live.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3484">The '''WD-11''' [[vacuum tube]], a [[triode]], was introduced by the [[Westinghouse Electric]] corporation in 1922 for their Aeriola RF model radio and found use in other contemporary [[regenerative receiver]]s (used as a detector-amplifier) including the Regenoflex and Radiola series.

==Drawbacks==
[[File:WD-12 Receiving Tube, Westinghouse, c. 1923 - National Electronics Museum - DSC00121.JPG|thumb|Westinghouse WD-12]]
[[File:UX199 Receiving Tube, RCA - General Electric, c. 1922 - National Electronics Museum - DSC00117.JPG|thumb|RCA UX-199]]
The WD-11's design was somewhat ill thought out, when the filament burns out it has a tendency to contact the plate, feeding high voltages back through the heater circuitry. It was replaced just a year later by higher performance tubes which were less likely to encounter this problem, Westinghouse Electric's WD-12 and [[General Electric]]'s UX-199. No radios using the WD-11 tube were designed after 1924, RCA ceased production and issued a service bulletin describing how to retrofit existing sets to use the newer UX-199 triodes.

==Collectiblity==
Because of its rarity it has become one of the most valuable vacuum tubes in the world. New-old-stock units have sold for as much as US$180 and used tubes for over $100, more than the original price of the radios that use them. Collectors rarely, if ever use these tubes for fear of burning them out.

==Substitution==
Sets that use the costly WD-11 and UX-199 tubes can be modified to use the 1A5/GT octal power [[pentode]] (Which cost around $2.50) by wiring a 5.1 [[ohm]] [[resistor]] between the pins of the filament and fabricating an octal-to-four pin adaptor. The pin for the 1A5's suppressor is left unconnected and the screen connected to the plate.

The type 12 (also known as RCA-12) is electrically identical to the type 11, but with a more common [[Tube socket#Early bases|UX4]] base.

The '''winter solstice''' (or '''hibernal solstice'''), also known as '''midwinter''', is an [[astronomical]] phenomenon marking the day with the shortest period of daylight and the longest night of the year. It occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt away from the Sun. It happens twice yearly, once in each hemisphere. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]] this is the [[December solstice]] and in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] this is the [[June solstice]].

The [[axial tilt]] of Earth and [[gyroscope#Properties|gyroscopic effects]] of its daily rotation mean that the two opposite points in the sky to which the Earth's [[axis of rotation]] points ([[axial precession]]) change very slowly (at the current rate it would take just under 26,000 years to make a complete circle). As the Earth follows its [[orbit]] around the Sun, the polar hemisphere that faced away from the Sun, experiencing winter, will, in half a year, face towards the Sun and experience summer. This is because the two hemispheres face opposite directions along Earth's axis, and so as one polar hemisphere experiences [[winter]], the other experiences [[summer]].

More evident from [[high latitudes]], a hemisphere's winter [[solstice]] occurs on the day with the shortest period of daylight and longest night of the year, when the sun's daily maximum elevation in the sky is at its lowest.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Physical Science, 12th Ed., James Ship-man, Jerry D. Wilson, Aaron Todd, Section 15.5, p 423, {{ISBN|978-0-618-92696-1}}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the winter solstice itself lasts only a moment in time, the term sometimes refers to the day on which it occurs. Other names are "midwinter", the "extreme of winter" ([[Dongzhi (solar term)|Dongzhi]]), or the "shortest day". In some cultures it is seen as the middle of winter, while in others it is seen as the beginning of winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/when-does-spring-start|title=When does spring start?|date=June 3, 2016 |accessdate=December 22, 2016 |publisher=[[Met Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[meteorology]], winter in the Northern Hemisphere spans the entire period of December through February. The seasonal significance of the winter solstice is in the reversal of the gradual lengthening of nights and shortening hours of daylight during the day. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates differ from winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see [[Analemma#Earliest and latest sunrise and sunset|earliest and latest sunrise and sunset]]).

Worldwide, interpretation of the event has varied across cultures, but many have held a recognition of rebirth, involving [[holidays]], festivals, gatherings, [[rituals]] or other [[parties|celebrations]] around that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/winter_solstice.htm |title=Winter Solstice celebrations: a.k.a.

== History and cultural significance ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
[[File:Amaterasu cave edit2.jpg|thumb|Japanese Sun goddess [[Amaterasu]] emerging from a cave (by [[Kunisada]])]]
[[File:Seasonearth.png|thumb|Winter solstice occurs in December for the northern hemisphere, and June for the southern hemisphere.]]

The [[solstice]] may have been a special moment of the annual cycle for some cultures even during [[neolithic]] times. Astronomical events were often used to guide activities such as the [[mating of animals]], the sowing of crops and the monitoring of winter reserves of food. Many cultural mythologies and traditions are derived from this. This is attested by physical remains in the layouts of late Neolithic and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological sites, such as [[Stonehenge]] in England and [[Newgrange]] in Ireland. The primary [[wikt:axis|axes]] of both of these monuments seem to have been carefully aligned on a sight-line pointing to the winter solstice sunrise (Newgrange) and the winter solstice sunset (Stonehenge). It is significant that at Stonehenge the Great [[Trilithon]] was oriented outwards from the middle of the monument, i.e. its smooth flat face was turned towards the midwinter Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Anthony |title=Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma |publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=9780500051559 |pages=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winter solstice was immensely important because the people were economically dependent on monitoring the progress of the seasons. [[Starvation]] was common during the first months of the winter, January to April (northern hemisphere) or July to October (southern hemisphere), also known as "the [[famine]] months". In temperate climates, the midwinter festival was the last feast [[Festival|celebration]], before deep winter began. Most cattle were [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]ed so they would not have to be fed during the winter, so it was almost the only time of year when a plentiful supply of fresh meat was available. The majority of wine and beer made during the year was finally [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] and ready for drinking at this time. The concentration of the observances were not always on the day commencing at midnight or at dawn, but at the beginning of the pagan day, which in many cultures fell on the previous [[evening|eve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/christmas/history-of-christmas | title=History of Christmas |publisher=History.com |accessdate=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the event was seen as the reversal of the Sun's ebbing presence in the sky, concepts of the birth or rebirth of [[sun god]]s have been common and, in cultures which used cyclic calendars based on the winter solstice, the "year as reborn" was celebrated with reference to [[Life-death-rebirth deity|life-death-rebirth deities]] or "new beginnings" such as [[Hogmanay]]'s ''redding'', a [[New Year]] cleaning tradition. Also "reversal" is yet another frequent theme, as in [[Saturnalia]]'s slave and master reversals.

===Iranian===
{{main|Yaldā Night}}
Iranian people celebrate the night of the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice as, "[[Yaldā Night|Yalda night]]", which is known to be the "longest and darkest night of the year". In this night all the family gather together, usually at the house of the oldest, and celebrate it by eating, drinking and reading poems (esp. Hafez). Nuts, pomegranates and watermelons are particularly served during this festival.

===Pagan===
{{main|Yule}}
The [[Norse paganism|pagan Scandinavian]] and [[Germanic people]] of northern Europe celebrated a twelve-day "midwinter" (winter solstice) holiday called [[Yule]] (also called Jul, Julblot, jólablót, [[midvinterblot]], julofferfest). Many modern [[Christmas]] traditions, such as the [[Christmas tree]], the [[Christmas wreath]], the [[Yule log]], and others, are direct descendents of Yule customs. Scandinavians still call Yule ''"Jul"''. In English, the word "Yule" is often used in combination with the season "yuletide" &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Yule Yule]. ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,'' Fourth Edition. Retrieved December 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; a usage first recorded in 900.  It is believed that the celebration of this day was a worship of these peculiar days, interpreted as the reawakening of nature. The Yule (Jul) particular god was Jólner, which is one of [[Odin|Odin's]] many names. 

The concept of Yule occurs in a tribute poem to [[Harald I of Norway|Harold Hårfager]] from about AD 900, where someone said "drinking Jul". Julblot is the most solemn sacrifice feast. At the "julblotet", sacrifices were given to the gods to earn blessing on the forthcoming germinating crops. Julblotet was eventually integrated into the Christian Christmas. As a remainder from this [[Viking]] era, the [[Midsummer]] is still important in Scandinavia, and hence vividly celebrated.

===Roman cult of Sol===
{{main|Dies Natalis Solis Invicti}}
[[Sol Invictus]] ("The Unconquered Sun") was originally a Syrian god who was later adopted as the chief god of the [[Roman Empire]] under [[Aurelian|Emperor Aurelian]]. His holiday is traditionally celebrated on December 25, as are several gods associated with the winter solstice in many pagan traditions.&lt;ref name=Capoccia&gt;{{cite web | last =Capoccia | first =Kathryn  | title =Christmas Traditions | year =2002 | url =http://www.biblebb.com/files/christmas00.htm | accessdate =2008-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It have been speculated to be the reason behind [[Christmas]]' proximity to the solstice.&lt;ref name="MacMullen1997"&gt;Bishop Jacob Bar-Salabi (cited in ''Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]]. Yale:1997, p. 155)&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Asian===
In [[East Asia]], the winter solstice has been celebrated as one of the [[Solar term|Twenty-four Solar Terms]], called ''[[Dongzhi (solar term)|Dongzhi]]'' in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In [[Japan]], in order not to catch [[Common cold|cold]] in the winter, there is a custom to soak oneself in the [[yuzu]] hot bath ({{Lang-ja|柚子湯}} = Yuzuyu). &lt;ref&gt; [http://goinjapanesque.com/06216/ Goin’ Japanesque!: Japanese Winter Solstice Traditions; A Day for Kabocha and Yuzuyu] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Observances ==
Although the instant of the solstice can be calculated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meeus|first1=Jean|title=Astronomical Algorithms|date=2009|publisher=Willmann-Bell, Inc.|location=Richmond, Virginia|isbn=0-943396-61-1|edition=2nd English Edition with corrections as of August 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; direct observation of the solstice by amateurs is impossible because the sun moves too slowly or appears to stand still (the meaning of "solstice"). However, by use of [[astronomy|astronomical data tracking]], the precise timing of its occurrence is now public knowledge. One cannot directly detect the precise instant of the solstice (by definition, one cannot observe that an object has stopped moving until one later observes that it has not moved further from the preceding spot, or that it has moved in the opposite direction){{Citation needed|reason=Dubious scientific claim for event on a macro scale.|date=December 2014}}. Further, to be precise to a single day, one must be able to observe a change in [[azimuth]] or elevation less than or equal to about 1/60 of the angular diameter of the sun. Observing that it occurred within a two-day period is easier, requiring an observation precision of only about 1/16 of the angular diameter of the sun. Thus, many observations are of the day of the solstice rather than the instant. This is often done by observing the sunrise and sunset or using an [[Archaeoastronomy|astronomically aligned instrument]] that allows a ray of light to be cast on a certain point around that time.

{{italic title}}
'''''Worlds in Collision''''' is a book written by [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and first published April 3, 1950. The book postulated that around the [[15th century BC]], [[Venus]] was ejected from [[Jupiter]] as a [[comet]] or comet-like object, and passed near [[Earth]] (an actual collision is not mentioned). The object changed Earth's orbit and axis, causing innumerable catastrophes that were mentioned in early [[mythology|mythologies]] and religions around the world. Many of the book's claims are completely rejected by the established scientific community as they are not supported by any available evidence.

==Publication==
The book was first published on April 3, 1950, by [[Macmillan Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky, Immanuel (1950). ''Worlds in Collision'', Macmillan. {{ISBN|1-199-84874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan's interest in publishing it was encouraged by the knowledge that Velikovsky had obtained a promise from Gordon Atwater, Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]], for a sky show based on the book when it was published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.velikovsky.info/Clark_Whelton Whelton, Clark] 1980. The Gordon Atwater Affair. ''S.I.S. Review'' '''IV''' (4), pp. 75-76. "Although Gordon Atwater had doubts about certain aspects of Velikovsky's work, he nevertheless found the basic thesis to be tenable. A reading of the manuscript confirmed his view that ''Worlds in Collision'' would be a tremendous hit at Hayden. He told Velikovsky that if a publisher for the book was found, the Planetarium would produce a sky show based on ''Worlds in Collision''."&lt;/ref&gt; The book, Velikovsky's most criticized and controversial, was an instant ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller, topping the charts for eleven weeks while being in the top ten for twenty-seven straight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, C. Leroy]] (1984). Worlds in Collision in Macmillan's Catalogues. ''Kronos'', '''9''' (2), 46-57. The 20 weeks at the top stated by Juergens in ''The Velikovsky Affair'' is incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popularity, overwhelming rejection of its thesis by the scientific community forced Macmillan to stop publishing it and to transfer the book to [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] within two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Friedlander|first= Michael W|year= 1995|title= At the Fringes of Science|location= [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, CO]]|publisher= [[Westview Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8133-2200-1|oclc= 31046052 |pages= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core ideas==
In the book's preface, Velikovsky summarized his arguments:

:''Worlds in Collision'' is a book of wars in the celestial sphere that took place in historical times. In these wars the planet Earth participated too. [...] The historical-cosmological story of this book is based in the evidence of historical texts of many people around the globe, on classical literature, on epics of the northern races, on sacred books of the peoples of the Orient and Occident, on traditions and folklore of primitive peoples, on old astronomical inscriptions and charts, on archaeological finds, and also on geological and paleontological material.

The book proposed that around the 15th century [[Common Era|BCE]], [[Venus]] was ejected from [[Jupiter]] as a [[comet]] or comet-like object, passed near [[Earth]] (an actual collision is not mentioned). The object changed Earth's orbit and axial inclination, causing innumerable catastrophes which were mentioned in early [[mythology|mythologies]] and religions around the world. Fifty-two years later, it passed close by again, stopping the Earth's rotation for a while and causing more catastrophes. Then, in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, [[Mars]] (itself displaced by Venus) made close approaches to the Earth; this incident caused a new round of disturbances and disasters. After that, the current "celestial order" was established. The courses of the planets stabilized over the centuries and Venus gradually became a "normal" planet.

These events lead to several key statements:

# Venus must be still very hot as young planets radiate heat.&lt;ref&gt;''W in C'', "The Thermal Balance Of Venus" (Ch. IX): "The night side of Venus radiates heat because Venus is hot. [..] Venus experienced in quick succession its birth and expulsion under violent conditions; an existence as a comet on an ellipse which approached the sun closely; two encounters with the Earth accompanied by discharges of potentials between these two bodies and with a thermal effect caused by conversion of momentum into heat; a number of contacts with Mars and probably also with Jupiter. Since all this happened between the third and the first millennia before the present era, the core of the planet Venus must still be hot."&lt;/ref&gt;
# Venus must be rich in petroleum gases, and hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;''W in C'', "The Gases Of Venus" (Ch. IX): "On the basis of this research, I assume that Venus must be rich in petroleum gases. If and as long as Venus is too hot for the liquefaction of petroleum, the hydrocarbons will circulate in gaseous form. The absorption lines of the petroleum spectrum lie far in the infra-red where usual photographs do not reach. When the technique of photography in the infra-red is perfected so that hydrocarbon bands can be differentiated, the spectrogram of Venus may disclose the presence of hydrocarbon gases in its atmosphere, if these gases lie in the upper part of the atmosphere where the rays of the sun penetrate."&lt;/ref&gt;
# Venus has an abnormal orbit in consequence of the unusual disasters that happened.

Velikovsky suggested some additional ideas that he said derived from these claims, including:
# Jupiter emits [[radio]] noises.&lt;ref&gt;In a lecture delivered in October 1953 Velikovsky stated: "In Jupiter and its moons we have a system not unlike the solar family. The planet is cold, yet its gases are in motion. It appears probable to me that it sends out radio noises as do the sun and the stars." (See [http://www.varchive.org/lec/671206pri.htm Lecture before the Graduate Student Forum in Princeton], December 6, 1967) In correspondence with Albert Einstein, Velikovsky (June 1954) repeated his view that Jupiter is not an inert gravitational body, and that it would be found to emit radio noises of electromagnetic (non-thermal) origin; and he offered to stake their debate on the role of electromagnetism in the mechanics of the solar system on this claim.[http://www.varchive.org/bdb/study.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[magnetosphere]] of the Earth reaches at least up to the [[moon]].
# The [[sun]] has an [[electric potential]] of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;volts.
# The rotation of the Earth can be affected by [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] fields.
Velikovsky arrived at these proposals using a methodology which would today be called [[comparative mythology]] - he looked for concordances in myths and written [[history]] of unconnected cultures across the world, following a literal reading of their accounts of the exploits of planetary deities. In this book, he argues on the basis of ancient cosmological myths from places as disparate as [[India]] and [[China]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]], [[Assyria]] and [[Sumer]]. For example, ancient Greek mythology asserts that the goddess [[Athena]] sprang from the head of [[Zeus]]. Velikovsky identifies Zeus (whose Roman counterpart was the god Jupiter) with the planet Jupiter and Athena (the Roman Minerva) with the planet Venus. This myth, along with others from ancient [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], etc. are used to support the claim that ''"Venus was expelled as a comet and then changed to a planet after contact with a number of members of our solar system"'' (Velikovsky 1972:182).

==Critical reaction==

===Contemporary reactions===
The plausibility of the theory was summarily rejected by the physics community, as the cosmic chain of events proposed by Velikovsky contradicts basic laws of physics.

Velikovsky's ideas had been known to [[astronomer]]s for years before the publication of the book, partially by his writing to astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] of [[Harvard]], partially through his 1946 pamphlet ''Cosmos Without Gravitation'',&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Velikovsky, "[http://www.varchive.org/ce/cosmos.htm Cosmos Without Gravitation: Attraction, repulsion and electromagnetic circumduction in the Solar System]" (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Friedlander|first= Michael W|year= 1995|title= At the Fringes of Science|location= [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, CO]]|publisher= [[Westview Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8133-2200-1|oclc= 31046052 |pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partially by a preview of his work in an article in the August 11, 1946, edition of the ''New York Herald Tribune''.  An article about the upcoming book was published by ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in January 1950, which was followed by an article in ''[[Newsweek]]'' (Bauer 1984:3-4) and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' in March 1950.

Shapley, along with others such as astronomer [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] (also at Harvard), instigated a campaign against the book before its publication. Initially, they were highly critical of a publisher as reputable as Macmillan publishing such a pseudoscientific book, even as a trade book,&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, James (1997). ''Redeeming Culture: American Religion in an Age of Science'', University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-29320-3}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIEGBimKQSwC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;vq=velikovsky&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Chap. 8, Two Men of Science, pp. 185-7].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grove, J.W. (1989). ''In Defence of Science: Science, technology, and, politics in modern society'', University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|0-8020-2634-6}}. Chap. 5, Pseudo-science, pp. 120-50.&lt;/ref&gt; and then their disapproval was re-invigorated when Macmillan included it among other trade books of possible interest to professors listed under the category "Science" in the back of a textbook catalog mailed to college professors.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, C. Leroy]] (1984). Worlds in Collision in Macmillan's Catalogues. ''Kronos'', '''9''' (2), 46-57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within two months of the book's initial release, the publishing of the book was transferred to Doubleday, which has no textbook division.

The fundamental criticism against this book from the astronomy community was that its celestial mechanics were irreconcilable with Newtonian [[celestial mechanics]], requiring planetary orbits which could not be made to conform to the laws of [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of angular momentum]] (Bauer 1984:70).  Velikovsky conceded that the behavior of the planets in his theories is not consistent with [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]].  He proposed that [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic forces]] could be the cause of the movement of the planets, although such forces between astronomical bodies are essentially zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Friedlander|first= Michael W|year= 1995|title= At the Fringes of Science|location= [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, CO]]|publisher= [[Westview Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8133-2200-1|oclc= 31046052 |pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Velikovsky tried to protect himself from criticism of his celestial mechanics by removing the original Appendix on the subject from ''Worlds in Collision'', hoping that the merit of his ideas would be evaluated on the basis of his comparative mythology and use of literary sources alone. However this strategy did not protect him: the appendix was an expanded version of the ''Cosmos Without Gravitation'' monograph, which he had already distributed to Shapley and others in the late 1940s—and they had regarded the physics within it as egregiously in error.

===Carl Sagan===
[[Carl Sagan]] wrote that the high surface temperature of Venus was known prior to Velikovsky, and that Velikovsky misunderstood the mechanism for this heat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Sagan|Sagan, Carl]], (1979) ''[[Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]]'' Chapter 7, "Venus and Dr. Velikovsky", section: Problem VIII: The Temperature of Venus.&lt;/ref&gt;  Velikovsky believed that Venus was heated by its close encounter with the Earth and Mars.  He also did not understand the greenhouse effect on Venus, which had earlier been elucidated by astronomer [[Rupert Wildt]].  Ultimately, Venus is hot due to its proximity to the sun; it does not emit more heat than it receives from the sun, and any heat produced by its celestial movements would have long dissipated.  Sagan concludes: "(1) the temperature in question was never specified [by Velikovsky]; (2) the mechanism proposed for providing this temperature is grossly inadequate; (3) the surface of the planet does not cool off with time as advertised; and (4) the idea of a high surface temperature on Venus was published in the dominant astronomical journal of its time and with an essentially correct argument ten years before the publication of ''Worlds in Collision''" (p.&amp;nbsp;118).

Carl Sagan also noted that "Velikovsky's idea that the clouds of Venus are composed of hydrocarbons or carbohydrates is neither original nor correct."&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Sagan|Sagan, Carl]], (1979) ''[[Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]]'' Chapter 7, "Venus and Dr. Velikovsky", section: Problem VII: The Clouds of Venus.&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan notes that the presence of hydrocarbon gases (such as petroleum gases) on Venus was earlier suggested, and abandoned, again by Rupert Wildt, whose work is not credited by Velikovsky.  Also, the 1962 [[Mariner 2]] probe was erroneously reported in the popular press to have discovered hydrocarbons on Venus.  These errors were subsequently corrected, and Sagan later concluded that "[n]either Mariner 2 nor any subsequent investigation of the Venus atmosphere has found evidence for hydrocarbons or carbohydrates" (p.&amp;nbsp;113).

Regarding Jupiter's radio emissions, Sagan noted that "all objects give off radio waves if they are at temperatures above absolute zero.  The essential characteristics of the Jovian radio emission — that it is nonthermal, polarized, intermittent radiation, connected with the vast belts of charged particles which surround Jupiter, trapped by its strong magnetic field — are nowhere predicted by Velikovsky.  Further, his 'prediction' is clearly not linked in its essentials to the fundamental Velikovskian theses. Merely guessing something right does not necessarily demonstrate prior knowledge or a correct theory."&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Sagan|Sagan, Carl]], (1979) ''[[Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]]'' Chapter 7, "Venus and Dr. Velikovsky", Section: Some Other Problems, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sagan concluded that "there is not one case where [Velikovsky's] ideas are simultaneously original and consistent with simple physical theory and observation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Sagan|Sagan, Carl]], (1979) ''[[Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]]'' Chapter 7, "Venus and Dr. Velikovsky", Section: Some Other Problems, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also noted that it was [[Athena]] and not [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] who was born from the head of Zeus – two utterly different goddesses.  Athena was never identified with a planet.

===Later reactions===
Tim Callahan, religion editor of ''Skeptic'', presses the case further in claiming that the composition of the atmosphere of Venus is a complete disproof of ''Worlds in Collision''. "...Velikovsky's hypothesis stands or falls on Venus having a reducing atmosphere made up mainly of hydrocarbons. In fact, the atmosphere of Venus is made up mainly of carbon dioxide—carbon in its ''oxidized'' form—along with clouds of sulfuric acid. Therefore, it couldn't have carried such an atmosphere with it out of Jupiter and it couldn't be the source of hydrocarbons to react with oxygen in our atmosphere to produce carbohydrates. Velikovsky's hypothesis is falsified by the carbon dioxide atmosphere of Venus."&lt;ref&gt;Callahan, Tim (2008). A New Mythology: Ancient Astronauts, Lost Civilizations, and the New Age Paradigm. ''Skeptic'', '''13''' (4), 32-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomer Dr [[Phil Plait|Philip Plait]] has pointed out that Velikovsky's hypothesis is also falsified by the presence of the Moon with its nearly circular orbit for which the length of the month has not changed sensibly in the 5,800 years the Jews have used their lunar calendar. "If Venus were to get so close to the Earth that it could actually exchange atmospheric contents [i.e., closer than {{convert|1,000|km|mi|sp=us}} from the surface of the Earth]," as Velikovsky claimed, ". . . the Moon would have literally been flung into interplanetary space. At the very least its orbit would have been profoundly changed, made tremendously elliptical... Had Venus done any of the things Velikovsky claimed, the Moon's orbit would have changed."&lt;ref&gt;Plait, Philip 2002. ''BAD Astronomy'', John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-40976-6}}. Chap. 18: Worlds in Derision: Velikovsky vs. Modern Science. pp. 181-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
By 1974, the controversy surrounding Velikovsky's work had reached the point where the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] felt obliged to address the situation, as they had previously done in relation to [[unidentified flying objects|UFO]]s, and devoted a scientific meeting to Velikovsky. The meeting featured, among others, Velikovsky himself and [[Carl Sagan]]. Sagan gave a critique of Velikovsky's ideas and attacked most of the assumptions made in ''Worlds in Collision''. His criticism is published in ''Scientists Confront Velikovsky'' (Ithaca, New York, 1977) edited by Donald Goldsmith and presented in a revised and corrected version in his book ''[[Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]]'' and is much longer than that given in the talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sagan|first= Carl|authorlink= Carl Sagan|title= [[Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science]]|origyear= Originally published 1979 by [[Random House]]|year= 1993|location= New York|publisher= [[Ballantine Books]]|isbn= 978-0-345-33689-7|oclc= 29993689}} Reprinted as {{cite book|last= Sagan|first= Carl|chapter= Chapter 15 - Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science|editor1-first= George O|editor1-last= Abell|editor1-link= George Ogden Abell|editor2-first= Barry|editor2-last= Singer|title= Science and the Paranormal: Probing the Existence of the Supernatural|year= 1981|location= New York|publisher= [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]|isbn= 978-0-684-16655-1|oclc= 6982689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan's arguments were aimed at a popular audience and he did not remain to debate Velikovsky in person, facts that some have taken to undermine Sagan's analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Ginenthal|first= Charles|title= Carl Sagan &amp; Immanuel Velikovsky|year= 1995|location= [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe, Ariz]]|publisher= New Falcon Publications|isbn= 978-1-56184-075-5|oclc= 33128016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan rebutted these charges, and further critiqued Velikovsky's ideas in his [[PBS]] television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]''. In ''Cosmos'', Sagan also criticizes the scientific community for their attitude toward Velikovsky, stating that while science is a process in which all ideas are subject to a process of extensive scrutiny before any idea can be accepted as fact, the attempt by some scientists to suppress outright Velikovsky's ideas was "the worst aspect of the Velikovsky affair."&lt;ref&gt;"Heaven and Hell". Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan, &amp; Steven Soter. "Cosmos: A Personal Voyage." PBS. KCET, Los Angeles, United States. 1980-10-19. 29:46 minutes in.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in November 1974 at the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association held at the University of Notre Dame, Michael W. Friedlander, professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis, confronted Velikovsky in the symposium "Velikovsky and the Politics of Science" with examples of his "substandard scholarship" involving the "distortion of the published scientific literature in quotations that he used to support his theses". For example, contrary to Velikovsky, R.A. Lyttleton did not write "the terrestrial planets, Venus included, ''must'' [emphasis added] have originated from the giant planets…"  Rather, Lyttleton wrote "…it is even possible…"  As Friedlander recounts, "When I gave each example, [Velikovsky's] response was 'Where did I write that?'; when I showed a photo copy of the quoted pages, he simply switched to a different topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Friedlander|first= Michael W|year= 1995|title= At the Fringes of Science|location= [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, CO]]|publisher= [[Westview Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8133-2200-1|oclc= 31046052 |pages= 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Friedlander|first= Michael W|title= Velikovsky on the Fringes (letter)|journal= [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]|year= 2002|issue= 3|page= 16|url= http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/archives/vol10n03.html|accessdate= 2009-09-13|volume= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
A thorough examination of the original material cited in Velikovsky's publications, and a severe criticism of its use, was published by Bob Forrest.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Bob (1981). ''Velikovsky's Sources''. In six volumes, with Notes and Index Volume. Privately published by the author, Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 1974, James Fitton published a brief critique of Velikovsky's interpretation of myth, drawing on the section "The World Ages" and the later interpretation of the Trojan war, that was ignored by Velikovsky and his defenders whose indictment began: "In at least three important ways Velikovsky's use of mythology is unsound. The first of these is his proclivity to treat all myths as having independent value; the second is the tendency to treat only such material as is consistent with his thesis; and the third is his very unsystematic method."&lt;ref&gt;Fitton, James (1974). Velikovsky Mythistoricus. ''Chiron'', '''I''' (1&amp;2), 29-36. Excerpts at &lt;http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/vfitton.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; A short analysis of the position of arguments in the late 20th century was given by Velikovsky's ex-associate [[C. Leroy Ellenberger]], a former senior editor of ''[[Kronos (journal)|Kronos]]'' (a journal to promote Velikovsky's ideas) (Bauer 1995:11), in his essay.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, Leroy]] (1986). A lesson from Velikovsky. ''Skeptical Inquirer'', '''10''' (4), 380-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost ten years later, Ellenberger criticized some Velikovskian and neo-Velikovskian qua "Saturnist" ideas in an invited essay.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, Leroy]] (1995). An antidote to Velikovskian delusions. [[The Skeptics Society|''Skeptic'']], '''3''' (4), 49-51. &lt;http://groups.google.com/group/talk.origins/msg/bc31349d10f8e205?&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm of controversy that was created by Velikovsky's works, especially ''Worlds in Collision'', may have helped revive the [[Catastrophism|Catastrophist]] movements in the last half of the 20th century; it is also held by some working in the field that progress has actually been retarded by the negative aspects of the so-called Velikovsky Affair.&lt;ref&gt;Steel, Duncan (1995). ''Rogue Asteroids and Doomsday Comets'', John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-30824-2}}. p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, David (2001).

[[The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]], Santa Barbara, Calif. {{ISBN|1-57607-653-9}}. 473-488. Morrison quotes scientists holding the latter view, including [[Walter Alvarez]], [[David Raup]], [[Richard A. Muller|Richard Muller]], Jay Melosh, [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]], and Don Yeomans. This survey confirms the hunch expressed by Morrison and Clark R. Chapman in Chap. 13 "Catastrophism Gone Wild: The Case of Immanuel Velikovsky" of ''Cosmic Catastrophes'' (1989)pp. 183-96.&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment of Velikovsky's work by tree-ring expert [[Mike Baillie]] is instructive: "But fundamentally, Velikovsky did not understand anything about comets … As if to comfort his readers, at one point he says that no planet at present has a course which poses a danger to this planet: '…only a few asteroids—mere rocks, a few kilometres in diameter—have orbits which cross the path of the earth.' … He did not know about the hazard posed by relatively small objects, and, just in case there is any doubt about his mistake, he repeats the notion by noting that a possibility exists of some future collision between planets, 'not a mere encounter between a planet and an asteroid'. This failure to recognize the power of comets and asteroids means that it is reasonable to go back to Velikovsky and delete all the physically impossible text about Venus and Mars passing close to the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Baillie|first= Mike G L|authorlink= Mike Baillie|chapter= Chapter 12: Velikovsky Revisited|title= Exodus to Arthur: Catastrophic Encounters with Comets|year= 1999|location= London|publisher= [[Anova Books|B.T.

More recently, the absence of supporting material in [[ice core]] studies (such as the [[Greenland]] Dye-3 and [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] cores), [[Dendrochronology|bristlecone pine tree ring data]], Swedish clay [[varve]]s, and many hundreds of cores taken from ocean and lake sediments from all over the world has ruled out any basis for the proposition of a global catastrophe of the proposed dimension within the Late [[Holocene]] age.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, C. Leroy]] (1985). Velikovsky's evidence? (Correspondence). ''Nature'' '''318''', November 21. p. 204. "The falsification of Velikovsky's scenario provided by Greenland's Dye 3 ice core [ref. 2: Ellenberger, C.L. ''Nature'' '''316''' 386 (1985)] is corroborated by ocean sediments and bristlecone pine rings [ref. 3: Ellenberger, C.L. ''Kronos'' X:1, 92-97 (1984)] and the revised late-glacial Swedish varve chronology [ref. 4: Cato, I. ''Boreas'' '''14''', 117-122 (1985)]. Either their mere existence contradicts Velikovsky or they do not contain debris suggesting a catastrophe. Velikovskian catastrophes are neither indicated by nor necessary to explain the natural stratigraphies of the Holocene."&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the fossils, geological deposits, and landforms in ''Earth in Upheaval'', which Velikovsky regards as corroborating the hypothesis presented in ''Worlds in Collision'' have been, since their publication, explained in terms of mundane noncatastrophic geologic processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, C. Leroy]] (1984). Still Facing Many Problems (Part I), sec. Tree Rings. ''[[Kronos (journal)|Kronos]]'' '''X''', 1, October, pp. 94-97. "''Earth in Upheaval'' is a brief in favor of global cosmic catastrophes to explain the geological record, but it does not make its case for all geological epochs to the exclusion of alternate explanations. In other words, . . . global, cosmic catastrophes are not ''necessary'' to explain the evidence for very recent catastrophes cited in the chapters 'Thirty-five centuries ago', 'Klimasturz', and 'Ruins of the East'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, C. Leroy]] (1985). Giant Tortoises Do Not Swim (letter). ''S.I.S. Workshop'' '''6''', 2, August. pp. 38-39. "EARTH IN UPHEAVAL is a brief in favour of global, cosmic catastrophes to explain the geologic record; but it does not make its case to the exclusion of alternate explanations. In other words, global, cosmic catastrophes are not necessary to explain the evidence cited in the chapters 'Thirty-five Centuries Ago', 'Klimasturz', and 'The Ruins of the East'." and ''Idem.'' (1986). Antarctic ice and the Dead Sea Reprised. ''S.I.S. Workshop'' '''6''', 3, February. p. 34. "The evidence in Chapters X and XII of EARTH IN UPHEAVAL, . . . where it is valid, can be explained most economically as responses to deglaciation and/or solar variability without the need to invoke cosmic catastrophes."&lt;/ref&gt; So far, the only piece of the geologic evidence which has shown to have a catastrophic origin is a "raised beach" containing [[coral]]-bearing [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] found at an elevation of 1,200 feet above sea level within the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. The sediments, which were misidentified as a "raise beach", are now attributed to [[megatsunami]]s generated by massive landslides created by the periodic collapse of the sides of the islands.&lt;ref name="McMurtryOthers2004a"&gt;McMurtry, G.M., P.

Geology. 32 (9), 741–744.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, these conglomerates, as many of the items cited as evidence for his ideas in ''Earth in Upheaval'' are far too old to be used as valid evidence supporting the hypothesis presented in ''Worlds in Collision''.&lt;ref name="McMurtryOthers2004a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[C.
