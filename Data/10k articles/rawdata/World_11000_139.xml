The '''Abealzu-Filigosa culture''' was a [[Copper Age]] culture of [[Sardinia]] (2700-2400 BC). It takes its name from the locality of Abealzu, near [[Osilo]], and Filigosa, near [[Macomer]].

The populations of this culture lived mainly in the [[Sassarese]] area and other parts of central-southern Sardinia. 
They still used [[obsidian]] to produce tools and weapons but [[copper]] objects, such as the daggers depicted in the [[Statue menhir]], were becoming common. [[Lead]] and [[silver]] were also smelted. Their economy was focused on pastoralism and agriculture.

The pottery of Abealzu show some similarities with those of the [[Rinaldone culture|Rinaldone]] and [[Gaudo culture]] of [[Italian peninsula|peninsular Italy]] &lt;ref&gt;Manlio Brigaglia-Storia della Sardegna (1995) p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

To this period date the second phase of construction of the massive [[megalithic]] temple of [[Monte d'Accoddi]].

The '''Bastetani''' or '''Bastuli''' were an [[Iberians|ancient Iberian]] (pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]) people of the [[Iberian peninsula]] (the Roman [[Hispania]]). They are believed to have spoken the [[Iberian language]]. 

Their territory extended through present-day the south part of [[Albacete Province|Albacete]], [[Almería Province|Almería]], [[Granada Province|Granada]], the eastern part of [[Málaga Province|Málaga]], and the southeastern part of [[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaén]], as well as the western part of the [[Murcia Region]] in the southeastern region of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Their main towns were from ''Baria'', present-day [[Cuevas del Almanzora|Villaricos]], to ''Bailo'' ([[Cádiz Province|Cádiz]]), as well as ''[[History of Málaga|Malaka]]'', ''Abdera'', ''Sexi'' and ''Carteia''.&lt;ref&gt;Luis A.

They were related to the [[Ilergetes]] and were not numerous. They inhabited the valley of the Saiarra river in the upper course of the [[Llobregat]] in the northern [[Tarraconense]].

The Bergistani were defeated by [[Hannibal]] during his overland journey to [[Italy]]. They are also known for having rebelled against Rome in 197 BC.

'''Bicorn and Chichevache''' are fabulous beasts that appear in European satirical works of the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]]. Bicorn is a creature—often described as a part-[[Black panther|panther]], part-[[Cattle|cow]] creature with a human-like face&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mythicalcreatureslist.com/mythical-creature/Bicorne |title=Bicorne |website=Mythical Creatures List |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613110701/http://mythicalcreatureslist.com:80/mythical-creature/Bicorne |archive-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that devours kind-hearted and devoted husbands and (because of their abundance) is plump and well fed. Chichevache, on the other hand, devours obedient wives and (because of their scarcity) is thin and starving.

==Chaucer==
[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] mentions Chichevache in the [[Envoi|envoy]] of the [[The Clerk's Tale|Clerk's Tale]] in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'':

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
O noble wyves, ful of heigh prudence,
Lat noon humylitee youre tonge naille,
Ne lat no clerk have cause or diligence
To write of yow a storie of swich mervaille
As of Grisildis pacient and kynde,
Lest Chichevache yow swelwe in hire entraille! (ll. 1183–1188)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Robinson|editor1-first=F. N. |editor1-link=Fred Norris Robinson |date=1957 |title=The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer |edition=2nd |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Chaucer may have borrowed the French term ''chichifache'' ("thin face") and put it with ''vache'' ("cow") to make the similar term ''chichevache'' ("thin or meagre cow").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://home.swipnet.se/~w-48250/mythology/c/chichevache.html |title=Chichevache |last= Segolsson |first=Pär-Erik |website=The Heathen's Place |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610102805/http://home.swipnet.se/~w-48250/mythology/c/chichevache.html |archive-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; D. Laing Purves notes that "The origin of the fable was French; but [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]] has a ballad on the subject. 'Chichevache' literally means 'niggardly' or 'greedy cow.{{'-}}"&lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg|no = 2383|name = The Canterbury Tales, and Other Poems|bullet=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lydgate==
In the early fifteenth century [[John Lydgate]] wrote "Bycorne and Chychevache", a 133-line poem in 7-line stanzas, probably from a French original. Written "at the request of a worthy citizen of London" to accompany a tapestry or painted wall-hanging, the poem is accompanied by instructions for pictorial representations. Lydgate describes the two beasts as husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hammond |editor1-first=Eleanor Prescott |date=1969 |orig-year=Originally published by Duke University Press, 1927|title=English Verse Between Chaucer and Surrey |url=https://archive.org/stream/englishversebetw00hamm#page/113/mode/1up |location=New York |publisher=Octagon |pages=113–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* A Bicorn is mentioned in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''. Its horn is used as ingredients for [[Polyjuice Potion]].
* The science fiction manga ''[[Battle Angel Alita: Last Order]]'' featured giant, bio-engineered monsters named Bicorne and Chichevache.
* Bicorns are a recurring creature in the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' video game franchise.

The '''Bünting Clover Leaf Map''', also known as '''The World in a Cloverleaf''', ([[German language|German]] title: "''Die ganze Welt in einem Kleberblat/Welches ist der Stadt Hannover meines lieben Vaterlandes Wapen''") is an historic [[mappa mundi]] drawn by the [[Germans|German]] [[Protestant]] [[pastor]], [[theologist]], and [[cartographer]] [[Heinrich Bünting]]. The map was published in his book ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'' (Travel through Holy Scripture) in 1581. 

Today the map is found within the Eran Laor maps collection in the [[National Library of Israel]] in [[Jerusalem]]. A mosaic model of the map is installed on the fence of [[Safra Square]] at the site of Jerusalem's city hall.

The map is a figurative illustration, in the manner of the medieval mappa mundi format, depicting the world via a [[clover]] shape.&lt;ref name="Carlton2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Genevieve Carlton|title=Worldly Consumers: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MCkCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|year=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-25545-3|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape is a symbolisation of the [[Christian]] [[Trinity]] and a component at the symbolisation of the German city [[Hanover]], where Bünting was born. The city of Jerusalem is represented as the centre, surrounded by three central continents, with some more areas of the world being accordingly illustrated separately from the clover.

==Description==
The dimension of the map is 38 by 30 centimeters.

Jerusalem is in the centre of the map surrounded by the three continents of [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]], comprising three leaves of a [[clover]] shape.&lt;ref name="Hiatt2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Hiatt|title=Terra Incognita: Mapping the Antipodes Before 1600|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s34YAQAAMAAJ|year=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-33303-8|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top-right leaf-shape coloured in green represents Asia, the top-left one coloured in red represents Europe, and the bottom one coloured in yellow represents Africa. The three continents include captions of their various countries and illustrations of some of their cities. Asia includes illustrations of nine cities, Europe includes one illustration of the [[Italy|Italian]] city [[Rome]], and the continent of Africa includes illustrations of three cities with one being the [[Egypt]]ian city of [[Alexandria]].

The clover is surrounded by the [[ocean]], with its surface including illustrations of sea creatures, monsters, and a ship. [[England]] and [[Denmark]]—as perhaps the tip of the entire [[Nordic countries]]—are represented as two island-shapes above Europe’s leaf. The [[Red Sea]] is illustrated between Asia and Africa, painted in red. [[Americas|America]] is represented as a separated, mostly unrevealed shape at the lower left corner, coloured in green like Asia, with the caption ''Die Neue Welt'' (The [[New World]]).

'''[[Czechs]]''' ({{lang-bg|чехи}}, ''chehi'') '''and [[Slovaks]]''' ({{lang-bg|словаци}}, ''slovatsi'') are a minority [[ethnic group]] in [[Bulgaria]] ([[Czech language|Czech]] and {{lang-sk|Bulharsko}}). According to the 2001 census, Czechs number only 316 and the number of Slovaks is even smaller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccedi.government.bg/save_pdf.php?id=247 |title=Етнически малцинствени общности |publisher=Национален съвет за сътрудничество по етническите и демографските въпроси |accessdate=2007-02-18 |language=Bulgarian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322131240/http://www.nccedi.government.bg/save_pdf.php?id=247 |archivedate=22 March 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but historically, their population has been considerably larger.

==History==
Following the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878, a large number of Czechs and Slovaks arrived in the country from [[Austria-Hungary]] to foster its cultural and economic development. These included many intellectuals and entrepreneurs, such as the historian [[Konstantin Josef Jireček]] (Minister of Education 1881–1882), the painters [[Ivan Mrkvička]] and [[Jaroslav Věšín]], the archaeologists [[Karel Škorpil]] and [[Hermann Škorpil]], the engineer and entrepreneur [[Jiří Prošek]] and the Prošek family (who built [[Lavov most]] and [[Orlov most]] and founded the [[Ariana beer|Sofia brewery]]), [[Václav Dobruský]] (first director of the [[National Archaeological Museum (Bulgaria)|National Archaeological Museum]]), the brewer Franz Milde (founder of the [[Shumensko|Shumen brewery]]), the architects [[Josef Schnitter]] (long-time chief architect of [[Plovdiv]]), [[Antonín Kolář]] (first chief architect of Sofia) and [[Lubor Bajer]] (who designed [[Stara Zagora]]'s modern street network), and many others.

Besides urban emigration, the Law for the settlement of the desolated lands of 1880 attracted many ethnic Czech and Slovak colonists, mostly [[Protestantism|Protestants]] from the regions of the [[Romania]]n [[Banat]] (particularly [[Sfânta Elena]] and [[Nădlac]]) and modern [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]]. The most notable site of the rural Czech colony in Bulgaria was the village of [[Voyvodovo, Vratsa Province]], founded by Czech colonists in 1900 and reaching a population of 800 (of which over 600 Czechs, the rest Slovaks, [[Banat Bulgarians]] and [[Banat Swabians]]) in the 1930s. Other places where Czechs and Slovaks settled were the town of [[Gorna Oryahovitsa]] and the villages of [[Belintsi]] and [[Podayva]], [[Razgrad Province]], with a significant Slovak community also present in [[Pleven Province]] ([[Gorna Mitropolia]], [[Podem]], [[Brashlyanitsa]]). A member of Bulgaria's Slovak community, Ďuro Mikoláš of Gorna Mitropolia, was an orderly ([[Batman (military)|batman]]) to [[Tsar]] [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?sid=2001090100010050001|title=Безкрайната Царска приказка|date=2005-11-09|publisher=Сега|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=3 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Podem (old name ''Martvitsa'' or Slovak ''Mŕtvica''), for example, the Slovaks arrived in 1884 from the southern [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and numbered 210 by 1910; they lived in a separate Slovak neighbourhood with characteristic Slovak houses (white, elongated and with steep roofs) and built their Evangelical Lutheran church in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.temanews.com/index.php?p=tema&amp;iid=170&amp;aid=4495 |title=Яж билиша, танжувай фришко! |last=Ценкова |first=Искра |accessdate=2008-09-02 |publisher=ТЕМА }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1948 and 1950, over 2,000 Czechs and Slovaks from [[Sofia]] and the aforementioned localities responded to the call of the government of [[Czechoslovakia]] and returned to their native land to populate areas deserted in [[World War II]]. Only around 5% of their peak number, mostly people who had married local Bulgarians, remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Словаците в България (Бележки за тяхното историческо и етнокултурно развитие) |journal=Българска Етнология |year=1995 |issue=2 |publisher=Етнографски институт с музей при БАН |language=Bulgarian |last=Botik |first=Jan |url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=837012f9-a22b-491c-9cb7-0221b3ad5c4d&amp;articleId=a442062a-75d0-44f6-a315-00b797de355a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A referendum on banning politicians and civil servants from having bank accounts or companies based in [[tax havens]] was held in [[Ecuador]] on 19 February 2017, alongside [[Ecuadorian general election, 2017|general elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecuadortimes.net/2016/11/22/referendum-on-tax-havens-will-be-conducted-in-the-elections-of-2017/ Referendum on tax havens will be conducted in the elections of 2017] Ecuador Times, 22 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was approved by voters, giving officials one year to transfer their assets.&lt;ref name=TS/&gt; If they do not, they will be removed from their posts.&lt;ref name=TS/&gt;

The question on the ballot was "Do you agree that, for those holding a popularly elected office or for public servants, there should be a prohibition on holding assets or capital, of any nature, in tax havens?"&lt;ref name=TS/&gt;

==Classification of tax havens==
In preparation for the referendum, the Ecuadorian Internal Revenue Service issued a resolution outlining the criteria for a jurisdiction to be considered a tax haven, establishing two categories: Preferential tax regimes, and low tax jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=EY&gt;[http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/tax/international-tax/alert--ecuadorian-irs-issues-resolution-with-new-list-of-tax-haven-jurisdictions Ecuadorian IRS issues resolution with new list of tax haven jurisdictions] EY, 9 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A preferential tax regime was classed as a jurisdiction whose effective tax rate is below 60% in relation to the Ecuadorian corporate income tax (CIT) rate of 13.2%.&lt;ref name=EY/&gt; A low tax jurisdiction was classed as having an effective tax rate below 60% in relation to the Ecuadorian CIT of 13.2% and no substantial economic activity.&lt;ref name=EY/&gt; The IRS may remove a country from their list of tax havens if it reforms its tax policy, if it enforces a treaty to avoid double taxation, including a special information exchange clause, or if its laws do not include banking confidentiality, securities or other regulations that prohibit sharing information with the Ecuadorian IRS.&lt;ref name=EY/&gt;

Along with this definition, the Ecuadorian IRS published a list of countries which currently meet the definition of a tax haven under their law.&lt;ref name=EY/&gt; This list included 28 jurisdictions in the Americas, 19 in Oceania, 16 in Europe, 13 in Asia, 9 in Africa and two other island territories.

'''Halfaouine child of the terraces''' {{ara|عصفور السطح}} is a Tunisian film made in 1990, first [[feature film]] of fiction by the director [[Ferid Boughedir]].
{{TOC limit}}

== Synopsis ==
In Halfaouine,a neighbourhood of [[Tunis]], young Noura, finely interpreted by the nephew of the director, is divided between several worlds: that of men in the streets, the women, with whom he can still share the [[Turkish bath|hammam]], despite his puberty approaching, and his imagination, in which he fears the transition to adult life. Boughedir paints a happy picture of Tunisian life, and illustrates the subtle and complex relationships between men and women in Tunisia.
The boy discovers the pleasures of life as their family adopt a teen girl. The boy tries whenever he has a chance to see her unclothed body. After three or four attempts the boy succeeds.

Often these governments often have little experience in dealing with international bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="YAHOO"/&gt; It works to enable broader participation in diplomatic forums such as the [[United Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/15/big-powers-clip-u-n-secretary-generals-wings/|title=Big Powers Clip U.N. Secretary-General's Wings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Union]], [[African Union]], etc. Independent Diplomat’s goal is to contribute to just and sustainable solutions to international problems by promoting inclusiveness and accountability in foreign policy.

It is an independent organisation, without connection to any particular governments or institutions, which only helps those who support democracy, [[human rights]] and the [[rule of law]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Independent Diplomat’s projects have included: helping [[Kosovo]] achieve recognition as a new state,&lt;ref name="YAHOO"/&gt; the [[National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma]], [[Somaliland]], the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] and [[Western Sahara]].  They also assist the Republic of the [[Marshall Islands]] in navigating international diplomatic processes on climate change and manage a project to reform the working methods of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The organisation has also assisted various non-profit organisations, including: [[Human Rights First]], the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Response==
According to Andrew Hudson of Crisis Action, Independent Diplomat "... fills a critical diplomatic deficit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/09/12/anarchism-the-political-philosophy/|title=Anarchism: the political philosophy|website=www.pakistantoday.com.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karhu''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[beer]] brand owned by the [[Sinebrychoff]] brewery,  part of the [[Carlsberg Group]]. ''Karhu'', meaning ''bear'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], is a [[pale lager]] with a strong taste.

The brewing of Karhu began in 1929. In 2010, Karhu had the largest market share of any Finnish beer.[https://web.archive.org/web/20111115075003/http://www.alko.fi/fi/EE93ABE62F8AB324C22572A500370399/%24File/Myydyimmat_panimotuotteet_2010.pdf] The original [[Pori Brewery]] was bought by Sinebrychoff in 1972.  From 2006 the beer has been made in a new brewery in [[Kerava]]. The Pori brewery was closed in 2009.

{{History of Indonesia}}
The '''Majapahit Empire''' ([[Javanese language|Javanese]]: ꦏꦫꦠꦺꦴꦤ꧀ꦩꦗꦥꦲꦶꦠ꧀ ''Karaton Majapahit'', {{lang-id|Kerajaan Majapahit}}) was a [[thalassocracy]] in [[Southeast Asia]], based on the island of [[Java]] (part of modern-day Indonesia), that existed from 1293 to circa 1500. Majapahit reached its peak of glory during the era of [[Hayam Wuruk]], whose reign from 1350 to 1389 was marked by conquest which extended through Southeast Asia. His achievement is also credited to his prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]]. According to the ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'' (''Desawarñana'') written in 1365, Majapahit was an empire of 98 tributaries, stretching from [[Sumatra]] to [[New Guinea]];&lt;ref name="Cribb"&gt;{{cite book | title = Historical Atlas of Indonesia | first = Robert | last = Cribb | publisher = Routledge | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781136780578 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ki8COnr7H0MC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=nature+of+majapahit+influence&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhvqrOk8TPAhUHpY8KHW2nDeIQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=majapahit%20influence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=87}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708185756/http://www.indonesianhistory.info/map/majapahit.html Majapahit Overseas Empire, Digital Atlas of Indonesian History]&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of present-day [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], southern [[Thailand]], [[Sulu Archipelago]] and [[East Timor]], although the true nature of Majapahit sphere of influence is still the subject of studies among historians.&lt;ref name="M Wood"&gt;{{cite journal|title =The Borderlands of Southeast Asia Chapter 2: Archaeology, National Histories, and National Borders in Southeast Asia|first =Michael|last =Wood|url =http://mercury.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/142914/ichaptersection_singledocument/54578174-4114-4470-a6d4-6fe4a4b376e3/en/Chapter+2.pdf|page =36|accessdate =4 May 2015|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150505003223/http://mercury.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/142914/ichaptersection_singledocument/54578174-4114-4470-a6d4-6fe4a4b376e3/en/Chapter+2.pdf|archivedate =5 May 2015|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica-Majapahit"&gt;{{cite web | title = Indonesia, The Majapahit Era | work = Britannica | url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Indonesia/The-Majapahit-era}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Majapahit was one of the last major empires of the region and is considered to be one of the greatest and most powerful empires in the history of Indonesia and Southeast Asia, one that is sometimes seen as the precedent for Indonesia's modern boundaries.&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp|page=19}}&lt;ref name="JPMajapahit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tracing the glory of Majapahit | author=Sita W.

==Etymology==
[[File:011 Mojo Fruit, Candi Brahu (39533866225).jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[Aegle marmelos|maja]]'' fruit near Brahu temple in Trowulan, the bitter-tasting fruit is the origin of the kingdom's name]]
The name ''Majapahit'' derives from local [[Javanese language|Javanese]], meaning "bitter ''maja''". German orientalist [[Berthold Laufer]] suggested that ''maja'' came from the Javanese name of ''[[Aegle marmelos]]'', an Indonesian tree.&lt;ref&gt;The Brunei Museum journal, Volume 4, Issue 1 – Page 192&lt;/ref&gt; The name originally referred to the area in and around [[Trowulan]], the cradle of Majapahit, which was linked to the establishment of a village in Tarik timberland by [[Raden Wijaya]]. It was said that the workers clearing the Tarik timberland encountered some bael trees and consumed its bitter-tasting fruit that subsequently become the village's name.&lt;ref name="NGI Trowulan"/&gt; It is a common practice in Java to name an area, a village or settlement with the most conspicuous or abundant tree or fruit species found in that region. In ancient Java it is common to refer the kingdom with its capital's name. Majapahit (sometimes also spelled ''Mojopait'') is also known by other names: ''Wilwatikta'', although sometimes the natives refer to their kingdom as ''Bhumi Jawa'' or ''[[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala Jawa]]'' instead.

==Historiography==
Little physical evidence of Majapahit remains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Taylor | first =Jean Gelman | title =Indonesia: Peoples and Histories | publisher =Yale University Press |year=2003 | location =New Haven and London | pages =29 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-300-10518-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some details of the history are rather abstract.&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp|page=18}} Nevertheless, local [[Javanese people]] did not forget Majapahit completely, as ''Mojopait'' is mentioned vaguely in ''[[Babad Tanah Jawi]]'', a Javanese chronicle composed in the 18th century. Majapahit did produce physical evidence: the main ruins dating from the Majapahit period are clustered in the [[Trowulan]] area, which was the royal capital of the kingdom. The Trowulan archaeological site was first documented in the 19th century by [[Stamford Raffles|Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles]], Lieutenant-Governor of [[British Java]] of [[British East India Company]] from 1811 to 1816. He reported the existence of "ruins of temples.... scattered about the country for many miles", and referred to Trowulan as "this pride of Java".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Bullough | first =Nigel| title =Historic East Java: Remains in Stone, Indonesian 50th independence day commemorative edition | editor= Mujiyono PH| publisher =ADLine Communications| year =1995 | location =Jakarta| page=102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nagarakertagama.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Nagarakretagama]]'' [[palm-leaf manuscript]]. Composed by [[Prapanca]] in 1365, it provides a primary historical account of Majapahit court during the reign of King [[Hayam Wuruk]].]]
By the early 20th century, Dutch colonial historians began to study old Javanese and Balinese literature to explore the past of their colony. Two primary sources were available to them:  the ''[[Pararaton]]'' ('Book of Kings') manuscript was written in the [[Kawi language]] c.&amp;nbsp;1600, and ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'' (Desawarnaña) was composed in [[Old Javanese]] in 1365.&lt;ref name="Johns1964"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pararaton'' focuses on [[Ken Arok]], the founder of [[Singhasari]], but includes a number of shorter narrative fragments about the formation of Majapahit. The ''Nagarakretagama'' is an old [[Java]]nese [[epic poem]] written during the Majapahit golden age under the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], after which some events are covered narratively.&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp| page=18}} The Dutch acquired the manuscript in 1894 during their [[Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem|military expedition against the Cakranegara royal house]] of [[Lombok]]. There are also some inscriptions in Old Javanese and Chinese.

The Javanese sources incorporate some poetic mythological elements, and scholars such as [[Cornelis Christiaan Berg|C. C. Berg]], an Indies-born Dutch naturalist, have considered the entire historical record to be not a record of the past, but a supernatural means by which the future can be determined.{{efn | group=lower-roman |1=&lt;ref&gt;C.

The list of rulers and details of the state structure show no sign of being invented.&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp | page=18}}

The Chinese historical sources on Majapahit mainly acquired from the chronicles of [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and following [[Ming dynasty]]. The Chinese accounts on Majapahit, mainly owed to the 15th century [[Zheng He]]'s account — a [[Ming Dynasty]] admiral reports during [[Treasure voyages|his visit to Majapahit]] between 1405 and 1432. Zheng He's translator [[Ma Huan]] wrote a detailed description of Majapahit and where the king of Java lived.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt; The report was composed and collected in ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', which provides a valuable insight on the culture, customs, also various social and economic aspects of ''Chao-Wa'' (Java) during Majapahit period.&lt;ref name="Chao-Wa"&gt;{{cite web|author2=JVG Mills|author1=Ma Huan |title=Ying-yai Sheng-lan, The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores | year=1970 |work= Washington.edu| pages=86–97 (Country of Chao-Wa) |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/qing/huan_ying-yai_sheng-lan%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Formation===
After [[Pamalayu expedition|defeating]] the [[Melayu Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Spuler |first1=Bertold |authorlink = |author2=F.R.C Bagley | title = The Muslim world: a historical survey, Part 4 | publisher = Brill Archive | pages=252 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VNgUAAAAIAAJ | isbn = 9789004061965 | year =  1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sumatra in 1290, [[Singhasari]] became the most powerful kingdom in the region. [[Kublai Khan]], the [[Great Khan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] and the Emperor of the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan Dynasty]], challenged Singhasari by sending emissaries demanding tribute. [[Kertanegara]], the last ruler of Singhasari, refused to pay the tribute, insulted the Mongol envoy, and challenged the Khan instead. In response, Kublai Khan [[Mongol invasion of Java|sent a massive expedition of 1,000 ships to Java]] in 1293.

====Mongol invasion====
{{main|Mongol invasion of Java}}
[[File:YuanJunk(14thcentury).jpg|thumb|Painting of a 14th-century [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] [[Junk (ship)|junk]]. Similar ships were sent by the Yuan in their naval armada.]]
By that time, [[Jayakatwang]], the ''Adipati'' (Duke) of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], a vassal state of Singhasari, had usurped and killed Kertanagara. After being pardoned by Jayakatwang with the aid of Madura's regent, Arya Wiraraja; [[Raden Wijaya]], Kertanegara's son-in-law, was given the land of [[Trowulan|Tarik]] timberland. He then opened the vast timberland and built a new settlement there. The village was named ''Majapahit'', which was taken from the name of a fruit that had a bitter taste (''[[bael|maja]]'' is the fruit name and ''pahit'' means bitter). When the Mongolian Yuan army sent by Kublai Khan arrived, Wijaya allied himself with the army to fight against Jayakatwang. Once Jayakatwang was destroyed, Raden Wijaya forced his allies to withdraw from Java by launching a surprise attack.&lt;ref name="Slamet Muljana 2005"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yuan army had to withdraw in confusion as they were in hostile territory. It was also their last chance to catch the [[monsoon]] winds home; otherwise, they would have had to wait for another six months.

====The first king, Kertarajasa Jayawardhana====
[[Image:Harihara Majapahit 1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|King [[Kertarajasa]] portrayed as [[Harihara]], amalgamation of [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]]. Originally located at Candi Simping, [[Blitar]], today it is displayed in [[National Museum of Indonesia|National Museum]].]]
In 1293, [[Raden Wijaya]] founded a stronghold with the capital Majapahit.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|200–201}} The exact date used as the birth of the Majapahit kingdom is the day of his coronation, the 15th of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] month in the year 1215 using the Javanese [[Saka era|çaka calendar]], which equates to 10 November 1293.&lt;ref name="NGI Trowulan"/&gt; During his coronation he was given the formal name Kertarajasa Jayawardhana. King Kertarajasa took all four daughters of Kertanegara as his wives, his first wife and prime queen consort Tribhuwaneswari, and her sisters; Prajnaparamita, Narendraduhita, and [[Gayatri Rajapatni]] the youngest. He also took a [[Sumatra]]n Malay [[Dharmasraya]] princess named [[Dara Petak]] as his wife.

The new kingdom faced challenges. Some of Kertarajasa's most trusted men, including [[Ranggalawe]], Sora, and Nambi were rebelled against him, though unsuccessfully. It was suspected that the ''Mahapati'' (a title equal to prime minister) [[Mahapati Halayudha|Halayudha]] set the conspiracy to overthrow all of his rivals in the court, led them to revolt against the king, while he himself gained king's favour and attained the highest position in the government. However, following the death of the last rebel Kuti, Halayudha's treachery was exposed, subsequently he was captured, jailed for his stratagems and then sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="Slamet Muljana 2005"/&gt; Wijaya himself died in 1309.

====Jayanegara==== 
[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Golden Tara]] is a 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat Majapahit period gold image discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan]], [[Philippines]] in 1918.]]
Kertarajasa Wijaya was succeeded by his heir [[Jayanegara]], his son with his [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu Dharmasraya]] spouse, [[Dara Petak|Indreswari]]. The reign of Jayanegara was a difficult and chaotic one, troubled with several rebellions by his father's former companions in arms. Among others are Gajah Biru's rebellion in 1314 and the Kuti rebellion in 1319. The Kuti rebellion was the most dangerous one, as Kuti managed to take control of the capital city. With the help of [[Gajah Mada]] and his ''Bhayangkara'' palace guard,&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|233}} Jayanegara barely escaped from the capital and safely hid in Badander village. While the king was in hiding, Gajah Mada returned to the capital city to assess the situation. After learning that Kuti's rebellion was not supported by the people or nobles of Majapahit court, Gajah Mada raised resistance forces to crush the Kuti rebellion.

After Kuti forces were defeated, Jayanegara was safely returned to his throne. For his loyalty and excellent service, Gajah Mada was promoted to high office to begin his career in royal court politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Misteri pemberontakan Ra Kuti hingga wajah asli sang Gajah Mada | author = Ya'cob Billiocta | newspaper = Merdeka.com | date = 22 April 2015 | language = Indonesian | url = http://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/misteri-pemberontakan-ra-kuti-hingga-wajah-asli-sang-gajah-mada.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tradition, Wijaya's son and successor, Jayanegara, was notorious for his immorality. One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish — it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or "weak villain". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.

In 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind the king's murder was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife. However, according to the Balinese manuscript ''[[Babad Dalem]]'', the assassination was a stratagem crafted by Gajah Mada himself in order to rid the kingdom of an evil tyrant. Tradition mentions that the immoral, cruel and abusive king often seduced and abused women, even the wives of his own subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Goda Istri Orang, Raja Jayanegara Dibunuh Tabib (Bagian-2) | author = Bahari | date = 12 September 2015 | work = Sindo | language = Indonesian | url = https://daerah.sindonews.com/read/1043588/29/goda-istri-orang-raja-jayanegara-dibunuh-tabib-bagian-2-1441971107/13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible reason includes to protect the two princesses — Gitarja and Rajadewi, the daughters of Gayatri Rajapatni from the king's cruelty. Since the slain king was childless, he left no successor.

===Golden age===

====Queen Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi====
[[File:Parvati Majapahit 2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The statue of [[Parvati]] as mortuary deified portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Tribhuwanottunggadewi]], queen of Majapahit, mother of [[Hayam Wuruk]].]][[File:Gajah-Mada.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[terracotta]] figure popularly believed as the portrait of [[Gajah Mada]], collection of [[Trowulan Museum]].]]Jayanegara's stepmother, Gayatri Rajapatni — the most revered matriarch of Majapahit court — was supposed to take the helm. However, Rajapatni had retired from worldly affairs to become a [[Bhikkhuni]]. Rajapatni appointed her daughter, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Dyah Gitarja]], or known in her formal regnal name as Tribhuwannottungadewi Jayawishnuwardhani, as the queen of Majapahit under Rajapatni's auspices. Tribhuwana appointed [[Gajah Mada]] as the Prime Minister in 1336. During his inauguration Gajah Mada declared his [[Palapa oath|Sumpah Palapa]], revealing his plan to expand Majapahit realm and building an [[empire]].&lt;ref name="JPMajapahit" /&gt;

During Tribhuwana’s rule, the Majapahit kingdom grew much larger and became famous in the area. Under the initiative of her able and ambitious prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]], Majapahit sent its armada to conquer the neighbouring island of [[Bali]].&lt;ref name="Coedes" /&gt;{{rp|234}} According to the Babad Arya Tabanan manuscript, in 1342 Majapahit forces led by Gajah Mada, assisted by his general Arya Damar, the regent of Palembang, landed in Bali. After seven months of battles, Majapahit forces defeated the Balinese king and captured the Balinese capital of Bedulu in 1343. After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Through this campaign, Majapahit planted a vassal dynasty that would rule the [[Bali Kingdom]] in the following centuries. Tribhuwana ruled Majapahit until the death of her mother in 1350. She abdicated the throne in favour of her son, Hayam Wuruk.

====Reign of Hayam Wuruk and Gajah Mada's conquest====
[[File:Majapahit Expansion.gif|thumb|260px|Expansion of the Majapahit Empire started in Trowulan Majapahit in the 13th century and extended to much of the Indonesian archipelago until it receded and fell in the early 16th century.]]
[[Hayam Wuruk]], also known as Rajasanagara, ruled Majapahit in 1350–89. During this period, Majapahit attained its peak with the help of prime minister [[Gajah Mada]]. Under Gajah Mada's command (1313–64), Majapahit conquered more territories and became the regional power.&lt;ref name="Coedes" /&gt;{{rp|234}} According to the ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'', canto XIII and XIV mentioned several states in [[Sumatra]], [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Nusa Tenggara]] islands, [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], [[New Guinea]], [[Mindanao]], [[Sulu Archipelago]], [[Luzon]] and some parts of the [[Visayas]] islands (Contested) as under the Majapahit realm of power. The [[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai|Hikayat Raja Pasai]], a 14th-century [[Aceh]] chronicle describe a Majapahit naval invasion on [[Samudra Pasai]] in 1350.&lt;ref name="Tirto-Pasai"&gt;{{cite web | title = Kejamnya Sultan Samudera Pasai dan Serbuan Majapahit | author = Iswara N Raditya | date = 21 June 2017  | work = Tirto.id | url = https://tirto.id/kejamnya-sultan-samudera-pasai-dan-serbuan-majapahit-crcW| language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacking force consisted of 400 large [[Djong (ship)|jong]] and uncountable number of malangbang and [[kelulus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of the Kings of Pasai'', 3: 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion marked the greatest extent of Majapahit, making it one of the most influential empires in the Indonesian history. It is considered as a commercial trading empire in the civilisation of Asia.

Along with launching naval and military expeditions, the expansion of the Majapahit Empire also involved diplomacy and alliance. Hayam Wuruk decided, probably for political reasons, to take princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi|Citra Rashmi]] (Dyah Pitaloka) of neighbouring [[Sunda Kingdom]] as his [[Queen consort|consort]].&lt;ref name="end"&gt;{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url= |doi= |pages=279|isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sundanese took this proposal as an alliance agreement. In 1357 the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit to accompany and marry his daughter to Hayam Wuruk.&lt;ref name=Coedes/&gt;{{rp|239}} However, Gajah Mada saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit overlordship. The skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the Majapahit troops on Bubat square was inevitable. Despite courageous resistance, the royal family were overwhelmed and decimated. Almost the whole of the Sundanese royal party were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Soekmono | first = Roden | title= Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia | volume = Vol. 2| edition = 2nd | publisher = Kanisius | year = 2002 | isbn = 9789794132906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition mentioned that the heartbroken princess committed [[suicide]] to defend the honour of her country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Y. Achadiati S |author2=Soeroso M.P. | title= ''Sejarah Peradaban Manusia: Zaman Majapahit''. | publisher = PT Gita Karya | year= 1988 | location =Jakarta| page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Bubat]], or the Pasunda Bubat tragedy, became the main theme of [[Kidung Sunda]], also mentioned in [[Carita Parahyangan]] and [[Pararaton]], however it was never mentioned in [[Nagarakretagama]].

The ''Nagarakretagama'', written in 1365, depicts a sophisticated court with refined taste in art and literature and a complex system of religious rituals. The poet describes Majapahit as the centre of a huge [[mandala]] extending from [[New Guinea]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] to [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Local traditions in many parts of Indonesia retain accounts of 14th-century Majapahit's power in more or less [[legend]]ary form. The direct administration of Majapahit did not extend beyond [[east Java]] and [[Bali]], but challenges to Majapahit's claim to overlordship in outer islands drew forceful responses.&lt;ref name="miksic" /&gt;{{rp|page=106}}

In an effort to revive the fortune of [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] in Sumatra, in the 1370s, a Malay ruler of [[Palembang]] sent an envoy to the court of [[Hongwu Emperor|the first emperor]] of the newly established [[Ming dynasty]]. He invited China to resume the tributary system, just like [[Srivijaya]] did several centuries earlier. Learning this diplomatic maneuver, immediately King Hayam Wuruk sent an envoy to Nanking, convinced the emperor that Malayu was their vassal, and was not an independent country.&lt;ref name="Britannica-Majapahit" /&gt; Subsequently, in 1377—a few years after the death of Gajah Mada, Majapahit sent a punitive naval attack against a rebellion in Palembang,&lt;ref name="ricklefs" /&gt;{{rp | page=19}} contributing to the end of Srivijayan successor kingdom.

In the 14th century a Malay [[Kingdom of Singapura]] was established, and it promptly attracted a Majapahit navy that regarded it as [[Temasek|Tumasik]], a rebellious colony. Singapura was finally sacked by Majapahit in 1398,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsang|Perera|2011|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabrizain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abshire|2011|p=19&amp;24}}&lt;/ref&gt; after approximately 1 month long siege by 300 jong and 200.000 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;''Sejarah Melayu'', 10.4:77: then His Majesty immediately ordered to equip three hundred jong, other than that kelulus, pelang, jongkong in uncountable numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=A.

The nature of the Majapahit empire and its extent is subject to debate. It may have had limited or entirely notional influence over some of the [[vassal|tributary states]], including Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, [[Kalimantan]], and eastern Indonesia, over which authority was claimed in the ''Nagarakretagama''.&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;Cribb, Robert, ''Historical Atlas of Indonesia'', University of Hawai'i Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Geographical and economic constraints suggest that rather than a regular centralised authority, the outer states were most likely to have been connected mainly by trade connections, which were probably a royal monopoly.&lt;ref name="ricklefs" /&gt;{{rp|page=19}} It also claimed relationships with [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand|Siam]], southern Burma, and Vietnam, and even sent missions to China.&lt;ref name="ricklefs" /&gt;{{rp|page=19}}

Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that passed through the archipelago. About the time Majapahit was founded, [[Muslim]] traders and [[proselytise]]rs began entering the area.

===Decline===
Following Hayam Wuruk's death in 1389, Majapahit power entered a period of decline with conflict over succession.&lt;ref name="Coedes" /&gt;{{rp|241}} Hayam Wuruk was succeeded by the crown princess Kusumawardhani, who married a relative, Prince [[Wikramawardhana]]. Hayam Wuruk also had a son from his previous marriage, crown prince [[Wirabhumi]], who also claimed the throne.

====Paregreg war====
{{main|Paregreg war}}
A civil war, called the [[Paregreg]] war, is thought to have occurred from 1405 to 1406.&lt;ref name="ricklefs" /&gt;{{rp|page=18}} The war was fought as a contest of succession between the [[Trowulan|western court]] led by [[Wikramawardhana]] and the [[Blambangan|eastern court]] led by [[Bhre Wirabhumi]]. Wikramawardhana was victorious.  Wirabhumi was caught and decapitated. However the civil war drained financial resources, exhausted the kingdom, and weakened Majapahit's grip on its outer vassals and colonies.&lt;ref name="Victor"&gt;{{cite book | title = From Majapahit and Sukuh to Megawati Sukarnoputri | author = Victor M Fic | publisher = Abhinav Publications | date = 2 Jan 2014 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gnh2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| page = 104 | accessdate = 16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being weakened by internal struggle, in 1409 Majapahit continued the invasion against the West Sumatran [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]], as recorded in a semi-legendary account of the [[Minangkabau (legend)|Minangkabau legend]]. It was mentioned that the Javanese force was defeated in a buffalo fight.&lt;ref name="Sindo-Minangkabau"&gt;{{cite news | title = Invasi Majapahit ke Pagaruyung dan Pertarungan Dua Kerbau | work = Sindo News | date = 11 March 2017 | url = https://daerah.sindonews.com/read/1187263/29/invasi-majapahit-ke-pagaruyung-dan-pertarungan-dua-kerbau-1489158517 | language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wikramawardhana and Ming expedition====
{{see|Treasure voyages}}
[[File:Zheng He.png|thumb|300px|The route of the voyages of Zheng He's fleet, including Majapahit ports.]]
During the reign of Wikramawardhana, a series of [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] armada [[Treasure voyages|naval expeditions]] led by [[Zheng He]],&lt;ref name="Coedes" /&gt;{{rp|241–242}} a [[Muslim]] Chinese admiral, arrived in Java several times spanning the period from 1405 to 1433. These Chinese voyages visited numbers of ports in Asia as far as Africa, which including Majapahit ports. It was said that Zheng He has paid a visit to the Majapahit court in Java.

These massive Chinese voyages were not merely a naval exploration, but also a show of power and a display of geopolitical reach. The Chinese Ming dynasty had recently overthrown the Mongols Yuan dynasty, and were eager to establish their hegemony in the world, which changed the geopolitical balance in Asia.&lt;ref name="TOI-Sanyal"&gt;{{cite news | title = History of Indian Ocean shows how old rivalries can trigger rise of new forces | work = Times of India | date = 6 August 2016 | author = Sanjeev Sanyal | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/History-of-Indian-Ocean-shows-how-old-rivalries-can-trigger-rise-of-new-forces/articleshow/53577849.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese intervened in the politics of the southern seas by supporting Thais against the declining Khmer Empire, support and installing allied factions in India, Sri Lanka and other places in Indian Ocean coasts. However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.&lt;ref name="TOI-Sanyal" /&gt; Previously, Majapahit has succeed to assert its influence in Malacca strait by contained the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in the region that finally reduced only in Java sea and eastern Indonesian waters.

This Ming dynasty voyages is extremely important for Majapahit historiography, since Zheng He's translator [[Ma Huan]] wrote ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', a detailed description of Majapahit,&lt;ref name="yingyai" /&gt; which provides a valuable insight on the culture, customs, also various social and economic aspects of Java during Majapahit period.&lt;ref name="Chao-Wa" /&gt;

Chinese provided systematic support to Malacca, and its sultan made at least one trip to personally pay obeisance to the Ming emperor. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to Islam in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java. Malacca prospered under Chinese Ming protection, while the Majapahit were steadily pushed back.&lt;ref name="TOI-Sanyal" /&gt;

====Queen Suhita====
[[File:Suhita.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The mortuary deified portrait statue of Queen [[Suhita]] (reign 1429-1447), discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java, [[National Museum of Indonesia]].]]
Wikramawardhana ruled until 1426 and was succeeded by his daughter [[Suhita]],&lt;ref name="Coedes" /&gt;{{rp|242}} who ruled from 1426 to 1447. She was the second child of Wikramawardhana by a concubine who was the daughter of Wirabhumi. The reign of Suhita was the second time Majapahit was reigned by a queen regnant after her great grandmother Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi. Her reign is immortalized in Javanese legend of [[Damarwulan]], as it involves a maiden queen named Prabu Kenya in the story, and during Suhita's reign there was a war with [[Blambangan]] as stated in the legend.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Holt. ''Art in Indonesia: Continuities and Change''. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1967, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1447, Suhita died and was succeeded by [[Kertawijaya]], her brother.&lt;ref name="Coedes" /&gt;{{rp|242}} He ruled until 1451. After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession 

crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.

====The divide====
[[File:Javanese Perahu.jpg|thumb|[[Djong (ship)|Javanese jong]] in 1300s. This type has existed in Nusantara for 1000 years.]]
In 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom’s capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.

In the western part of the crumbling empire, Majapahit found itself unable to control the rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] that in the mid-15th century began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] and expand its influence to Sumatra. Several other former Majapahit vassals and colonies began to release themselves from Majapahit domination and [[suzerainty]]. But Kertabhumi managed to reverse this event, under his rule he allied Majapahit with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with Demak as its centre and in return he asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because Islam spread faster. Hindu-Buddhist followers' grievances later paved the way for Ranawijaya to defeat Kertabumi.

[[Image:Muzium Negara KL38.JPG|thumb|right|The model of a Majapahit ship display in [[Muzium Negara]], [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The type is [[Borobudur ship]].]]

Dates for the end of the Majapahit Empire range from 1478 (that is, 1400 [[Saka era|Saka]], the ends of centuries being considered a time when changes of dynasty or courts normally ended&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp|pages = 37 and 100}}) to 1517.{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1=The year is marked among Javanese today with ''[[chronogram|candrasengkala]]'' "''sirna ilang kertaning bumi''" (the wealth of earth disappeared and diminished) (''sirna'' = 0, ''ilang'' = 0, ''kerta'' = 4, ''bumi'' = 1).}} Actually 1478 was the year of [[Sudarma Wisuta war]], when a Ranawijaya army under general Udara (who later became vice-regent) breached Trowulan defences and killed Kertabumi in his palace,&lt;ref&gt;Pararaton, p. 40, " .... bhre Kertabhumi ..... bhre prabhu sang mokta ring kadaton i saka sunyanora-yuganing-wong, 1400".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Hasan Djafar, Girindrawardhana, 1978, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demak sent reinforcements under [[Sunan Ngudung]], who later died in battle and was replaced by [[Sunan Kudus]], but they came too late to save Kertabumi although they managed to repel the Ranawijaya army. This event is mentioned in Trailokyapuri (Jiwu) and Petak inscription, where Ranawijaya claimed that he already defeated Kertabhumi and reunited Majapahit as one Kingdom.&lt;ref name="SNI448"&gt;Poesponegoro &amp; Notosusanto (1990), pp. 448–451.&lt;/ref&gt; Ranawijaya ruled from 1474 to 1498 with the formal name Girindrawardhana, with Udara as his vice-regent. This event led to the war between the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Daha]], since Demak rulers were descendants of Kertabhumi.

====Demak invasion and the fall of Majapahit====
[[File:Masjid Agung Demak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] was the earliest Islamic polity in Java that replaced Majapahit.]]
In 1498, there was a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying [[Raden Patah]], Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father had done before, while others said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's youngest daughter.

In the west, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Malacca was captured by Portuguese in 1511]]. The delicate balance between Demak and Daha ended when Udara asked [[Portuguese Malacca|Portugal for help in Malacca]] and forced Demak to attack both Malacca and Daha under [[Demak Sultanate#Adipati Yunus|Adipati Yunus]] to end this alliance.{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1= V.&lt;ref&gt;MB. Rahimsyah. Legenda dan Sejarah Lengkap Walisongo. (Amanah, Surabaya, tth)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp | page=50}} Another paper noted that the reasons for the attacks Demak (led by Adipati Yunus) to Majapahit (Girindrawardhana period) is a backlash against Girindrawardhana who had defeated Adipati Yunus' grandfather Prabu Bhre Kertabumi (Prabu Brawijaya V). Read &lt;ref&gt;Marwati Djoenoed Poesponegoro dan Nugroho Notosusanto. Sejarah Nasional Indonesia. Jilid II. Cetakan V. (PN. Balai Pustaka, Jakarta, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp | page=451}}}} A large number of courtiers, artisans, priests, and members of the royalty moved east to the island of [[Bali]]. The refugees probably fled to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi.

With the fall of Daha, crushed by Demak in 1517,&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp|pages=36–37}} the Muslim emerging forces finally defeated the remnants of the Majapahit kingdom in the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. "liberator", "conqueror"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.

Demak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.

==Culture, art and architecture==
The main event of the administrative calendar took place on the first day of the month of [[Chaitra|Caitra]] (March–April) when representatives from all territories paying [[tax]] or [[tribute]] to Majapahit came to the capital to pay court. Majapahit's territories were roughly divided into three types: the palace and its vicinity; the areas of east Java and Bali which were directly administered by officials appointed by the king; and the outer [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] which enjoyed substantial internal [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name=miksic /&gt;{{rp|page=107}}

===Culture===
[[File:Wringin Lawang, Trowulan.jpg|thumb|Wringin Lawang, the 15.5-meter tall [[red brick]] split gate in [[Trowulan]], believed to be the entrance of an important compound.]]

The capital [[Trowulan]], was grand and known for its great annual festivities. [[Buddhism]], [[Shaivism]], and [[Vaishnavism]] were all practised: the king was regarded as the incarnation of the three. The ''Nagarakretagama'' does not mention [[Islam]], but there were certainly Muslim courtiers by this time.&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp|page=19}}

The first European record about Majapahit came from the travel log of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Odoric of Pordenone|Mattiussi]], a Franciscan monk. In his book: "Travels of Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]]", he visited several places in today's Indonesia: Sumatra, Java, and [[Banjarmasin]] in Borneo, between 1318–1330. He was sent by the Pope to launch a mission into the Asian interiors. In 1318 he departed from Padua, crossed the Black Sea into Persia, all the way across Calcutta, Madras, and Sri Lanka. He then headed to Nicobar island all the way to Sumatra, before visiting Java and Banjarmasin. He returned to Italy by land through Vietnam, China, all the way through the [[silkroad]] to Europe in 1330.

In his book he mentioned that he visited Java without explaining the exact place he had visited. He said that king of Java ruled over seven other kings (vassals). He also mentioned that in this island was found a lot of [[clove]], [[cubeb]], [[nutmeg]] and many other spices. He mentioned that the King of Java had an impressive, grand, and luxurious palace. The stairs and palace interior were coated with gold and silver, and even the roofs were gilded. He also recorded that the kings of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] had repeatedly tried to attack Java, but always ended up in failure and managed to be sent back to the mainland. The Javanese kingdom mentioned in this record is Majapahit, and the time of his visit is between 1318–1330 during the reign of [[Jayanegara]].

In ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'' – a record about [[Zheng He]]'s expedition (1405-1433) – [[Ma Huan]] describes the culture, customs, various social and economic aspects of ''Chao-Wa'' (Java) during Majapahit period.&lt;ref name="Chao-Wa"/&gt; Ma Huan visited Java during Zheng He's 4th expedition in the 1413, during the reign of Majapahit king [[Wikramawardhana]]. He describes his travel to Majapahit capital, first he arrived to the port of ''Tu-pan'' ([[Tuban]]) where he saw large numbers of Chinese settlers migrated from [[Guangdong]] and Chou Chang. Then he sailed east to thriving new trading town of ''Ko-erh-hsi'' ([[Gresik]]), ''Su-pa-erh-ya'' ([[Surabaya]]), and then sailing inland into the river by smaller boat to southwest until reached the river port of ''Chang-ku'' (Changgu).&lt;ref name="Chao-Wa"/&gt; Continued travel by land to southwest he arrived in ''Man-che-po-I'' (Majapahit), where the king stay. There are about 200 or 300 foreign families resides in this place, with seven or eight leaders to serve the king. The climate is constantly hot, like summer.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;
He describes the king’s costumes; wearing a crown of gold leaves and flowers or sometimes without any headgear; bare-chested without wearing a robe, the bottom parts wears two sash of embroidered silk. Additional silk rope is looped around the waist as a belt, and the belt is inserted with one or two short blades, called ''pu-la-t'ou'' (''belati'' or more precisely [[kris]] dagger), walking barefoot. When travelling outside, the king riding an elephant or an ox-drawn carriage.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;

[[File:Golden Celestial Nymph of Majapahit.jpg|left|thumb|upright| The graceful ''Bidadari Majapahit'', golden celestial [[apsara]] in Majapahit style perfectly describes Majapahit as "the golden age" of the archipelago.]]

Commoners’ clothing for men is without headgear and women arrange their hair as a bun secured with hairpin. They wore clothing on the upper body and wrapped unstitched fabrics around the bottom part,{{efn|group=lower-roman|1=In the same fashion as traditional costumes of how [[Balinese people|Balinese]] wore unstitched [[sarong]] around their waist or how [[Javanese people|Javanese]] wore ''kain'' [[batik]] around their waist}} Men from a boy aged three to elders slipped ''pu-la-t'ou'' (dagger) in their belt. The dagger, made entirely of steel with intricate motifs smoothly drawn. The handles are made of gold, rhino’s horn or ivory carved with a depiction of human or demon, the carving works are exquisite and skilfully made.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chao-Wa"/&gt;

Majapahit people, men and women, favoured their head.{{efn| group=lower-roman | 1=One's head is considered sacred, since it is where the soul resides, beliefs and customs still practised in modern Indonesia.}} If someone was touched on his head, or if there is a misunderstanding or argument when drunk, they will instantly draw their knives and stab each other. When the one being stabbed was wounded and dead, the murderer will flee and hide for three days, then he will not lose his life. But if he was caught during the fight, he will instantly stabbed to death (execution by stabbing). The country of Majapahit knows no [[caning]] for major or minor punishment. They tied the guilty men on his hands in the back with rattan rope and paraded them, and then stabbed the offender in the back where there is a floating rib which resulted in instant death.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt; Judicial executions of this kind were frequent.

Population of the country did not have a bed or chair to sit, and to eat they do not use a spoon or chopsticks. Men and women enjoy chewing [[betel nut]] mixed with, [[betel]] leaves, and white chalk made from ground mussels shells.&lt;ref name="Chao-Wa"/&gt; They eat rice for meal, first they took a scoop of water and soak betel in their mouth, then wash their hands and sit down to make a circle; getting a plate of rice soaked in butter (probably [[coconut milk]]) and gravy, and eat using hands to lift the rice and put it in their mouth. When receiving guests, they will offer the guests, not the tea, but with betel nut.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;

The population consisted of Muslim merchants from the west (Arab and Muslim Indians, but mostly those from Muslim states in Sumatra), Chinese (claimed to be descendants of [[Tang dynasty]]), and unrefined locals. The king held annual jousting tournaments.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;{{rp|page=45}} About the marriage rituals; the groom pays a visit to the house of the bride's family, the marriage union is consummated. Three days later, the groom escorts his bride back to his home, where the man’s family beat drums and brass gongs, blowing pipes made from coconut shells (''senterewe''), beating a drum made from bamboo tubes (probably a kind of bamboo [[gamelan]] or [[kolintang]]), and light fireworks.&lt;ref name="Chao-Wa"/&gt; Escorted in front, behind, and around by men holding short blades and shields. While the bride is a matted-hair woman, with uncovered body and barefooted. She wraps herself in embroidered silk, wears a necklace around her neck adorned with gold beads, and bracelets on her wrist with ornaments of gold, silver and other precious ornaments. Family, friends and neighbours decorate a decorative boat with betel leaf, areca nut, reeds and flowers were sewn, and arrange a party to welcome the couple on such a festive occasion. When the groom arrives home, the gong and drum are sounded, they will drink wine (possibly [[arack]] or [[tuak]]) and play music. After a few days the festivities end.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;

About the burial rituals, the dead body was left on beach or empty land to be devoured by dogs (for lower-class), cremated, or committed into the waters (Javanese:''larung''). The upper-class performed ''[[suttee]]'', a ritual suicide by widowed wives, concubines or female servants, through [[self immolation]] by throwing themselves into flaming cremation fire.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chao-Wa"/&gt;

In this record, Ma Huan also describes a musical troupes travelling during full moon nights. Numbers of people holding shoulders creating an unbroken line while singing and chanting in unison, while the families whose houses being visited would give them copper coins or gifts. He also describes a class of artisans that draws various images on paper and give a theatrical performance. The narrator tells the story of legends, tales and romance drawn upon a screen of rolled paper.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt; This kind of performance is identified as ''[[wayang]] bébér'', an art of story-telling that has survived for many centuries in Java.&lt;ref name="Chao-Wa"/&gt;

The literature of Majapahit was the continuation of [[Javanese literature|Javanese]] [[Kawi language|Kawi]] Hindu-Buddhist scholarly tradition that produces ''[[kakawin]]'' poem that has been developed in Java since the 9th century [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] era, all the way through [[Kediri Kingdom|Kadiri]] and Singhasari periods. Notable Javanese literary works dated from earlier period, such as Kadiri's 11th century Kanwa's [[Arjunawiwaha]], 12th century Dharmaja's [[Smaradahana]], Sedah's [[Bharatayuddha]], Panuluh's [[Kakawin Hariwangsa|Hariwangsa]] also popular [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]] are continuously preserved and rewritten by ''Rakawi'' (Hindu-Buddhist poet or scholar) in Majapahit era. Notable literary works that was produced in Majapahit period among others are Prapanca's [[Nagarakretagama]], Tantular's [[Sutasoma]], and [[Tantu Pagelaran]]. Popular tale of [[Sri Tanjung]] and [[Damarwulan]] also dated from Majapahit period.

Nagarakretagama composed by Prapanca in 1365 is a vital source of premier historical account of Majapahit historiography. While Sutasoma is an important literature for modern Indonesian nationhood, since the national motto ''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'', which is usually translated as ''[[Unity in Diversity]]'', was taken from a ''pupuh'' ([[canto]]) of this manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Sutasoma: The Ancient Tale of a Buddha-Prince from 14th Century Java by the Poet Mpu Tantular | editor1 = Kate O'Brien | editor2 = Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder | publisher = Orchid Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 9789745241077| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u7ZJJwAACAAJ&amp;dq=sutasoma+bhinneka+tunggal+ika&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRr9v_gNbVAhVDMI8KHQt4Ap0Q6AEILzAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palmleaf of Kakawin Sutasoma from Java01.jpg|thumb|500px|Palm leaf manuscript of ''[[Kakawin Sutasoma]]'', a 14th-century Javanese poem.]]
This quotation comes from Sutasoma canto 139, stanza 5. The full stanza reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;''Rwâneka dhâtu winuwus Buddha Wiswa,''
''Bhinnêki rakwa ring apan kena parwanosen,''
''Mangka ng Jinatwa kalawan Siwatatwa tunggal,''
''Bhinnêka tunggal ika tan hana dharma mangrwa.''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Originally, the poem was meant to promote the religious tolerance between the Hindu and Buddhist religions, specifically promote the syncretic Shiva-Buddha doctrine.&lt;ref name="Siva-Buddha"/&gt;

In Yingya Shenglan, Ma Huan describe the writing system used in Majapahit. For the writing, they had known the alphabet using ''So-li'' (Chola - Coromandel/Southern India) letters. There is no paper or pen, they use ''Chiao-chang'' (''kajang'') or palm leaf (''[[Palm-leaf manuscript#Javanese and Balinese|lontar]]''), written by scraping it with a sharp knife. They also have a developed language system and grammar. The way the people talk in this country is very beautiful and soft.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;

===Art===
{{further|Majapahit Terracotta}}
[[File:RA 3540013.JPG|thumb|Bas reliefs of Tegowangi temple, dated from Majapahit period, demonstrate the East Javanese style.]]
The Pala school of art of the Indian [[Pala Empire]] influenced the art and architecture of Majapahit.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of world art by Bernard Samuel Myers p.35-36&lt;/ref&gt;
Majapahit art was the continuation of East Javanese art, style and aesthetic developed since the 11th century during Kediri and Singhasari period. Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in Balinese art, especially in its classical paintings and Balinese wayang.

The statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.

[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]

Clay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The [[Majapahit Terracotta]] art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of [[terracotta]] artefacts were discovered in [[Trowulan]]. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, [[piggy bank]]s, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One of the most interesting findings is Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both "savings" and "piggy bank". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means "wild boar", the [[suffix]] "-an" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.

Terracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.

[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jabung]] temple near Paiton, Probolinggo, East Java, dated from Majapahit period.]]

In his book ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king’s residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''chang'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9–14.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;

The houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''Ch'ih'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.

The Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.

[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]

Although [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.&lt;ref name="Schoppert1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33–34|isbn=962-593-232-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, Pari in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan – also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.

Some of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure – consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof – evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.&lt;ref name="Made Wijaya"&gt;{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.

==Economy==
Also in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market. Rice is harvested twice a year, and its grain is small. They also harvest white sesame and lentils, but there is no wheat. This land produces [[Sapan Wood|sapan wood]] (useful to produce red dye), diamond, sandalwood, incense, ''puyang'' pepper, [[cantharides]] (green beetles used for medicine), steel, turtles, tortoise shell, strange and rare birds; such as a large parrot as big as a hen, red and green parrots, five-colored parrots, (all of them can imitate the human voice), also guinea fowl, ' bird hanging upside down ', five-coloured pigeon, peacock, 'betel tree bird', pearl bird, and green pigeons. The beasts here are strange: there are white deer, white monkey, and various other animals. Pigs, goats, cattle, horses, poultries, and there are all types of ducks, however donkeys and geese are not found.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;

For the fruits, there are all kinds of bananas, coconut, sugarcane, pomegranate, lotus, ''mang-chi-shi'' (''manggis'' or [[mangosteen]]), watermelon and ''lang Ch'a'' (''langsat'' or [[lanzones]]). ''Mang-chi-shi'' – is something like a pomegranate, peel it like an orange, it has four lumps of white flesh, sweet and sour taste and very delicious. ''Lang-ch’a'' is a fruit similar to Loquat, but larger, contained three blocky white flesh with sweet and sour taste. Sugarcane has white stems, large and coarse, with roots reaching 3 ''chang'' (30 feet 7 inches). In addition, all types of squash and vegetables are there, just a shortage of peach, plum and leek.&lt;ref name=yingyai /&gt;
[[Image:Majapahit, Piggy Bank.jpg|thumb|Majapahit [[terracotta]] [[piggy bank]], 14th or 15th century [[Trowulan]], [[East Java]]. (Collection of [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]])]]
Taxes and fines were paid in cash. Javanese economy had been partly monetised since the late 8th century, using gold and silver coins. Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&amp;nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.&lt;ref name=miksic /&gt;{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes—the imported Chinese copper coins—enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).

Some idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).&lt;ref name=miksic /&gt;{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.

The great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous irrigation projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.&lt;ref name=miksic /&gt;{{rp|page=107}}

The Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh (Surabaya). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].

==Administration==
During the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history.&lt;ref name="SNI451"&gt;Poesponegoro &amp; Notosusanto (1990), hal. 451–456.&lt;/ref&gt; The king is the paramount ruler, as the [[chakravartin]] he is considered as the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.

===Bureaucracy officials===
During his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:
:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir
:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration
:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws
:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs

Within the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.

There is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders—mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].&lt;ref name="BP-Sejarah Nasional"&gt;{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno — Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

===Territorial hierarchy===
Majapahit recognise the hierarchy classifications of lands within its realm:
:#''[[Bhūmi|Bhumi]]'': the kingdom, ruled by the king
:#''Nagara'': the province, ruled by the ''rajya'' (governor), or ''natha'' (lord), or ''bhre'' (prince or duke)
:#''Watek'': the regency, administered by ''wiyasa'',
:#''Kuwu'': the district, administered by ''lurah'',
:#''Wanua'': the village, administered by ''thani'',
:#''Kabuyutan'': the hamlet or sanctuary place.

[[File:Majapahit Core and Provinces.svg|thumb|right|360px|Majapahit core realm and provinces (''Mancanagara'') in eastern and central parts of Java, including islands of Madura and Bali.]]

During its formation, Majapahit traditional realm only consists of lesser vassal kingdoms (provinces) in eastern and central Java. This region is ruled by provincial kings called ''Paduka Bhattara'' with the title ''Bhre''. This title is the highest position below the monarch and similar to duke or duchess. Usually this position reserved for the close relatives of the king. Their duty is to administer their own provinces, collect taxes, send annual tributes to the capital, and manage the defences of their borders.

During the reign of Hayam Wuruk (1350–1389) there were 12 provinces of Majapahit, administered by king's close relatives:

===Territorial division===
When Majapahit entered the thalassocratic imperial phase during the administration of Gajah Mada, several overseas vassal states were included within the Majapahit sphere of influence, as the result the new larger territorial concept was defined:
* '''''Negara Agung''''', or the Grand State, the core kingdom. The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.
* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' — traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].
* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].

[[File:Majapahit Empire.svg|thumb|360px|The extent of Majapahit according to Nagarakretagama.]]

[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.&lt;ref name="Britannica-Majapahit"/&gt; In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Tebo Regency|Muaro Tebo]]), and [[Dharmasraya]]. Also mentioned are Kandis, Kahwas, [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Siak Regency|Siak]], [[Rokan Hilir Regency|Rokan]], [[Kampar Regency|Kampar]] and [[Pannai|Pane]], Kampe, [[Aru Kingdom|Haru]] (coastal [[North Sumatra]], today around [[Medan]]) and [[Mandailing]]. Tamiyang ([[Aceh Tamiang Regency]]), negara Perlak ([[Peureulak]]) and [[Padang Lawas Regency|Padang Lawas]], are noted in the west, together with Samudra ([[Samudra Pasai]]) and [[Lamuri]], Batan ([[Bintan]]), [[Lampung]], and [[Barus]].  Also listed are the states of Tanjungnegara (believed to be on [[Borneo]]): [[Kapuas River|Kapuas]] [[Katingan Regency|Katingan]], [[Sampit]], Kota Lingga, [[Banjarmasin|Kota Waringin]], [[Sambas Regency|Sambas]], and Lawas.

In Nagarakretagama Canto 14 more lands are noted: Kadandangan, [[Landak Regency|Landa]], Samadang, Tirem, Sedu ([[Sarawak]]), Barune ([[Brunei]]), Kalka, [[Kingdom of Maynila|Saludung]] (Manila), Solot ([[Sulu Province|Sulu]]), Pasir, [[Barito River|Barito]], Sawaku, [[Tabalong Regency|Tabalung]], and [[Kutai|Tanjung Kutei]]. In Hujung Medini ([[Malay Peninsula]]), [[Pahang]] is mentioned first.

Also in Canto 14 are territories east of Java: [[Bedulu|Badahulu]] and [[Goa Gajah|Lo Gajah]] (part of today's [[Bali]]). Gurun and Sukun, [[Taliwang]], Sapi (Sape town, east end of Sumbawa island, by the [[Sape Strait]]) and [[Dompu|Dompo]], [[Sangeang Api|Sang Hyang Api]], [[Bima]]. Hutan Kadali ([[Buru]] island). Gurun island, and [[Lombok|Lombok Merah]]. Together with prosperous [[Sasak people|Sasak]] (central, north and east [[Lombok]]) are already ruled. Bantayan with [[Luwu Regency|Luwu]]. Further east are Udamakatraya ([[Sangihe Islands|Sangir]] and [[Talaud]]). Also mentioned are [[Makassar]], [[Buton]], [[Banggai Regency|Banggai]], Kunir, [[Pantar|Galiao]] with [[Selayar Islands|Selayar]], [[Sumba]], [[Sulu archipelago|Solot]], [[Muar (town)|Muar]]. Also Wanda(n) ([[Banda Islands|Banda]] island), [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] or [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] islands, Kai-islands, Wanin (Onin peninsula, today [[Fakfak Regency]], West Papua), [[Seram|Seran]], [[Timor]] and other islands.

The true nature of Majapahit [[suzerainty]] is still a subject of study and even has sparked controversy. Nagarakretagama describes Majapahit as the center of a huge [[Mandala (political model)|mandala]] consists of 98 tributaries stretching from Sumatra to New Guinea. Some scholars has discounted this claim as merely a sphere of limited influence, or even just a statement of geographical knowledge.&lt;ref name="Cribb"/&gt;{{rp|page=87}} Scholars, such as historian Hasan Djafar, argued that ''Nusantara'' should be translated as "other islands", which denotes that they are beyond Majapahit sovereignty. He argued that Majapahit territory was confined only in East and Central Java.&lt;ref name ="NG-Majapahit"&gt;{{cite news | author = Mahandis Y. Thamrin | title = Nusantara Bukanlah Wilayah Majapahit? | work = National Geographic Indonesia | date = 11 October 2013 | url = http://nationalgeographic.co.id/berita/2013/10/faktanya-nusantara-bukanlah-wilayah-majapahit | language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Javanese overseas prestige and influence during the lifetime of Hayam Wuruk was undoubtedly considerable.&lt;ref name="Britannica-Majapahit"/&gt; Majapahit fleets must have periodically visited many places in the archipelago to acquire formal submission, or the splendour of Majapahit court might have attracted regional rulers to send tribute, without any intention to submit to Majapahit's order.&lt;ref name="Cribb"/&gt;{{rp|page=87}}

All of those three categories—the ''Negara Agung, Mancanegara'' and ''Nusantara'', were within the sphere of influence of the Majapahit empire, however Majapahit also recognise the fourth realm that defines its foreign diplomatic relations:
* '''''Mitreka Satata''''', literally means "partners with common order". It refers to independent foreign states considered as Majapahit's equals, not the subject of Majapahit powers. According to Nagarakretagama canto 15, the foreign states are ''Syangkayodhyapura'' ([[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] of [[Siam]]), ''Dharmmanagari'' ([[Negara Sri Dharmaraja]]) in southern Thailand, ''Rajapura'' ([[Ratchaburi]]) and ''Singhanagari'' (Singora or modern [[Songkla]]), ''Marutma'' (Martaban or [[Mottama]], modern Southern [[Myanmar]]), ''[[Champa]]'' (today Southern Vietnam), ''Kamboja'' ([[Cambodia]]), and ''Yawana'' ([[Vietnam|Annam]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nagarakretagama ''pupuh'' (canto) 15, these states are mentioned as ''Mitreka Satata'', literary means "partners with common order".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ariesgoblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/agus-arismunandar-majapahit-ker_-agraris-maritim.pdf MAJAPAHIT: KERAJAAN AGRARIS – MARITIM DI NUSANTARA p. 8]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mitreka Satata'' can be considered as Majapahit's [[Political alliance|allies]], since other foreign kingdoms in China and India were not included in this category, although Majapahit is known to have conducted foreign relations with these nations.

The model of political formations and power diffusion from its core in the Majapahit capital city that radiates through its overseas possessions, was later identified by historians as "[[Mandala (Southeast Asian history)|mandala]]" model. The term mandala derived from Sanskrit "circle" to explain the typical ancient Southeast Asian polity that was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territories belongs within Majapahit Mandala sphere of influence were those categorised as Mancanegara and Nusantara. These areas usually have their own indigenous rulers, enjoy substantial autonomy and have their own political institution intact without further integration into Majapahit administration. The same mandala model also applied to previous empires; [[Srivijaya]] and [[Khmer Empire|Angkor]], and also Majapahit's neighbouring mandalas; Ayutthaya and Champa.

In later period, Majapahit's hold on its overseas possessions began to wane. According to [[Wingun Pitu inscription]] (dated 1447) it was mentioned that Majapahit consist of 14 provinces, that administrated by the ruler titled ''Bhre''.&lt;ref&gt;Nastiti, Titi Surti.

[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' ("Majapahit Temple") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]

Majapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=miksic /&gt;{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities. Its capital was inhabited by a cosmopolitan population among whom literature and art flourished.&lt;ref name=miksic /&gt;{{rp|page=107}}

Numbers of local legends and [[folklore]]s in the region had mentioned about the Majapahit kingdom. Other than Javanese sources, some regional legends mentioning Majapahit kingdom or its general Gajah Mada, also can be found; from Aceh, Minangkabau, Palembang, Malay Peninsula, Sunda, Brunei, Bali to Sumbawa. Most of them mentioned about the incoming Javanese forces to their land, which was probably a local testament of the empire's expansive nature that once dominating the archipelago. The [[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai|Hikayat Raja Pasai]], a 14th-century [[Aceh]] chronicle tell a Majapahit naval invasion against [[Samudra Pasai]] in 1350. The chronicle described that the Majapahit invasion was a punishment for Sultan Ahmad Malik Az-Zahir's crime on ruining a royal marriage between Pasai Prince Tun Abdul Jalil and Raden Galuh Gemerencang, a Majapahit princess — that led to the death of the royal couple.&lt;ref name="Tirto-Pasai"/&gt; 
[[File:Masjid Menara Kudus.jpg|thumb|left|The Majapahit style minaret of Kudus Mosque.]]
In West Sumatra, the [[Minangkabau (legend)|legend of Minangkabau]] mentioned an invading foreign prince — associated with Javanese Majapahit kingdom — being defeated in a buffalo fight.&lt;ref name="Sindo-Minangkabau"/&gt; In West Java, the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] tragedy caused a myth to revolve around Indonesians, which forbids marriage between a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and a [[Javanese people|Javanese]], as it would be unsustainable and only bring misery to the couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tragedi Perang Bubat dan mitos orang jawa dilarang kawin dengan sunda | date = 24 April 2015 | author = Hery H Winarno | url = https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/tragedi-perang-bubat-mitos-orang-jawa-dilarang-kawin-dengan-sunda.html | language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Malay peninsula, the [[Malay annals]] mentioned the legend of the fall of [[Kingdom of Singapura|Singapura]] to Majapahit forces in 1398 was due to the betrayal of Sang Rajuna Tapa that opened the fortified city gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|A. Samad|1979|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brunei]], the folk legend of Lumut Lunting and Pilong-Pilongan islands in [[Brunei Bay]] also connected to Majapahit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Two Brunei Bay Legends, Tales about Lumut Lunting and Pilong-Pilongan | author = Rozan Yunos | work = Brunei Sources | url = http://www.bruneiresources.com/goldenlegacy/tgl_brunei_bay_legends.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Javanese legends were originated or become popular during Majapahit period. The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|อิเหนา}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}

Majapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]]. The empire's expansion circa 14th-century, contributed to the difussion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of [[Javanisation]]. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java. The descriptions of the architecture of the capital's pavilions (''[[pendopo]]'')  in the ''Nagarakretagama'' evoke the Javanese [[Kraton (Indonesia)|Kraton]] also the [[Pura (Balinese temple)|Balinese temples]] and palace compounds of today. The Majapahit architectural style that often employs [[Majapahit Terracotta|terracotta]] and [[red brick]] heavily influenced the architecture of Java and Bali in the later period. The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.&lt;ref name="Made Wijaya"/&gt;

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reliëfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]

The vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy. The Javanese Hindu civilisation since the era of [[Airlangga]] to the era of Majapahit kings has profoundly influenced and shaped the Balinese culture and [[History of Bali|history]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/bali/history Lonely Planet: History of Bali]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient links and Majapahit legacy is observable in many ways; architecture, literature, religious rituals, dance-drama and artforms. The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; "without Java there is no Bali". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.

[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]

In weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand. Although it has been suggested that the keris, and native daggers similar to it, predate Majapahit, nevertheless the empire expansion contributed to its popularity and diffussion in the region around the year 1492.&lt;ref name="JPostKris"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kris, more than just a simple dagger |author=Tantri Yuliandini |date=18 April 2002 |publisher=The Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |accessdate=30 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729203644/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |archivedate=29 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to 1264 Saka (which correspondends to 1342). The Malay legend of Kris [[Taming Sari]] is also attributed to Majapahit origin.

For Indonesians in later centuries, Majapahit became a symbol of past greatness. The Islamic sultanates of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], [[Pajang]], and [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] sought to establish their legitimacy in relation to the Majapahit.&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp|page=40}} The Demak claimed a line of succession through Kertabumi, as its founder [[Raden Patah]], in court chronicles was said to be the son of Kertabumi with Putri Cina, a Chinese princess, who had been sent away before her son was born.&lt;ref name=ricklefs/&gt;{{rp|pages=36–37}} [[Sultan Agung]]'s conquest of [[Wirasaba]] (present day Mojoagung) in 1615—during that time just a small town without significant strategic and economic value—led by the sultan himself, may probably have had such symbolic importance as it was the location of the former Majapahit capital.&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp|page=43}} Central Javanese palaces have traditions and [[genealogy]] that attempt to prove links back to the Majapahit royal lines—usually in the form of a grave as a vital ''link'' in Java — where legitimacy is enhanced by such a connection.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Bali in particular was heavily influenced by Majapahit and the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] consider themselves to be the true heirs of the kingdom.&lt;ref name="Schoppert1997"/&gt;

[[File:Relief of Indonesian History, Monas.JPG|thumb|right|The high reliefs of Gajah Mada and Majapahit history depicted in [[National Monument (Indonesia)|Monas]], has become the source of Indonesian national pride of past greatness.]]

Modern Indonesian nationalists, including those of the early 20th-century [[Indonesian National Revival#National Revival|Indonesian National Revival]], have invoked the Majapahit Empire.&lt;ref name ="M Wood"/&gt; Indonesian founding fathers—especially [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Yamin]], built a historical construct around Majapahit to argue for the ancient unified realm, as a predecessor of modern Indonesia.&lt;ref name ="NG-Majapahit"/&gt; The memory of its greatness remains in Indonesia, and is sometimes seen as a precedent for the current political boundaries of the Republic.&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp|page=19}} Many of modern Indonesian national symbols derived from Majapahit Hindu-Buddhist elements. The Indonesian national flag "[[Flag of Indonesia|Sang Merah Putih]]" ("Red and White") or sometimes called "Dwiwarna" ("The bicolor"), derived from the Majapahit royal colour. The Indonesian Navy flag of red and white stripes also has a Majapahit origin. The Indonesian national motto, "''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]''", is a quotation from an [[Old Javanese]] poem "''Kakawin Sutasoma''", written by a Majapahit poet, Mpu Tantular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1256649489/bhinekatunggalikakaryagemilangmputantular |title=Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, masterpiece of Mpu Tantular, Antara (in Indonesian) |access-date=17 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008024249/http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1256649489/bhinekatunggalikakaryagemilangmputantular |archive-date=8 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indonesian coat of arms, ''[[Coat of arms of Indonesia|Garuda Pancasila]]'', also derives from [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Javanese Hindu elements]]. The statue and relief of [[Garuda]] have been found in many temples in Java such as [[Prambanan]] from the ancient [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram]] era, and the [[Penataran Temple|Panataran]] as well as the [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] temple dated from the Majapahit era. The notable statue of Garuda is the statue of the king [[Airlangga]] depicted as [[Vishnu]] riding [[Garuda]].
[[File:Trowulan ancient canal 1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Ancient red brick canal discovered in Trowulan.]]
In its propaganda from the 1920s, the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] presented its vision of a classless society as a reincarnation of a romanticised Majapahit.&lt;ref name=ricklefs /&gt;{{rp|page=174}} It was invoked by Sukarno for nation building and by the [[Orde Baru|New Order]] as an expression of state expansion and consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Friend  | first = Theodore |title = Indonesian Destinies | publisher = Belknap Press, [[Harvard University Press]] |date= |location = Cambridge, Massachusetts and London | pages = 19 |isbn = 0-674-01137-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Majapahit, the modern state of Indonesia covers vast territory and is politically centred on Java.

[[Palapa]], the series of communication satellites owned by Telkom, an Indonesian telecommunication company, was named after ''Sumpah Palapa'', the famous oath taken by [[Gajah Mada]], who swore that he would not taste any spice as long as he had not succeeded in unifying Nusantara (Indonesian archipelago). This ancient oath of unification signifies the Palapa satellite as the modern means to unify the Indonesian archipelago by way of [[telecommunication]]. The name was chosen by president [[Suharto]], and the program was started in February 1975.

During the last half year of 2008, the Indonesian government sponsored a massive exploration on the site that is believed to be the place where the palace of Majapahit once stood. [[Jero Wacik]], the Indonesian Minister of Culture and Tourism stated that the [[Trowulan#The Majapahit Park|Majapahit Park]] would be built on the site and completed as early as 2009, to prevent further damage caused by home-made brick industries that developed in the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taman Majapahit Dibangun di Trowulan |date=4 November 2008 |url=http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/04/20305699/taman.majapahit.dibangun.di.trowulan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107163612/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/04/20305699/Taman.Majapahit.Dibangun.di.Trowulan |archivedate=7 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the project leaves a huge attention to some historians, since constructing the park's foundation in Segaran site located in south side of [[Trowulan Museum]] will inevitably damage the site itself. Ancient bricks which are historically valuable were found scattered on the site. The government then argued that the method they were applying were less destructive since digging method were used instead of drilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Situs Majapahit Dirusak Pemerintah |date=5 January 2009 |url=http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/01/05/05100324/situs.majapahit.dirusak.pemerintah |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112012614/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2009/01/05/05100324/situs.majapahit.dirusak.pemerintah |archivedate=12 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Majapahit in popular culture==
Celebrated as 'the golden era of the archipelago', the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era, or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:

# ''Sandyakalaning Majapahit'' (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is an historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by [[Sanusi Pane]].
# ''Panji Koming'' (since 1979), a weekly [[comic strip]] by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of [[Kompas]], telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.
# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987–1991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Pajajaran]]. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled 'Saur Sepuh' as well.
# ''Tutur Tinular'', a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a [[martial art]] historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.
# ''Wali Songo'', the film tells the story of nine [[Muslim]] saints ('wali') who spread [[Islam]] to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.
# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit.
#  ''Imperium Majapahit'', a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.
# ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (film)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2004), a [[Malaysia]]n epic film based on [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang|a traditional Malay legend]]. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and [[Hang Tuah]], a [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan]] admiral.
# ''[[Gajah Mada (book)|Gajah Mada]]'', a [[pentalogy]] written by [[Langit Kresna Hariadi]] depicting a fictionalised detail of [[Gajah Mada]]'s life from the [[Gajah Mada#Rise to Mahapatih|Kuti rebellion]] up to the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].

[[File:Wine fountain at Milestii Mici (193872576).jpg|thumb|250px|Wine fountain at Mileștii Mici]]
'''Mileștii Mici''' is a [[Moldovan wine producers|Moldovan wine producer]] located in the commune of [[Mileștii Mici]].

== Cellars ==
The State Enterprise Quality Wines Industrial Complex "Mileștii Mici" was founded in 1969 to store, preserve and mature high-quality wines.

Local ancient underground galleries reach the [[Chişinău]] borders. The limestone in the galleries maintains constant humidity (85–95%) and temperature ({{convert|12|–|14|C|F|lk=on|disp=sqbr}})&lt;ref name=eco&gt;{{cite web|last=Spânu |first=Vlad |title=Cricova: The Largest Underground Wine Cellar in the World |url=http://economie.moldova.org/news/cricova-the-largest-underground-wine-cellar-in-the-world-19083-eng.html |publisher=economie.moldova.org |accessdate=8 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902060521/http://economie.moldova.org/news/cricova-the-largest-underground-wine-cellar-in-the-world-19083-eng.html |archivedate=2 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the year. The longer some specific [[red wine]]s are stored in such ideal conditions, the more they improve. Some wines are cellared for several decades before being sold. The cellars extend for {{convert|200|km}}, of which only {{convert|55|km}} are currently in use.

In August 2005, Mileștii Mici was registered in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the biggest wine collection in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-wine-cellar-by-number-of-bottles/ Largest wine cellar by number of bottles] guinnessworldrecords.com&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, the complex holds nearly 2 million bottles.&lt;ref name="eco"/&gt; More than 70% of the stored wines are red, 20% are white and about 10% are dessert wines. The most valuable items of this collection, worth €480 a bottle, were produced in 1973–74; they are now exported only to Japan.

Wines are exported from Mileștii Mici to Sweden, Japan, the USA, Great Britain, the Czech Republic, Poland, Greece, Germany, Denmark, Finland, and China.

== Wines ==
The wines stored here are made from crops of various years, beginning with 1969. Grapes include [[Pinot (grape)|Pinot]], [[Traminer]], [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat]], [[Riesling]], [[Dnestrovscoie]], [[Milestscoie]], [[Codru (wine)|Codru]], [[Negru de Purcari]], [[Trandafirul Moldovei]], [[Auriu]], and [[Cahor-Ciumai]].

'''The Military of [[Eswatini]] (Umbutfo Eswatini Defence Force)''' is used primarily during domestic protests, with some border and customs duties; the force has never been involved in a foreign conflict.&lt;ref name="crash" /&gt; The army has struggled with high rates of [[HIV]] infection. Since measures were put in place the rate is dropping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201012140720.html|accessdate=2010-12-18|title=allAfrica.com: Swaziland: Army Slowly Winning the HIV/Aids Battle|date=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USDF replaced the [[Royal Swaziland Defence Force]], which was created in 1973 to replace the role of the [[British Army]] following independence in 1968.

The [[King of Eswatini|King]] is the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the ''Umbutfo Swaziland Defence Force'' (USDF), and the substantive Minister of the Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africafocus.org/docs11/swaz1104.php |title=Swaziland: Time for Democracy? |publisher=Africafocus.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he delegates the responsibilities of the day-to-day activities of the executive arm of the government.&lt;ref name="commonwealth-of-nations1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealth-of-nations.org/Swaziland/Security/Ministry_of_Defence%60_Swaziland/welcome |title=Security in Swaziland, Swaziland Security, Ministry of Defence, Swaziland welcome, Commonwealth |publisher=Commonwealth-of-nations.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a Defence Council, which is responsible for inter alia advising the King on all matters pertaining to the USDF.&lt;ref name="commonwealth-of-nations1"/&gt; The USDF is commanded by [[Major General]] [[Stanley Dlamini]]; the deputy commander is [[Brigadier General]] [[Patrick Motsa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.sz/home.asp?pid=2244 |accessdate=2010-08-15 |title=Welcome to the home page of the Government of Swaziland }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the formation commander is [[Brigadier General]] Jeffry S.

'''Norm N. Nite''' (born '''Norman Durma''', January 25, 1941), is the author of the ''Rock On: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock N' Roll'' book series. Nite began his career as a DJ at  [[WHKW#WGAR (AM)|WGAR&amp;nbsp;(AM)]] in [[Cleveland]] and later at [[WMJI]] there. Later he would host shows at [[WCBS-FM]] and [[WNBC]] in [[New York City]].  His historical interest in [[Rock &amp; Roll]] led him to compile, as the first volume of "Rock On" describes it, "an exhaustive array of data on more than 1,000 of the most popular artists of the fifties and early sixties. Any singer who had a top 100 single during the golden days of rock n' roll can be found in (the) book." Subsequently, due to the popularity of this volume, first released in 1974, he authored a second volume in 1978, covering, as described on the [[dust jacket]], "The Modern Years: 1964-Present" with an introduction by [[Wolfman Jack]].  In 1985 Rock On Volume 3 was released and billed "Rock On Volume 3 – The Video Revolution: 1978 – Present". During 1988 he narrated the radio program, Solid Gold Scrapbook.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2008/06/23/2008-06-23_on_the_radio_norm_n_nite_auctions_rock_r.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005 Nite began broadcasting live from the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in Cleveland on [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]] Channel 5 ([[SIRIUS Gold]], now known as [[50s on 5|Sirius XM 50s on 5]]), which is also available on channel 9905 on the [[Dish Network]].  His show had originally aired Wednesdays through Sundays, but in August 2006, he cut back his on-air schedule to every Friday through Sunday afternoons from 3-6 p.m. US Eastern time (12-3 p.m. Pacific time).

From 2005 to 2014, he broadcast on Saturdays and Sundays at the same time, when he presents "Remember Then", an hour dedicated exclusively to the music that was on the charts on the corresponding date during a designated year, mainly between 1956 and 1963.  The "Remember Then" hour aired between 4-5 p.m. Eastern (1-2 p.m. Pacific) on Saturdays and Sundays. Nite was an enthusiastic cheerleader of the music and its artists, and also did much to promote the 50s on 5 channel and its other on-air talent. In February 2014, SiriusXM made a sudden management move to drop live deejays from virtually all of its 50s on 5 programming, ending Nite's broadcasts accordingly without the chance to have a farewell broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.normnnite.com/&lt;/ref&gt; (Some other deejays from the 50s on 5 New York studio were reassigned to weekday shifts on SiriusXM's more-favored 60s on 6 channel, including Pat St. John.)

Although he once split his time between New York City, New York and Cleveland,Ohio- he now lives in Cleveland full-time.

'''Vaduz Castle''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Schloss Vaduz'') is the [[palace]] and [[official residence]] of the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref name=o&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/travel/sightseeing/Vaduz-Castle-Liechtenstein-JPhKgKrA1x.html |title=Sightseeing : Vaduz Castle- Liechtenstein |publisher=Gowealthy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle gave its name to the town of [[Vaduz]], the capital of [[Liechtenstein]], which it overlooks from an adjacent hilltop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Liechtenstein/Vaduz/Things_To_Do-Vaduz-MISC-BR-1.html |title=Fun Things To Do in Vaduz - Attractions &amp; Must See |publisher=VirtualTourist |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tourismus.li/en/lie/place/Vaduz%20Castle/ |title=Principality of Liechtenstein: Travel, holidays, vacations - Activities - Popular sights &amp; the countryside: Vaduz Castle |date=31 March 2018 |accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The former owners, who were presumably also the builders, were the counts of [[County of Sargans|Werdenberg-Sargans]]. The [[bergfried]] (the [[keep]], built in the 12th century) and parts of the eastern side are the oldest. The tower stands on a piece of ground that is {{convert|12|x|13|m|0|abbr=off}} in area. At the ground floor, the tower walls have a thickness of up to {{convert|4|m|0|abbr=off}}. The original entrance lay at the courtyard side at a height of {{convert|11|m|0|abbr=off}}. The chapel of St. Anna was presumably built in the [[Middle Ages]] as well. The main altar is late-gothic. In the [[Swabian War]] of 1499, the castle was burned by the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. The western side was expanded by Count Kaspar von Hohenems (1613–1640).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismus.li/en/culture-cuisine/places-of-cultural-interest/cultural-places-of-historical-interest/Vaduz-Castle.html |title=Liechtenstein : The Official Tourism Site - Culture &amp; Cuisine - Places of historical interest : Vaduz Castle |date=2013-01-05 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornelia Herrmann |chapter=Die Kunstdenkmäler des Fürstentums Liechtenstein.

The [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein]] acquired Vaduz Castle in 1712 when it purchased the countship of Vaduz. At this time, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], combined the countship with the Lordship of [[Schellenberg]], purchased by the Liechtensteins in 1699, to form the present Principality of Liechtenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schloss Vaduz, Liechtenstein|url=http://www.galenfrysinger.com/liechtenstein_schloss_vaduz.htm|author=Galen R Frysinger, Sheboygan, Wisconsin|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
The castle underwent a major restoration between 1904 and 1920, then again in the early 1920s during the reign of [[Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Johann II]], and was expanded during the early 1930s by [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz Joseph II]]. Since 1938, the castle has been the primary residence of Liechtenstein's Princely Family. The castle is not open to the public as the princely family still lives in the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://merlinandrebecca.blogspot.com/2011/08/castle-hunting-schloss-valduz.html |title=Article about Vaduz Castle and Schalun castle (includes images of both) |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismus.li/en/culture-cuisine/places-of-cultural-interest/cultural-places-of-historical-interest/Vaduz-Castle.html |title=Liechtenstein - Vaduz Castle |publisher=Tourismus.li |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruinenland.de/burgen-luxemburg.htm |title=Photo gallery of Liechtenstein and Luxembourg castles, including photos of Vaduz Castle |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William I. Robinson''' (born March 28, 1959) is an American professor of [[sociology]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].  His work focuses on [[political economy]], [[globalization]], [[Latin America]] and [[historical materialism]]. He is a member of the International Parliamentary and Civil Society Mission to Investigate the Political Transition in Iraq.

==Early life==
In the early 1980s Robinson worked as a journalist in war-torn Nicaragua. He was a member of Union of Nicaraguan Journalists (past member and officer 1984–1990).

==Academic life==
He then went on to study for his BA in Journalism with the [[Friends World College]] in Nairobi (Kenya), Ibadan (Nigeria), and Costa Rica. Following this he received both his MA in Latin American Studies  and his PhD in Sociology at the [[University of New Mexico]].

==Academic work==

For a list of his many academic journal articles and books see his UCSB Sociology Department website:
http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/robinson/vitae.shtml

For a list of his contributions to Al Jazeera see:  http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/profile/william-i-robinson.html

Many of his works have been translated into Spanish, some of which can be found here: http://alainet.org/active/show_author.phtml?autor_nombre=William%20I.&amp;autor_apellido=Robinson

==Theoretical debates==
Entire symposiums and issues of scholarly journals have focused on discussing and debating Robinson's theories on global capitalism, class, and political economy. See for example the May 2012 issue of Critical Sociology [http://crs.sagepub.com/], the April 2001 issue of Theory and Society, the debate between Robinson and noted Marxian theorist [[Ellen Meiksens Wood]] in issue 15 of the journal Historical Materialism, the debate between British political economist in the 2009 volume 1(2) of the journal of the contemporary science association.

==Controversy==
In 2009 Robinson forwarded an e-mail to his "Sociology of Globalization" course, to spur class discussion, that had photos of the 2008-9 Israeli assault on Gaza paralleling photos of the German occupation of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] during the Second World War. The e-mail was widely circulated and became the subject of media controversy, after it was revealed that the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), a pro-Israel lobbyist organization, pressured university administrators to punish him. A Jewish student in the class brought a complaint against Robinson, that she was intimidated by the e-mail. The ADL criticized Robinson, considering the matter a case of academic misconduct, while [[California Scholars for Academic Freedom]] considered it a case of [[academic freedom]] and the charges without merit.&lt;ref name="Chronicle"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/temp/email2.php?id=CHBfzphdrpXJxfsyHVRgsjpfsZPswXqY |title=Head of Anti-Defamation League Urged Santa Barbara to Act Against Critic of Israel |author=Peter Schmidt |date=April 29, 2009 |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |accessdate= |format= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711060049/http://chronicle.com/temp/email2.php?id=CHBfzphdrpXJxfsyHVRgsjpfsZPswXqY |archivedate=July 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Counterpunch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/cloud04302009.html |author = Dana L.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars for Peace in the Middle East, a pro-Israel group of academics, said that the incident had raised "serious questions about his judgment and the value of his teaching," and that "Concern for academic freedom does not justify or erase what is clearly and profoundly flawed pedagogy." &lt;ref name="spme.net"&gt;SPME Statement on the Disposition of the Case of William Robinson at  UCSB,  SPME Board of Directors, June 29, 2009 [http://www.spme.net/cgi-bin/articles.cgi?ID=5691]&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson stated that his critics had confused his criticism of Israeli policies with anti-Semitism. "That's like saying if I condemn the U.S. government for the invasion of Iraq, I'm anti-American. It's the most absurd, baseless argument."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/30/local/me-professor30 |author = Duke Helfand | title=Professor's comparison of Israelis to Nazis stirs furor |date= April 30, 2009 |work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate= November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University officials initiated an investigation of Robinson to probe the allegations that the email Robinson had forwarded to his class was inappropriate and in violation of the faculty code of ethics.  The charges were dismissed in May 2009.&lt;ref name="spme.net"/&gt;
