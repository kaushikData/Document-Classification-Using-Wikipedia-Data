'''A. F. Salahuddin Ahmed''' (24 September 1924 – 19 October 2014) was a [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi]] historian, humanist and rationalist thinker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=National professor Salahuddin Ahmed passes away |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/10/19/national-professor-salahuddin-ahmed-passes-away |newspaper=bdnews24.com |date=19 October 2014 |access-date=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Ahmed was born in [[Motihari]], [[Bihar]]. He came from an educated [[Bengali Muslims|Bengali Muslim]] family. His father Abu Ahmed Faizul Mohi, paternal grandfather Moulvi Ahmed, one of the early Bengali Muslim high-ranking administrators in British India, and maternal grandfather [[Azizul Haque (police officer)|Azizul Haque]], (who is credited with having a major contribution to the development of [[Henry Classification System]] of [[fingerprint]] method) were all students of [[Presidency College, Calcutta]].

He received his I.A. from [[Surendranath College]], (formerly Ripon College), and B.A. (Hons.) in history from [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]] (now Presidency University). He completed his first M.A. in history from [[Calcutta University]], and then a second M.A. in history from [[University of Pennsylvania]], and his Ph.D. in history from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] at [[University of London]] (1961).

==Professional career==
Ahmed started his teaching career in 1948 as a lecturer at [[Jagannath College]], [[Dhaka]]. Later, he was a lecturer, reader, and then professor of history at [[Rajshahi University]]. He was also a professor of history at [[Jahangir Nagar University]] and [[Dhaka University]], the job from which he retired in 1984. In 1963, Ahmed was invited by the American Historical Association as a visiting lecturer in South Asian history at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. He was also [[UNESCO]] Cultural Fellow at [[Kyoto University]], Japan in 1956. Ahmed was also associated with [[Independent University, Bangladesh]] as Professor of National Culture and Heritage, and served as the president of the National Association of Social Sciences of Bangladesh, and chairman of the United Nations Association of Bangladesh.

==Personal life==
Ahmed was married to [[Hamida Khanom]], who was one of the very few early Muslim graduates (I.A. and B.A.) from [[Bethune College]], Calcutta. She completed her M.A. from  Calcutta University, and then a second B.A. (Hons.) from [[University College London]]. She retired as Principal of [[Home Economics College, Dhaka]]. Hamida provided support and inspiration to Ahmed in his professional career throughout their long 60 years of married life.

==Publications==
The following quote from the review of one of Ahmed's book: ''Perspectives on History, Society and Politics'' published by Readers Service, Kolkata, 2001, aptly captures his views and reputation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedamsbooks.com/no37124.htm |title=Perspectives on History, Society and Politics/A.F. Salahuddin Ahmed |publisher=Vedamsbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"This is a compilation of articles written over last two decades by a renowned historian of Bangladesh, Professor A.F. Salahuddin Ahmed on topics relating to history, society, and politics of the Indo-Pakistan-Bangladesh subcontinent, which is now known as South Asia. The main contention of the author is this that despite political divisions which took place in 1947 the people of this vast region belong to "one indivisible civilization which is the product of over thousand years of historical development." It was due to the machinations of "certain vested interests, both indigenous and foreign"  the common people had to pass through untold misery and suffering: and, these 'vested interests, even threatened their 'civilized existence.

Professor Ahmed is of the opinion that the destinies of the common people inhabiting this sub-continent 'are closely interlinked'. "They must", therefore, "learn to live together in peace which is essential for their development and progress." He made sincere efforts through these articles to promote greater awareness about the problems raised and to provoke "new thoughts concerning peace and understanding among the people of the three countries."}}

In 2012, Ahmed contributed a chapter, entitled "Bangladesh, Present, and Future Prospects" in a memorial book in honor of his younger deceased brother, Fakhruddin Ahmed, a career diplomat,and twice Foreign Secretary of Bangladesh, titled, ''Regional Cooperation and Globalization: Bangladesh, South Asia and Beyond edited by Dr. Zillur Rahman Khan and Dr. Meghna Guha Thakurta'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uplbooks.com/book/regional-cooperation-and-globalisation-bangladesh-south-asia-and-beyond |title=Regional Cooperation and Globalization:Bangladesh, South Asia and Beyond |publisher=uplbooks |date= |accessdate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202010509/http://www.uplbooks.com/book/regional-cooperation-and-globalisation-bangladesh-south-asia-and-beyond |archivedate=2012-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he makes a case for appreciating historical perspectives of social and political events:
{{quote| The present state of Bangladesh has to be viewed in the light of the past because, as has been said, the present "is the child of the past and parent of the future." In order to understand the problems and predicaments which confront the country at the present moment we  have to turn back to the past. Without understanding the past we cannot understand the present. If we look at history we would find that during the past hundred years or so phenomenal changes have taken place in what may be called the psyche of the Muslims who form the great majority of population of the region. These changes have to be explained and analysed in historical perspective.}}

In 2004, Ahmed in collaboration with Bazlul Momin Choudhury, published a comprehensive editorial volume on the history of Bangladesh, entitled ''Bangladesh:National Culture and Heritage: An Introductory Reader'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorsofbangladesh.com/boipatra1.php |title=Colors Of Bangladesh |publisher=Colors Of Bangladesh |date= |accessdate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220125447/http://www.colorsofbangladesh.com/boipatra1.php |archivedate=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives an overview of the land, society, culture and religions, and history of the peoples of Bangladesh.

Some other notable books &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Salahuddin%20Ahmed&amp;page=1 |title=Salahuddin Ahmed: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in English and Bengali written by Ahmed are:

* ''Social ideas and social change in Bengal 1818-18-35''
* ''Bangladesh Tradition and Transformation,Bengali Nationalism and the Emergence of Bangladesh''
* ''Itihash O oitijjo Bangalir Sadhana O Bhangalir Muktijuddha''
* ''Bangladesh Jatiyabad, Swadhinata'', Gonotantro

He has also contributed many articles in professional journals.

==Social activities==
Ahmed's interest and involvement in social service is reflected by his work for the [[Red Cross]] during the turbulent period of [[Partition of India]], and his association with the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/PRC/blog/m-n-roy |title=Absurdist Republic - M. N. Roy - The Radical Humanist |publisher=My.opera.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[M.N.Roy]], and his active involvement in Ahmed Memorial Foundation established by family members  dedicated to the educational and social welfare of their ancestral village of Bashbaria in Faridpur, Bangladesh. He maintained an active life until the day he died, serving as the National Professor, writing and publishing articles, giving media interviews.  He maintained  worldwide contacts with his students, and professional acquaintances, as well as with their children and grandchildren, as many of them continued to seek him out for advise and support, as did his own family, and his house served as intellectual, social, and family gathering place during his lifetime.

==Awards==
* [[Ekushey Padak]] (1991). 
* Bangladesh Sadhinota Padak ([[Independence Day Award]]), (1999).

The '''Arab National Council''' was an alliance of once warring Arabian tribes formed after the victorious uprising against nearly 400 years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule over Syria. [[T. E. Lawrence]] was instrumental in establishing this provisional Arab government under [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], Lawrence had hoped to bring about independence from foreign colonialism by uniting the [[Arabs]]. Faisal's rule as king, however, came to an abrupt end in 1920, after the battle of [[Battle of Maysalun|Maysaloun]], when the French Forces of [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|General Gouraud]], under the command of [[Mariano Goybet|General Mariano Goybet]], entered [[Damascus]], destroying Lawrence's dream of an independent Arabian rule over Syria; the council disbanded in the 1930s.

The '''Bank of New York Hoard''' is the name given to identify a [[treasure trove]] of several thousand [[Fugio Cent]]s that were discovered at the [[Bank of New York|bank]]. Sometime in 1788, a keg of Fugio cents were acquired by the bank and stored in the basement. The coins were forgotten about until they were rediscovered in 1856, this time at the bank's current location. At that time the coins were placed in cotton bags and put away until a final rediscovery of the coins was made in 1926.&lt;ref name="Colcoin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/Fugio.intro.html|title=The Fugio Cent of 1787: Introduction|publisher=www.coins.nd.edu|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coins were then given out as souvenirs and keepsakes to clients until 1948 when  the [[American Numismatic Society]] examined the remaining 1,641 coins. Several of the coins were donated to the society while others were sold to collectors.&lt;ref name="Colcoin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeoman"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide Book of United States Coins|author=R.S. Yeoman and Kenneth Bressett|publisher=[[Whitman Publishing]]|year=2017|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the coins found were in [[Uncirculated coin|mint state]] condition, most with brown [[Toning (coin)|toning]]. The find was important to collectors who wished to obtain a mint state example of the coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numismaster.com/ta/numis/Article.jsp?ArticleId=25556|title=More Than Morgans in Coin Hoards|author=Paul M. Green|publisher=www.numismaster.com|date=July 24, 2012|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeoman"/&gt;

The bank kept 819 of the remaining coins which range in grade from mint state to corroded due to past water damage while in storage. Despite the merger which led to the bank's closure in 2007, it was reported in 2013 that the coins still remain on the property. The owners have refused to distribute the remaining coins, and have kept them for historical value and appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlrc.com/articles/09132013.pdf|title=Collecting the Coins of Famous Hoards|publisher=www.hlrc.com|author=Dave Wnuck|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeoman"/&gt;

{{History of Bangladesh}}
'''Bikrampur''' ("City of Courage") was a [[pargana]] situated {{convert|12|mi}} south of [[Dhaka]], the modern capital city of [[Bangladesh]]. In the present day it is known as [[Munshiganj District]] of Bangladesh. It is a historic region in [[Bengal]]. It was a part of the [[Bhawal Estate]].

==History==

===Early history===
[[Ashoka]], the emperor of the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya Dynasty]], ruled all of major parts of Bengal from ca. 269 BC to 232 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Thapur (1973), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a devotee of [[Gautama Buddha]], he propagated [[Buddhism]] across his kingdom which included Bikrampur to the east. Following the high ideals of this religion, [[Pala Empire|Pala Kings]] came to Bikrampur to rule the region.&lt;ref name=romance&gt;{{cite book|pages=26|title=The Romance of an Eastern Capital|first=F.B.|last=Bradley|publisher=Smith, Elder &amp; CO|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pala Era===
The second ruler of [[Pala Empire]], [[Dharmapala (emperor)|Dharmapal]], built a [[Buddhist monasticism|Buddhist monastery]] in Bikrampur during his reign in 770–810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ray |first=Krishnendu |year=2012 |chapter=Vikramashila Mahavihara |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Vikramashila_Mahavihara |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, his son, [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapala]] ruled this area until 850 CE. Then the region is successively ruled by [[Vigrahapala I]], [[Narayanapala]], [[Rajyapala]], [[Gopala II]], [[Vigrahapala II]], [[Mahipala]], [[Naya Pala]], [[Vigrahapala III]], [[Mahipala II]], [[Shurapala II]], [[Ramapala]], [[Kumarapala (Pala king)|Kumarapala]], [[Gopala III]] and [[Madanapala (Pala dynasty)|Madanapala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=AM |year=2012 |chapter=Pala Dynasty |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pala_Dynasty |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pala empire]] disintegrated in 1174 weakened by attacks of the [[Sena dynasty]].&lt;ref name = Scott&gt;{{cite journal

===Chandra Era===
During the rule of [[Srichandra]] (reigned 930 – 975 AD), the administrative centre of the [[Chandra dynasty|Chandra kingdom]] was established at Bikrampur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=AM |year=2012 |chapter=Chandra Dynasty, The |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chandra_Dynasty,_The |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sen Era===
A copper-plate inscription from the time of the ruler [[Vijay Sen]] (ruled 1097–1160), founder of Sen dynasty, was found in [[Barrackpore]], in 1911. In this inscription, Bikrampur was mentioned as the capital of that region.&lt;ref name =companigonj.com&gt;[http://www.munshigonj.com/MgonjSection/HistoryOldBangla.htm Proof of Bikrampur as the ancient capital of Bengal], Golam Ashraf Khan Uzzal&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to be the capital throughout the, [[Sena Dynasty]]. In 1205, Turkic invader [[Bakhtiyar Khalji]] defeated the then-ruler [[Lakshman Sen]] in [[Nadia district|Nadia]]. Lakshman fled to Bikrampur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Misra |first=Chitta Ranjan |year=2012 |chapter=Laksmanasena |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Laksmanasena |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His two sons [[Vishwarup Sen]] and [[Keshab Sen]] kept ruling from here until 1230.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/IndiaBengal.htm|title= Far East King Lists|accessdate=30 December 2013}}{{self-published source|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the copper-plate inscriptions during their reign do not mention Bikrampur as the capital.&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=AM |year=2012 |chapter=Vikramapura |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Vikramapura |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another Hindu ruler, [[Danuj Rai]], defeated a successor of Keshab Sen and started ruling from here. In early 1280 he moved the capital to Suvarnagrama (later named Sonargaon).&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taher |first=MA |year=2012 |chapter=Raja Ganesha |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Raja_Ganesha |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mughal Era===
Emperor [[Akbar]] established Bikrampur as one of the 52 [[pargana]]s of Sonargaon [[Sarkar (country subdivision)|sarkar]] in Bengal [[Subah (province)|subah]] during his administrative reforms in 1572–1580.&lt;ref&gt;Abul Fazl-I-'Allami (1949, reprint 1993).

In the expeditions against [[Bara-Bhuiyans]], Mughal Subahdar [[Man Singh]] killed Kedar Rai in early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Szfqq7ruqWgC&amp;pg=PA64 |title=Bangladesh|work=google.com|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-[[Aurangzeb]] era, during the time of [[Murshid Quli Khan|Nawab Murshid Quli Khan]], Bikrampur was divided into eight [[taluk]]s – ''Bhagyakul'', ''[[Sreenagar Upazila|Sreenagar]]'', ''Maijpara'', ''Sinhapara'', ''Taltala'', ''[[Sirajdikhan Upazila|Sirajdikhan]]'', ''Louhojong'' and ''Baligaon''. Each taluk was represented by one Zamindar. Muhammad Azim Khan became the Zamindar of Louhajong who held the title of "Khan Bahadur". Gobinda Prasad Roy became the Zamindar of Maijpara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.munshigonj.com/heritage/Maijpara.htm|title=:: Munshigonj District – Heritage Places – Maijpara Math ::|work=munshigonj.com|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys of Wem by William Wolfgang Claret.jpg|thumb|[[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Judge Jeffreys]]]]
The '''Bloody Assizes''' were a series of [[trial (law)|trials]] started at [[Winchester]] on 25 August 1685 in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]], which ended the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] in England.

There were five judges&amp;nbsp;– Sir William Montague ([[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]]),&lt;ref name="whiles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whiles|first=John|title=Sedgemoor 1685|publisher=Picton Publishing|location=Chippenham|year=1985|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-948251-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Wright (judge)|Sir Robert Wright]],&lt;ref name="whiles"/&gt; Sir Francis Wythens ([[Court of King's Bench (England)|Justice of the King's Bench]]),&lt;ref name="whiles"/&gt; [[Creswell Levinz|Sir Creswell Levinz]] ([[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Justice of the Common Pleas]])&lt;ref name="whiles"/&gt; and [[Sir Henry Pollexfen]], led by [[Lord Chief Justice of England|Lord Chief Justice]] [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|George Jeffreys]].
[[File:Bloody assizes.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th-century artist's impression of Judge Jeffreys presiding over the "Bloody Assizes".]]
Over 1,000 rebels were in prison awaiting the trials, which started in Winchester on 26 August.&lt;ref name="whiles"/&gt; The first notable trial was that of an elderly [[gentlewoman]] named Dame [[Alice Lyle]].&lt;ref name="som"/&gt; The jury reluctantly found her guilty, and, the law recognising no distinction between principals and accessories in [[treason]], she was sentenced to be [[Death by burning|burned]]. This was commuted to [[decapitation|beheading]], with the sentence being carried out in Winchester market-place on 2 September 1685.&lt;ref name="whiles"/&gt;

From Winchester the court proceeded through the [[West Country]] to [[Salisbury]], [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and on to [[Taunton]], before finishing up at [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]] on 23 September. More than 1,400 prisoners were dealt with and although most were sentenced to death, fewer than 300 were hanged or [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].&lt;ref name="britex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britainexpress.com/History/battles/sedgemoor.htm |title=The battle of Sedgemoor |accessdate=21 November 2007 |work=Britain Express }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Bloodyassize.htm | title=The Bloody Assize|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taunton Assize took place in the Great Hall of [[Taunton Castle]] (now the home of the [[Museum of Somerset]]). Of more than 500 prisoners brought before the court on the 18/19 September, 144 were hanged and their remains displayed around the county to ensure people understood the fate of those who rebelled against the king.&lt;ref name="exmoor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everythingexmoor.org.uk/_T/Taunton_Castle.php |title=Taunton Castle |accessdate=21 November 2007 |format= |work=Everything Exmoor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 800–850 men were [[penal transportation|transported]] to the [[West Indies]]&lt;ref name="som"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Bloodyassize.htm |title=The Bloody Assize |accessdate=17 December 2015 |work=Somerset County Council }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they were worth more alive than dead as a source of cheap labour&lt;ref name="emn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emn/index.php/archives/2004/11/from-the-dnb-the-bloody-judge/ |title=George Jeffreys (1645–1689) |accessdate=20 February 2008 |format= |work=Early Modern Notes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the novel ''[[Captain Blood (novel)|Captain Blood]]'', and the later movies based on it, graphically portray this punishment).  Others were imprisoned to await further trial, although many did not live long enough, succumbing to 'Gaol Fever' ([[typhus]]), which was rife in the unsanitary conditions common to most English [[Jail|gaols]] at that time. A woman named [[Elizabeth Gaunt]] had the gruesome distinction of being the last woman burnt alive in England for political crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strum.co.uk/twilight/shepton5.htm |title=The Bloody Assizes |accessdate=20 February 2008 |work=From Watford Gap to Camelot }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffreys returned to London after the Assizes to report to [[James II of England|King James]], who rewarded him by making him [[Lord Chancellor]] (at the age of only 40), 'For the many eminent and faithful services to the Crown'.  Jeffreys became known as "the [[hanging judge]]".&lt;ref name="emn"/&gt;

After the [[Glorious Revolution]], Jeffreys was incarcerated in the [[Tower of London]], where he died in 1689. His death was probably due to his chronic medical history of kidney and [[bladder stone]]s leading to an acute infection, [[kidney failure]] and possibly [[Bacteremia|toxaemia]].&lt;ref name="emn"/&gt;

Writing as recently as 1929, Sir John C. Fox&lt;ref&gt;Fox was Vice-Chairman of Oxfordshire Quarter Sessions and had been Senior Chancery Master of the Supreme Court.&lt;/ref&gt; said:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even to the present day, the mothers of West Somerset control their unruly offspring by threatening to send for 'Judge Jeffreys'.&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Fox, ''The Lady Ivie's Trial'', (Oxford University Press, 1929), xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2455">The '''Center for American Archeology''', or '''CAA''', is an independent non-profit [[501(c)(3)]] research and education institution located in [[Kampsville]], [[Illinois]], [[United States|USA]], near the [[Illinois River]]. It is dedicated to the exploration of the culture of [[prehistoric]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and, to a lesser extent, the European settlers who supplanted them.

Founded on what is often referred to as the "[[Nile]] of [[North America]]," the region surrounding the confluence of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and the [[Illinois River|Illinois]] rivers, the Center for American Archeology specializes in [[North America]]n [[pre-Columbian]] cultures of the area.  Due to successive settlement along the rivers, the area is particularly rich in [[Woodland Period]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], especially those of the Middle Woodland [[Hopewell culture]], and later [[Mississippian culture]].  The Center has been associated with years of excavation at the [[Koster Site]] in [[Greene County, Illinois]].  Researchers have uncovered evidence of more than 7,000 years of human habitation, back to the Early [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] period (8000 BC to 1000 BC).  

The center is located about 90 minutes north of [[St. Louis]] and the [[Cahokia]] Mounds near [[Collinsville, Illinois]]. It uses the [[Kamp Store]] as the site of the CAA's Visitor’s Center and [[Museum]].  The early 1900s [[mercantile]] building is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

This narrative is false, as shown by the Wehrmacht's own documents, such as [[Clean Wehrmacht#Commissar Order|the records detailing the executions of Red Army commissars by frontline divisions]], in violation of the laws of war. While the Wehrmacht largely treated British and American POWs in accordance with these laws (giving the myth plausibility in the West), they routinely enslaved, starved, shot, or otherwise abused and murdered Polish, Soviet, and Yugoslav civilians and prisoners of war. Wehrmacht units also participated in the mass murder of Jews and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{illm|Urlich Herbert|de|Ulrich Herbert}} (2016): [https://books.google.com/books?id=3OrVDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=wehrmacht+mass+murder&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDwJGQz6rVAhWrrlQKHd_wDdMQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=wehrmacht%20mass%20murder&amp;f=false “Holocaust Research in Germany”], in ''Holocaust and Memory in Europe'', edited by Thomas Schlemmer and [[Alan E. Steinweis]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth began in the late 1940s, with former Wehrmacht officers and veterans' groups looking to evade guilt, and a few German veterans' associations and various far-right authors and publishers in Germany and abroad continue to promote such a view. Modern defenders often downplay or deny the Wehrmacht's involvement in the [[Holocaust]], largely ignore the [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|German persecution of Soviet prisoners of war]], and emphasise the role of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and the civil administration in the atrocities committed.

The [[Waffen-SS]], in turn, attempted to benefit from the clean Wehrmacht myth by their veterans declaring the organisation to have virtually been a branch of the latter, and to have fought as "honourably" as it. Its veteran organisation, [[HIAG]], attempted to cultivate a myth of their soldiers having been "Soldiers like any other".{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=39}}

==War of extermination==
{{Main|War of annihilation}}
[[File:Greater Germanic Reich.png|thumb|right|In their plan to create the [[Greater Germanic Reich]], the Nazi leadership aimed to conquer Eastern European territories, subjugate and exterminate the Slavic populations, and colonise the territory with ethnic German settlers.]]
In the eyes of the Nazis, the war against the [[Soviet Union]] would be a [[war of annihilation]] (''Vernichtungskrieg'').{{sfn|Förster|1988|p=21}}&lt;!---While older historiography tended to emphasize the notion of a "clean" Wehrmacht, the historian {{illm|Jürgen Förster|de|Jürgen Förster (Historiker)}} notes that "In fact, the military commanders were caught up in the ideological character of the conflict, and involved in its implementation as willing participants."{{sfn|Förster|1988|p=21}}--&gt; The [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]] viewed the Soviet Union (and all of [[Eastern Europe]]) as populated by non-Aryan ''[[Untermenschen]]'' ("sub-humans"), ruled by "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevik]] conspirators".{{sfn||''The Fatal Attraction of Adolf Hitler'', 1989}} Accordingly, it was stated Nazi policy to kill, deport, or enslave the majority of [[Russians|Russian]] and other [[Slavs|Slavic]] populations according to the ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' ("General Plan for the East").{{sfn||''The Fatal Attraction of Adolf Hitler'', 1989}} The plan consisted of the ''Kleine Planung'' ("Small Plan") and the ''Große Planung'' ("Large Plan"), which covered actions to be taken during the war and actions to be implemented after the war was won, respectively.{{sfn|Rössler|Schleiermacher|1996|pp=270–274}} The plans entailed killing the vast majority of the native population among the nations it would be implemented through starvation and deportations.

Before and during the invasion of the Soviet Union, German troops were heavily indoctrinated with [[anti-Bolshevik]], [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|anti-Slavic]] propaganda.{{sfn|Evans|1989|p=59}} Following the invasion, Wehrmacht officers told their soldiers to target people who were described as "Jewish Bolshevik subhumans", the "Mongol hordes", the "Asiatic flood" and the "Red beast".{{sfn|Evans|1989|pp=59–60}} Many German troops viewed the war in Nazi terms and regarded their Soviet enemies as sub-human.{{sfn|Förster|2005|p=127}} A speech given by General [[Erich Hoepner]] indicates the disposition of Operation Barbarossa and the Nazi racial plan, as he informed the [[4th Panzer Group]] that the war against the Soviet Union was "an essential part of the German people's struggle for existence" (''Daseinskampf''), and stated, "the struggle must aim at the annihilation of today's Russia and must therefore be waged with unparalleled harshness."{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=140}}

==Foundation==
The [[Potsdam Conference]] held by the Soviet Union, United Kingdom and United States from 17 July to 2 August 1945 largely determined the occupation policies that the [[Allied-occupied Germany|defeated country]] was to face. These included [[demilitarization|demilitarisation]], [[denazification]], [[democratization]] and [[decentralization]]. The Allies' often crude and ineffective implementation caused the local population to dismiss the process as a "noxious mixture of moralism and 'victors' justice'".{{sfn|Large|1987|pp=79–80}}

For those in the Western zones of occupation, the arrival of the [[Cold War]] undermined the demilitarization process by seemingly justifying a major part of Hitler's foreign policies — the "fight against Soviet bolshevism".{{sfn|Large|1987|p=80}} In 1950, after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], it became clear to the Americans that a German army would have to be revived to help face off against the Soviet Union. Both American and West German politicians were faced with the prospect of rebuilding the armed forces of the Federal Republic.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=72–73}}

===Himmerod memorandum===
From 5 to 9 October 1950, a group of former senior officers, at the behest of Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], met in secret at [[Himmerod Abbey]] (hence the memorandum's name) to discuss West Germany's rearmament. The participants were divided into several subcommittees that focused on the political, ethical, operational and logistical aspects of the future armed forces.{{sfn|Abenheim|1989|pp=53–54}} The "internal structure" working group was headed by General Hermann Foertsch, who in the 1930s had been a protege of Field Marshal [[Walter von Reichenau]], one of the most ardent National Socialists in the Wehrmacht, and would go on to become one of Adenauer's advisers on defense.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=236}}

The resulting memorandum included a summary of the discussions at the conference and bore the name "Memorandum on the Formation of a German Contingent for the Defense of Western Europe within the framework of an International Fighting Force". It was intended as both a planning document and as a basis of negotiations with the Western Allies.{{sfn|Abenheim|1989|pp=53–54}}

The participants of the conference were convinced that no future German army would be possible without the historical rehabilitation of the [[Wehrmacht]]. Thus, the memorandum included these key demands:
*All German soldiers convicted as war criminals would be released;
*The "defamation" of the German soldier, including those of the [[Waffen-SS]], would have to cease;
*The "measures to transform both domestic and foreign public opinion" with regards to the German military would need to be taken.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=72–73}}

Adenauer accepted these propositions and in turn advised the representatives of the three Western powers that German armed forces would not be possible as long as German soldiers remained in custody. To accommodate the West German government, the Allies commuted a number of war crimes sentences.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=72–73}}

===Public opinion===
A public declaration from [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] followed in January 1951, stating that there was "a real difference between the German soldier and Hitler and his criminal group". Chancellor Adenauer made a similar statement in a [[Bundestag]] debate on the Article 131 of the ''[[Grundgesetz]]'', West Germany's provisional constitution. He stated that the German soldier fought honorably, as long as he "had not been guilty of any offense".{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=236}} Article 231 expressly declared that all who served in the military and the civil service before 1945 were entitled to their full pensions, a measure that did not touch directly upon the memory of the past, but did suggest the majority of those who served the National Socialist regime were honorable people who deserved their pensions.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=238}} These declarations laid the foundation of the myth of the "clean Wehrmacht" that reshaped the West's perception of the German war effort.{{sfn|Wette|2007|pp=236–238}}

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, there was much sympathy in Germany with those accused of war crimes and in the late 1940s and 1950s there was a flood of polemical books and essays demanding freedom for the "so-called 'war criminals'", the very phrasing of which implied that those convicted of war crimes were in fact innocent.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=239}} The German historian Norbert Frei wrote that the widespread demand for freedom for the "so-called war criminals" was "an indirect admission of the entire society's enmeshment in National Socialism"; the war crimes trials were a painful reminder of the nature of the regime that many ordinary people had identified with, and in this context, there was an overwhelming demand for the rehabilitation of the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=240-241}} This is in part because the Wehrmacht could trace its descent back to the Prussian Army and before that to the army founded in 1640 by Frederich Wilhelm, the "Great Elector" of Brandenburg, making it an institution deeply rooted in German history, which presented problems for those who wanted to portray the Nazi era as a "freakish aberration" from the course of German history. In part, there were so many Germans who served in the Wehrmacht or who had family members who served in the Wehrmacht that there was a widespread demand to have a version of the past that allowed them to "...honor the memory of their fallen comrades and to find meaning in the hardships and personal sacrifice of their own military service".{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=241-242}}

==Denial of responsibility==
{{Main|War crimes of the Wehrmacht}}
After penalties were imposed in the immediate postwar period as part of the [[denazification]] process in the late 1940s to the early 1950s, the Federal Republic of Germany's population and politicians sharply criticized the practice of "[[victor's justice]]" and the theory of [[Collective responsibility|collective guilt]] (in the opinion of historian {{illm|Norbert Frei|de|Norbert Frei}}, it was never the Allies' intention to impose collective punishment). Thus, the [[Bundestag|German Federal Parliament]] began to enact amnesty laws under which many war criminals saw their sentences commuted.{{Clarify|date=March 2016}}

===Political climate===

The changing political climate in the immediate post-war period aided in the creation of the image of a "clean Wehrmacht", according to which, unlike the criminal killings carried out by police and [[Schutzstaffel|SS groups]], the Wehrmacht had fought fairly under the provisions of the [[international law of war]] without involvement in the crimes of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norbert Frei]]: ''Deutsche Lernprozesse. NS-Vergangenheit und Generationenfolge''. In: Derselbe: ''1945 und wir. Das Dritte Reich im Bewußtsein der Deutschen''. dtv, München 2009, S. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1980s and 1990s, there was something of a division of labor among historians; military historians writing the history of World War II focused on the campaigns and battles of the Wehrmacht and treated the genocidal policies of the Nazi regime in passing, if at all,{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=257}} while historians of the Holocaust and of the occupation policies of Nazi Germany largely avoided writing about the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=257}} This was not the result of a conspiracy, but rather due to the training of historians for different fields. Military historians tended to focus on battles and campaigns to the exclusion of everything else, and as a result, most military historians were not interested in the Wehrmacht's role in occupation policies in the areas it had conquered.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=254}}

The subject of the Holocaust was largely avoided outside of Israel in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=254}} The governments of Britain, the United States, France, Canada, and other countries had either imposed restrictions on Jewish refugees in the 1930s or in the case of Canada barred all Jewish refugees outright, and most did not wish to be reminded that many of the Jews turned away in the 1930s were subsequently killed in the Holocaust. As such, historians outside of Germany were not much interested in the Holocaust and there were almost no studies done of the Wehrmacht's involvement in the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" as the subject of the "Final Solution" itself attracted almost no interest until the 1960s.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=230-231}} The Austrian-born American historian [[Raul Hilberg]] found that in the 1950s, few in the United States wanted to hear about the Holocaust. Successive publishers rejected his later critically acclaimed 1961 book ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', telling him that nobody in America was interested in the topic.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=276-277}}

===Memoirs and historical studies===

Former German officers published their memoirs and historical studies, which also contributed to the myth. The chief architect of this body of work was the former chief of the ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'', [[Franz Halder]]. He informally supervised the work of other officers who, during and since their prisoner-of-war captivity, had worked in the Operational History (German) Section of the [[United States Army Center of Military History|U.S. Army Historical Division]] and had exclusive access to the captured German war archives stored in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram Wette: ''Die Wehrmacht. Feindbilder, Vernichtungskrieg, Legenden''. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2002, {{ISBN|3-7632-5267-3}}, S. 225–229.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case of the vanquished writing history, starting in 1947, the U.S. Army Historical Division assembled a large group of former Wehrmacht generals under the leadership of Halder to write a multi-volume history of the Eastern Front so that U.S. Army officers could learn about the tactics of the Red Army, albeit as the Germans perceived them.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=251}} The work of the Halder committee, which was a quasi-official history, was extremely influential on the memory of the war beginning in the 1950s, and the picture that the Halder committee drew of a highly professional, apolitical Wehrmacht that had nothing to do with war crimes, was widely accepted by historians.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=251}}

The German historian Wolfram Wette described Halder as having a "decisive influence in West Germany in the 1950s and 1960s on the way the history of the Second World War was written, by virtue of the knowledge he had amassed working on the studies assembled by the Historical Division, which he shared with both professional historians and interested amateurs and veterans".{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=345}} Other Wehrmacht leaders like [[Erich von Manstein]] and [[Heinz Guderian]] published best-selling memoirs that depicted the Wehrmacht as victims of Hitler rather than as his followers; a group of professional, apolitical officers who were quietly opposed to National Socialism who were led into the abyss by their deranged ''Führer'' through no fault of their own.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=234-235}} Given this picture, discussion of war crimes by the Wehrmacht was completely avoided as it would damage the picture of the Wehrmacht as "victims" of Hitler.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=234}}

===Trial of Erich von Manstein===
Captain [[Basil Liddell Hart]], was an influential British military historian who endorsed the "clean Wehrmacht" myth, writing with admiration that the Wehrmacht had been the mightiest war machine ever built and that it would have won the war if only Hitler had not interfered with the conduct of operations.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=234-235}} Between 1949 and 1953, Liddell Hart was deeply involved in a campaign urging the release of Manstein after a British military court convicted him of war crimes on the Eastern Front, which he called a gross miscarriage of justice.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=226}} The trial of Manstein was a turning point in the British people's perception of the Wehrmacht; Manstein's lawyer, the Labour MP Reginald Paget, waged a well-oiled and energetic public relations campaign for amnesty for his client, enlisting many politicians and celebrities in the process.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=224-225}}

One celebrity who joined Paget's campaign, the left-wing philosopher Bertrand Russell, wrote in a 1949 essay that the enemy of the time was the Soviet Union, not Germany, and given the way in which Manstein was a hero to the German people, that it was necessary for the wartime Western Allies to free him for the needs of the Cold War.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=226}} Liddell Hart joined Paget's campaign for freedom for Manstein, and as Liddell Hart often wrote on military affairs in British newspapers, he played a key role in winning Manstein his freedom in May 1953.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=226}} Given Liddell Hart's general sympathy with the Wehrmacht, he depicted it in his books and essays as an apolitical force that had nothing to do with the crimes of the National Socialist regime, a subject that did not much interest Liddell Hart in the first place.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=234-235}}
 
In arguing for Manstein, Paget had made mutually exclusive contradictory arguments. Namely while knowing nothing of Nazi crimes, Manstein and other Wehrmacht officers simultaneously opposed the Nazi crimes that they were supposedly unaware of.{{sfn|Lawson|2006|p=159}} Paget lost the Manstein case with the British military tribunal presided over by Lieutenant General Frank Simpson finding Manstein supported Hitler's "war of annihilation" against the Soviet Union, enforced the Commissar Order, and as commander of the 11th Army assisted ''Einsatzgruppe'' C with massacring Jews in the Ukraine, sentencing him to 18 years in prison for war crimes.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=225-226}}

The British historian Tom Lawson wrote that Paget was greatly helped by the fact that most of the British "Establishment" naturally sympathized with the traditional elites in Germany, seeing them as people much like themselves, and for members of the "Establishment" like Archbishop George Bell the mere fact that Manstein was a German Army officer and a Lutheran who went to church regularly "..was enough to confirm his opposition to the Nazi state and therefore the absurdity of the trial".{{sfn|Lawson|2006|p=159-160}}  During and after the trial of Manstein, Paget denied that Operation Barbarossa was a "war of annihilation", down-playing the racist aspects of Barbarossa and the campaign to exterminate Soviet Jews as the supposed fonts of Communism, and instead argued that "the Wehrmacht displayed a large degree of restraint and discipline in circumstances of unimaginable cruelty".{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=225}}

Wette wrote that most Anglo-American military historians had a strong admiration for the "professionalism" of the Wehrmacht, and tended to write about the Wehrmacht in a very admiring tone, largely accepting the version of history set out in the memoirs of former Wehrmacht leaders.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=230-231}} Wette suggested this "professional solidarity" had something with the fact that most military historians in the English-speaking world tended to be conservative former Army officers who had a natural sympathy with conservative former Wehrmacht officers, whom they saw as men much like themselves.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=230-231}} He suggested that this sympathy did not extend to Nazi Germany itself, but only the picture of a "professional" Wehrmacht committed to Prussian values that were allegedly inimical to Nazism, while displaying super-human courage and endurance against overwhelming odds, especially on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Wette|2007|p=230}}

Jennifer Foray, in her 2010 study of the Wehrmacht [[Netherlands in World War II#German occupation|occupation]] of the [[Netherlands]], asserts that "Scores of studies published in the last few decades have demonstrated that the Wehrmacht's purported disengagement with the political sphere was an image carefully cultivated by commanders and foot soldiers alike, who, during and after the war, sought to distance themselves from the ideologically driven murder campaigns of the National Socialists."{{sfn|Foray|2010|pp=769–770}} Following the return of the last war prisoners from Soviet captivity, on 7 October 1955, 600 former members of the Wehrmacht and the [[Waffen-SS]] swore a public oath in the Friedland Barracks that received a strong media reaction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the German people and the German dead and the Soviet Armed Forces, we swear that we have neither committed murder, nor defiled, nor plundered. If we have brought suffering and misery on other people, it was done according to the Laws of War.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Hans Reichelt]], ''Die deutschen Kriegsheimkehrer. Was hat die DDR für sie getan?'' eastern edition, Berlin 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Debunking==
In 2011, the [[Germany|German]] military historian [[Wolfram Wette]] called the "clean Wehrmacht" thesis a "collective perjury".&lt;ref&gt;''Zähe Legenden''. Interview mit Wolfram Wette, in: [[Die Zeit]] vom 1.&amp;nbsp;Juni 2011, S. 22&lt;/ref&gt; After the return of former Wehrmacht documents by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] to the Federal Republic of Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Astrid M. Eckert: ''Kampf um die Akten: Die Westalliierten und die Rückgabe von deutschem Archivgut nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg''. Franz Steiner, Stuttgart 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; it became clear through their evaluation that it was not possible to sustain the narrative any longer. Today, the extensive involvement of the Wehrmacht in numerous Nazi crimes is documented, such as the [[Commissar Order]].&lt;ref name="EnzNat"&gt;[[Gerd R. Ueberschär]]: ''Die Legende von der sauberen Wehrmacht.'' In: [[Wolfgang Benz]], [[Hermann Graml]], {{illm|Hermann Weiß (historian)|de|Hermann Weiß (Historiker)}} (Eds.): ''Enzyklopädie des Nationalsozialismus.'' Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-423-34408-1}}, S. 110f.&lt;/ref&gt;

While advocates of the thesis of a "clean Wehrmacht" were attempting to describe the Wehrmacht as independent of the [[Nazi ideology]], and denying their war crimes or trying to put individual cases into perspective, more recent historical research from the 1980s and 1990s based on witness statements, court documents, letters from the front, personal diaries and other documents demonstrates the immediate and systematic involvement of the armed forces in many massacres and war crimes, especially in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="EnzNat" /&gt;

In the 1990s and 2000s, two exhibitions by the [[Hamburg Institute for Social Research]] exposed these crimes to a wider audience and focused on the hostilities as a German-Soviet extermination war. The historian [[Christian Hartmann (historian)|Christian Hartmann]] found in  2009 that "no one needs to expose the deceptive myth of the 'clean' Wehrmacht any further. Their guilt is so overwhelming that any discussion about it is superfluous."&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Hartmann (historian)|Christian Hartmann]]: ''Wehrmacht im Ostkrieg. Front und militärisches Hinterland 1941/42.'' (= ''Quellen und Darstellungen zur Zeitgeschichte'', Band 75) Oldenbourg, München 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-486-58064-8}}, S. 790.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, historian [[Truman Anderson]] identified a new scholarly consensus centering around the "recognition of the Wehrmacht's affinity for key features of the National Socialist world view, especially for its hatred of communism and its anti-semitism".{{sfn|Anderson|2000|p=325}} Similarly, [[Ben Shepherd (historian)|Ben Shepherd]] writes that "Most historians now acknowledge the scale of Wehrmacht involvement in the crimes of the Third Reich", but maintains that "there nevertheless remains considerable debate as to the relative importance of the roles which ideology, careerism, ruthless military utilitarianism, and pressure of circumstances played in shaping Wehrmacht conduct."{{sfn|Shepherd|2009|pp=455–6}} Finally, in his last book, he points out how the "German army's moral failure and military failure" were always reinforcing each other, whether at a time of success after the victory over France, or in the days of defeat and destruction.{{sfn|Shepherd|2016|p=536}}

===Commissar Order===
{{Main|Commissar Order}}
German historian [[Felix Römer]] has studied the implementation of the [[Commissar Order]] by the Wehrmacht, publishing his findings in 2008 as ''Der Kommissarbefehl. Wehrmacht und NS-Verbrechen an der Ostfront 1941/42 [The Commissar Order: The Wehrmacht and the Nazi Crimes on the Eastern Front, 1941–1942]''. It was the first complete account of the implementation of the order by the combat formations of the [[Wehrmacht]]. Römer's research showed that 116 out of 137 German divisions on the Eastern Front filed reports detailing the killing of the Red Army's [[political commissar]]s. In total, at least 3430 were murdered by the regular troops (and not by the SS) according to the order until May 1942, possibly up to 4,000 men.{{sfn|Kellerhoff|2016}}

Römer finds that the records "prove that Hitler's generals had executed his murderous orders without scruples or hesitations", thereby shattering vestiges of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht. Historian [[Wolfram Wette]], reviewing the book, notes that the sporadic objections to the order were not fundamental, but rather driven by military necessity and that the cancellation of the order in 1942 was "not a return to morality, but an opportunistic course correction". Wette concludes: "The Commissar Order, which has always had a particularly strong influence on the image of the Wehrmacht because of its obviously criminal character, has finally been clarified. Once again the observation has confirmed itself: the deeper the research penetrates into the military history, the gloomier the picture becomes."{{sfn|Wette|2009}}

===Participation in the Holocaust===
American historian [[Waitman Wade Beorn]] has examined the complicity of the Wehrmacht in the crimes committed against Jews and other civilians in [[Belarus]], from autumn 1941 to early in the subsequent winter, in his work ''[[Marching into Darkness|Marching into Darkness: The Wehrmacht and the Holocaust in Belarus]]''. The book investigates how so-called anti-partisan warfare was connected to the [[Holocaust]] via its ideological targeting of "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish-Bolsheviks]]". Beorn concludes that, because anti-semitic sentiment was lower in Belarus, the [[Army Group Centre Rear Area]], compared to the territories of [[Army Group North Rear Area|Army Group North]] and [[Army Group South Rear Area]]s, the army troops played a significantly larger role in direct persecution of Jews during the period that he studied.{{sfn|Shepherd|2015}}

Beorn addresses other aspects of Wehrmacht crimes, including its support for the starvation policy of Nazi Germany, the [[Hunger Plan]]. He examines what he calls "the progressive complicity" of the Wehrmacht, highlighting the main developments that led to the escalation of violence, such as the [[Mogilev Conference]] in September 1941. Organised by the commander of the [[Army Group Centre Rear Area]], it brought together the German Army, the SS and the [[Order Police]] commanders for an "exchange of experiences" and marked a dramatic escalation of violence against the civilian population.{{sfn|Kühne|2015}} The book looks at several military formations and how they responded to orders to commit genocide and other [[crimes against humanity]]. Beorn finds that those who refused were only lightly punished (or not punished at all), debunking the claims of German veterans that they had to participate under threat of death.{{sfn|Nelson|2014}}

==Contemporary parallels==
===Italian collaboration===
The "Clean Wehrmacht" myth parallels the emergence of a comparable narrative surrounding the participation of the [[Royal Italian Army]] during World War II. Emerging under the post-war [[Italian Republic|republic]], it was argued that "the Italians were decent people" (''Italiani, brava gente'') in contrast to the ideologically motivated and brutal Germans. In particular, it argued that the Italians had not participated in the Nazi persecution of Jews in occupied parts of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=P2004&gt;{{cite journal|first=Marta|last=Petrusewicz|title=The hidden pages of contemporary Italian history: war crimes, war guilt and collective memory|journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies|volume=9|issue=3|year=2004|pages=269–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodogno|first=Davide|title=Italiani brava gente? Fascist Italy's Policy Toward the Jews in the Balkans, April 1941–July 1943|journal=European History Quarterly|year=2005|volume=35|issue=2|pages=213–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of the phenomenon in [[popular culture]] is the film ''[[Mediterraneo]]'' (1991), directed by [[Gabriele Salvatores]].&lt;ref name=P2004/&gt; This avoided "a public debate on collective responsibility, guilt and denial, repentance and pardon" but has recently been challenged by historians.&lt;ref name=P2004/&gt;

===Waffen-SS===
Analogus to the Wehrmacht [[Waffen-SS veterans in post-war Germany|Waffen-SS veterans]] and their organisation, [[HIAG]], tried to portray the [[Waffen-SS]] as a clean fighting force, innocent of war crimes. HIAG argued that the Waffen-SS was the fourth branch of the Wehrmacht and had fought honourably, like it made out the Wehrmacht to have done, and that all crimes committed by the SS, which even HIAG could not deny, had been carried out by the other, non-combat branches of the organisation. HIAG thereby combined the Waffen-SS into the myth of the "Clean Wehrmacht", something former Wehrmacht officials were not particularly comfortable about.{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=39}} This claim was not particularly successful as the Waffen-SS had been declared a criminal organisation after the war and, apart from the war crimes it committed, almost 60,000 of its members had served at some stage as concentration camp guards or in ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]''.&lt;ref name="Focus" &gt;{{cite web |last=Wiederschein  |first= Harald |url=https://www.focus.de/wissen/mensch/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/militaerisch-unbedeutend-brutal-verbrecherisch-mythos-waffen-ss-hitlers-ueberschaetzte-elitetruppen_id_4826676.html |title=Mythos Waffen-SS |publisher=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]] |date=21 July 2015 |website= |access-date=22 September 2018 |language=German |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; High level support from German post-war politicians like [[Konrad Adenauer]] and [[Franz-Josef Strauss]] led however to the myth of the Waffen-SS soldiers having been "Soldiers like any other".&lt;ref name="Spiegel" &gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=25 March 1964 |title=WAFFEN-SS |trans-title= |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46173314.html |language=German |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |location= |access-date=22 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wienand|2015|p=39}}

By the 10th-century, Java had one of the most complex economies in [[Southeast Asia]]. Despite the importance of rice farming which acts as the chief tax income for the Javanese courts, the influx of sea trade in Asia between the 10th and 13th centuries forced a more convenient currency to the Javanese economy. During the late 8th-century, ingots made of gold and silver were introduced. These are the '''early Nusantara coins'''.{{sfn|Christie|1996|p=99}}

==Early development in Central Java==
In Java, rice farming was still the main occupation of most households in the village. This continued to provide most of the tax income of the Javanese courts. Later in the period, the northern coasts of Java and Bali became the main center of an affluent export trade in local agricultural products and manufacture, as well as spices e.g. [[sandalwood]] from eastern Indonesia. These trade brought goods to distant markets e.g. China and India. The increasing intensity of trade called for a convenient currency in the Javanese society.{{sfn|Christie|1996|p=98}}

During the late 8th-century money took the form of ingots made of gold and silver. These are the earliest recorded coins in Indonesia. The currency in Indonesia is based on weight; the most common units were the ''[[catty|kati]]'' of {{convert|750|g|oz}}, ''[[tael|tahil]]'' of {{convert|38|g|oz}}, ''masa'' {{convert|2.4|g|oz}} and ''kupang'' {{convert|0.6|g|oz}}. These units were legal tender for tax payments. The ''kati'', ''tahil'', ''masa'' and ''kupang'' units remained in use up until the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch period]]. Several trade jargons were introduced in this period, e.g. the Javanese ''wli'', which became the modern Indonesian ''beli'' ("buy"), and the Sanskrit ''wyaya'', modern Indonesian term ''biaya'' ("expenses") appears in two inscriptions both dated 878 AD. The Javanese coins have no parallels with the style of Indian coins. Most of the Javanese coins were found within the Javanese [[Shailendra dynasty|kingdom of Shailendra]].{{sfn|Christie|1996|p=99}}

===Gold coins===
[[File:MET 1998 544 240.jpeg|thumb|right|A gold coin of probably the highest denomination of ''ka''.]]
Most gold coins of 9th and early 10th century Java are stamped with the character ''ta'' in [[Nāgarī script|nagari script]] on one side, an abbreviation of ''tahil''. The same character remained on coins until the [[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]] period in the 12th-century.{{sfn|Christie|1996|p=99}} Gold coins were usually made in the shape of cubes, carefully crafted and very uniform in size and gold content.

===Silver coins===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Prent voorstellende door Engelse particulieren voor Sumatra geslagen munten TMnr 93-4-9.jpg|thumb|left|Sandalwood decoration or quatrefoil appeared in the silver ingot on the picture below.]]
Central Javanese silver coins have very different shapes compared with the gold coins. Most silver coins are round and known as "sandalwood flower" coins referring to the four-petaled flower (quatrefoil) found on the reverse. The silver coins lasted from the early 9th until the 14th century. The same flower appears on one side of older silver ingots from central Java; the other side is stamped with a flowing vase design, which is never found on coins. The observe of the sandalwood flower coins are stamped with the nagari character ''ma'' (abbreviation of ''masa'').{{sfn|Wicks|1992|pp=248-50}}{{sfn|Christie|1996|p=99}} 

Unlike the gold coins, the silver coins changed rapidly. In only one century, the character ''ma'' degenerated very quickly, perhaps because it is different with the Javanese [[Kawi script|Kawi letter]] for ''ma''. The shape also changed; in the early 10th-century, the shape of one masa changed from a thick and flat coin to a thin and cup-shaped coin. The silver coins were presumably served as small change. The silver coins were probably created by smiths in the market for use in market transactions.{{sfn|Wicks|1992|pp=248-50}}{{sfn|Christie|1996|p=99}}

In Java, beginning at the end of the 10th-century and onwards, more and more Chinese copper coins were imported in greater quantities, as well as Chinese cash and local copies, known as ''pisis''. These coins began to displace the silver alloy coins as small denomination currency. By the mid-14th century, there were so many ''pisis'' in circulation, that the Javanese court recognized them as official currency for tax purposes.{{sfn|Wicks|1992|pp=248-50}}{{sfn|Christie|1996|p=99}} 

==Sumatran coins==
In Sumatra, coins were first minted in the 11th-century. Similar sandalwood flower coins like those in Java were discovered in Sumatra, but more of these were made of gold, [[electrum]], and silver alloys. Several 11th-century sites in Sumatra including [[Barus]], [[Bengkulu]], and [[Muara Jambi]] were abundant in gold coins, while silver is rare. Similar coins were also found in [[South Thailand]]. The Sumatran silver alloy examples are very well made compared with the Javanese silver coins. 

Curiously, no coins have been found at Palembang, said to be the center of the Sriwijayan economy. This suggests that coins may have had a limited role in the early Sriwijayan economy. International trades might have been conducted either through the mechanism known as [[tributary trade]] or in other form known as administered trade. In administered trade system, equivalencies were established between commodities through diplomatic negotiations rather than bargaining.{{sfn|Christie|1996|p=99}}

==Legacy==
The gold [[piloncitos]] of the Philippines are a late offshoot of the Indonesian gold coinage, while the bean-like silver "namo" series of the Malay peninsula was presumably an offshoot of the silver and may have evolved into the bullet (Pod-Duang) coinage of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coin.filipinonumismatist.com/2011/06/piloncitos-treasure-of-philippine.html |title=PILONCITOS: The treasure of Philippine numismatic |last= |first= |date=2013 |website=Filipino Numismatist |publisher=Filipino Numismatist |access-date=November 30, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city had a population of 722,664 according to the 2006 Nigerian census. The name ''Enugu'' is derived from the two [[Igbo language|Igbo]] words ''Énú Ụ́gwụ́'' meaning "hill top" denoting the city's hilly geography. The city was named after [[Ngwo|Enugwu Ngwo]], under which coal was found.

Since the 17th century the location of present-day Enugu has been inhabited by the Nike ({{IPAc-en|n|iː|ˈ|k|eɪ}} {{respell|nee|KAY|'}}) subgroup of the [[Igbo people]]; one of Enugu's neighbourhoods still retains the village's old name [[Ogui]]. In 1900 the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] was established by the colonial administration of the [[British Empire]]. The discovery of coal by the colonialists led to the building of the Eastern Line railway to carry coal from the inland city to the port of [[Port Harcourt]], a city created for this purpose located {{convert|151|mi|km}} south&lt;ref name="easternline"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nigeria handbook |author=Nigeria, Chief Secretary's Office |edition=10 |page=83 |location=Eastern Line |publisher=Government Printer, Lagos|year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; of what was called Enugu Coal Camp. Enugu was then renamed simply ''Enugu'' and developed as one of the few cities in West Africa created from European contact. By 1958 Enugu had over 8,000 coal miners. {{As of|2005}} there are no significant coal mining activities left in the city.

Enugu became the capital of the [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] after Nigeria's independence in 1960; a succession of territorial adjustments in 1967, 1976 and 1991 led to Enugu becoming the capital of what is now Enugu State. On 30 May 1967 Enugu was declared the capital of the short-lived [[Republic of Biafra]]; for this Enugu is known as the "capital of [[Igboland]]." After Enugu was captured by the Nigerian armed forces, the Biafran capital was moved to [[Umuahia]].

Industries in the city include the urban market and [[Bottling line|bottling]] industries. Enugu is also one of the filming locations for directors of the [[Cinema of Nigeria|Nigerian movie industry]], dubbed "Nollywood". Enugu's main airport is the [[Akanu Ibiam International Airport]]. The main educational establishment in the city is the Enugu campus of the [[University of Nigeria, Nsukka|University of Nigeria]] based in [[Nsukka]], a town north of Enugu and in the same state.

==History==

===Early history===
The first settlement in the Enugu area was the small Nike village of Ogui, which was present since the era of the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]].&lt;ref name="town"&gt;Udo, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nike'' in the Igbo language means "with strength or power."&lt;ref name="cap"&gt;Williams, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; It was through [[slave raiding]] that the Nike people acquired most of their lands, which were mostly unsettled. The Nike used slaves for a defence strategy, placing slave camps at the edge of their territories so that it was harder for an enemy to access the free born.&lt;ref&gt;Udo, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nike people were allied to the [[Aro people]] who formed the [[Aro Confederacy]] (1690—1901)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Evolution of the Aro Confederacy in Southeastern Nigeria, 1690–1720: A Theoretical Synthesis of State Formation Process in Africa |first=Apollos |last=Nwauwa |journal=Anthropos |issue=4–6 |publisher=Anthropos Institute |year=1995 |volume=90 |pages=353–364 |issn=0257-9774}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an Igbo organisation that controlled slave trading in the Enugu area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Africa |volume=24 |issue=4 |title=The Ohu System of Slavery in a Northern Ibo Village Group |first=W.R.G. |last=Horton |year=1954 |pages=311–336 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press | doi = 10.2307/1156711 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Aro people who came to trade from [[Arochukwu]] in the south were the [[Hausa people]] who came to trade from the north. The Hausa traders provided horses to the Nike which were used for rituals by the Igbo. Both the Aro and Hausa migrated back and forth to what is now the city of Enugu and were considered foreigners to the area.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite journal|title=Explaining Inter-Ethnic Coexistence and Harmony in Enugu city, Southeastern Nigeria |first=Akachi Cornelius |last=Odoemene |publisher=University of Ibadan |pages=6–8 |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:1alpOUdSuSAJ:iussp2009.princeton.edu/download.aspx%3FsubmissionId%3D90623+Explaining+Inter-Ethnic+Coexistence+and+Harmony+in+Enugu+city,+Southeastern+Nigeria&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgfS7i6J5YxEHceZG9ZdYv4g-HjZ0RCwIB9FM-Vpduh8FvNUlYWg1i3wI35yKyQMX7UIMcLfOqdeP4VfHoq4mAbwHgRo-R3cI2sVQ_QQOggYXkYwXEExnHv_mizVboLDEc03SFo&amp;sig=AHIEtbTZa9w6FJWeoGADzwaG2fxd2m4y9g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 the British began talks with the indigenous people of the land that would become Enugu about its acquisition in order to lay the Eastern Line railway and to build a colliery. The first houses built in the area were in a temporary settlement consisting of Igbo traditional mud housing inhabited by a W.J. Leck and some other Europeans on Milliken Hill. Another settlement known as ''Ugwu Alfred'' (Igbo: Alfred's Hill) or "Alfred's Camp", inhabited by an Alfred Inoma (a leader of indigenous labourers from [[Onitsha]]) and his labourers, was located on a hillside.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name="townhist"&gt;{{cite book|title=Management of environmental problems and hazards in Nigeria |first=H.

The area now known as the Government Reserved Area (GRA) became the European Quarters located north of the Ogbete River; alongside this was a section developed for African residents located south of the river. The built-up area of Enugu comprised these two areas, and by 1917 the city officially gained township status.

In 1938 Enugu became the administrative capital of the [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]]. The number of employed coal miners in Enugu grew from 6,000 (of mostly [[Udi, Enugu|Udi]] men) in 1948 to 8,000 in 1958.

The shooting was right after a period of unrest when miners were angered by the belief that their full pay was being held back by the colliery management, a belief that was pushed by the nationalist press.

Enugu's coal mines are dotted around on the outskirts of the city, a majority of which are closed. The Colliery Camp mines are located in the Iva Valley which is near the neighbouring town of [[Ngwo]] and Hilltop of Enugu.&lt;ref name="townhist"/&gt; The Iva Valley coal mine is accessed through the Iva Valley road linking Enugu with Ngwo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Iva Faults |page=53 |journal=Bulletin |issue=6 |publisher=Geological Survey of Nigeria |year=1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other coal mines are located in the Ogbete and Coal Camp layouts; these mines are located on the periphery of the city near the Iva Valley as well.&lt;ref name="townhist"/&gt;

Architectural design in Enugu's early years was in the hands of the British colonial administration; Enugu's architecture was consequently very European. English cottage housing and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian houses]] were used for housing Europeans and Nigerian colonial civil servants in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century until Europeans started trying to adapt their architecture to the tropical climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African architecture: evolution and transformation |first=Nnamdi |last=Elleh |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=331 |year=1997 |isbn=0-07-021506-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other examples of these European styles are visible in churches of the colonial era, such as the Holy Ghost Cathedral with its [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] stained glass windows depicting Europeans. Enugu's roads were reflective of its British rule; much of the city's narrow roads in the GRA have been preserved dating back to the incorporation of the city itself.&lt;ref name="football2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Enugu |publisher=[[FIFA]] |url=https://www.fifa.com/u17worldcup/destination/cities/city=10116/index.html |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low rent one bedroom flats in Enugu and other Nigerian cities are known as "[[face-me-I-face-you]]" for the way a group of flats face each other and form a square where a compound entrance is led into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Newswatch |volume=14 |issue=1–14 |page=10 |publisher=Newswatch Communications Ltd |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prison stories: a collection of short storie[s] |first=Helon |last=Habila |page=65 |publisher=Epik Books |year=2000 |isbn=978-30397-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two important Igbo traditional festivals take place in Enugu annually; the [[Mmanwu]] festival and the [[New Yam Festival of the Igbo|New yam festival]]. The Mmanwu festival takes place in November and features various types of masquerades that each have a name.

There were a variety of flags flown by ships of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] of 1649–1660.

At sea, royalist ships continued to fly the [[Flag of Great Britain|Union Jack]] of 1606, while on 22 February 1649 the [[Council of State]] decided to send the parliamentary navy an order (signed by [[Oliver Cromwell]] on 23 February) that "the ships at sea in service of the State shall onely beare the red Crosse in a white flag" (viz., the [[flag of England]]).
On 5 March 1649 the Council further ordered "that the Flagg that is to be borne by the Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and Rere-Admiral be that now presented, viz., the Armes of England and Ireland in two severall Escotcheons in a Red Flagg, within a compartment."&lt;ref name="FoTW - UKinter"&gt;cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-inter.html Dave Martucci, 29 September 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
A sole surviving example of a naval flag following this description is kept by the [[National Maritime Museum]] at Greenwich, others having fallen victim to the destruction of Commonwealth symbols at the [[English Restoration|Restoration of Charles II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/g/gb_cmnwth-stdd.jpg image provided ] by Nick Flowers, 3 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Scotland was formally [[The Protectorate|reunited with England]] in 1654. According to Perrin (1922), the saltire of Scotland did not reappear on naval flags of the Commonwealth until 1658.&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, ''British Flags'' (1922), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1658 Cromwell's personal standard as Lord Protector became the 'Standard for the General of his Highnesse fleet', while the Cross-and-Harp jack was replaced by the "Protectorate Jack", consisting of the royal Union Flag with the addition of the Irish Harp at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Flags at Sea'' (1986), p. 19: "In 1658 Cromwell's standard as Lord Protector, in which the cross of St. George was quartered with the cross of St. Andrew and the [[Irish Harp]], and surmounted by an escutcheon with Cromwell's personal coat of arms, became the 'Standard for the General of his Highnesse fleet' and the Cross and Harp jack was replaced by the old Union Jack with the addition of a harp in the centre."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fortunato Bartolommeo de Felice''' (24 August 1723 &amp;ndash; 13 February 1789), 2nd [[Count Panzutti|Comte de Panzutti]], also known as ''Fortuné-Barthélemy de Félice'' and  ''Francesco Placido Bartolomeo De Felice'', was an Italian [[nobleman]], a famed [[author]], [[philosopher]], [[scientist]], and is said to have been one of the most important publishers of the [[18th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donato|first=Clorinda|date=1992|title=The Letters of Fortunato Bartolomeo De Felice to Pietro Verri|journal=MLN|volume=107|issue=1|pages=74–111|doi=10.2307/2904677|jstor=2904677}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered a pioneer of education in [[Switzerland]], and a formative contributor to the [[European Enlightenment]].

==Life==
Fortunato Bartolomeo de Félice was born in [[Rome]] to a [[Naples|Neapolitan]] family as the eldest of six children on 24 August 1723. He was confirmed in 1733 in the parish of St. Celso e Giuliano. At the age of 12, he studied at Rome and Naples under the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], taught by the Franciscan [[Fortunato of Brescia|Fortunato da Brescia]].

On 28 May 1746 he was ordained by papal dispensation, whilst also teaching philosophy. Through his studies at the monastery of San Francesco in Ripa, he discovered a love of Physics, becoming friends with [[Celestino Galiani]]. In 1753, Galiani appointed de Félice chair of Ancient and Modern Geography, and the chair of experimental physics and mathematics at [[Naples University]]. There he became friends with the [[Raimondo di Sangro|Prince Raimondo di Sangro]] who aided him in his translation of the physicist [[John Arbuthnot]]'s works from Latin.

After rescuing the imprisoned [[Count Panzutti|Countess Panzutti]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.cromohs.unifi.it/7_2002/donato.html Rewriting Heresy in the Encyclopedie d'Yverdon 1770–1780&lt;/ref&gt; Félice and his new wife fled to [[Bern]], with the help of his friend [[Albrecht von Haller]], due to religious persecution from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Rome. He then converted to [[Protestantism|Protestant]].

In 1758, he founded with [[:de:Vincenz Bernhard Tscharner]] the Typographic Society of Bern, and was an Italian-speaking ( l'Estratto de la europea letterature until 1762) and a Latin ( l'Excerptum totius Italicae nec non Helveticae literaturae, to 1766) literary and scientific journal.

In 1762, after the death of the Countessa di Panzutti to influenza at Tscharner's residence Château Lansitz, he moved to Yverdon where he founded an educational institute for young people from all over Europe and a printing press. The latter quickly developed into one of the most distinguished in Switzerland, producing the Yverdon Encyclopedia, for which he is now famous. In, 1769 he became a citizen of Yverdon and thus Swiss.

He was married four times and had 13 children: in 1756 to Countess Agnese Arcuato, Countessa di Panzutti (1720-1759)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (whereby his Earldom was received suo jure, confusing Arcuato's late husband is recorded as the first Count Panzutti), in 1759 to Susanne de Wavre Neuchâtel (1737-1769), in 1769 to Louise Marie Perrelet († 1774), and in 1774 to Jeanne Salomé Sinet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He died in [[Yverdon-les-Bains]].

==Work==
De Felice is considered a significant contributor to education in Switzerland. As editor and translator of [[Burlamaqui]]'s ''Principes du Droit Naturel'', his name became synonymous with [[natural law]] throughout Europe. His most important work is the ''[[Yverdon Encyclopedia|Encyclopédie d'Yverdon]]'', which he headed as editor and for which he wrote more than 800 articles. From 1770 to 1780 he published 58 volumes, and as the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of Paris in a new version of the Protestant perspective.

His other work consists of half a dozen educational, philosophical and scientific books. He translated the works of [[René Descartes]], [[d'Alembert]], [[Maupertuis]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] into Italian.

In de Felice's famous printing house, as well as the Encyclopedia, he translated into French works of [[Elie Bertrand]], [[Charles Bonnet]], [[Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui]], [[Albrecht von Haller]], Gabriel Seigneux de Correvon, [[Samuel-Auguste Tissot]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] authors.

The two magazine projects of the Typographic Society Bern aimed at an international exchange of knowledge. This allowed Tscharner and de Felice to create a correspondent network all over Europe.

==Portrait==
An 18th-century depiction of de Félice is held by the [http://art.famsf.org/anonymous/fortunatus-de-felice-19633021935 Achenbach Foundation] in the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco|San Francisco Museum of Fine Arts]]. A Latin and 18th century French inscription by one of his sons, Carolus de Félice reads:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="800">'''George of Resh'aina''' was a 7th-century [[Syriac studies|Syriac]] historian. He was opposed  to [[Maximus the Confessor]], the defender of orthodoxy against [[monotheletism]] and wrote an unfriendly biography of him. This book also provides a glimpse into the events of his time.

:After Maximus went up to Rome,  [[Arabs]] seized control of the islands of the sea and took over [[Cyprus]] and [[Arwad]], ravaging them and taking captives. They gained control over [[Africa]] and subdued almost all the islands of the sea; for, following the wicked Maximus, the wrath of God punished every place which had accepted his error. (George of Resh'aina, ''Syriac Life of Maximus'' XXIII, 312-13 [p. 141])

'''Gligorije "Gliša" Elezović''' ([[Vučitrn]], [[Kosovo Vilayet]], [[Ottoman Empire]] 18 January 1879 — [[Belgrade]], [[Yugoslavia]] 17 October 1960) was a [[Serbia]]n historian and member of the [[Serbian Academy of Science and Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanu.ac.rs/Clanstvo/IstClan.aspx?arg=166 | title=Глигорије ЕЛЕЗОВИЋ, Глиша | publisher=Serbian Academy of Science and Arts | year=2011 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;Also, he was one of the founding members of the [[Serb Democratic League]] (see photograph), headed by [[Bogdan Radenković]]. In 1931 the Serbian Royal Academy (''Srpska kraljevska akademija'') established a Committee for the Collection of Eastern Historical and Literary Sources, which employed  scholars like Gligorije Elezović and Fahim Barjaktarević who were sent to archives in Istanbul to investigate Ottoman sources related to Serbian history. Elezović was a scholar from Skopje (then South Serbia) with a prolific record of publishing Ottoman documents, and trained in Albanian and Turkish languages. He compiled and published ''Rečnik kosovo-metohiskog dijalekta'' (Dictionary of Kosovo-Metohija dialect) in Belgrade in 1932.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3546">'''Guglielmo Audisio''' (1802 at [[Bra, Piedmont]], Italy – 27 September 1882 in Rome) was an Italian Catholic priest and writer.

==Life==
Guglielmo Audisio was born January 27, 1802 and graduated with degrees in philosophy and theology from the University of Turin. After teaching for four years in the seminary of Bra, in 1837 he was appointed by King [[Charles Albert|Carlo Alberto]], Dean of the Ecclesiastical Academy of Superga, where he taught sacred eloquence, moral theology, canon law and institutions of Roman law. He was expelled from this office because he was opposed to the Piedmontese Government. Audisio was a fervent upholder of papal and Catholic rights against the political liberalism of Piedmont.

In 1848, along with [[Giacomo Margotti]], he founded the newspaper, ''Armonia'' ("Harmony") in Turin. It was for this reason that he fell a victim to the anti-clerical influence which had deprived him of his post at Superga.&lt;ref name=Benigni&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02070b.htm Benigni, Umberto. "Guglielmo Audisio." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 9 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He then went to Rome, where [[Pope Pius IX]] appointed him professor at the Roman University, where he taught the law of nature and of nations. He was also appointed Canon of the [[Vatican Basilica]]. In Rome Audisio joined the liberal reformist Italian ecclesiastics, such as Monsignor Liverani, and tried to reconcile the new political and cultural needs of his time with Catholic tradition. He urged Catholics to exercise their right and duty against political revolutionaries and [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzini]], rejecting all forms of abstention.&lt;ref name=Corvino/&gt;

At the time of the [[First Vatican Council]] he was suspected of [[Gallicanism]], to the grief of his patron Pius IX, and his work on political and religious society in the nineteenth century was condemned by the Church. Audisio submitted to the condemnation of his book, but he warmly protested against the accusation of heterodoxy and disobedience.&lt;ref name=Benigni/&gt;

==Works==
In 1839, in Turin, he published a manual of sacred eloquence, his most noted work, which was issued in eight Italian and a French edition.&lt;ref name=Corvino&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/guglielmo-audisio_(Dizionario_Biografico)/&amp;prev=search Corvino, Francesco. "Guglielmo Audisio", ''Dizionario Biografico'', Vol.4, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also devoted himself to historical studies, especially relating to the history of the papacy.

The works of Audisio include:

*"Lezioni di Eloquenza Sacra" (several editions); 
*"Juris Naturae et Gentium Publici Fundamenta" (Rome 1852); 
*"Idea storica della diplomazia ecclesiastica (Rome, 1864); 
*"Storia religiosa e civile dei papi" (5 vols., Rome, 1860); 
*"Sistema politica e religiosa di Federico II e di Pietro della Vigna" (1866); 
*"Della società politica e religiosa rispetto al secolo XIX" (Florence, 1876, condemned by decree of the Holy Office, April 1877;
*"Vita di Pio IX."

'''Helen C. Evans''' is an [[United States of America|American]] art historian and curator specializing in [[Byzantine art]].

She has worked for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] since 1991 and was co-curator along with William D. Wixom of the 1997 Byzantine exhibition there. She became a scholar devoted to the documentation of Byzantine art because according to her, "Byzantine art is underrepresented because Byzantine history slowly disappeared from the way we look at the world. The empire ended at roughly the same moment that [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] found the New World. When we do an exhibition like ''Interwoven Globe'' at the Met, it starts at 1500 and we don't look at the fact that [[Byzantium]] was on one of the great trade routes of the previous millennium and a half—or several millennia in fact. Until Columbus, you did not reach the spices of the orient; you did not reach the silks of China, without crossing the Eastern Mediterranean. ...When most academic scholarship really begins, Byzantium has been subsumed in the [[Ottoman Empire]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/2014/helen-evans-interview 2014 interview] on the occasion of winning the [[Iran's Book of the Year Awards|Iran Book of the Year]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">A '''Heritage Overlay''' or '''HO''' is one of a number of [[planning scheme overlay]]s contained in the [[Victorian Planning Provisions]], for use in [[planning scheme]]s in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], Australia.  The heritage overlay schedule of each [[Local Government Areas of Victoria|local government]] planning scheme lists sites of local and state significance ([[Victorian Heritage Register]]) but does not include sites on the [[Australian National Heritage List]].

The Heritage Overlay is used to protect sites that have [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] value, meaning that individual buildings or whole urban precincts may be covered. The protection afforded by a Heritage Overlay varies in each instance, though the controls apply to built structures and their associated land. The minimum level of protection is afforded by the mere existence of the overlay and means that any work at all to the building or site will require a [[planning permit]], ensuring that a higher level of scrutiny automatically occurs, regardless of any specific control measures cited.  Exemptions from permits can be achieved via a site specific exclusion or an incorporated plan listed in the schedule to the overlay.

Each planning scheme will have a set of maps which indicate the location of overlay controls. Associated with the maps is a schedule listing every individual overlay in that planning scheme according to the following criteria:
* Planning Scheme map reference (HO+number)
* Address of building or name of precinct
* External paint controls
* Internal alteration controls
* Tree controls 
* Exemptions for certain outbuildings or fencing
* Victorian Heritage Register listing
* Prohibitions on uses
* Reference to other parts of the Planning Scheme
* Aboriginal heritage 

An easy to follow description of how to read a heritage overlay and the different related documents is found at the [http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/pbs/statutory-planning/overlays/heritage-planning-protection.aspx City of Ballarat Website - What is a Heritage Overlay].

{{Bulgarians}}
The '''History of the Bulgarian language''' can be divided into three major periods:

* [[Old Bulgarian language|Old Bulgarian]] (from the late 9th until the 12th century);
* [[Middle Bulgarian language|Middle Bulgarian]] (from the 12th century to the 16th century);
* [[Bulgarian language|Modern Bulgarian]] (since the 16th century).

Bulgarian as a written [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic language]] that dates back to the end of the 9th century.

==Old Bulgarian==
{{main|Old Bulgarian language}}
[[File:Old Bulgarian Alphabet.png|thumb|Early [[Cyrillic Alphabet]].]]
Old Bulgarian was the first literary period in the development of the language. It was a highly [[synthetic language]] with a rich [[declension]] system as attested by a number of manuscripts from the late 10th and the early 11th centuries. Those originate mostly from the [[Preslav Literary School|Preslav]] and the [[Ohrid Literary School]], although smaller literary centers also contributed to the tradition. The language became a medium for rich scholarly activity &amp;mdash; chiefly in the late 9th and the early 10th century &amp;mdash; with writers such as [[Constantine of Preslav]], [[John Exarch]], [[Clement of Ohrid]], [[Chernorizetz Hrabar]] and [[Naum of Preslav]] (Naum of Ohrid). Most of their works are preserved through later copies, many of which are from neighboring Balkan countries or Russia.

===Name===
The name “Old Bulgarian” was extensively used in the late 19th and the first half of the 20th century synonymously with [[Old Church Slavonic]] to describe the literary language of a number of Slavic peoples from the 9th until the 12th century. Although "Old Bulgarian" is still used in a number of sources with the meaning "Old Church Slavonic", there is a growing tendency for the name to be applied only to the language of manuscripts from the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] (Bulgarian editions of [[Old Church Slavonic]]), excluding manuscripts from other editions.

===Traits===

Old Bulgarian is characterized by a number of phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and lexical traits (some of which are shared with other Slavic languages and some, such as the reflexes of *tj ([t']) and *dj ([d']), are typical only for Bulgarian):

*phonetic:
** very wide articulation of the ''[[Yat]]'' vowel (Ѣ); still preserved in the archaic Bulgarian dialect of the [[Rhodope mountains]];
** Proto-Slavonic reflexes of *tj ({{IPA|[tʲ]}}) and *dj ({{IPA|[dʲ]}}):

==Middle Bulgarian==
{{main|Middle Bulgarian language}}
In the period between 12th and 15th centuries the structure of the language changed quite radically. Few of these changes can still be observed in contemporary written records, thanks to the tendency towards archaicism driven by a desire to preserve the purity of the Cyrilo-Methodian tradition. 
[[Image:Ivan ALexander and his family Tetraevangelia.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A miniature from the [[Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander|Tetraevangelia]] depicting the tsar and the royal family]]
*The phonetic features of Middle Bulgarian include:
** Changes to the nasal vowels, which lose their nasal element in the majority of the Bulgarian dialects. The frequent confusion of the letters for the front and back nasal vowels suggests that the two vowels were phonetically very similar.
** As in other Balkan Slavic languages /ы/ becomes /и/ (although it is thought this change occurred later in Bulgarian).
** The [[yat]] vowel falls together with /e/ in Western dialects, with some manuscripts confusing it not only with e but also with the front nasal letter. In Eastern dialects the situation is more complex, as is reflected in the treatment of jat in the modern literary language (based on the Eastern pronunciation, i.e. [ja] when under stress and before a hard consonant, [ɛ] everywhere else).
** As for consonants, the East/West distinctions of hardness and softness become more clearly defined, with the hardening of consonants occurring more in the West while the Eastern dialects preserve the opposition hard/soft for most consonants.

The language underwent some morphological changes as well: starting from the time of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] a confusion of case endings is to be observed along with the increasing use of prepositions in syntax. This linguistic tendency resulted in the gradual loss of the complex Slavic case system, rendering [[East South Slavic languages|Bulgarian and Macedonian]] significantly more analytic than their relatives. Scholars dispute whether this has anything to do with phonetic changes, such as the confusion of the nasals, or whether it is purely due to the influence of [[Balkan language area|grammar developments across the Balkans]].
Also dating from the [[High Middle Ages]] is the use of the prefixes по- and най- to indicate comparative and superlative degrees of the adjective.

The earliest signs of post-positive definite article dates from the early 13th century with the Dobreyshevo Gospel (Добрейшево Евангелие) where the construction "злыотъ рабъ" ("the evil person") was used. Old Bulgarian relative pronouns иже, яже and еже ("which," masculine, feminine, neuter) were at that time replaced by interrogative pronouns with the suffix -то: който, която, което.

A new class of verbs developed with stems in -a-, conjugating like the old [[athematic]] verbs, e.g. имам, имаш, etc., (to have). Another characteristic of this period is the emergence of a shortened form of the future tense marker - "ще" in modern literary language and "че," "ке," and "ше" in dialect forms. The marker originates from the 3rd person singular present tense form of the verb "hotjeti" - to want). The Renarrative verb form possibly appeared around the end of the Second Bulgarian Empire, though it could also be attributed to subsequent Turkish influence.

==Modern Bulgarian==

Modern Bulgarian dates from developments beginning after the 16th century; particularly grammar and syntax changes in the 18th and 19th centuries. Present-day written Bulgarian language was standardized on the basis of the 19th-century Bulgarian [[vernacular]] from [[Balkan dialects of Bulgarian|Central Eastern Bulgaria]].

Bulgarian, along with the closely related [[Macedonian language]] (collectively forming the [[South Slavic languages#Eastern group|Eastern group of South Slavic]]), has several characteristics that set it apart from all other [[Slavic languages]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|title=The Languages of the World, 3rd ed.|publisher=Routlege|year=2002|quote=Macedonian is closely related to Bulgarian and is considered by some to be merely a dialect of that language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=_kn5c5dJmNUC |page=431 }} |title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction Blackwell textbooks in linguistics|first=Benjamin W.|last=Fortson|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=1-4051-8896-0| page= 431 |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes include the elimination of [[grammatical case|case declension]], the development of a suffixed [[definite article]] (see [[Balkan language area]]), and the lack of a verb [[infinitive]], but it retains and has further developed the [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] verb system. Various [[evidentiality|evidential]] verb forms exist to express unwitnessed, retold, and doubtful action.

'''Sir Isaac Pitman''' (4 January 1813 – 22 January 1897),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22322 "Pitman, Sir Isaac (1813–1897)"] by Tony D. Triggs in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], online edition. Retrieved 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; was a teacher of the [[:English language]] who developed the most widely used system of [[shorthand]], known now as [[Pitman shorthand]]. He first proposed this in ''Stenographic Soundhand'' in 1837. He was also the vice-president of the [[Vegetarian Society]]. Pitman was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1894.

== Background ==
Pitman was born in [[Trowbridge]], Wiltshire in England. One of his cousins was [[Abraham Laverton]]. In 1831 he had five months' training at the Training College of the [[British and Foreign School Society]], which was sufficient to qualify him as a teacher. He started teaching at [[Barton-upon-Humber]], Lincolnshire. In 1835 he married a widow, and moved in 1836 to [[Wotton-under-Edge]], Gloucestershire, where he started his own school. In 1839 he moved to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], where he opened a small school.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/Media/CHC%20Images/Vol%2007%20-%2007.%20Ward%20-%20Isaac%20Pitman%20and%20the%20Fourth%20Phonetic%20Institute.pdf |title=Isaac Pitman and the Fourth Phonetic Institute |author=Owen Ward |accessdate=2 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004141107/https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/Media/CHC%20Images/Vol%2007%20-%2007.%20Ward%20-%20Isaac%20Pitman%20and%20the%20Fourth%20Phonetic%20Institute.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1851 census he appears in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] aged 38, living with his wife, Mary, aged 58, born in [[Newark-on-Trent]], Nottinghamshire. He married Isabella Masters in 1861, and he appears in the 1871 census, aged 58, with his new wife Isabella, aged 46.

== Spelling reform and shorthand ==
Isaac Pitman was a lifelong advocate of [[English language spelling reform|spelling reform for the English language]], producing many pamphlets during his lifetime on spelling reform. His motto was "time saved is life gained".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anniversaries of 2013|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9770133/Anniversaries-of-2013.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the outcomes of his interest in spelling reform was the creation of his system of phonetic shorthand which he first published in 1837, in a pamphlet titled ''Sound-Hand''. Among the examples in this pamphlet, were [[Psalm 100]], the [[Lord's Prayer]], and Swedenborg's ''Rules of Life''.

By 1843 his business of preparing and publishing had expanded sufficiently to give up teaching, and to set up his own printing press, as well as compositing and a binding.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;

In 1844 he published ''Phonotypy'', his major work on spelling reform. In 1845 he published the first version of the ''[[English Phonotypic Alphabet]]''.

In the 1881 census his name is spelled phonetically as Eisak Pitman. In the 1891 census he is again listed as Isaac, but his birthplace has moved to Bath.

== Publishing ==
In 1886 Pitman went into partnerships with his sons Alfred and Ernest to form Isaac Pitman and Sons. In the same year the millionth copy of the Phonographic Teacher was sold in Great Britain. Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons was to become one of the world's leading educational publishers and training businesses with offices in London, Bath, New York City, [[Melbourne]], [[Johannesburg]], Toronto and Tokyo. The publishing division was bought by rival Pearson Plc in 1985. The training business evolved into two separate businesses: [[Pitman Training Group|Pitman Training]] and JHP Training (now learndirect).

== Distance learning ==

The first distance education course in the modern sense was provided by Sir Isaac Pitman in the 1840s, who taught a system of shorthand by mailing texts transcribed into shorthand on postcards and receiving transcriptions from his students in return for correction. The element of student feedback was a crucial innovation of Pitman's system. This scheme was made possible by the introduction of uniform postage rates across Britain in 1840.

== Personal life ==
Isaac Pitman was fervently [[Swedenborgianism|Swedenborgian]]. Not only did he read ''The Writings'' of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] daily, he also devoted much time and energy to educating the world about them. He published and distributed books and tracts by and about Swedenborg. Among the authors he encouraged was [[Thomas Child (minister)|Thomas Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Child, Thomas|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitman was active in the local [[The New Church|New Church]] congregation in Bath while living on [[Royal Crescent]].&lt;ref name="lowndes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowndes|first=William|title=The Royal Crescent in Bath|publisher=Redcliffe Press|year=1981|isbn=978-0-905459-34-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the founding members, when this congregation was formed in 1841. He served as president of this society from 1887 to his death in 1897. His contribution to this church was honoured by the congregation with a [[stained glass]] window depicting the golden [[cherub]] in the temple of wisdom described in Swedenborg's ''True Christian Religion'' No. 508.&lt;ref&gt;''Bath Herrold,'' 6 September 1909&lt;/ref&gt; The window was dedicated on 5 September 1909.

His memorial plaque on the north wall of [[Bath Abbey]] reads, "His aims were steadfast, his mind original, his work prodigious, the achievement world-wide. His life was ordered in service to God and duty to man."

In about 1837 Pitman discontinued the use of all alcoholic beverages, and in about 1838 he became a vegetarian – both lifelong practices to which, in a famous{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} letter to ''[[The Times]]'' (London), he attributed his lifelong excellent health and his ability to work long hours.

Isaac Pitman is the grandfather of Sir [[James Pitman]], who developed the [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]].

His great-grandson John Hugh Pitman was appointed an OBE in 2010 for services to Vocational Training.

'''John Victor Luce''' (21 May 1920 – 11 February 2011) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] classicist, former professor and emeritus [[Fellow (college)|Fellow]] of [[Classics]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Trinity vice-provost dies|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0212/1224289634573.html| accessdate=14 February 2011 | newspaper=[[Irish Times]] | date=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the College's [[Public Orator]] between 1971 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=John Victor Luce, Public Orator 1972–2005 | url=http://www.tcd.ie/Classics/jvl/ | publisher= [[Trinity College Dublin]] |location=[[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]] | accessdate=10 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luce entered Trinity in 1938 to read Classics, and was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in his first year, a highly unusual achievement. He took a double Moderatorship in Classics and [[Philosophy]] and was awarded Gold Medals for both subjects. He was Auditor of the [[College Classical Society]] in 1942–43. He was elected a Fellow of Trinity in 1948 and served as [[Erasmus Smith|Erasmus Smith's]] Professor of Oratory until 1989.

John Luce was the son of [[A. A. Luce|Arthur Aston Luce]], the long serving fellow of TCD, nephew of Gordon Hannington Luce, the noted scholar of Burmese and Asian History and Bloomsbury group member, first cousin of Rex Warner, classicist and author of novels such as the Airodrome.

An avid sportsman in his youth represented Ireland in Hockey in the 1940s, and also played Squash and Cricket. He was a keen Chess player and played for Rathmines Chess Club in the Leinster Leagues.

'''José Amador de los Ríos y Serrano''' (30 April 1818 &amp;ndash; 17 February 1878) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] intellectual, primarily a historian and archaeologist of [[Art history|art]] and [[Literary history|literature]]. He was a graduate in history of the [[Complutense University of Madrid]].
[[File:Museo Arqueológico Nacional - 1990-123-11 - José Amador de los Ríos.jpg|thumbnail]]
In 1844 he was the secretary of the Comisión Central de Monumentos. He was co-director with Antonio de Zabaleta of the ephemeral ''Boletín Español de Arquitectura'', the first Spanish journal dedicated exclusively to architecture.&lt;ref&gt;José Enrique García Melero (2002), ''Literatura española sobre Artes Plásticas: Bibliografía aparecida en España entre los siglos XVI y XVIII'' (Encuentro), 176.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in publication from 1 June to December 1846. In 1852 he published the complete works of [[Íñigo López de Mendoza]]. It was Amador de los Ríos who first used the term ''[[mudejarismo]]'' to describe a style of architecture in 1859.

In 1861 he published the first volume of ''Historia crítica de la literatura española'', the first general history of Spanish literature written in Spain.&lt;ref name=gies&gt;David Thatcher Gies (2004), ''The Cambridge History of Spanish Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 28&amp;ndash;30&lt;/ref&gt; It was to remain incomplete. Ideologically Amador de los Ríos, a [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Romanticism|romantic]], conceives of Spain as a unit, at once [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Castilian language|Castilian]], a [[constitutional monarchy]] (thought it was not one yet) united with its past by an ''idea luminosa'' (luminous idea).&lt;ref name=gies/&gt; Countering the foreign historians who regard medieval Spain as a backwater, he defends Spanish literature as the foremost among those which appeared after the [[Fall of Rome]]. Though he only covered the [[Middle Ages]], he demonstrated that he regarded [[Spanish American literature]] as part of the Spanish tradition. In another work, ''Historia social, política y religiosa de los judíos de España'', he accepts the Spanish [[Jewish literature]] as part of the tradition, since it "bloomed" in Spanish soil.&lt;ref name=gies/&gt; Unlike [[Adolf de Castro]], however, he did not condemn the [[Spanish Inquisition]].

The '''Lithuanian Wars of Independence''', also known as the '''Freedom Struggles''' ({{lang-lt|Laisvės kovos}}), refer to three wars [[Lithuania]] fought defending its independence at the end of [[World War I]]: with [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik]] forces (December 1918 – August 1919), [[Bermontians]] (June 1919 – December 1919), and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (August 1920 – November 1920). The wars delayed international recognition of independent Lithuania and the formation of civil institutions.

==Background==
After the [[Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Lithuanian National Revival]] emerged during the 19th century and the movement to establish an independent [[nation-state]] intensified during the early 20th century. During World War I, Lithuanian territory was occupied by [[German Empire|Germany]] from 1915 until the war ended in November 1918.

On February 16, 1918, the [[Council of Lithuania]] [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|declared the re-establishment of independence]] from all previous legal bonds with other states. The declaration asserted the right to [[self-determination]], meaning the creation of a state within ethnic Lithuanian territories. The publication of the Act of Independence was initially suppressed by the German occupation forces, but on March 23, 1918, the Germans acknowledged the declaration; their plans had shifted to the establishment of a network of satellite countries ([[Mitteleuropa]]). However, Germany did not allow the Council to establish a Lithuanian military force, police force, or civic institutions. On November 11, 1918 [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Germany signed an armistice on the Western Front]] and officially lost the war and control over Lithuania. The first national government, led by [[Augustinas Voldemaras]], was formed. Voldemaras issued a declaration that Lithuania did not need a military force, as it was not planning to engage in warfare, and that only a small militia was needed. This view was unrealistic, since military conflicts soon erupted.

==Formation of the army==
[[File:Alytus war memorial.jpg|right|thumb|300px|War memorial in [[Alytus]] to Lithuanians who died in the Lithuanian Wars of Independences]]
The first legislative act creating an army was passed on November 23, 1918. Its development and organization moved slowly due to lack of funding, arms, ammunition, and experienced military commanders. On December 20 [[Antanas Smetona]] and Voldemaras went to Germany to request assistance. This arrived at the end of 1918, when Germany paid the Lithuanian government one hundred million [[German mark|mark]]s in reparations; the organization of the new Lithuanian army proceeded under the auspices of the German army, which was withdrawing in stages. However, the departure of both leaders created a difficult domestic situation. The [[Council of Lithuania]] released Voldemaras' cabinet; [[Mykolas Sleževičius]] became Prime Minister of Lithuania and formed a Cabinet on 26 December 1918. Perceiving an imminent threat to the state, he issued a proclamation several days later. Directed at Lithuanian men, the proclamation invited volunteers to join a force to defend the country.

Lithuanian volunteers who agreed to join the military force were promised free land. Fulfilling its Armistice obligation to support Lithuanian independence, Germany initially tried to organize a volunteer force from units remaining in Lithuanian territory, but those attempts failed. [[Crimp (recruitment)|Crimp]]s were sent to Germany to recruit volunteers. A division of volunteers was soon formed, who were paid 5 marks per day plus 30 marks per month. The first units began arriving in Lithuania during January 1919, although some of them were sent away because they were in a poor condition. By the end of January, 400 volunteers were stationed in [[Alytus]], [[Jonava]], [[Kėdainiai]], and [[Kaunas]]. They formed the basis for the 46th Saxonian division, renamed in March to the Southern Lithuanian Saxonian Volunteer Brigade. The brigade consisted of the 18th, 19th, and 20th regiments. The last of these German troops, also known as [[Freikorps]], would leave Lithuania during July 1919.

After successful attempts at mustering a voluntary force to defend Lithuanian territories, [[mobilization]] was begun on March 5, 1919 to expand the Lithuanian armed forces. It applied to men born between 1897 and 1899. At the end of summer 1919, the Lithuanian army numbered about 8,000 men. During the battles that followed, 1,700 Lithuanian volunteers died, more than 2,600 were injured, and 800 were [[missing in action]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. Historian [[Alfonsas Eidintas]] cites the total deaths as 1,444.&lt;ref name=eidintas1&gt;{{cite book|last=Eidintas|first=Alfonsas|authorlink=Alfonsas Eidintas|others=Edvardas Tuskenis, Vytautas Zalys|title=Lithuania in European Politics|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_i8yez8udgC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=eidintas+wars+independence&amp;source=web&amp;ots=WK7VvZMI-q&amp;sig=8cN2yps2e5N7aCK2XFAtsM2mFXA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA34,M1 | isbn=978-0-312-22458-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PL-RU war 1919 phase I.svg|thumb|300px|Advance of Bolshevik forces (red arrows). The red line shows the Bolshevik front in January 1919.]]
As revolution broke out in Germany, the German government withdrew support for the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], which had ceded Lithuania independence from Soviet Russia on November 5, 1918.  Meanwhile, the Soviet Russian government renounced the treaty on November 13.&lt;ref name=eidintas1/&gt; The [[Bolsheviks]] attempted to conquer Lithuania from the east as part of their [[World revolution|global proletarian revolution]]. Elsewhere, the treaty of 1918 had also ceded independence to [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the Near East, and [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] in Eastern Europe.  The Soviet Union attacked these nations as well.  But whereas they did fall, Lithuania and Poland would not.

On December 8, 1918, a temporary revolutionary government in the capital city of [[Vilnius]] was formed, consisting solely of members of the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]]. [[Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas]] became its chairman. The following day a workers' [[Soviet (council)|soviet]] was formed and declared that it had taken control of Vilnius. However, Voldemaras' government and a Polish committee also declared their control of the city at the same time. The Germans finally abandoned Vilnius on December 31, 1918. On January 5, 1919 the [[Red Army]] took it and advanced further in the west. Local Polish paramilitary platoons led by general [[Władysław Wejtko]] fought the Red Army in Vilnius for five days; the Lithuanian government had left Vilnius along with the regular German Army. On January 1, 1919 local communists in the town of [[Šiauliai]], about 200 kilometers west of Vilnius, rebelled and created a 1,000-man "Samogitian Regiment"; when the Red Army entered the town on January 15 Soviet power already existed there. On January 18 the Soviets and Germans signed a treaty and designated a demarcation line that barred Bolshevik forces from directly attacking [[Kaunas]], Lithuania's second-largest city. The Red Army would need to attack through [[Alytus]] or [[Kėdainiai]].

German volunteers led by [[Rüdiger von der Goltz]] arrived in Lithuania, took up positions along the [[Hrodna]]&amp;ndash;[[Kaišiadorys]]&amp;ndash;[[Kaunas]] line, and helped the Lithuanian forces, commanded by [[Jonas Variakojis]], to stop the Red Army advance near Kėdainiai. On February 8, during a reconnaissance mission, the first Lithuanian soldier to die in the wars, [[Povilas Lukšys (1886)|Povilas Lukšys]], was killed near [[Taučiūnai]]. On February 10 the joint forces captured [[Šėta]] and forced the Red Army to retreat. The success of this operation lifted the Lithuanian army's morale. During the first half of February 18, the regiment of Saxon volunteers stationed between [[Kaišiadorys]] and [[Žiežmariai]] engaged in skirmishes on their line, and the joint force captured [[Jieznas]] in an operation held between February 10 and February 13. After this setback the Bolshevik 7th Riflemen Regiment began to disintegrate, and many soldiers deserted. The regiment could have been completely destroyed, if the Germans had not refused to pursue the retreating units.

On February 12 Bolshevik forces attacked [[Alytus]]. Lithuanian 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th companies of the 1st Infantry Regiment had to withstand pressure from the Red Army, while members of the German units left their posts. During this battle the first Lithuanian officer to die in the wars was killed: [[Antanas Juozapavičius]], the commander of the 1st Infantry Regiment. After the loss of their commander the regiment began retreating towards [[Marijampolė]]. On the night of February 14–15, German forces retook Alytus.

Towards the end of 1918 the officer [[Povilas Plechavičius]], together with his brother Aleksandras, began organizing [[Partisans (military)|partisans]] in [[Skuodas]]. On February 9 the partisans took an oath, and on February 16 they paraded in the town square. A partisan unit commanded by army officers was also organized in [[Joniškėlis]].

[[File:PL-RU war 1919 phase II.svg|thumb|300px|The advance of Polish (blue arrows), Lithuanian (dark purple arrows), Latvian/German (white arrows from west), and Estonian/Latvian (white arrows from north) forces. The blue line shows the Polish front in May 1920.]]
The movement of the Bolsheviks towards [[East Prussia]] worried Germany, and they sent volunteers (Brigade Shaulen) commanded by General [[Rüdiger von der Goltz]] to free the railroad line linking [[Liepāja]], [[Mažeikiai]], [[Radviliškis]], and [[Kėdainiai]]. At the end of February the Lithuanian partisans, supported by German artillery, took Mažeikiai and [[Seda, Lithuania|Seda]], and pursued Bolsheviks to [[Kuršėnai]]. On February 27, 1919, German volunteers supported by Plechavičius' partisans and Joniškėlis' partisans, defeated the ''Samogitian regiment'' in a battle near [[Luokė]]. By that time the regiment had been incorporated into the Red Army's 2nd Latvian International Riflemen Division. On the same day the [[Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Litbel) was declared. On March 7, 1919 the Germans took the town of Kuršėnai, on March 11 - Šiauliai, on March 12 - Radviliškis. On March 14 Lithuanian partisans and German forces captured [[Šeduva]]. The German troops were active in Lithuania until May 31, 1919.

In Kėdainiai a stationed volunteer regiment had secured its positions; in March it started small ''expeditions'' into nearby towns. Local volunteers with good knowledge of the location succeeded in driving Bolshevik supporters out of [[Ramygala]], [[Truskava]], and [[Krekenava]], but these areas were soon recaptured by the Bolsheviks. These expeditions into several towns were successfully carried out until the end of March. As a reward for its successful operations, the volunteer regiment was given a name on March 22: the ''Separate Panevėžys Volunteer Regiment''. Due to a succession of losses, the Bolshevik forces stationed in [[Panevėžys]] and [[Kupiškis]] rebelled, and were quelled only by a Red Army Division from neighboring [[Latvia]]. The Bolshevik morale underwent deeper declines, and between March 19 and March 24 their forces left Panevėžys. Lithuanian forces entered the city on March 26, but the Red Army retook it on April 4.

In April the Lithuanian army began moving towards Vilnius, taking [[Žąsliai]] and [[Vievis]], but their advances stopped on April 8. In the meantime, on April 19, the Polish army had taken Vilnius from the Bolsheviks and forced them to withdraw their left wing from territories south of the [[Neris River]]. The shortened front line that resulted allowed Lithuania to send stronger forces to northeastern Lithuania, and carry out operations there. By May 3, the Separate Panevėžys Volunteer Regiment, supported by the 18th regiment of Saxonian volunteers, had secured [[Siesikai]], [[Atkočiai]], and [[Deltuva]]. They had also captured [[Ukmergė]]; Lithuanian units were the first to enter the city.

In the beginning of March the mobilization began and Lithuanian forces increased their numbers. At the end of April the Lithuanian army's chain of command was reformed. General [[Silvestras Žukauskas]] was designated Chief of [[Staff (military)|Staff]], and on May 7 he assumed command of the entire Lithuanian army. A complete reorganization took place over the next new weeks, and the strengthened Lithuanian forces were now ready to push the Red Army back. Žukauskas decided to concentrate his Lithuanian forces in two areas. The first brigade, centered in the [[Ukmergė]]&amp;ndash;[[Utena]]&amp;ndash;[[Zarasai]] region, was called the ''Vilkmergė Group''; the second brigade, centered in the Kėdainiai-Panevėžys-Rokiškis region, was called the ''Panevėžys Group''. Operations planning was undertaken during the middle of May.

On May 17 the reorganized army carried out its first operation, capturing the town of [[Kurkliai]]. Preparations were made for an advance on [[Anykščiai]], which was taken on May 19, along with [[Skiemonys]] and [[Alanta]]. On May 22 the Lithuanian forces launched an advance on [[Utena]], reaching the village of [[Diktarai]]. The initiative was met by a counterattack, and the Lithuanian forces retreated. The attack was stopped for several days, and line Alanta-Skiemonys-Anykščiai was taken. A drive towards [[Utena, Lithuania|Utena]] started on May 31, and the city was secured on June 2.

The Panevėžys Group launched a drive towards [[Panevėžys]] on May 18. On May 19 the brigade secured [[Panevėžys]] and [[Raguva]]; on May 20 its field staff moved to Panevėžys. The city withstood a Bolshevik attack that took place on May 21 and 22. On May 24 Žukauskas ordered both groups to push farther. The Panevėžys Group advanced towards [[Kupiškis]] and secured [[Subačius]] on May 25. On May 30 they took [[Rokiškis]]; Bolshevik forces left [[Kupiškis]] on the night of May 30–31, and Lithuania secured that city on June 1. The advance continued, and on the 10th of June Lithuanian forces reached the territory controlled by Latvian partisans (Green Guard) and supplied them with munitions.

The Lithuanian successes continued, and by the end of August, the Bolsheviks were defeated near Zarasai. On October 2 Lithuania took Griva, a suburb of [[Daugavpils]]. The Lithuanian forces stopped at the [[Daugava River]] near the border with Latvia, and the front line stabilized. The short-lived [[Litbel]] government was discontinued.

On July 12, 1920, Lithuania signed a [[Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920|peace treaty]] with the [[Russian SFSR]]. Russia recognized Lithuania's independence and its right to the [[Vilnius Region]]. This treaty was not recognized by Poland or by the short-lived [[Belarusian National Republic]]. Several historians have asserted that despite its treaty with Russia, Lithuania was very close to being taken over by local communist forces that were backed by the Bolsheviks. In this view, it was only the Polish victory against the Soviets in the [[Polish–Soviet War]] that disrupted these plans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Erich Senn]], "The Formation of the Lithuanian Foreign Office, 1918&amp;ndash;1921", ''Slavic Review'', Vol. 21, No. 3. (Sep., 1962), pp. 500-507.: ''"A Bolshevik victory over the Poles would have certainly meant a move by the Lithuanian communists, backed by the Red Army, to overthrow the Lithuanian nationalist government... Kaunas, in effect, paid for its independence with the loss of Vilna."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Erich Senn, ''Lietuvos valstybes...'' p. 163: ''"If the Poles didn't stop the Soviet attack, Lithuania would fell to the Soviets... Polish victory costs the Lithuanians the city of Wilno, but saved Lithuania itself."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antanas Ruksa]], ''Kovos del Lietuvos nepriklausomybes'', t.3, p.417: ''"In summer 1920 Russia was working on a communist revolution in Lithuania... From this disaster Lithuania was saved by the [[miracle at Vistula]]."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Rudokas, [http://www.pogon.lt/_NCZ_ARCHYVAS/519/na_lamach.html Józef Piłsudski - wróg niepodległości Litwy czy jej wybawca?] (Polish translation of a Lithuanian article) "Veidas", 25 08 2005: ''[Piłsudski] "defended both Poland and Lithuanian from Soviet domination"''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bermontians, named for their leader [[Pavel Bermondt-Avalov]] and formally known as the [[West Russian Volunteer Army]], were a mixed German-Russian army. The army included Russian [[prisoners of war]], released by the [[German Empire]] after promising to fight against the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Civil War]], and [[Freikorps in the Baltic|members of the Freikorps]], stationed in Latvia and Lithuania after Germany lost the war.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; The official goal of this army was to fight Bolsheviks along with [[Aleksandr Kolchak]]'s forces, but its actual agenda was the retention of German power in the territories they had taken during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lietuvos istorija 11–12 klasėms | first=Rūstis |last=Kamuntavičius |author2=Vaida Kamuntavičienė |author3=Remigijus Civinskas |author4=Kastytis Antanaitis  |year=2001 |publisher=Vaga |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-415-01502-7 |pages=354–355|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the Bermontians operated mostly in [[Latvia]], but in June 1919, they crossed the Lithuanian–Latvian border and took the town of [[Kuršėnai]]. At that time the Lithuanians were engaged in battles with the Bolsheviks and could only issue diplomatic protests.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; By October, the Bermontians had taken considerable territories in western Lithuania ([[Samogitia]]), including the cities of [[Šiauliai]], [[Biržai]], and [[Radviliškis]]. After they had annexed a town, the Bermontians enforced a rule that only the [[Russian language]] could be used to conduct administration.&lt;ref name=eid/&gt; They became notorious for robbing and looting the local populace, who began organizing local [[partisan (military)|partisan]] groups.

During October 1919, Lithuanian forces attacked the Bermontians, achieving an important victory on November 21 and 22 near Radviliškis, a major railway center. The Lithuanians collected significant spoils of war there, including 30 airplanes and 10 cannons.&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title=Bermondtists | year=1970–1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapočius | volume=I | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id={{LCC | 74-114275}} | pages=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later clashes were stopped by the intervention of an [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] representative, the French General [[Henri Niessel]], who oversaw the withhdrawal of German troops.&lt;ref name=eid&gt;{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys |author3=Alfred Erich Senn  | editor=Ed.

[[File:Lietuvos šarvuotas traukinys Gediminas.jpg|thumb|left|Lithuanian [[armoured train]] ''Gediminas 3'' and Lithuanian soldiers]]

In June 1920 the Russian army had taken Vilnius. Shortly after their defeat in the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], the withdrawing Red Army handed the city over to Lithuania under the terms of [[Soviet–Lithuanian Treaty of 1920|the peace treaty signed on July 12]]. Negotiations were started in an attempt to avoid an armed conflict between Poland and Lithuania. On October 7, the [[Suwałki Agreement]] was signed. However, on October 8, before the agreement was to formally take effect, General [[Lucjan Żeligowski]], acting on orders from the Polish leader [[Józef Piłsudski]], [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|staged a mutiny]] by Polish troops. The [[Vilnius Region|Vilnius]] and the [[Suvalkai Region|Suvalkai]] regions were overrun. Initially the Polish forces did not meet much armed resistance, and a later Lithuanian counter-offensive was stopped by Military Commission of [[League of Nations]]. Since the Vilnius region was controlled by Poland, the Lithuanian government declared [[Kaunas]] the [[temporary capital of Lithuania]]. The dispute over Vilnius would continue throughout the interwar period.

== Żeligowski's Mutiny ==
{{main|Żeligowski's Mutiny}}
A staged mutiny arranged by the Polish [[Chief of State]] [[Józef Piłsudski]] was carried out by Polish forces led by general [[Lucjan Żeligowski]].&lt;ref&gt;'''(Polish)''' Piotr Łossowski, ''Konflikt polsko-litewski 1918-1920'', pp. 175–79.&lt;/ref&gt; These forces took control of Vilnius in the fall of 1920. However, shortly after this, Lithuanian forces started to gain the upper hand in this conflict and the 'mutinous' forces gained support from the regular Polish army. This military action is considered as a continuation of the Polish-Lithuanian war in historiography.

'''Martha Levisman de Clusellas''' (born 1933) is an Argentine architect, archivist, and historian.{{sfn|Hispanic Institute in the United States|2009|p=89}} She is best known for the three buildings of the Antorchas Foundation in [[Buenos Aires]] and for the part she played the development of the [[National Library in Buenos Aires]]. In 1985 she completed the first Antorchas building.&lt;ref name="Undia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undiaunaarquitecta.wordpress.com/2015/06/27/martha-levisman-1933/|title=Martha Levisman|publisher=Un día / una arquitecta|date=27 June 2015|accessdate=25 October 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writer Roberto Segren notes how in her work on the first Antorchas building transformed a "decayed palace representative of the anonymous architecture of Italian builders of the late nineteenth century"  in the [[San Telmo, Buenos Aires|San Telmo]] neighborhood.{{sfn|Segre|1991|p=295}}

==Biography==
From 1952 to 1958, she studied at the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism at the University of Buenos Aires, together with [[Beatriz Goldestein]], [[Nely Cueitel]] and [[Nora Monreal]]. It was during the period of transition when some of the staff were teaching the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts style]] while others were beginning to turn to [[Modern architecture|Modernism]], especially [[César Janello]] and [[Tomás Maldonado]] who taught integral design. She was also able to benefit from the lectures given by [[Odilia Suárez]] and [[Enriqueta Méoli]], both bent on following emerging trends.&lt;ref name="Undia"/&gt;

She was on the point of leaving Buenos Aires to embark on further studies in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] where there was a new school of architecture but she stayed in the capital after meeting [[Gerardo Clusellas]] (1929–73) who became her business partner, her husband and the father of her three sons. From 1957, she began her career at the university, working under Janello and with [[Wladimiro Acosta]]. From 1963 to 1966, she headed first-year practical projects in [[Alfredo Ibarlucía]]'s department. Later she worked with [[Mario Tempone]]. With the return of democracy in 1984, she returned to the Faculty of Architecture at Buenos Aires University as lecturer responsible for cultural events until 1889 when she was worked for the dean, undertaking research and arranging historical exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Undia"/&gt;

Between 1998 and 2002, Levisman was Director of ARCA, Argentina's architectural archive centre (Asociación Civil para el Archivo de Arquitectura Contemporánea Argentina);&lt;ref name="Undia"/&gt; she also served as ARCA's president.{{sfn|Sierra|2012|p=}} As an archivist she has worked for the [[Alejandro Bustillo|Bustillo]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Architectural Digest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt1UAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=John C. Brasfield Publishing Corporation|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levisman has conducted research as a historian into architecture, in one instance arguing that the "Bariloche style" was "created by a group of affluent Argentine developers inspired by 'colonization, illusion and fantasy'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revista hispánica moderna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gswqAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Casa de las Españas, Columbia University|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an architect, she was a member of her husband's firm. The most important completed works included the Antorchas Head Office (1985), the TAREA Foundation building (renovated in 1987) and an addition to the Antorchas complex to house a photograph gallery, completed in 1991. In 1989, she was commissioned to complete work on the National Library, a sizeable project which entailed redrafting plans for the interiors which had been mislaid.&lt;ref name="Undia"/&gt;

'''Matija''' or '''Mateja Nenadović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Матија}} or {{lang-sr-cyr|Матеја Ненадовић}}; 26 February 1777&amp;nbsp;– 11 December 1854), known as '''Prota Mateja''', was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Archpriest#Byzantine Christianity|archpriest]], writer, and a notable leader of the [[First Serbian Uprising]].

==Life==
At the age of sixteen he was ordained priest, and a few years later was promoted to an archpriest ({{lang-sr|протопоп}}), colloquially ''prota'' ({{lang-sr|прота}}) of [[Valjevo]]. His father, [[Aleksa Nenadović]], [[Knez (title)|Knez]] (chief magistrate) of the district of Valjevo, was one of the most popular and respected public men among the Serbs at the beginning of the 19th century. When the four leaders of the [[Janissary|Janissaries]] of the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] (the so-called [[Janissary|Dahia]]s) thought that the only way to prevent a general rising of the Serbs was to intimidate them by [[Slaughter of the knezes|murdering all their principal men]], Aleksa Nenadović (1749–1804) was one of the first victims. The policy of the Dahias, instead of preventing, did actually and immediately provoke a general insurrection of the Serbs against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]].

Prota Mateja became the deputy-commander of the insurgents of the Valjevo district (1804), but did not hold the post for long, as [[Karađorđe]] sent him in 1805 on a secret mission to [[St. Petersburg]], and afterwards employed him almost constantly as Serbia's diplomatic envoy to Russia, Austria, [[Bucharest]] and [[Constantinople]]. After the fall of Karadjordje (1813), the new leader of the Serbs, [[Miloš Obrenović]], sent Prota Mateja as representative of Serbia to the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–1815), where he pleaded the Serbian cause indefatigably. During that mission he often saw [[Lord Castlereagh]], and for the first time the Serbian national interests were brought to the knowledge of British statesmen. 
Prota Mateja's memoirs (''Memoari Prote Mateje Nenadovića'') are the most valuable authority for the history of the first and [[Second Serbian uprising]] against the Turks.

He had a brother, [[Sima Nenadović|Sima]], a ''voivode''. His paternal uncle, [[Jakov Nenadović]], had an equally important role in Serbia, as the first Interior Minister. Mateja Nenadović had a son, [[Ljubomir Nenadović]], born on 14 September 1826 at Brankovina, near [[Valjevo]]. From his earliest years he showed uncommon diligence and perseverance in classical studies, nothwithstanding many difficulties and privations. In 1844 he went to Prague, Berlin and Heidelberg where he studied at their universities. His reputation as a literary scholar, writer and poet secured him a post of professor at the [[Belgrade Lyceum]]. In 1851 Ljubomir Nenadović accompanied [[Petar II Petrović Njegoš]] on his last voyage in Italy. His ''Letters from Italy'' reveal many intimate sides of Njegoš's personality. Nenadović was only 25 years old at the time. When Njegoš, the great Serb poet, was dying Ljubomir Nenadović arrived in Cetinje to record whatever he could from the eyewitnesses and to save it for posterity. In later life Ljubomir Nenadović took an active part in politics; he became a secretary at a Serbian Legation in Constantinople; and in 1859 he was in charge of the Press Bureau of the Serbian Foreign Office.

==Works==
He is best known for his work ''The Memoirs of Prota Nenadović''. He also authored other memoirs and documentary literature.

==Legacy==
He is included in [[The 100 most prominent Serbs]].

{{National Literary "Matters"}}
The '''Matter of Britain''' is the body of [[Medieval literature]] and legendary material associated with [[Great Britain]], and sometimes [[Brittany]], and the [[list of legendary kings of Britain|legendary kings]] and heroes associated with it, particularly [[King Arthur]]. It was one of the three great [[short story cycle|story cycles]] recalled repeatedly in medieval literature, together with the [[Matter of France]], which concerned the legends of [[Charlemagne]], and the [[Matter of Rome]], which included material derived from or inspired by [[classical mythology]].

==History==
The three "Matters" were first described in the [[12th century]] by [[France|French]] poet [[Jean Bodel]], whose epic ''[[:fr:Chanson des Saisnes|La Chanson des Saisnes]]'' ("Song of the Saxons") contains the line:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''Ne sont que III matières à nul homme atandant,''
''De France et de Bretaigne, et de Rome la grant.''

"Not but with three matters no man should attend:
Of France, and of Britain, and of Rome the grand."&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The name distinguishes and relates the Matter of Britain from the mythological themes taken from [[classical antiquity]], the "[[Matter of Rome]]", and the tales of the [[paladin]]s of [[Charlemagne]] and their wars with the [[Moors]] and [[Saracen]]s, which constituted the "[[Matter of France]]". Arthur is the chief subject of the Matter of Britain, along with stories related to the [[List of legendary kings of Britain|legendary kings of the British]], as well as lesser-known topics related to the history of [[Great Britain]] and [[Brittany]], such as the stories of [[Brutus of Troy]], [[Coel Hen]], [[Leir of Britain]] (King Lear), and [[Gogmagog (giant)|Gogmagog]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Themes and subjects==
===Legendary history of Britain===
It could be said that the legendary history of Britain was created partly to form a body of patriotic myth for the country. Several agendas thus can be seen in this body of literature.

The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', the earliest known source of the story of Brutus of Troy, may have been devised to create a distinguished [[genealogy]] for a number of [[Wales|Welsh]] princes in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to [[Nennius]], its actual compiler is unknown; it exists in several recensions. This tale went on to achieve greater currency because its inventor linked Brutus to the diaspora of [[hero]]es that followed the [[Trojan War]], and thus provided raw material which later mythographers such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], [[Michael Drayton]], and [[John Milton]] could draw upon, linking the settlement of [[Great Britain|Britain]] to the [[heroic Age (literary theory)|heroic age]] of [[Greek literature]], for their several and diverse literary purposes. As such, this material could be used for patriotic mythmaking just as [[Virgil]] linked the [[founding of Rome]] to the Trojan War in ''[[Aeneid|The Æneid]]''. Geoffrey of Monmouth also introduced the fanciful claim that the [[Trinovantes]], reported by [[Tacitus]] as dwelling in the area of [[London]], had a name he interpreted as ''Troi-novant'', "New [[Troy]]".

More speculative claims link [[Welsh mythology]] with several of the rulers and incidents compiled by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|Historia Regum Britanniæ]]''. It has been suggested, for instance, that Leir of Britain, who later became [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'', was originally the Welsh sea-god [[Llŷr]] (see also the [[Ireland|Irish]] sea-god [[Ler (mythology)|Ler]]). Various Celtic [[deity|deities]] have been identified with characters from Arthurian literature as well: [[Morgan le Fay]] was often thought to have originally been the Welsh goddess [[Modron]] (cf. [[the Morrígan]]). Many of these identifications come from the speculative [[comparative religion]] of the late 19th century, and have been questioned in more recent years.

[[William Shakespeare]] was interested in the legendary history of Britain, and was familiar with some of its more obscure byways. Shakespeare's plays contain several tales relating to these legendary kings, such as ''King Lear'' and ''[[Cymbeline]]''. It has been suggested that Shakespeare's [[Wales|Welsh]] [[teacher|schoolmaster]] [[Thomas Jenkins (headmaster)|Thomas Jenkins]] introduced him to this material, and perhaps directed him to read Geoffrey of Monmouth{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. These tales also figure in [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''The Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland'', which also appears in Shakespeare's sources for ''[[Macbeth]]''.

Other early authors also drew from the early Arthurian and pseudo-historical sources of the Matter of Britain. The [[Scotland|Scots]], for instance, formulated a mythical history in the [[List of kings of the Picts|Picts]] and the [[List of kings of Dál Riata|Dál Riata]] royal lines. While they do eventually become factual lines, unlike those of Geoffrey, their origins are vague and often incorporate both aspects of mythical British history and mythical [[Irish mythology|Irish]] history. The story of [[Gabrán mac Domangairt]] especially incorporates elements of both those histories.

===Arthurian cycle===
The Arthurian [[List of literary cycles|literary cycle]] is the best known part of the Matter of Britain. It has succeeded largely because it tells two interlocking stories that have intrigued many later authors. One concerns [[Camelot]], usually envisioned as a doomed [[utopia]] of chivalric virtue, undone by the fatal flaws of Arthur and Sir Lancelot. The other concerns the quests of the various knights to achieve the [[Holy Grail]]; some succeed ([[Galahad]], [[Percival]]), and others fail ([[Lancelot]]).

The medieval tale of Arthur and his knights is full of [[Christian]] themes; those themes involve the destruction of human plans for virtue by the moral failures of their characters, and the quest for an important Christian [[relic]]. Finally, the relationships between the characters invited treatment in the tradition of [[courtly love]], such as Lancelot and [[Guinevere]], or [[Tristan and Iseult]]. In more recent years, the trend has been to attempt to link the tales of King Arthur and his knights with Celtic mythology, usually in highly romanticized, early 20th century reconstructed versions.

The work of [[Jessie Weston]], in particular ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]'', traced Arthurian imagery through Christianity to roots in early nature worship and vegetation rites, though this interpretation is no longer fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Waste Land and Jessie Weston: A Reassessment |first=Leon |last=Surette |journal=Twentieth Century Literature |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=Summer 1988 |pages=223–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it is possible to read the Arthurian literature in general, and that concerned with the Grail tradition in particular, as an allegory of human development and spiritual growth (a theme explored by [[mythology|mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]] amongst others).

The traditional '''Mongol calendar''' ({{Lang-mn|цаглабар}}, ''Tsaglabar'' or {{Lang|mn|цаг тооны бичиг}}, ''Tsag toony bichig'') is a [[lunisolar calendar]] based on {{Lang|mn|Tegus Buyantu zurkhai}}&lt;ref&gt;Zurkhai (from the verb ''zur'' - ''draw'') is a system of knowledge embracing mathematics, astronomy and astrology&lt;/ref&gt; system developed in 1747 by monk Ishbaljir ({{Lang|mn|Сүмбэ хамбо Ишбалжир}}, ''Sümbe khambo Ishbaljir''; 1704–1788). The Mongol year is composed of either 12 or 13 [[lunar month]]s, each beginning and ending with a [[new moon]]. A thirteenth month is added every two or three years, so that an average year is equal to the [[solar year]].

The Mongol new year celebration is [[Tsagaan Sar]] which is celebrated two months after the first [[new moon]] following the [[winter solstice]].

In modern [[Mongolia]], the Gregorian calendar is used, with the traditional calendar only used for traditional celebrations and events based on it.

The European system of chronology is called ''Аргын тоолол'' ({{Lang|mn|Argyn Toolol}}, chronology of method) and the Mongol system of chronology is called ''Билгийн тоолол'' ({{Lang|mn|Bilgiin Toolol}}, chronology of wisdom).

The twelve months of the year are referred to by their number, such as first month, second month, and so on.

=== Days of the week ===
In colloquial usage, the first 5 days of the week are referred to as first day, second day, etc. Saturday is referred to as ''Hagas sain ödör'' (translation: half-good day), and Sunday is referred to as ''Büten sain ödör'' (translation: full good day), a result of 5 full working days and Saturday as a half working day during the [[Mongolian People's Republic|communist era]].

The names of Tibetan origin are used in more formal settings, and almost exclusively in written documents, while the Sanskrit names are practically absent in modern usage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3789">The '''Museo de la Palabra y la Imagen''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for Museum of the Word and the Image) is an innovative museum located in [[San Salvador, El Salvador]]. It was founded in the late 1990s by the Venezuelan journalist [[Carlos Henríquez Consalvi]] as a [[museum]] dedicated to collecting and preserving memories of the [[Salvadoran civil war]], incorporating memories across the political spectrum. The general enthusiasm of the public quickly prompted the MUPI to expand and it now includes a variety of exhibits that deal with various moments in the nation's past.

== Projects ==
One of its projects has been the production of the documentary ''Cicatriz de la Memoria'' (''Scars of Memory'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://frif.com/new2003/scar.html Scars of Memory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with U.S. historian Jeffrey Gould&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~lahist/IU_lahist_faculty_gould.html Latin American History at Indiana University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]]. Integral to the project was the idea of the "cine-forum," in which the MUPI took the documentary "on tour" throughout the country and abroad, organizing screenings in community centers, schools, and universities, followed by lively discussion sessions. More recently, the MUPI has worked in an exhibit regarding the memory of the massacre of [[El Mozote]], and has also worked in collaboration with the art museum MARTE in a joint exhibit about the acclaimed Salvadoran writer and artist, [[Salarrué]].

==Archives==
The MUPI has an impressive archive that includes historical photographs, manuscripts, and video recordings:
* '''Movie archive''': considered El Salvador's most important audiovisual archive including takes from the [[Salvadoran civil war]], Salvadoran productions (Baltazar Polio, Alejandro Coto, Guillermo Escalón, etc.) and registers about literature, history, folklore, etc. This archive is used for audiovisual productions, TV programs or educative products. 
* '''Photo archive''':  contains more than 35,000 images dating from 1872 until present. Most important themes are:
** Images about indigenous culture. 1896
** [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]].
** [[Salvadoran civil war|Armed conflict 1980 - 1992]].
** Personalities collection: Masferrer, [[Claudia Lars]], [[Roque Dalton]], [[Monseñor Romero]], María de Baratta, etc.
** Kabrakan collection: Images about natural phenomenon in [[El Salvador]]: earthquakes, eruptions, tsunami and floodings.
** Women's collection: Prudencia Ayala, Amparo Casamalhuapa, etc.

The '''Polish Center for Holocaust Research''' ({{lang-pl|Centrum Badań nad Zagładą Żydów}}) is an academic and research center at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. 

==History==
Created in 2003, the Center is an interdisciplinary research facility devoted to study of [[the Holocaust]] in historical perspective. The Center gathers psychologists, sociologists, literary historians, cultural anthropologists, and other scholars in order to provide knowledge on the nature, scope, and effects of the [[Shoah|Jewish tragedy]]. 

The Center coordinates research and educational projects, grants, seminars, conferences, and workshops, and publishes books and papers by Polish scholars as well as translations of works in other languages.  Since 2005, the Center has published an academic journal, ''[[Holocaust Studies and Materials]]''.

In order to support and expand the Center's activities, in 2007 the Association of the Polish Center for Holocaust Research was created.

In 2018, Jakub Petelewicz, speaking as academic secretary of the Polish Center for Holocaust Research, expressed concern that a 2018 Polish law criminalizing discussion of negative Polish actions in the Holocaust may hinder the work of Poland-based academics and institutions. While the law contains an exemption for academic and artistic work, he said the lack of definitions could lead to confusion. For instance, he expressed concern that presenting materials to schools and discussing findings publicly might be prevented. Another concern he raised was the possibility of being sued personally or as an institution by right-wing groups under provisions of the law allowing for lawsuits to defend "the good name of the Polish nation." Petelwicz described the overall effect of the law as pressuring academics to play down negative actions by Poles and emphasize suffering by Poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Matthews |title=Historians fear ‘censorship’ under Poland’s Holocaust law |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/historians-fear-censorship-under-polands-holocaust-law |quote= |pages= |work=[[Times Higher Education]] |location= |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=2018-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the Center released a Polish-language study on ''The Fate of Jews in Selected Counties of Occupied Poland'' ([[Polish language|Polish]] title: 
''Dalej jest noc'', Night Goes On), co-edited by [[Jan Grabowski (historian)|Jan Grabowski]] and [[Barbara Engelking]], and  co-authored with 7 other Center members. The 1,600-page, two-volume study covers 9 counties of Poland. The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] wrote that the study estimates that over half a million Jewish Holocaust victims died as a result of the actions of non-Jewish Poles. The study identified small Polish towns as particularly dangerous, or "death traps", for Jews in hiding.&lt;ref name="JTA20180511"&gt;[https://www.jta.org/2018/05/11/default/poles-helped-kill-jews-hiding-nazis-study-claims Study says Polish neighbors betrayed many more Jews than previously thought], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], 11 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book made different estimates than what the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] claimed. According to the book co-edited by Grabowski and Engelking, ten percent of Jews in the [[General Government]] sought shelter among the Polish population, two-thirds of whom died, usually with Polish participation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oko.press/dalej-jest-noc-dwoch-na-trzech-zydow-szukajacych-ratunku-zginelo-z-rak-polakow-lub-przy-ich-wspoludziale/ „Dalej jest noc”.

'''Sam T. Jack''' (31 December 1852 – 1899), a burlesque impresario, was a pioneer of the African-American vaudeville industry in the USA with his ''Creole Burlesque Show''. He was also known for staging increasingly risqué shows in Chicago, where young women appeared wearing only skin-colored tights.

==Early years==

Sam T. Jack was born on 31 December 1852 in rural [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|O'Neill|1895|pp=15-18}}
According to an 1895 biography, which he may have commissioned and may be unreliable,
he served in the army for a short period, and then in the oil business in western [[Pennsylvania]]. In 1872 he opened the Oil City Opera in [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]]. He opened other opera houses in nearby [[Franklin, Pennsylvania|Franklin]] and [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Titusville]] that specialized in melodrama.{{sfn|Barons of Burlesque: Sam T. Jack}}
His biography says that from 1873–77 he ran a showboat, and his Alice Oates Comic Opera Company toured the USA in 1880–84.{{sfn|Barons of Burlesque: Sam T. Jack}}

There are records of Sam Jack being the principal of the Sam Jack Stock Company in Oil City.{{sfn|Marsh|1977|p=207}}
Jack's Oil Region Circuit was able to provide far better entertainment than had been offered in the past.
Thus at the start of the 1877-78 season he brought in the Berger family's troupe, providing a respectable entertainment of music and sketches, Duprey and Benedicts Minstrels, the Washburn troupe and the Union Square Theatre Company.{{sfn|Marsh|1977|p=210}}
Jack was manager of Eliza Weathersby's ''Froliques'', a variety show, which also played in the oil region.{{sfn|Marsh|1977|p=212}}
In 1878 the recently remodeled opera house reopened under his management.{{sfn|Marsh|1977|p=207}}
He had other theater interests in the area. Thus on 13 December 1879 the Meadville Evening Republican reported, "Mr. Sam Jack, the manager, who has given [[Meadville, Pennsylvania|Meadville]] and the towns of the region so many entertainments of the highest order this season, deserves the most liberal patronage of the public ... for his enterprise and good judgment as a caterer to the best classes of theatre goers."{{sfn|Marsh|1977|p=207}}

In 1879 Jack became manager of the newly renovated Pillot's Opera House in Houston.{{sfn|Gallegly|1962|p=44}}
Jack began his career as a burlesque manager in 1881, when he was responsible for the number two company of [[Michael B. Leavitt]]'s Rentz-Santely review.
It was based in Chicago and toured the western USA.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=557}}
Jack added risqué elements from Western honky‐tonk entertainments to the shows.{{sfn|Burlesque in America, OUP 2004}}
After leaving Leavitt, Jack opened the Lilly Clay Colossal Gaiety Company, the first of his own burlesque shows.
The star of the show, Lilly Clay, came from England.{{sfn|Barons of Burlesque: Sam T. Jack}}
Leavitt says in his memoirs that he sold Jack the title "Lilly Clay Gaiety Company" for $5,000 in 1889. 
Jack's biography does not mention Leavitt at all, but portrays Jack as entirely self-made.{{sfn|Bowdre|2006|p=71}}

==''The Creole Show''==
[[File:Musical Gems - Creole Burlesque Co.png|thumb|Cover of ''Musical Gems'', a book of songs by Sam T. Jack's Creole Burlesque Co.]]
Sam T. Jack produced ''The Creole Show'' between 1890 and 1897. It represents a stage in the transition from the traditional minstrel shows to the vaudeville revue.{{sfn|Peterson|1993|p=91}}
It is said that [[Sam Lucas]] came up with the idea of a creole burlesque company, and persuaded Sam T. Jack to put it on.{{sfn|Abbott|Seroff|2003|p=154}}
It was the first to present beautiful black women as chorus girls in place of the traditional all-male chorus.{{sfn|Peterson|1993|p=253}}
It has been called the first black burlesque show. It included original songs, sketches and comedy numbers by black artists.{{sfn|Peterson|1993|p=91}}

The show opened with three women interlocuters or conversationalists sitting in the center. They were flanked by eight lavishly costomed chorus girls on each side. There were male performers at each end and in the orchestra.{{sfn|Peterson|1993|p=92}}
The show followed the traditional three-part minstrel pattern. In the first part there was an exchange of repartee between the interlocuters and comedians, and songs and dances by individuals and the chorus. In the second part there were various sketches and variety acts. The third part was a burlesque. The show was innovative in giving women a leading role and in introducing burlesque by African Americans.{{sfn|Peterson|1993|p=92}}

''The Creole Show''  opened in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]], on 4 August 1890, and traveled to Boston, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The show opened in Chicago in 1891 in Sam T. Jack's Opera House, and toured on Jack's circuit.{{sfn|Peterson|1993|p=93}}
On 4 June 1892 it was announced that Sam T. Jack had stopped traveling and settled at the Madison Street Opera House in Chicago. 
The Creole Burlesque Company played here for most of the summer of 1893.
In August 1893 it was announced that "Six women from [[Honolulu]], dancing what manager Jack styles the Hullu-Hullu gavotte, are this week added to the drawing powers of his Creole Burlesquers.{{sfn|Abbott|Seroff|2003|p=161}}

In the 1893-94 season the cast was joined by Charles E. Johnson and [[Dora Dean]], a dancing team that specialized in the [[cakewalk]], the composer, performer and stage manager [[Bob Cole (composer)|Bob Cole]] and the dancer Stella Wiley, who later married Bob Cole.{{sfn|Peterson|1993|p=93}}
In the early 1890s [[Tom McIntosh (comedian)|Tom McIntosh]] and Hattie McIntosh had put together ''Mr. and Mrs. McIntosh in the King of Bavaria'', a vaudeville act.
The McIntoshes played with Sam T. Jack's Creole Show in 1894.{{sfn|Thompson|1997}}
Other artists who performed with the show included [[Billy McClain]] and his wife Cordelia McClain.{{sfn|Peterson|1993|p=93}}

[[John W. Isham]], the advance agent for the ''Creole Show'', decided to produce his own show in 1895, also using beautiful black women as chorus girls. At first called ''Isham's Creole Opera Co.'', the name was changed to ''Isham's Octoroons'' to avoid legal challenges.{{sfn|Peterson|1993|p=253}}

==Other shows and legacy==
[[File:1896 Postcard advertising the Sam T. Jack Opera House in Chicago.jpg|thumb|1896 Postcard advertising the Sam T. Jack Opera House in Chicago]]
In Manhattan in the 1890s Sam T. Jack's Tenderloin Company presented living statues of young women dressed only in flesh-colored tights, and others doing daring performances of the cancan.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=163}}
Preachers in New York regularly denounced his shows.
Jack moved to Chicago, which was less straight-laced.
He hired the bellydancer [[Little Egypt (dancer)|Little Egypt]] (Fahreda Mazar Spyropoulos) to appear at his Chicago Theatre after her appearance at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=164}}

Jack blatantly promoted increasingly explicit burlesque.{{sfn|Cullen|Hackman|McNeilly|2004|p=164}}
However, Jack's shows still included many of the elements of a musical comedy or revue, which lent them some legitimacy.
Historians often credit Jack for the form that burlesque took in Chicago by the turn of the century.{{sfn|Burlesque in America, OUP 2004}}

Sam Jack married Emma Ward, a burlesque actress. 
He died in 1899, leaving an estate valued at $75,000, plus real estate holdings.{{sfn|Peculiar Request in Sam T. Jack's Will 1899}}
His will was filed for probate on 2 June 1899. 
One third of the property went to his wife, Emma, and one third to his brother, James C. Jack. 
The rest was divided among various relatives, including his father, mother and various nephews and nieces. 
No provision was made for his illegitimate daughter by the actress Mabel Hazelton.
The will said it was Jack's wish that his brother and widow should marry.{{sfn|The Will of Sam T. Jack, NYT 1899}}
His widow insisted that she be given the Sam T. Jack Theatre in Chicago, while his brother received the theater in New York.{{sfn|Peculiar Request in Sam T. Jack's Will 1899}}

{{Kurds}}
'''Shahrizor''' is a plain between [[Suleimania]] and [[Darbandikhan]], situated in the southeastern part of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], [[Iraq]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Shahrazur'' is likely derived from two [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] words: ''shah'' (king) and ''razur'' (forest), hence sharazur meaning ''kingly forest''.&lt;ref&gt;E.J.W. Gibb memorial series, 1937, E. J. Brill, University of California&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ernst Herzfeld|Herzfeld]] based on the fact that in classical sources the name was spelt with an initial /s/ rather /sh/, suggested ''white forest'',&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Herzfeld, Gerold Walser, 1968, The Persian Empire: Studies in geography and ethnography of the ancient Near East, p. 18, ff. Steiner, University of Michigan, 392 pages&lt;/ref&gt; which he connected with the [[Avesta]]n legends. Indeed, to this day the plain of Sharazur has an important status among adherents of native religion of [[Yarsan]] as a holy and sacred region where [[God]] descends for the Last Judgement.&lt;ref&gt;Islamic Desk Reference, by Emeri van Donzel, page: 408, {{ISBN|90-04-09738-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover modern Assyrians continue to revere the site.
The 12th century geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], based on folk etymology interpreted origin of name Sharazur,  from the name of the son of [[Zahhak]], whom he mentions as founder of the famous city of Sharazor.&lt;ref&gt;''Kitab Mu'jam Al Buldan'' by Yaqoot Hamawi, Book 3, p: 425–427&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Extensive archaeological research, especially since 2009, at sites like [[Bakr Awa]], [[Tell Begum]] and [[Gird-î Qalrakh]], has shown that the plain has been continuously occupied since [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]].&lt;ref&gt;Kopanias, Kostas, John MacGinnis, and Jason Ur (eds.). 2015 [https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/14022526 "Archaeological Projects in the Kurdistan Region in Iraq."] The Directorate of Antiquities of Kurdistan&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharazor and its king ''Yazdan Kard'' are mentioned in the [[Karnamag-i Artaxshir-i Papakan|Karnamag]], a book of Persian mythology, of [[Ardashir I]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Kārnāmag-ī Ardaxšīr-ī Pābagān]], Book of the Deeds of Ardashir son of Babag, Chapter VI&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the inscription of [[Narseh]] alongside [[Garmian]]. During the [[Sassanid]] era the region of Sharazor was one of the 5 provinces of the satrapy of [[Medes]], an ancient [[Iran]]ian people.

In the 4th century, some of inhabitants of Sharazor who had converted to Christianity were persecuted by the Sassanids. Among the prominent examples of this persecution is the killing of Bishop Shahdost Shahrazori and 128 of his followers.

Emperor [[Heraclius]] spent the month of February in 628 in Shahrazur.

In the year 642 AD, Sharazor witnessed a big battle between Kurds and invading [[Arab Muslims]] aiming to conquer the Sassanid empire. After suffering massive casualties,  the Arabs assumed control of it in 643 AD.

Sharazur was incorporated into [[Ardalan Principality]] from 11th century until the 16th&lt;ref&gt;Kurdistan: Divided Nation of the Middle East - Page 10, by S. S. Gavan. Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; and was its first capital. Its relics are the historic site of Yassin tepe.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica: A New Survey of Universal Knowledge'', pg. 521, by Walter Yust, 1951; and ''The Pageant of Persia: A Record of Travel by Motor in Persia'', by  James Rives Childs, p. 253, The Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; It formed afterwards part of [[Baban Principality]].

In the Medieval era, the area was incorporated into the territories ruled by many dynasties, including [[Annazid]], [[Aishanid]] and also [[Ayyubid]], who were also of Kurdish origins. During the Ayyubid period the region, and the city of Erbil, were granted as a fief to the emir [[Gökböri]] by [[Saladin]] in 1190.&lt;ref&gt;*Ibn Khallikan (1843) ''Kitab wafayat ala'yan - Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary'', transl. by Guillaume, Baron Mac-Guckin de Slane, Volume 2, Paris.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8MdLAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], p. 537&lt;/ref&gt;

Yaqoot Hamawi describes the region of Sharazor as areas between Erbil to the west and Hamadan to the east including many cities, towns and villages.  He mentions the inhabitants of the region as  having been entirely [[Kurds]], who were defended themselves from the Sultan and ruled their area.&lt;ref&gt;''Kitab Mu'jam Al Buldan'', by Yaqoot Hamawi, vol. 3, pp. 425−427&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The New Found World, or Antarctike''''' ([[French language|French]] edition: ''Les singularitez de la France antarctique, autrement nommee Amerique, &amp; de plusieurs terres et isles decouvertes de nostre temps,'' 1557) is an account published by the French [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] priest and explorer [[André Thevet]] detailing his experiences in [[France Antarctique]], a French settlement in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New found worlde, or Antarctike, wherein is contained wōderful and strange things, as well of humaine creatures, as beastes, fishes, foules, and serpents, trees, plants, mines of golde and siluer: garnished with many learned aucthorities.|last=Thevet|first=André|publisher=Imprinted by Henry Bynneman, for Thomas Hacket|year=1568|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thevet based his descriptions of Rio de Janeiro on his ten weeks spent living in Brazil, as well as drawing on the reports of other travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/renaissance-in-print/travelnarratives/thevet|title=André Thevet (1516?-1592)|last=Conrad|first=Elsa|date=|website=The Renaissance in Print: Sixteenth-Century Books in the Douglas Gordon Collection|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first English translation of the book was published in 1568.   Thevet describes the native people and the new experiences that he saw. He goes on to describe foods that they eat, clothing, the surrounding areas, and eventually their rituals. He goes into great detail discussing cannibalism and its common use among prisoners and enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A13665.0001.001/1:30?rgn=div1;view=fulltext|title=The new found vvorlde, or Antarctike wherin is contained wo[n]derful and strange things, as well of humaine creatures, as beastes, fishes, foules, and serpents, trées, plants, mines of golde and siluer: garnished with many learned aucthorities, trauailed and written in the French tong, by that excellent learned man, master Andrevve Theuet.

Throughout the book there was a big emphasis on clothing in which Thevet makes very clear that often both men and women don't wear very much if any. They did wear jewelry as well as animal skins. Thevet also goes into detail about the food and drink that they were consuming. The native people would make an alcoholic wine like substance out of roots and would drink this until they felt sick. He compares this to Europeans drinking wine. While the natives do practice cannibalism it was done in a way that was much more humane than most people thought. They did kill war prisoners but leading up until his death they were often treated nicely and humanely.&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu"/&gt;

== Synopsis ==
Thevet and his colleagues land on the Brazilian mainland on November 10, and are welcomed and fed by a delegation of native people immediately upon their arrival. At the welcoming feast, they are served an alcoholic beverage brewed from a combination of different roots. Initially hoping to venture inland or elsewhere along the coast, the expeditionary team members are informed that there is little freshwater for a significant distance away from the indigenous settlement but that they would be welcome to remain near their landing site for the time being. Venturing to a nearby inlet, Thevet and company are impressed by an array of colorful birdsㅡtheir feathers making an attractive decoration for the sparse garments of native peopleㅡand a generous bounty of fish, upon which local residents may subsist. Finally Thevet describes some of the local flora, including beautiful trees unseen in Europe and small vines utilized by the natives as accessories and for medicinal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thevet|first=André|year=1568|title=The New found worlde, or Antarctike, wherein is contained wōderful and strange things, as well of humaine creatures, as beastes, fishes, foules, and serpents, trees, plants, mines of golde and siluer: garnished with many learned aucthorities, trauailed and written in the French tong, by that excellent learned man, master Andrevve Theuet. And now newly translated into Englishe, wherein is reformed the errours of the auncient cosmographers.|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A13665.0001.001/1:30?rgn=div1;view=fulltext|location=London|publisher=Imprinted by Henry Bynneman, for Thomas Hacket|pages=31–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic author acknowledges and laments the absence of organized religion in the lives of indigenous people. Although they do believe in "Toupan"ㅡsome sort of higher being reigning above them and governing the climateㅡthey make no clear effort to worship or honor it as a collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thevet|first=André|year=1568|title=The New found worlde, or Antarctike, wherein is contained wōderful and strange things, as well of humaine creatures, as beastes, fishes, foules, and serpents, trees, plants, mines of golde and siluer: garnished with many learned aucthorities, trauailed and written in the French tong, by that excellent learned man, master Andrevve Theuet.

Following this, the author momentarily touches upon how [[Christopher Columbus]] and his team were initially worshiped by local Amerindians, before losing this divine status once it was gradually discovered that they behaved and functioned as ordinary men. [[Cannibalism]] is addressed at the end of this chapter, being attributed to certain indigenous groups who allegedly consume human flesh as one in European society might consume any other meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thevet|first=André|year=1568|title=The New found worlde, or Antarctike, wherein is contained wōderful and strange things, as well of humaine creatures, as beastes, fishes, foules, and serpents, trees, plants, mines of golde and siluer: garnished with many learned aucthorities, trauailed and written in the French tong, by that excellent learned man, master Andrevve Theuet. And now newly translated into Englishe, wherein is reformed the errours of the auncient cosmographers.|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A13665.0001.001/1:34?rgn=div1;view=fulltext|location=London|publisher=Imprinted by Henry Bynneman, for Thomas Hacket|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thevet also describes, in some detail, the rarity of clothing in the aboriginal society he and his companions observe. Almost without exception, men and women alike would live their entire lives completely naked. Deviations from this norm might occur at formal events, at which attendees might wear sashes or headdresses. Additionally, elderly people might cover their breasts and genitalia out of an apparent desire to hide their physical deterioration wrought by the aging process. However, it is also notable that these indigenous villagers placed a great deal of value in the garments that they made or otherwise encountered. Rather than wear these articles of clothing, the natives would frequently set them aside for fear of degrading their quality. In those instances when they did choose to wear attire, the Amerindians would always do so on a part of their body where it could easily be prevented from touching the ground at any time. Noting their ability to weave cotton for other purposes, Thevet deduces that the natives likely embrace nudity as a way for them to move and fight with agility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thevet|first=André|year=1568|title=The New found worlde, or Antarctike, wherein is contained wōderful and strange things, as well of humaine creatures, as beastes, fishes, foules, and serpents, trees, plants, mines of golde and siluer: garnished with many learned aucthorities, trauailed and written in the French tong, by that excellent learned man, master Andrevve Theuet.

Relatively late in the narrative, Thevet describes a method of execution which he claims is practiced by the coastal community in which he resides. Condemned men, typically war prisoners, are given comfortable lodging, plenty of food, and even a “wife” for the period of time leading from the beginning of their internment to their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thevet|first=André|year=1568|title=The New found worlde, or Antarctike, wherein is contained wōderful and strange things, as well of humaine creatures, as beastes, fishes, foules, and serpents, trees, plants, mines of golde and siluer: garnished with many learned aucthorities, trauailed and written in the French tong, by that excellent learned man, master Andrevve Theuet. And now newly translated into Englishe, wherein is reformed the errours of the auncient cosmographers.|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A13665.0001.001/1:46?rgn=div1;view=fulltext|location=London|publisher=Imprinted by Henry Bynneman, for Thomas Hacket|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of captured women differed in that they were afforded greater mobility, but were also required to gather food and perform sexual favors for a predetermined man of the tribe. The unit of time throughout this period is the moon, rather than days, weeks, or months. On the final day before his or her execution, the prisoner is chained to a bed and is the subject of a ceremony in which community members gather and sing of their death. Finally, the condemned man or woman is brought to a public place, tied up, hacked to pieces, and consumed by the local populace. Male children are told to bathe in the blood of the victim, while women are tasked with eating the internal organs. All children born to a condemned man’s “widow” as a result of their copulation are to be "nurtured" for a brief period, before being cannibalized in the same manner as their father. The executioners, meanwhile, are honored and brilliantly accessorized with colorful feathers and body paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thevet|first=André|year=1568|title=The New found worlde, or Antarctike, wherein is contained wōderful and strange things, as well of humaine creatures, as beastes, fishes, foules, and serpents, trees, plants, mines of golde and siluer: garnished with many learned aucthorities, trauailed and written in the French tong, by that excellent learned man, master Andrevve Theuet.

== Reception ==
''The New Found World, or Antartike'' was quickly spread throughout Europe after its publication.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cardozo|first=Manoel Da Silveira|date=July 1944|title=Some Remarks Concerning André Thevet1|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/americas/article/some-remarks-concerning-andre-thevet1/BB761D0D45983F72F25D5FDA66C67492|journal=The Americas|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15–36|doi=10.2307/978333|issn=0003-1615}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans at the time considered Thevet’s work as an, “unusual contribution to travel literature.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In 1568, the book was translated into an English version, titled ''The New found vvorlde, or antarctike, wherein is contained woderful and strange things, as well of humaine creatures, as beastes, fishes, foules, and serpents, trees, plants, mines of golde and siluer: garnished with many learned aucthorities, trauailed and written in the French tong, by that excellent learned man, Master Andrevve Thevet, and now newly translated into Englishe, wherein is reformed the errours of the auncient cosmographer'', and an Italian edition with the title ''Historia dell'India America detta altramente Francia Antartica, di M.

'''Yanlā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: ञला) is the eleventh month in the [[Nepal Era]] calendar, the national [[lunar calendar]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Sambat gets national status|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The month coincides with [[Bhadrapada]] (भाद्रपद) in the [[Hindu lunar calendar]] and [[September]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

Yanlā begins with the [[new moon]] and the [[full moon]] falls on the 15th of the [[lunar month]]. The month is divided into the bright and dark fortnights which are known as Yanlā Thwa (ञला थ्व) and Yanlā Gā (ञला गा) respectively.

Among the major events of the month, the 4th day of the bright fortnight is [[Ganesha Chaturthi]] which marks the birthday of the Hindu deity of good fortune [[Ganesha]]. It is known as Chathā (चथा) in Nepal Bhasa.

The highlight of Yanlā is [[Yenya|Yenyā]] (येँयाः). The name means "Festival of Kathmandu" and it is the largest religious street celebration in the Nepalese capital. Also known as Indra Jātrā, it consists of chariot processions of the [[Kumari (children)|Living Goddess Kumari]], masked dances of deities, pageants and displays of sacred images. Yenyā lasts for eight days from the 12th day of the bright fortnight to the 4th day of the dark fortnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Toffin| first = Gérard | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/64459961/Indra-Jatra-of-Kathmandu-Gerard-Toffin| title = The Indra Jātrā of Kathmandu as a Royal Festival Past and Present| work = Contributions to Nepalese Studies| publisher = Center for Nepal and Asian Studies, Tribbuvan University| date=January 1992| page= 73|accessdate = 18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levy |first= Robert Isaac |date=1990 |title= Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal|chapter=A Catalogue of Annual Events and Their Distribution throughout the Lunar Year |publisher= University of California Press |page=654 |isbn=9780520069114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
