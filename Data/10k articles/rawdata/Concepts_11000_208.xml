== Origin of Crabtree effect in yeast ==
Approximately 100 million years ago (mya), within the yeast lineage there was a [[whole genome duplication]] (WGD).&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Kenneth H.|title=Origin of the Yeast Whole-Genome Duplication|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002221|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=13|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002221|pmc=4529243|pmid=26252643|pages=e1002221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A majority of Crabtree-positive yeasts are post-WGD yeasts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  It was believed that the WGD was a mechanism for the development of Crabtree effect in these species due to the duplication of [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH) encoding genes and hexose transporters.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, recent evidence has shown that aerobic fermentation originated before the WGD and evolved as a multi-step process, potentially aided by the WGD.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The origin of aerobic fermentation, or the first step, in ''Saccharomyces'' crabtree-positive yeasts likely occurred in the interval between the ability to grow under anaerobic conditions, horizontal transfer of anaerobic DHODase (encoded by URA1 with bacteria), and the loss of respiratory chain Complex I.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A more pronounced Crabtree effect, the second step, likely occurred near the time of the WGD event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Later evolutionary events that aided in the evolution of aerobic fermentation are better understood and outlined in the Genomic basis of the crabtree effect section.

=== Driving forces ===
It is believed that a major driving force in the origin of aerobic fermentation was its simultaneous origin with modern fruit (~125 mya).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  These fruit provided an abundance of simple sugar food source for microbial communities, including both yeast and bacteria.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Bacteria, at that time, were able to produce biomass at a faster rate than the yeast.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Producing a toxic compound, like ethanol, can slow the growth of bacteria, allowing the yeast to be more competitive.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, the yeast still had to use a portion of the sugar it consumes to produce ethanol.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Crabtree-positive yeasts also have increased glycolytic flow, or increased uptake of glucose and conversion to pyruvate, which compensates for using a portion of the glucose to produce ethanol rather than biomass.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Therefore, it is believed that the original driving force was to kill competitors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  This is supported by research that determined the kinetic behavior of the ancestral ADH protein, which was found to be optimized to make ethanol, rather than consume it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further evolutionary events in the development of aerobic fermentation likely increased the efficiency of this lifestyle, including increased tolerance to ethanol and the repression of the respiratory pathway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In high sugar environments, ''S. cerevisiae'' outcompetes and dominants all other yeast species, except its closest relative ''[[Saccharomyces paradoxus]]''.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The ability of ''S. cerevisiae'' to dominate in high sugar environments evolved more recently than aerobic fermentation and is dependent on the type of high-sugar environment.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Other yeasts' growth is dependent on the pH and nutrients of the high-sugar environment.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Kathryn M.|last2=Liu|first2=Ping|last3=Fay|first3=Justin C.|date=2015-08-01|title=Evolution of ecological dominance of yeast species in high-sugar environments|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12707/abstract|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=69|issue=8|pages=2079–2093|doi=10.1111/evo.12707|issn=1558-5646|pmc=4751874|pmid=26087012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genomic basis of the crabtree effect ==
The genomic basis of the crabtree effect is still being investigated, and its evolution likely involved multiple successive molecular steps that increased the efficiency of the lifestyle.

=== Expansion of hexose transporter genes ===
[[Glucose transporter|Hexose transporters]] (HXT) are a group of proteins that are largely responsible for the uptake of glucose in yeast.  In ''S. cerevisiae'', 20 ''HXT'' genes have been identified and 17 encode for glucose transporters (''HXT1-HXT17''), ''GAL2'' encodes for a galactose transporter, and ''SNF3'' and ''RGT2'' encode for glucose sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boles|first=E.|last2=Hollenberg|first2=C. P.|date=1997-08-01|title=The molecular genetics of hexose transport in yeasts|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|volume=21|issue=1|pages=85–111|issn=0168-6445|pmid=9299703|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.1997.tb00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of glucose sensor genes have remained mostly consistent through the budding yeast lineage, however glucose sensors are absent from ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]''.  ''Sch. pombe'' is a Crabtree-positive yeast, which developed aerobic fermentation independently from ''Saccharomyces'' lineage, and detects glucose via the cAMP-signaling pathway.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The number of transporter genes vary significantly between yeast species and has continually increased during the evolution of the ''S. cerevisiae'' lineage.  Most of the transporter genes have been generated by tandem duplication, rather than from the WGD.  ''Sch. pombe'' also has a high number of transporter genes compared to its close relatives.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Glucose uptake is believed to be a major rate-limiting step in glycolysis and replacing ''S. cerevisiae''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ''HXT1-17'' genes with a single chimera ''HXT'' gene results in decreased ethanol production or fully respiratory metabolism.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Thus, having an efficient glucose uptake system appears to be essential to ability of aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  There is a significant positive correlation between the number of hexose transporter genes and the efficiency of ethanol production.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== CNV in glycolysis genes ===
[[File:Ethanol Fermentation english.png|thumb|A scheme of transformation of glucose to alcohol by alcoholic fermentation.]]
After a WGD, one of the duplicated gene pair is often lost through fractionation; less than 10% of WGD gene pairs have remained in ''S. cerevisiae'' genome.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  A little over half of WGD gene pairs in the [[glycolysis]] reaction pathway were retained in post-WGD species, significantly higher than the overall retention rate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  This has been associated with an increased ability to metabolize glucose into pyruvate, or higher rate of glycolysis.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  After glycolysis, pyruvate can either be further broken down by [[pyruvate decarboxylase]] (Pdc) or [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] (Pdh).  The kinetics of the enzymes are such that when pyruvate concentrations are high, due to a high rate of glycolysis, there is increased flux through Pdc and thus the fermentation pathway.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The WGD is believed to have played a beneficial role in the evolution of the Crabtree effect in post-WGD species partially due to this increase in copy number of glycolysis genes.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== CNV in fermentation genes ===
The fermentation reaction only involves two steps.  Pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde by Pdc and then acetaldehyde is converted to ethanol by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (Adh).  There is no significant increase in the number of ''Pdc'' genes in Crabtree-positive compared to Crabtree-negative species and no correlation between number of ''Pdc'' genes and efficiency of fermentation.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55013-3_5|title=Comparative Genomics and Evolutionary Genetics of Yeast Carbon Metabolism|last=Lin|first=Zhenguo|last2=Li|first2=Wen-Hsiung|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642550126|editor-last=Piškur|editor-first=Jure|pages=97–120|language=en|editor-last2=Compagno|editor-first2=Concetta}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are five ''Adh'' genes in ''S. cerevisiae''.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Adh1 is the major enzyme responsible for catalyzing the fermentation step from acetaldehyde to ethanol.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Adh2 catalyzes the reverse reaction, consuming ethanol and converting it to acetaldehyde.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The ancestral, or original, Adh had a similar function as Adh1 and after a duplication in this gene, Adh2 evolved a lower K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; for ethanol.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Adh2 is believed to have increased yeast species' tolerance for ethanol and allowed Crabtree-positive species to consume the ethanol they produced after depleting sugars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  However, Adh2 and consumption of ethanol is not essential for aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  ''Sch. pombe'' and other Crabtree positive species do not have the ''ADH2''  gene and consumes ethanol very poorly.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Differential expression ===
In Crabtree-negative species, respiration related genes are highly expressed in the presence of oxygen.  However, when ''S. cerevisiae'' is grown on glucose in aerobic conditions, respiration-related gene expression is repressed.  Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins expression is only induced under environmental stress conditions, specifically low glucose availability.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Genes involving mitochondrial energy generation and phosphorylation oxidation, which are involved in respiration, have the largest expression difference between aerobic fermentative yeast species and respiratory species.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  In a comparative analysis between ''Sch. pombe'' and ''S. cerevisiae'', both of which evolved aerobic fermentation independently, the expression pattern of these two fermentative yeasts were more similar to each other than a respiratory yeast, ''C. albicans''.  However, ''S. cerevisiae'' is evolutionarily closer to ''C. albicans''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Regulatory rewiring was likely important in the evolution of aerobic fermentation in both lineages.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Domestication and aerobic fermentation ==
[[File:Wine Grapes with dusting that contains yeast.jpg|thumb|A close up picture of ripening wine grapes. The light white "dusting" is a film that also contains wild yeasts.]]
Aerobic fermentation is also essential for multiple industries, resulting in human domestication of several yeast strains.  Beer and other alcoholic beverages, throughout human history, have played a significant role in society through drinking rituals, providing nutrition, medicine, and uncontaminated water.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Legras|first=Jean-Luc|last2=Merdinoglu|first2=Didier|last3=Cornuet|first3=Jean-Marie|last4=Karst|first4=Francis|date=2007-05-01|title=Bread, beer and wine: Saccharomyces cerevisiae diversity reflects human history|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=16|issue=10|pages=2091–2102|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03266.x|issn=0962-1083|pmid=17498234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the domestication process, organisms shift from natural environments that are more variable and complex to simple and stable environments with a constant substrate. This often favors specialization adaptations in domesticated microbes, associated with relaxed selection for non-useful genes in alternative metabolic strategies or pathogenicity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Domestication might be partially responsible for the traits that promote aerobic fermentation in industrial species.  Introgression and HGT is common in ''Saccharomyces'' domesticated strains.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Many commercial wine strains have significant portions of their DNA derived from HGT of non-''Saccharomyces'' species.  HGT and introgression are less common in nature than is seen during domestication pressures.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  For example, the important industrial yeast strain ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'', is an interspecies hybrid of ''S. cerevisiae'' and the cold tolerant ''[[Saccharomyces eubayanus|S. eubayanus]].''&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;  This hybrid is commonly used in lager-brewing, which requires slow, low temperature fermentation.&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;

== Aerobic fermentation in non-yeast species ==

=== Plants ===
Alcoholic fermentation is often used by plants in anaerobic conditions to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and regenerate [[NAD+|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] to allow for glycolysis to continue.  For most plant tissues, fermentation only occurs in anaerobic conditions, but there are a few exceptions.  In the pollen of [[maize]] (''Zea mays'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadege|first=Million|last2=Dupuis|first2=Isabelle|last3=Kuhlemeier|first3=Cris|date=1999-08-01|title=Ethanolic fermentation: new functions for an old pathway|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138599014508|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=4|issue=8|pages=320–325|doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(99)01450-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tobacco]] (''Nicotiana tabacum'' &amp; ''Nicotiana plumbaginifolia''), the fermentation enzyme ADH is abundant, regardless of the oxygen level.  In tobacco pollen, PDC is also highly expressed in this tissue and transcript levels are not influenced by oxygen concentration.  Tobacco pollen, similar to Crabtree-positive yeast, perform high levels of fermentation dependent on the sugar supply, and not oxygen availability.  In these tissues, respiration and alcoholic fermentation occur simultaneously with high sugar availability.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tadege|first=M.|last2=Kuhlemeier|first2=C.|date=1997-10-01|title=Aerobic fermentation during tobacco pollen development|journal=Plant Molecular Biology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=343–354|issn=0167-4412|pmid=9349258|doi=10.1023/A:1005837112653}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fermentation produces the toxic acetaldehyde and ethanol, that can build up in large quantities during pollen development.  It has been hypothesized that acetaldehyde is a pollen factor that causes [[cytoplasmic male sterility]].  Cytoplasmic male sterility is a trait observed in maize, tobacco and other plants in which there is an inability to produce viable pollen.  It is believed that this trait might be due to the expression of the fermentation genes, ADH and PDC, a lot earlier on in pollen development than normal and the accumulation of toxic aldehyde.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Trypanosomatids ===
When grown in glucose-rich media, [[Trypanosomatida|trypanosomatid]] parasites degrade glucose via aerobic fermentation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In this group, this phenomenon is not a pre-adaptation to/or remnant of anaerobic life, shown through their inability to survive in anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  It is believed that this phenomenon developed due to the capacity for a high glycolytic flux and the high glucose concentrations of their natural environment.  The mechanism for repression of respiration in these conditions is not yet known.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bringaud|first=Frédéric|last2=Rivière|first2=Loïc|last3=Coustou|first3=Virginie|date=2006-09-01|title=Energy metabolism of trypanosomatids: Adaptation to available carbon sources|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166685106001150|journal=Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology|volume=149|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/j.molbiopara.2006.03.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''E. coli'' mutant ===
A couple ''Escherichia coli'' mutant strains have been bioengineered to ferment glucose under aerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One group developed the ECOM3 (''E. coli'' cytochrome oxidase mutant) strain by removing three terminal cytochrome oxidases (cydAB, cyoABCD, and cbdAB) to reduce oxygen uptake.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  After 60 days of adaptive evolution on glucose media, the strain displayed a mixed phenotype.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  In aerobic conditions, some populations' fermentation solely produced lactate, while others did mixed-acid fermentation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;[[File:Warburgh Effect.gif|thumb|Myc and HIF-1 regulate glucose metabolism and stimulate the Warburg effect.]]

=== Tumor cells ===
One of the hallmarks of cancer is altered metabolism or deregulating cellular energetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanahan|first=Douglas|date=4 March 2011|title=Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411001279|journal=Cell|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013|pmid=21376230|access-date=|volume=144|pages=646–674}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cancers cells often have reprogrammed their glucose metabolism to perform lactic acid fermentation, in the presence of oxygen, rather than send the pyruvate made through glycolysis to the mitochondria. This is referred to as the [[Warburg effect (oncology)|Warburg effect]], and is associated with high consumption of glucose and a high rate of glycolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warburg|first=Prof Otto|date=1925-03-01|title=über den Stoffwechsel der Carcinomzelle|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01726151|journal=Klinische Wochenschrift|language=de|volume=4|issue=12|pages=534–536|doi=10.1007/BF01726151|issn=0023-2173}}&lt;/ref&gt;   ATP production in these cancer cells is often only through the process of glycolysis and pyruvate is broken down by the fermentation process in the cell's cytoplasm.  This phenomenon is often seen as counterintuitive, since cancer cells have higher energy demands due to the continued proliferation and respiration produces significantly more ATP than glycolysis alone (fermentation produces no additional ATP).  Typically, there is an up-regulation in glucose transporters and enzymes in the glycolysis pathway (also seen in yeast).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diaz-Ruiz|first=Rodrigo|last2=Rigoulet|first2=Michel|last3=Devin|first3=Anne|title=The Warburg and Crabtree effects: On the origin of cancer cell energy metabolism and of yeast glucose repression|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005272810006869|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics|volume=1807|issue=6|pages=568–576|doi=10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many parallel aspects of aerobic fermentation in tumor cells that are also seen in Crabtree-positive yeasts. Further research into the evolution of aerobic fermentation in yeast such as ''S. cerevisiae'' can be a useful model for understanding aerobic fermentation in tumor cells.  This has a potential for better understanding cancer and cancer treatments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5930">'''Bioconversion''', also known as ''biotransformation'', is the conversion of organic materials, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or [[energy source]]s by biological processes or agents, such as certain microorganisms. One example is the industrial production of [[cortisone]], which one step is the bioconversion of [[progesterone]] to 11-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone by ''[[Rhizopus nigricans]].'' Another example is the [[Bioconversion of Glycerol to 1,3-Propanediol|bioconversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol]], which is part of scientific research for many decades.

Another example of bioconversion is the [[Conversion (chemistry)|conversion]] of [[organic material]]s, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or [[energy source]]s by biological processes or agents, such as certain [[microorganism]]s, some [[detritivore]]s or [[enzyme]]s.

In the USA, the Bioconversion Science and Technology group performs multidisciplinary R&amp;D for the [[United_States_Department_of_Energy|Department of Energy]]'s (DOE) relevant applications of bioprocessing, especially with biomass. Bioprocessing combines the disciplines of chemical engineering, microbiology and biochemistry. The Group 's primary role is investigation of the use of microorganism, microbial consortia and microbial enzymes in bioenergy research. New [[cellulosic ethanol]] conversion processes have enabled the variety and volume of [[feedstock]] that can be bioconverted to expand rapidly. Feedstock now includes materials derived from plant or animal waste such as paper, auto-fluff, tires, fabric, construction materials, [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW), [[sludge]], [[sewage]], etc.

==Three different processes for bioconversion==
1 -''' Enzymatic hydrolysis''' - a single source of feedstock, switchgrass for example, is mixed with strong enzymes which convert a portion of cellulosic material into sugars which can then be fermented into ethanol. [[Genencor]] and [[Novozymes]] are two companies that have received United States government Department of Energy funding for research into reducing the cost of cellulase, a key enzyme in the production cellulosic ethanol by this process.

2 - '''Synthesis gas fermentation''' - a blend of feedstock, not exceeding 30% water, is [[gasified]] in a closed environment into a [[syngas]] containing mostly carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The cooled syngas is then converted into usable products through exposure to bacteria or other catalysts. BRI Energy, LLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brienergy.com/|title=Clean Technology for Renewable Energy|website=www.brienergy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a company whose pilot plant in Fayetteville, Arkansas is currently using synthesis gas fermentation to convert a variety of waste into ethanol. After gasification, anaerobic bacteria  (''[[Clostridium ljungdahlii]]'') are used to convert the syngas ([[carbon monoxide|CO]], [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) into ethanol. The heat generated by gasification is also used to co-generate excess electricity.

'''Biomass heating systems''' generate heat from [[biomass]].&lt;br&gt;
The systems fall under the categories of:
*direct [[combustion]],
*[[gasification]],
*[[combined heat and power]] (CHP),
*[[anaerobic digestion]],
*[[aerobic digestion]].

==Benefits of biomass heating==
The use of biomass in [[heating system]]s is beneficial because it uses agricultural, forest, urban and industrial residues and waste to produce heat and electricity with less effect on the [[Natural environment|environment]] than fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vallios | first1 = I | last2 = Tsoutsos | first2 = T | last3 = Papadakis | first3 = G | year = 2009 | title = Design of Biomass District Heating | url = | journal = Biomass &amp; Bioenergy | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 659–678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of energy production has a limited long-term effect on the environment because the carbon in biomass is part of the natural [[carbon cycle]]; while the carbon in fossil fuels is not, and permanently adds carbon to the environment when burned for fuel ([[carbon footprint]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Wood Fuelled Heating |url= http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Wood-fuelled-heating |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716153317/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Wood-fuelled-heating |archivedate= 16 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, before the use of [[fossil fuels]] in significant quantities, biomass in the form of [[wood fuel]] provided most of humanity's heating.

==Drawbacks of biomass heating==
On a large scale, the use of biomass removes [[agricultural land]] from [[food production]], reduces the [[carbon sequestration]] capacity of forests, and extracts [[soil nutrient|nutrients]] from the soil. Combustion of biomass creates [[air pollutant]]s and adds significant quantities of carbon to the atmosphere that may not be returned to the soil for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/governance/scientific-committee/sc-opinions/opinions-on-scientific-issues/sc-opinion-on-greenhouse-gas |title=Opinion of the EEA Scientific Committee on Greenhouse Gas Accounting in Relation to Bioenergy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of [[carbon monoxide]], [[NOx]] (nitrogen oxides), VOCs ([[volatile organic compound]]s), particulates and other pollutants, in some cases at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal |title=George Lopez visits the Fox Theatre |publisher=Michigan Messenger |date=22 February 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205080916/http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal |archivedate=5 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1892127 | pmid=17589590 | doi=10.1289/ehp.9479 | volume=115 | issue=6 | title=Household air pollution from coal and biomass fuels in China: measurements, health impacts, and interventions |date=June 2007 | journal=Environ. Health Perspect. | pages=848–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black carbon]] – a pollutant created by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass – is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming.&lt;ref&gt;''2009 State of the World, Into a Warming World'','''Worldwatch Institute''', 56–57, {{ISBN|978-0-393-33418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 a Swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in South Asia determined that it had been principally produced by biomass burning, and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning.&lt;ref&gt;''Science'', '''2009''', 323, 495&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers measured a significant concentration of [[Carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]], which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;''Biomass burning leads to Asian brown cloud'', [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]], '''87''', 4, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

On combustion, the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as [[carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]]. The amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50% by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~jcjenkin/smith%20et%20al.%202003.pdf |title=Forest volume-to-biomass models and estimates of mass for live and standing dead trees of U.S. forests |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711174829/http://www.uvm.edu/~jcjenkin/smith%20et%20al.%202003.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When from agricultural sources, plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth. When the biomass is from forests, the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer, and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed.&lt;ref name="fao-prasad"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prasad|first=Ram|title=SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT FOR DRY FORESTS OF SOUTH ASIA|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/X6895E/x6895e04.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foeitreetr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treetrouble: Testimonies on the Negative Impact of Large-scale Tree Plantations prepared for the sixth Conference of the Parties of the Framework Convention on Climate Change|url=http://www.foei.org/en/resources/forests/treetrouble.html|publisher=Friends of the Earth International|accessdate=11 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726122033/http://www.foei.org/en/resources/forests/treetrouble.html|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usda-laihoetal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of intensive forestry on early rotation trends in site carbon pools in the southeastern US|url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/5295|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=11 August 2010|author=Laiho, Raija|author2=Sanchez, Felipe |author3=Tiarks, Allan |author4=Dougherty, Phillip M. |author5= Trettin, Carl C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fao-towsusman"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FEASIBILITY OF SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/X4107E/X4107E04.htm#P866_112288|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biomass-is-carbon-neutral proposal put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas. When a tree’s carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Biomass heating in our world==
[[File:Olarizu - Casa de la Dehesa - Central de biomasa 01.jpg|thumb|Biomass heating system for one building complex in the Spanish Basque Country]]
The [[oil price increases since 2003]] and consequent price increases for natural gas and coal have increased the value of biomass for heat generation. Forest renderings, agricultural waste, and [[energy crop|crops grown specifically for energy]] production become competitive as the prices of [[Energy density|energy dense]] fossil fuels rise.  Efforts to develop this potential may have the effect of [[Land reclamation#Repairing damaged land|regenerating mismanaged croplands]] and be a cog in the wheel of a decentralized, multi-dimensional [[renewable energy industry]].  Efforts to promote and advance these methods became common throughout the [[European Union]] through the 2000s. In other areas of the world, inefficient and polluting means to generate heat from biomass coupled with poor forest practices have significantly added to [[environmental degradation]].

==Buffer tanks==

Buffer tanks store the hot water the biomass appliance generates and circulates it around the heating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treco.co.uk/products/type/buffertank/2|title=Buffer Tanks and Hot Water Storage - Treco|website=www.treco.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as 'thermal stores', they are crucial for the efficient operation of all biomass boilers where the system loading fluctuates rapidly, or the volume of water in the complete hydraulic system is relatively small. Using a suitably sized buffer vessel prevents rapid cycling of the boiler when the loading is below the minimum boiler output. Rapid cycling of the boiler causes a large increase in harmful emissions such as [[Carbon monoxide]], dust, and [[NOx]], greatly reduces boiler efficiency and increases electrical consumption of the unit. In addition, service and maintenance requirements will be increased as parts are stressed by rapid heating and cooling cycles. Although most boilers claim to be able to turn down to 30% of nominal output, in the real world this is often not achievable due to differences in the fuel from the 'ideal' or test fuel. A suitably sized buffer tank should therefore be considered where the loading of the boiler drops below 50% of the nominal output – in other words unless the biomass component is purely base load, the system should include a buffer tank. In any case where the secondary system does not contain sufficient water for safe removal of residual heat from the biomass boiler irrespective of the loading conditions, the system must include a suitably sized buffer tank. The [[residual heat]] from a biomass unit varies greatly depending on the boiler design and the thermal mass of the combustion chamber. Light weight, fast response boilers require only 10L/kW, while industrial wet wood units with very high thermal mass require 40L/kW.&lt;ref name="Buffer tanks"&gt;{{cite web |title=Buffer tanks |url= http://www.mbaxterbiomass.co.uk/services/buffer.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of biomass heating systems==
[[File:Biomasseheizwerk Spillern Nordansicht.jpg|thumb|Biomass [[Heat-only boiler station|heating plant]] in Austria; the heat power is about 1000 kW]]

The use of Biomass in heating systems has a use in many different types of buildings, and all have different uses. There are four main types of heating systems that use biomass to heat a boiler. The types are Fully Automated, Semi-Automated, Pellet-Fired, and Combined Heat and Power.

===Fully automated===
In fully automated systems chipped or ground up waste wood is brought to the site by delivery trucks and dropped into a holding tank. A system of conveyors then transports the wood from the holding tank to the boiler at a certain managed rate. This rate is managed by computer controls and a laser that measures the load of fuel the conveyor is bringing in. The system automatically goes on and off to maintain the pressure and temperature within the boiler. Fully automated systems offer a great deal of ease in their operation because they only require the operator of the system to control the computer, and not the transport of wood while offering comprehensive and cost effective solutions to complex industrial challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sigmathermal.com/automation|title=Automation: Combustion Control &amp; Burner Management Systems|newspaper=Sigma Thermal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Biomass Heating Systems |url= http://www.hurstboiler.com/biomass_boiler_systems/heating_system_types/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-automated or "surge bin"===
Semi-automated or "Surge Bin" systems are very similar to fully automated systems except they require more manpower to keep operational. They have smaller holding tanks, and a much simpler conveyor systems which will require personnel to maintain the systems operation. The reasoning for the changes from the fully automated system is the efficiency of the system. The heat created by the combustor can be used to directly heat the air or it can be used to heat water in a boiler system which acts as the medium by which the heat is delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://selectedecoenergy.co.uk/biomass-system-design/|title=Biomass System Design - Selected Eco Energy|newspaper=Selected Eco Energy|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood fire fueled boilers are most efficient when they are running at their highest capacity, and the heat required most days of the year will not be the peak heat requirement for the year. Considering that the system will only need to run at a high capacity a few days of the year, it is made to meet the requirements for the majority of the year to maintain its high efficiency.&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"/&gt;

===Pellet-fired===
The third main type of biomass heating systems are [[Pellet fuel|pellet]]-fired systems. Pellets are a processed form of wood, which make them more expensive. Although they are more expensive, they are much more condensed and uniform, and therefore are more efficient. Further, it is relatively easy to automatically feed pellets to boilers.  In these systems, the pellets are stored in a grain-type storage silo, and gravity is used to move them to the boiler. The storage requirements are much smaller for pellet-fired systems because of their condensed nature, which also helps cut down costs. these systems are used for a wide variety of facilities, but they are most efficient and cost effective for places where space for storage and conveyor systems is limited, and where the pellets are made fairly close to the facility.&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"/&gt;

====Agricultural pellet systems====
One subcategory of pellet systems are boilers or burners capable of burning pellet with higher ash rate (paper pellets, hay pellets, [[straw pellets]]). One of this kind is PETROJET pellet burner with rotating cylindrical burning chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horakypetrojet.cz/news/great-results-from-swedish-testing-laboratory |title=Great results from Swedish testing laboratory &amp;#124; Petrojet Trade s.r.o |publisher=Horakypetrojet.cz }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of efficiencies advanced pellet boilers can exceed other forms of biomass because of the more stable fuel charataristics. Advanced pellet boilers can even work in condensing mode and cool down combustion gases to 30-40&amp;nbsp;°C, instead of 120&amp;nbsp;°C before sent into the flue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okofen.co.uk/en/pellematic_plus/#tab2|title=Okofen condesing pellet boiler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined heat and power===
[[Combined heat and power]] systems are very useful systems in which wood waste, such as [[wood chips]], is used to generate power, and heat is created as a byproduct of the power generation system. They have a very high cost because of the high pressure operation. Because of this high pressure operation, the need for a highly trained operator is mandatory, and will raise the cost of operation. Another drawback is that while they produce electricity they will produce heat, and if producing heat is not desirable for certain parts of the year, the addition of a cooling tower is necessary, and will also raise the cost.

There are certain situations where CHP is a good option. Wood product manufacturers would use a combined heat and power system because they have a large supply of waste wood, and a need for both heat and power. Other places where these systems would be optimal are hospitals and prisons, which need energy, and heat for hot water. These systems are sized so that they will produce enough heat to match the average heat load so that no additional heat is needed, and a cooling tower is not needed.&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"/&gt;

Initiatives that increase the availability of books by such measures as [[bookmobiles]] and librarians on bicycles have been offered as possible solutions to book deserts, as have [[Little Free Library|Little Free Libraries]] and offering children's literature available online, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ur9ep9bn4s.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Literacy+initiative+aims+to+eliminate+%27book+deserts%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Dayton+Daily+News&amp;rft.au=ByJeff+Gilbert&amp;rft.date=2016-06-26&amp;rft.pub=CMG+Corporate+Services%2C+Inc.+on+behalf+of+itself+and+the+Newspapers&amp;rft.issn=0897-0920&amp;rft.externalDocID=4100425741&amp;paramdict=en-US|title=Literacy initiative aims to eliminate 'book deserts'|last=Gilbert|first=Jeff|date=June 26, 2016|work=Dayton Daily News|subscription=yes|access-date=August 6, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and research ==
In the past, researchers have studied how the absence or scarcity of books impact how a child's early [[literacy]] and language skills develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=M. D. R.|last2=Kelley|first2=Jonathan|last3=Sikora|first3=Joanna|last4=Treiman|first4=Donald J.|date=2010-06-01|title=Family scholarly culture and educational success: Books and schooling in 27 nations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562410000090|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=28|issue=2|pages=171–197|doi=10.1016/j.rssm.2010.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/blog/2196_a_book_of_their_own_how_owning_books_affects_childrens_literacy|title=A book of their own: how owning books affects children's literacy|last=Poulton|first=Lizzie|date=July 7, 2010|website=Literacy Trust|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "book desert" came into regular use in the mid-2010s and the [[social enterprise]] [http://www.uniteforliteracy.com Unite for Literacy] is credited as having coined the term.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unite for Literacy created an operational definition of a book desert when they published the U.S. Book Desert Map: A geographic area (country, state, county, census tract) where it is predicted that a majority of homes have less than 100 printed books. In March 2014, James LaRue, director of the [[American Library Association]]'s Office for [[Intellectual Freedom]] and the [[Freedom to Read Foundation]], used the term in an issue of ''[[American Libraries]]'', where he described the term as applying to houses with 25 or fewer books in them and discussed ways to lessen or eradicate the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/blogs/e-content/the-price-is-right-at-unite-for-literacy/|title=The Price Is Right at Unite for Literacy|last=LaRue|first=James|date=March 4, 2014|website=American Libraries Magazine|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, professors [[Susan B. Neuman]] and Naomi Moland published a study in ''[[Urban Education]]'', where they examined how the lack of printed reading material among low-income and poverty stricken neighborhoods impacts early childhood development and used the term to describe areas and homes with little access to written materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This study built upon other research Neuman had conducted in 2001 on the same topic and the researchers found few stores in [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]; the focus areas of their research had print resources for children ages 0 through 18.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/where-books-are-nonexistent/491282/|title=The Children Who Grow Up in 'Book Deserts'|last=Wong|first=Alia|date=July 14, 2016|website=The Atlantic|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those stores, many were [[dollar stores]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''The Atlantic'' reported that in 2015 Neuman and [[JetBlue|JetBlue Airways]] held an experiment to foster literacy by providing book vending machines in a low-income Washington D.C. neighborhood. Over 20,000 books were given away, prompting Neuman to conclude that the neighborhood's parents did care about their children's education but lacked "the resources to enable their children to be successful."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Contributing factors ===
Multiple factors are credited as contributing to the formation of book deserts, the most frequently highlighted of which tends to be poverty and low income. Other factors tend to include language and geography, as some areas lack access to bookstores or public or community school libraries that would provide books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wkbn.com/2016/07/29/warren-group-works-to-fight-book-desert-phenomenon/|title=Warren group works to fight 'book desert' phenomenon|last=Santelli|first=James|date=July 30, 2016|website=WKBN|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bookselling|Book store]] closures due to [[bankruptcy]] or other financial difficulties are also occasionally cited as a contributing factor, when the closure leaves the area without a bookseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;u=drexel_main&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A286307818&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=drexel_main&amp;authCount=1|title=Store closures create US 'book deserts'|last=Gelles|first=David|date=April 14, 2012|work=The Financial Times|subscription=yes|access-date=August 6, 2016|via=Academic OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unite Book Desert Map.jpg|thumb|US Book Desert map from Unite for Literacy]]

Unite for Literacy has developed a book desert map of the [[United States]] powered by [[Esri]]'s ArcGIS platform, which provides a visual presentation of the lack of books in the nation, states, counties and [[census tract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniteforliteracy.com/corp/esri&lt;/ref&gt; To create the map, Unite for Literacy performed a statistical analyses of data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the American Community Survey. Data used in the map includes the number of books in 4th graders' homes, average community income, ethnic diversity, geographic location and home language. Unite for Literacy unveiled the map during the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] America (CGI America) meeting held in Denver, Colorado, in June 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15901">In [[mathematics]], especially [[vector calculus]] and [[differential topology]], a '''closed form''' is a [[differential form]] ''α'' whose [[exterior derivative]] is zero ({{nowrap|1=''dα'' = 0}}), and an '''exact form''' is a differential form, ''α'', that is the exterior derivative of another differential form ''β''.  Thus, an ''exact'' form is in the ''[[image (mathematics)|image]]'' of ''d'', and a ''closed'' form is in the ''[[kernel (algebra)|kernel]]'' of ''d''.

For an exact form ''α'', {{nowrap|1=''α'' = ''dβ''}} for some differential form ''β'' of degree one less than that of ''α''. The form ''β'' is called a "potential form" or "primitive" for ''α''. Since the exterior derivative of a closed form is zero, ''β'' is not unique, but can be modified by the addition of any closed form of degree one less than that of ''α''.

Because {{nowrap|1=''d''{{i sup|2}} = 0}}, any exact form is necessarily closed. The question of whether ''every'' closed form is exact depends on the [[topology]] of the domain of interest.  On a [[Contractible space|contractible]] domain, every closed form is exact by the [[#Poincaré lemma|Poincaré lemma]]. More general questions of this kind on an arbitrary [[differentiable manifold]] are the subject of [[de Rham cohomology]], which allows one to obtain purely [[algebraic topology|topological]] information using differential methods.

== Examples ==
{{details|Winding number}}
[[File:Irrotationalfield.svg|thumb|Vector field corresponding to ''dθ''.]]
A simple example of a form which is closed but not exact is the 1-form &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is an abuse of notation. The argument &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not a well-defined function, and &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not the differential of any zero-form. The discussion that follows elaborates on this.&lt;/ref&gt; given by the derivative of [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] on the [[punctured plane]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^2\setminus\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not actually a function (see the next paragraph) &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not an exact form. Still, &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; has vanishing derivative and is therefore closed.

Note that the argument &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is only defined up to an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; since a single point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be assigned different arguments &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r+2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, etc. We can assign arguments in a locally consistent manner around &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, but not in a globally consistent manner. This is because if we trace a loop from &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; counterclockwise around the origin and back to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, the argument increases by &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Generally, the argument &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; changes by
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{S^1} d\theta&lt;/math&gt;
over a counter-clockwise oriented loop &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;.

Even though the argument &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not technically a function, the different ''local'' definitions of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; differ from one another by constants. Since the derivative at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; only uses local data, and since functions that differ by a constant have the same derivative, the argument has a globally well-defined derivative "&lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt;".&lt;ref group=note&gt;The article [[covering space|covering spaces]] has more information on the mathematics of functions that are only locally well-defined.&lt;/ref&gt;

The upshot is that &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a one-form on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^2\setminus\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; that is not actually the derivative of any well-defined function &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is not ''exact''. Explicitly, &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given as:
:&lt;math&gt;d\theta = \frac{-y\,dx + x\,dy}{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;,
which by inspection has derivative zero. Because &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt; has vanishing derivative, we say that it is ''closed''.

This form generates the de Rham cohomology group &lt;math&gt;H^1_{dR}(\mathbf{R}^2\setminus\{0\}) \cong \mathbf{R},&lt;/math&gt; meaning that any closed form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of an exact form &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; and a multiple of &lt;math&gt;d\theta:&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\omega = df + k\ d\theta,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{k = \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint_{S^1} \omega}&lt;/math&gt; accounts for a non-trivial contour integral around the origin, which is the only obstruction to a closed form on the punctured plane (locally the derivative of a [[function (mathematics)|potential function]]) being the derivative of a globally defined function.

==Examples in low dimensions==

Differential forms in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; were well known in the [[mathematical physics]] of the nineteenth century. In the plane, 0-forms are just functions, and 2-forms are functions times the basic area element {{nowrap|''dx'' ∧ ''dy''}}, so that it is the 1-forms

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = f(x,y) \, dx + g(x,y) \, dy&lt;/math&gt;

that are of real interest. The formula for the [[exterior derivative]] ''d'' here is

:&lt;math&gt; d \alpha = (g_x-f_y) \, dx\wedge dy&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripts denote [[partial derivative]]s. Therefore the condition for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to be ''closed'' is

:&lt;math&gt; f_y=g_x.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case if {{nowrap|''h''(''x'', ''y'')}} is a function then

:&lt;math&gt; dh = h_x \, dx + h_y \, dy.&lt;/math&gt;

The implication from 'exact' to 'closed' is then a consequence of the [[symmetry of second derivatives]], with respect to ''x'' and ''y''.

The [[gradient theorem]] asserts that a 1-form is exact if and only if the line integral of the form depends only on the endpoints of the curve, or equivalently,
if the integral around any smooth closed curve is zero.

===Vector field analogies===
On a [[Riemannian manifold]], or more generally a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], ''k''-forms correspond to ''k''-vector fields (by [[musical isomorphism | duality via the metric]]), so there is a notion of a vector field corresponding to a closed or exact form.

In 3 dimensions, an exact vector field (thought of as a 1-form) is called a [[conservative vector field]], meaning that it is the derivative ([[gradient]]) of a 0-form (smooth scalar field), called the [[scalar potential]]. A closed vector field (thought of as a 1-form) is one whose derivative ([[curl (mathematics)|curl]]) vanishes, and is called an [[irrotational vector field]].

Thinking of a vector field as a 2-form instead, a closed vector field is one whose derivative ([[divergence]]) vanishes, and is called an [[incompressible flow]] (sometimes [[solenoidal vector field]]).

The concepts of conservative and incompressible vector fields generalize to ''n'' dimensions, because gradient and divergence generalize to ''n'' dimensions; curl is defined only in three dimensions, thus the concept of irrotational vector field does not generalize in this way.

==Poincaré lemma&lt;!--'Poincaré lemma' redirects here--&gt;==
The '''Poincaré lemma'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; states that if ''B'' is an open ball in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, any smooth closed ''p''-form ''ω'' defined on ''B'' is exact, for any integer ''p'' with {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ''n''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warner|1983|pages=155-156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translating if necessary, it can be assumed that the ball ''B'' has centre 0. Let ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; be the flow on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; defined by {{nowrap|1=''α''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; '''x''' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''s''&lt;/sup&gt; '''x'''}}. For {{nowrap|''s'' ≥ 0}} it carries ''B'' into itself and induces an action on functions and differential forms. 
The derivative of the flow is the vector field ''X'' defined on functions ''f'' by {{nowrap|1=''Xf'' = ''d''(''α''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;''f'')/''ds''|&lt;sub&gt;''s'' = 0&lt;/sub&gt;}}: it is the ''radial vector field'' {{nowrap|1=−''r'' {{sfrac|∂|∂''r''}} = −∑ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|∂|∂''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. The derivative of the flow on forms defines the [[Lie derivative]] with respect to ''X'' given by {{nowrap|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ''d''(''α''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;''ω'') /''ds''|&lt;sub&gt;''s''=0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In particular 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{d\over ds} \alpha_s \omega =\alpha_s L_X \omega,}&lt;/math&gt;

Now define

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{h\omega =-\int_0^\infty \alpha_t\omega \, dt.}&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] we have that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{hL_X\omega=-\int_0^\infty \alpha_t L_X \omega \, dt=-\int_0^\infty {d\over dt} (\alpha_t \omega) \, dt= -[\alpha _t \omega]_0^\infty= \omega.}&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\iota_X}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[interior multiplication]] or contraction by the vector field ''X'', Cartan's formula writes:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{L_X = d\iota_X + \iota_X d.}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that ''d'' commutes with ''h'' (as ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; does with ''d'') we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ hL_X\omega = h (d\iota_X + \iota_X d) \omega = d (h\iota_X \omega) + h \iota_X d \omega =\omega} &lt;/math&gt;.

It now follows that if ''ω'' is closed, i. e. {{nowrap|1=''dω'' = 0}}, then {{nowrap|1=''d''(''h'' ''ι''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''ω'') = ''ω''}}, so that ''ω'' is exact and the Poincaré lemma is proved.

(In the language of [[homological algebra]], {{nowrap|''h'' ∘ ''ι''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a "contracting homotopy".)  

The same method applies to any open set in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; that is star-shaped about 0, i.e. any open set containing 0 and invariant under ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{1 &lt; t &lt; \infty}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example''': In two dimensions the Poincaré lemma can be proved directly for closed 1-forms and 2-forms as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Napier|Ramachandran|2011|pages=443-444}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''p'' ''dx'' + ''q'' ''dy''}} is a closed 1-form on {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'') × (''c'', ''d'')}}, then {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} then {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''q'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g(x,y)=\int_a^x p(t,y)\, dt,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''}}.  Then {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''f'' − ''g''}} must satisfy {{nowrap|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q'' − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The right hand side here is independent of ''x'' since its partial derivative with respect to ''x'' is 0. So 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{h(x,y)=\int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds - g(a,y)=\int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds,}&lt;/math&gt;

and hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f(x,y)=\int_a^x p(t,y)\, dt + \int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds.}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''r'' ''dx'' ∧ ''dy''}} then {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''d''(''a'' ''dx'' + ''b'' ''dy'')}} with {{nowrap|1=''b''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''}}. Thus a solution is given by {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 0}} and 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{b(x,y)=\int_a^x r(t,y) \, dt.}&lt;/math&gt;

==Formulation as cohomology==

When the difference of two closed forms is an exact form, they are said to be '''cohomologous''' to each other.  That is, if ''ζ'' and ''η'' are closed forms, and one can find some ''β'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta - \eta = d\beta&lt;/math&gt;

then one says that ''ζ'' and ''η'' are cohomologous to each other. Exact forms are sometimes said to be '''cohomologous to zero'''. The set of all forms cohomologous to a given form (and thus to each other) is called a [[de Rham cohomology]] class; the general study of such classes is known as [[cohomology]]. It makes no real sense to ask whether a 0-form (smooth function) is exact, since ''d'' increases degree by 1; but the clues from topology suggest that only the zero function should be called "exact". The cohomology classes are identified with [[locally constant]] functions.

Using contracting homotopies similar to the one used in the proof of the Poincaré lemma, it can be shown that de Rham cohomology is homotopy-invariant. In general, non-contractible differentiable manifolds have non-trivial de Rham cohomology. For instance, on the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, parametrized by ''t'' in {{nowrap|[0, 1]}}, the closed 1-form ''dt'' is not exact.

==Application in electrodynamics==

In electrodynamics, the case of the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\vec B(\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt; produced by a stationary electrical current is important. There one deals with the [[vector potential]] &lt;math&gt;\vec A(\mathbf r )&lt;/math&gt; of this field. This case corresponds to {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 2}}, and the defining region is the full &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3\,.&lt;/math&gt;  The   current-density  vector is &lt;math&gt;\vec j\,.&lt;/math&gt; It corresponds to the current two-form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf I :=j_1(x_1,x_2, x_3) \, {\rm d}x_2\wedge {\rm d}x_3+j_2(x_1,x_2, x_3) \, {\rm d}x_3\wedge {\rm d}x_1+j_3(x_1,x_2, x_3) \, {\rm d}x_1\wedge {\rm d}x_2.&lt;/math&gt;

For the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\vec B&lt;/math&gt;  one has analogous results: it corresponds to the induction two-form &lt;math&gt;\Phi_B:=B_1{\rm d}x_2\wedge {\rm d}x_3 +\cdots ,&lt;/math&gt; and can be derived from the vector potential &lt;math&gt;\vec A&lt;/math&gt;, or the corresponding one-form &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \vec B ={\rm curl\,\,}\vec A =\left\{ \frac{\partial A_3}{\partial x_2}-\frac{\partial A_2}{\partial x_3} , \frac{\partial A_1}{\partial x_3}-\frac{\partial A_3}{\partial x_1} ,\frac{\partial A_2}{\partial x_1}-\frac{\partial A_1}{\partial x_2}\right\},\text{ or }\Phi_B={\rm d}\mathbf A.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Thereby the vector potential &lt;math&gt;\vec A&lt;/math&gt;  corresponds to the potential one-form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A:=A_1 \, {\rm d}x_1+A_2 \, {\rm d}x_2+A_3 \, {\rm d}x_3.&lt;/math&gt;

The closedness of the magnetic-induction two-form corresponds to the property of the magnetic field that it is source-free: &amp;nbsp;  &lt;math&gt; {\rm div\,\,}\vec B \equiv 0,&lt;/math&gt; i.e. that there are no magnetic [[Magnetic monopole|monopole]]s.

In a special gauge, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}\vec A{~\stackrel{!}{=}~}0&lt;/math&gt;, this implies for&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3

:&lt;math&gt;A_i(\vec r)
=\int \frac{\mu_0 j_i(\vec r^{\,'})\,\, dx_1'dx_2'dx_3'}{4\pi |\vec r -\vec r^{\,'}|}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

(Here &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, the magnetic vacuum permeability.)

This equation is remarkable, because it corresponds completely to a well-known formula for the ''electrical'' field &lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt;, namely for the ''electrostatic Coulomb potential'' &lt;math&gt;\,\phi (x_1,x_2, x_3)&lt;/math&gt; of a ''charge density'' &lt;math&gt;\rho (x_1,x_2,x_3)&lt;/math&gt;. At this place one can already guess that

*&lt;math&gt;\vec E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec B ,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec j ,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec A&lt;/math&gt;

can be ''unified'' to quantities with six rsp. four nontrivial components, which is the basis of the  [[relativistic invariance]] of the [[Maxwell equations]].

If the condition of stationarity is left, on the ''l.h.s.'' of the above-mentioned  equation one must add, in the equations for &lt;math&gt;A_i\,,&lt;/math&gt;  to the three space coordinates, as a fourth variable also the time ''t'', whereas on the ''r.h.s.'',  in &lt;math&gt;j_i' \,,&lt;/math&gt; the so-called "retarded time", &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;t':=t-\frac{|\vec r -\vec r^{\,'}|}{c}\,,&lt;/math&gt; must be used, i.e. it is added to the argument of the current-density. Finally, as before, one integrates over the three primed space coordinates. (As usual
''c'' is the vacuum velocity of light.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7886">The field of '''conflict early warning''' seeks to forecast the outbreak of [[armed conflict]], or, at minimum, to detect the early escalation of violence, with the objective of preventing the outbreak or the further escalation of violence in order to save lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Rupesinghe |editor1-first=Kumar |editor1-link=Kumar Rupesinghe |editor2-last=Kuroda |editor2-first=Michiko |date=1992 |title=Early warning and conflict resolution |location=New York |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=0312085648 |oclc=25834272 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initial conceptions of conflict early warning materialized in the 1970s and 1980s but the field really emerged on the international policy agenda after the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Nyheim"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Nyheim |first=David |authorlink=David Nyheim |date=18 May 2008 |title=Can violence, war, and state collapse be prevented?

In contrast, quantitative methodologies quantify conflict trends and use mathematical techniques to forecast future trends or "events of interest" (EOIs) such as the onset of conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chadefaux |first=Thomas |date=January 2014 |title=Early warning signals for war in the news |journal=[[Journal of Peace Research]] |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=5–18 |doi=10.1177/0022343313507302 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Chadefaux/publication/256044330_Early_Warning_Signals_for_War_in_the_News/links/0c96052a992664d50d000000.pdf |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Integrated Conflict Early Warning System]] (ICEWS) project at the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) takes this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Brien |first=Sean P. |date=March 2010 |title=Crisis early warning and decision support: contemporary approaches and thoughts on future research |journal=[[International Studies Review]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=87–104 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2486.2009.00914.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some approaches to conflict early warning combine both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, such as [[Swisspeace]]'s formerly operational project called FAST.&lt;ref name="FAST"&gt;{{cite book |last=Krummenacher |first=Heinz |date=2006 |chapter=Computer assisted early warning—the FAST example |editor-last=Trappl |editor-first=Robert |editor-link=Robert Trappl |title=Programming for peace: computer-aided methods for international conflict resolution and prevention |series=Advances in group decision and negotiation |volume=2 |location=Dordrecht |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=71–80 |isbn=1402043775 |oclc=63764074 |doi=10.1007/1-4020-4390-2_4 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6Fv7XFhQgMC&amp;pg=PA71 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The unanticipated events of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973 and that of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 provoked a series of debates over the lack of early warning. The incident over the Falklands had taken the [[United Nations]] completely by surprise and it is said "no map of the islands was available in the Secretariat when the invasion began".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peck |first=Connie |date=1998 |title=Sustainable peace: the role of the UN and regional organizations in preventing conflict |series=Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict series |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=0847685608 |oclc=37180967 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=zycKkwkkzNAC&amp;pg=PA72 72] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial drivers, however, were humanitarian agencies "driven by the need for accurate and timely predictions of refugee flows to enable effective contingency planning".&lt;ref name="Nyheim"/&gt; After the end of the Cold War, political scientists at leading academic institutions began modifying old Cold War models of conflict to understand the onset of new wars. The horrors of the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]] also spurred increased interest in operational conflict early warning systems. The FAST project of Swisspeace&lt;ref name="FAST"/&gt; and the [[Forum on Early Warning and Early Response]] (FEWER) were responses to the [[genocide]].

'''Conservation-reliant species''' are animal or plant [[species]] that require continuing species-specific [[wildlife management]] intervention such as [[Hunting#Wildlife management|predator control]], [[Habitat conservation|habitat management]] and [[Pest control|parasite control]] to survive, even when a self-sustainable recovery in population is achieved.&lt;ref name="NCSE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncseonline.org/Conference/Biodiversity/cms.cfm?id=2396 |title=Endangered Species and Other Conservation Reliant Species |last=J.

== History ==

The term "conservation-reliant species" grew out of the [[conservation biology]] undertaken by ''The Endangered Species Act at Thirty Project'' (launched 2001)&lt;ref name="Goble"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goble |first=Dale |author2=J. Michael Scott |author3=Frank W. Davis |title=The Endangered Species Act at Thirty: Renewing the Conservation Promise |publisher=Island Press |year=2006 |volume=I |pages=xii, 299 |isbn=978-1-59726-009-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vEh7m1k5WMwC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=%22conservation+reliant+species%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its popularization by project leader [[J. Michael Scott]].&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=J. Michael |date=Jan 2007 |title=AOU Conservation Award, 2006 |journal=The Auk |publisher=The American Ornithologists' Union |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=353–355 |issn=0004-8038 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1642/0004-8038%282007%29124%5B353%3AACA%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[353:ACA]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first use in a formal publication was in ''Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment'' in 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Worldwide use of the term has not yet developed and it has not yet appeared in a publication compiled outside North America.&lt;!--?: &lt;ref&gt;Note: See publication information of article references.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Passages of the 1973 [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) carried with it the assumption that endangered species would be delisted as their populations recovered. It assumed they would then thrive under existing regulations and the protections afforded under the ESA would no longer be needed. However, eighty percent of [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species|species currently listed]] under the ESA fail to meet that assumption. To survive, they require species-specific conservation interventions (e.g. control of predators, competitors, nest parasites, prescribed burns, altered hydrological processes, etc.) and thus they are conservation-reliant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.fws.gov/EC/WebSeminarSeries/aug08/information_page.html Conservation Reliant Species: Our New Relationship with Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==

The criteria for assessing whether a species is conservation-reliant are:&lt;ref name="Scott1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://training.fws.gov/EC/WebSeminarSeries/aug08/conservation_reliant_species.pdf |title=Conservation Reliant Species:Our New Relationship with Nature? |last=Scott |first=J. Michael Scott |author2=Dale Goble |author3=Aaron Haines |date=August 21, 2008 |work=CSP3900 Conservation Science Web Conference Series |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Threats to the species’ continued existence are known and treatable.
# The threats are pervasive and recurrent, for example: nest parasites, non-native [[predator]]s, human disturbance.
# The threats render the species at risk of [[extinction]], absent ongoing conservation management.
# Management actions sufficient to counter threats have been identified and can be implemented, for example: [[controlled burn|prescribed fires]], restrictions on grazing or public access, predator or parasite control.
# National, state or local governments, often in cooperation with private or tribal interests, are capable of carrying out the necessary management actions as long as necessary.

== Management actions ==

There are five major areas of management action for conservation of vulnerable species:
# Control of other species may include: control of [[Introduced species#Introduced animals|exotic fauna]], [[Introduced species#Introduced plants|exotic flora]], other native species and [[parasite]]s and [[disease]].
# Control of direct human impacts may include control of [[Grazing#Disadvantages|grazing]], human access, on and [[off-road vehicle]]s, low impact [[recreation]] and illegal collecting and [[poaching]].
# Pollution control may include control of chemical [[Surface runoff|run-off]], [[siltation]], [[water quality]] and use of [[pesticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s.
# Active [[Habitat conservation|habitat management]] may include [[Wildfire suppression|fire management and control]], control of [[Erosion|soil erosion]] and [[waterbody|waterbodies]], habitat [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] and [[Weed control#Organic methods|mechanical vegetation control]].
# Artificial population recruitment may include captive propagation (forced immigration) or [[captive breeding]].&lt;ref name="Scott1"/&gt;

== Case study ==
[[File:Indian Tiger.jpg|thumb|225px|Bengal tiger at [[Bannerghatta National Park]], Bangalore, India.]]

A prominent example is in [[India]], where [[Bengal tiger|tigers]], an [[apex predator]] and the national animal, are considered a conservation-reliant species. This [[keystone species]] can maintain self-sustaining wild populations; however, they require ongoing management actions because threats are pervasive, recurrent and put them at risk of extinction. The origin of these threats are rooted in the changing socio-economic, political and spatial organization of society in India. Tigers have become extinct in some areas because of extrinsic factors such as habitat destruction, poaching, disease, floods, fires and drought, decline of prey species for the same reasons, as well as intrinsic factors such as demographic [[stochastic]]ity and [[genetic deterioration]].

Recognizing the conservation reliance of tigers, [[Project Tiger]] is establishing a national science-based framework for monitoring tiger population trends in order to manage the species more effectively. India now has 28 tiger reserves, located in 17 states. These reserves cover {{convert|37761|km2|sqmi}} including 1.14% of the total land area of the country. These reserves are kept free of biotic disturbances, forestry operations, collection of minor forest products, grazing and human disturbance. The populations of tigers in these reserves now constitute some of the most important tiger source populations in the country.&lt;ref name="Maraj"&gt;{{cite web |last=R Maraj, J Seidensticker |title=Assessment of a Framework for Monitoring Tiger Population Trends in India |url=http://projecttiger.nic.in/whtsnew/Assessment%20of%20a%20framework%20for%20monitoring%20tiger%20population%20trends%20in%20India-%202006.pdf |year=2006 |work=A Report to the IUCN: World Conservation Union and India's Project Tiger |publisher=Govt. of India, Project Tiger |pages=7–9 |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnitude and pace of human impacts on the environment make it unlikely that substantial progress will be made in delisting many species unless the definition of "recovery" includes some form of active management. Preventing delisted species from again being at risk of extinction may require continuing, species-specific management actions. Viewing "recovery" of  "conservation-reliant species" as a continuum of phases rather a simple "recovered/not recovered" status may enhance the ability to manage such species within the framework of the Endangered Species Act. With ongoing loss of habitat, disruption of natural cycles, increasing impacts of non-native invasive species, it is probable that the number of conservation-reliant species will increase.

It has been proposed that development of "recovery management agreements", with legally and biologically defensible contracts would provide for continuing conservation management following delisting. The use of such formalized agreements will facilitate shared management responsibilities between federal wildlife agencies and other federal agencies, and with state, local, and tribal governments, as well as with private entities that have demonstrated the capability to meet the needs of conservation-reliant species.&lt;ref name="Scott2"&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 2005 |title=Recovery of imperiled species under the Endangered Species Act: The need for a new approach |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |publisher=ProQuest-CSA |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=383–89 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7326616&amp;q=%22conservation+reliant+species%22&amp;uid=1014961&amp;setcookie=yes |doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0383:ROISUT]2.0.CO;2 |last1=Scott |first1=J Michael |last2=Goble |first2=Dale D. |last3=Wiens |first3=John A. |last4=Wilcove |first4=David S. |last5=Bean |first5=Michael |last6=Male |first6=Timothy |issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics and chemistry, the '''law of conservation of energy''' states that the total [[energy]] of an [[isolated system]] remains constant, it is said to be [[Conservation law|''conserved'']] over time.&lt;ref name=Feynman2Ch1S2&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Feynman |title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol I |publisher=Addison Wesley  |year=1970 |isbn=978-0 -201-02115-8  |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_04.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. For instance, [[chemical energy]] is [[Energy conversion|converted]] to [[kinetic energy]] when a stick of [[dynamite]] explodes. If one adds up all the forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the [[kinetic energy]] of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite.  Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass; however, [[special relativity]] showed that mass is related to energy and vice versa by ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and science now takes the view that mass–energy is conserved.

Conservation of energy can be rigorously proven by [[Noether's theorem]] as a consequence of [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[time translation symmetry]]; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.

A consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a [[Perpetual motion#Classification|perpetual motion machine of the first kind]] cannot exist, that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Planck, M.

Ogg from the seventh German edition, Longmans, Green &amp; Co., London, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; For systems which do not have [[time translation symmetry]], it may not be possible to define conservation of energy.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gottfried Leibniz]]]]
[[Ancient]] [[philosopher]]s as far back as [[Thales of Miletus]] {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;550 BCE had inklings of the conservation of some underlying substance of which everything is made. However, there is no particular reason to identify this with what we know today as "mass-energy" (for example, Thales thought it was water). [[Empedocles]] (490–430 BCE) wrote that in this universal system, composed of [[Classical element|four roots]] (earth, air, water, fire), "nothing comes to be or perishes";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janko|first=Richard|title=Empedocles, "On Nature"|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|year=2004 |volume=150 |pages=1–26|url=http://ancphil.lsa.umich.edu/-/downloads/faculty/janko/empedocles-nature.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, these elements suffer continual rearrangement.

In 1605, [[Simon Stevinus]] was able to solve a number of problems in statics based on the principle that [[perpetual motion]] was impossible.

In 1638, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] published his analysis of several situations—including the celebrated "interrupted pendulum"—which can be described (in modern language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. Essentially, he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the height from which it falls, and used this observation to infer the idea of inertia. The remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height to which a moving body ascends on a frictionless surface does not depend on the shape of the surface.

In 1669, [[Christian Huygens]] published his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of bodies were both the sum of their linear momentums as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his [[Horologium Oscillatorium]], he gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object cannot lift itself.

The fact that kinetic energy is scalar, unlike linear momentum which is a vector, and hence easier to work with did not escape the attention of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. It was Leibniz during 1676–1689 who first attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with ''motion'' (kinetic energy). Using Huygens' work on collision, Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several [[mass]]es, ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' each with [[velocity]] ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''),
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

was conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the ''[[vis viva]]'' or ''living force'' of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of [[kinetic energy]] in situations where there is no friction. Many [[physicist]]s at that time, such as Newton,  held that the [[conservation of momentum]], which holds even in systems with friction, as defined by the [[momentum]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\!\sum_{i} m_i v_i&lt;/math&gt;

was the conserved ''vis viva''. It was later shown that both quantities are conserved simultaneously, given the proper conditions such as an [[elastic collision]].

In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published his [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]], which was organized around the concept of force and momentum. However, the researchers were quick to recognize that the principles set out in the book, while fine for point masses, were not sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies. Some other principles were also required.

[[File:Daniel Bernoulli 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Daniel Bernoulli]]]]

The law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo, [[Johann Bernoulli|Johann]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]. The former enunciated the principle of [[virtual work]] as used in statics in its full generality in 1715, while the latter based his [[Hydrodynamica]], published in 1738, on this single conservation principle. Daniel's study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate the [[Bernoulli's principle]], which relates the loss to be proportional to the change in hydrodynamic pressure. Daniel also formulated the notion of work and efficiency for hydraulic machines; and he gave a kinetic theory of gases, and linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas.

This focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics, such as the [[D'Alembert's principle]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]],
and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations of mechanics.

[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706  – 1749) proposed and tested the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] in 1722 in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from, equal to the initial potential energy. Earlier workers, including Newton and Voltaire, had all believed that "energy" (so far as they understood the concept at all) was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped from. In classical physics the correct formula is &lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac12 mv^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; is the kinetic energy of an object, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; its mass and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its speed. On this basis, Châtelet proposed that energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat…).&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber, Ruth, editor (2011) ''Émilie du Chatelet between Leibniz and Newton''. Springer. {{ISBN|978-94-007-2074-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arianrhod|first1=Robyn|title=Seduced by logic : Émilie du Châtelet, Mary Somerville, and the Newtonian revolution|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-993161-3|edition=US|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9444991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Engineer]]s such as [[John Smeaton]], [[Peter Ewart]], [[:de:Carl Holtzmann|Carl Holtzmann]], [[Gustave-Adolphe Hirn]] and [[Marc Seguin]] recognized that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and made use of Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some [[chemist]]s such as [[William Hyde Wollaston]]. Academics such as [[John Playfair]] were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but in the 18th and 19th centuries the fate of the lost energy was still unknown.

Gradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of ''vis viva''. In 1783, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] reviewed the two competing theories of ''vis viva'' and [[caloric theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Lavoisier, A.L. &amp; Laplace, P.S. (1780) "Memoir on Heat", ''Académie Royale des Sciences'' pp.&amp;nbsp;4–355&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]]'s 1798 observations of heat generation during the [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]] of [[cannon]]s added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat, and (as importantly) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat). ''Vis viva'' then started to be known as ''energy'', after the term was first used in that sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1807.

[[File:Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]]]]

The recalibration of ''vis viva'' to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {2}\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

which can be understood as converting kinetic energy to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], was largely the result of [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] over the period 1819–1839. The former called the quantity ''quantité de travail'' (quantity of work) and the latter, ''travail mécanique'' (mechanical work), and both championed its use in engineering calculation.

In a paper ''Über die Natur der Wärme''(German "On the Nature of Heat/Warmth"), published in the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' in 1837, [[Karl Friedrich Mohr]] gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of energy in the words: "besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only, and this is called ''Kraft'' [energy or work]. It may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others."

===Mechanical equivalent of heat===
A key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the ''[[mechanical equivalent of heat]]''. The [[caloric theory]] maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.

In the middle of the eighteenth century, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], a Russian scientist, postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the idea of a caloric. Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov came to the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the caloric fluid.

In 1798, Count Rumford ([[Benjamin Thompson]]) performed measurements of the frictional heat generated in boring cannons, and developed the idea that heat is a form of kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.

[[File:SS-joule.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[James Prescott Joule]]]]

The mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the German surgeon [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;von Mayer, J.R. (1842) "Remarks on the forces of inorganic nature" in ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''43''', 233&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer reached his conclusion on a voyage to the [[Dutch East Indies]], where he found that his patients' blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less [[oxygen]], and therefore less energy, to maintain their body temperature in the hotter climate.  He discovered that [[heat]] and [[mechanical work]] were both forms of energy and in 1845, after improving his knowledge of physics, he published a monograph that stated a quantitative relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.R. (1845). ''Die organische Bewegung in ihrem Zusammenhange mit dem Stoffwechsel. Ein Beitrag zur Naturkunde'', Dechsler, Heilbronn.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|[[James Prescott Joule|Joule]]'s apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]

Meanwhile, in 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In the most famous, now called the "Joule apparatus", a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate.  He showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.

Over the period 1840–1843, similar work was carried out by engineer [[Ludwig A. Colding]], although it was little known outside his native Denmark.

Both Joule's and Mayer's work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was Joule's that eventually drew the wider recognition.

{{For|the dispute between Joule and Mayer over priority|Mechanical equivalent of heat: Priority}}

In 1844, [[William Robert Grove]] postulated a relationship between mechanics, heat, [[light]], [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] by treating them all as manifestations of a single "force" (''energy'' in modern terms). In 1846, Grove published his theories in his book ''The Correlation of Physical Forces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Grove, W. R. | title=The Correlation of Physical Forces | location=London | publisher=Longmans, Green | year=1874 | edition=6th }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, drawing on the earlier work of Joule, [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] and [[Émile Clapeyron]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] arrived at conclusions similar to Grove's and published his theories in his book ''Über die Erhaltung der Kraft'' (''On the Conservation of Force'', 1847).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= On the Conservation of Force|url=http://www.bartleby.com/30/125.html|publisher=Bartleby|accessdate= April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general modern acceptance of the principle stems from this publication.

In 1850, [[William Rankine]] first used the phrase ''the law of the conservation of energy'' for the principle.&lt;ref&gt;William John Macquorn Rankine (1853) "On the General Law of the Transformation of Energy," ''Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow'', vol. 3, no. 5, pages 276-280; reprinted in: (1) ''Philosophical Magazine'', series 4, vol. 5, no. 30, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ov22-gFMnEC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 106-117] (February 1853); and (2) W. J. Millar, ed., ''Miscellaneous Scientific Papers: by W. J. Macquorn Rankine'', ... (London, England: Charles Griffin and Co., 1881), part II, [https://archive.org/stream/miscellaneoussci00rank#page/203/mode/1up pages 203-208]: "The law of the ''Conservation of Energy'' is already known—viz. that the sum of all the energies of the universe, actual and potential, is unchangeable."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] claimed that the principle originated with Sir Isaac Newton, based on a creative reading of propositions 40 and 41 of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. This is now regarded as an example of [[Whig history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Mass–energy equivalence===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
{{main|Mass–energy equivalence}}

Matter is composed of such things as atoms, electrons, neutrons, and protons. It has [[rest mass|''intrinsic'' or ''rest'' mass]]. In the limited range of recognized experience of the nineteenth century it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein's 1905 theory of [[special relativity]] showed that it corresponds to an equivalent amount of ''rest energy''. This means that it can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of ''other'' (non-material) forms of energy, for example kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the [[mass in special relativity|''total'' mass]] or ''total'' energy. All forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy.

For example, an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] each have rest mass.  They can perish together, converting their combined rest energy into [[photon]]s having electromagnetic radiant energy, but no rest mass.  If this occurs within an isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the external surroundings, then neither the total ''mass'' nor the total ''energy'' of the system will change.  The produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes just as much to the inertia (and to any weight) of the system as did the rest mass of the electron and positron before their demise. Likewise, non-material forms of energy can perish into matter, which has rest mass.

Thus, conservation of energy (''total'', including material or ''rest'' energy), and [[conservation of mass]] (''total'', not just ''rest''), each still holds as an (equivalent) law.  In the 18th century these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws.

===Conservation of energy in beta decay===
{{Main|Beta decay#Neutrinos in beta decay}}
The discovery in 1911 that electrons emitted in [[beta decay]] have a continuous rather than a discrete spectrum appeared to contradict conservation of energy, under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an electron from a nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Carsten |year=2000 |editor1-link= |editor1-mask= |title=Controversy and Consensus: Nuclear Beta Decay 1911-1934 |url=https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/physics/book/978-3-7643-5313-1 |publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag |isbn=978-3-7643-5313-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode= 1978PhT....31i..23B |doi=10.1063/1.2995181 |title=The idea of the neutrino |journal=Physics Today |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=23–8 |year=1978 |last1=Brown |first1=Laurie M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was eventually resolved in 1933 by [[Enrico Fermi]] who proposed the correct [[Fermi's interaction|description of beta-decay]] as the emission of both an electron and an [[antineutrino]], which carries away the apparently missing energy.&lt;ref&gt;

==First law of thermodynamics==
{{main|First law of thermodynamics}}

For a [[Closed system#In thermodynamics|closed thermodynamic system]], the first law of thermodynamics may be stated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = \mathrm{d}U + \delta W&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity of [[energy]] added to the system by a [[heat]]ing process, &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity of energy lost by the system due to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] done by the system on its surroundings and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the [[internal energy]] of the system.

The l's before the heat and work terms are used to indicate that they describe an increment of energy which is to be interpreted somewhat differently than the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U&lt;/math&gt; increment of internal energy (see [[Inexact differential]]). Work and heat refer to kinds of process which add or subtract energy to or from a system, while the internal energy &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a property of a particular state of the system when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus the term "heat energy" for &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; means "that amount of energy added as the result of heating" rather than referring to a particular form of energy. Likewise, the term "work energy" for &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; means "that amount of energy lost as the result of work". Thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state, but one cannot tell, just from knowledge of the given present state, how much energy has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being heated or cooled, nor as the result of work being performed on or by the system.

[[Entropy (classical thermodynamics)|Entropy]] is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of the possibility of conversion of heat into work.

For a simple compressible system, the work performed by the system may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = P\,\mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]] and &lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt; is a small change in the [[volume]] of the system, each of which are system variables. In the fictive case in which the process is idealized and infinitely slow, so as to be called ''quasi-static'', and regarded as reversible, the heat being transferred from a source with temperature infinitesimally above the system temperature, then the heat energy may be written

:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[temperature]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}S&lt;/math&gt; is a small change in the [[entropy]] of the system. Temperature and entropy are variables of state of a system.

If an open system (in which mass may be exchanged with the environment) has several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from the heat and work transfers, then the first law may be written:&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949). ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance'', Oxford University Press, London, [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–147].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W + u'\,dM,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dM&lt;/math&gt; is the added mass and &lt;math&gt;u'&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass of the added mass, measured in the surroundings before the process.

==Noether's theorem==
{{main|Noether's theorem}}
[[File:Noether.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Emmy Noether]] (1882-1935) was an influential [[mathematician]] known for her groundbreaking contributions to [[abstract algebra]] and [[theoretical physics]].]]
The conservation of energy is a common feature in many physical theories. From a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of [[Noether's theorem]], developed by [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and first published in 1918. The theorem states every continuous symmetry of a physical theory has an associated conserved quantity; if the theory's symmetry is time invariance then the conserved quantity is called "energy". The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as "nothing depends on time per se".
In other words, if the physical system is invariant under the [[continuous symmetry]] of [[time translation]] then its energy (which is [[canonical conjugate]] quantity to time) is conserved.  Conversely, systems which are not invariant under shifts in time (an example, systems with time dependent potential energy) do not exhibit conservation of energy&amp;nbsp;– unless we consider them to exchange energy with another, external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time invariant again.  Conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in such physical theories as special relativity and quantum theory (including [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]) in the flat [[space-time]].

==Relativity==
With the discovery of [[special relativity]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Albert Einstein]], energy was proposed to be one component of an [[four-momentum|energy-momentum 4-vector]].  Each of the four components (one of energy and three of momentum) of this vector is separately conserved across time, in any closed system, as seen from any given [[inertial reference frame]].  Also conserved is the vector length ([[Minkowski space|Minkowski norm]]), which is the [[rest mass]] for single particles, and the [[invariant mass]] for systems of particles (where momenta and energy are separately summed before the length is calculated—see the article on [[invariant mass]]).

The relativistic energy of a single [[mass]]ive particle contains a term related to its [[rest mass]] in addition to its kinetic energy of motion.  In the limit of zero kinetic energy (or equivalently in the [[rest frame]]) of a massive particle, or else in the [[center of momentum frame]] for objects or systems which retain kinetic energy, the [[total energy]] of particle or object (including internal kinetic energy in systems) is related to its [[rest mass]] or its [[invariant mass]] via the famous equation &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the rule of [[Mass in special relativity|''conservation of energy'' over time in special relativity]] continues to hold, so long as the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] of the observer is unchanged. This applies to the total energy of systems, although different observers disagree as to the energy value. Also conserved, and invariant to all observers, is the [[invariant mass]], which is the minimal system mass and energy that can be seen by any observer, and which is defined by the [[energy–momentum relation]].

In [[general relativity]], energy–momentum conservation is not well-defined except in certain special cases. Energy-momentum is typically expressed with the aid of a [[stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]]. However, since pseudotensors are not tensors, they do not transform cleanly between reference frames. If the metric under consideration is static (that is, does not change with time) or asymptotically flat (that is, at an infinite distance away spacetime looks empty), then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls. In practice, some metrics such as the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] do not satisfy these constraints and energy conservation is not well defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html|title=Is Energy Conserved in General Relativity?|authors=Michael Weiss and John Baez|accessdate=5 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation of energy for the entire universe.

==Quantum theory==
In [[quantum mechanics]], energy of a quantum system is described by a [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] (or Hermitian) operator called the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which acts on the [[Hilbert space]] (or a space of [[wave functions]]) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-independent operator, emergence probability of the measurement result does not change in time over the  evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum [[Noether's theorem]] for energy-momentum tensor operator. Note that due to the lack of the (universal) time operator in quantum theory, the uncertainty relations for time and energy are not fundamental in contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty principle, and merely holds in specific cases (see [[Uncertainty principle]]). Energy at each fixed time can in principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the time-energy uncertainty relations. Thus the conservation of energy in time is a well defined concept even in quantum mechanics.

'''Dance notation''' is the [[symbol]]ic representation of human [[dance]] movement and form, using methods such as graphic symbols and figures, path mapping, [[Numeral system|numerical system]]s, and letter and word [[Writing systems|notations]]. Several dance notation systems have been invented, many of which are designed to document specific types of dance. A ''dance score'' is recorded dance notation that describes a particular dance.

==Usage==

The primary uses of dance notation are historical dance preservation through documentation, and analysis (e.g., in [[ethnochoreology]]) or reconstruction of [[choreography]], dance forms, and technical exercises. Also, dance notation allows a dance work to be documented and therefore potentially copyrighted. 

Two popular dance notation systems used in [[Western culture]] are [[Labanotation]] (also known as Kinetography Laban) and [[Benesh Movement Notation]]. Others include [[Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation]] and DanceWriting.

Many dance notation systems are designed for a specific type of dance. Examples of such systems include Shorthand Dance Notation for dances from [[Israel]], Morris Dance Notation for [[Morris dance]], and [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]] for [[Baroque dance]]. As a result, these systems usually cannot effectively describe other types of dance.

==History==

[[File:Dancewriting 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Valerie Sutton]] in a dance pose and its corresponding "Sutton DanceWriting" notation.]]

In the 1680s, [[Pierre Beauchamp]] invented a dance notation system for Baroque dance. His system, known as ''[[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]]'', was published in 1700 by [[Raoul-Auger Feuillet]] and used to record dances throughout the eighteenth century.

A well-known collection of dance scores is the [[Sergeyev Collection]], recorded using [[Vladimir Ivanovich Stepanov]]'s notation method (1892). This collection documents the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]]'s (today the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet) repertoire from the turn of the 20th century, including [[Marius Petipa]]'s original choreographic designs for ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Giselle]]'', ''[[Le Corsaire]]'', and ''[[Swan Lake]]'', as well as ''[[Coppélia]]'' and the original version of ''[[The Nutcracker]]''. It was with this collection that many of these works were first staged outside Russia.

In 1948, [[Hanya Holm]] became the first Broadway choreographer to have her dance scores copyrighted, for her work on ''[[Kiss Me, Kate|Kiss Me Kate]]''.

In 1951, Stanley D. Kahn published [[Kahnotation]], a dance notation system specific to [[tap dance]].

In 1975, [[Ann Hutchinson Guest]] reconstructed choreographer [[Arthur Saint-Léon]]'s ''Pas de Six'' from his 1844 ballet ''[[La Vivandière]]'', along with its original music by composer [[Cesare Pugni]], for the [[Joffrey Ballet]]. The piece was reconstructed from Saint-Léon's work, which was documented using his own method of dance notation, known as ''La Sténochorégraphie''.

In 1982, the first computerized notation system—the ''DOM'' dance notation system—was created by [[Eddie Dombrower]] for the [[Apple II]] [[personal computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Dance Notation Journal|year=1986|issue=Fall|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system displayed an animated figure on the screen that performed dance moves specified by the choreographer.

Dharani are found in the ancient texts of all major traditions of Buddhism. They are a major part of the Pali canon preserved by the [[Theravada]] tradition.

prevalent translations of dharani used by Buddhists in medieval China. Seminal Buddhist literature describes an ordinary monk as a student of spell techniques and the acquisition of dharani as a prominent quality of a bodhisattva. Dharani have a firmly established position in the Mahayana doctrine of the bodhisattva path. They were perceived to be part of an ordinary monk’s religious cultivation and a by-product of meditation. In this respect they are closely associated with an advanced monk or bodhisattva’s acquisition of the spiritual penetrations, supernormal powers and the ability to work miracles. [...] Dharani and spells were functional and fashionable in medieval
Sinitic Buddhism and their role in Chinese religion has continued to the present. They were understood and used as powerful practices to promote the Buddhist teaching and to protect the personal and spiritual welfare of believers. Yet, the very success of Buddhist spells was probably due to the long-standing value of spells and talismans in Chinese religion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abe1999159"/&gt; In some Buddhist regions, they served as texts upon which the Buddhist witness would swear to tell the truth.&lt;ref name=Kooij1978&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

The word ''dhāraṇī'' derives from a Sanskrit root √''dhṛ'' meaning "to hold or maintain".&lt;ref name="mcbride2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braarvig, Jens (1985), p.19&lt;/ref&gt; This root is likely derived from the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] of ancient India where chants and melodious sounds were believed to have innate spiritual and healing powers even if the sound cannot be translated and has no meaning (as in a music).

According to the traditional belief in Tibetan texts, states Jose Cabezon – the Dalai Lama professor of Tibetan Buddhism studies, there were three councils and the term ''dharani'' was recorded and became the norm after the third council.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p75"/&gt; The first council, according to this belief, compiled the ''Sutranta'', the ''Vinaya'' and the ''Abhidhamma'' in  Vimalabhada to the south of Rajagriha in India. The first council was held in the year Buddha died, but the compiled dhamma consisted of spoken words that were not written down.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p75"/&gt; The second council occurred about 200 years after the death of the Buddha in a grove provided by [[Ashoka]], where the knowledge was compiled again, but it too did not write anything down.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p75"/&gt; The third council gathered in Kashmir a century later, according to the Tibetan tradition, and the teachings were put down in writing for those "who had not obtained the power (''dharani'') of not-forgetting"  because people were reciting corrupted forms of the teachings of the Buddha. In this context, ''dharani'' were acknowledged in the Buddhist tradition by about 2nd-century BCE, and they were a memory aid to ground and remember the ''[[dhamma]]'' teachings.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p75"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jose Ignacio Cabezon|title=The Buddha's Doctrine and the Nine Vehicles: Rog Bande Sherab's Lamp of the Teachings|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty3O7BZYO5QC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-995862-7|pages=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The term dharani as used in the history of Mahayana and tantric Buddhism, and its interpretation has been problematic since the mid-19th-century, states Ronald Davidson. It was initially understood as "magical formula or phrase", but later studies such as by Lamotte and Berhard interpreted them to be "memory", while Davidson proposes that some dharani are "codes".{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=97-100}} [[Eugène Burnouf]], the 19th-century French Indologist and a scholar of Buddhism, dharanis are magical formulas that to Buddhist devotees are the most important parts of their books.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|p=100}} Burnouf, states Davidson, was the first scholar to realise how important and widespread dharani had been in Buddhism sutras and Mahayana texts.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=100-101}} The Indologist [[Moriz Winternitz]] concurred in early 20th-century that dharanis constituted a "large and important" part of Mahayana Buddhism, and that they were magic formulae and "protective spells" as well as amulets.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p367"/&gt;{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=101-102}}

According to Winternitz, a dharani resembles the incantations found in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' and ''[[Yajurveda]]'' of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p368"/&gt;{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=101-102}} The dharani-genre of Buddhist literature includes mantra, states [[Étienne Lamotte]], but they were also a "memory aid" to memorize and chant Buddha's teachings. This practice was linked to concentration (''samadhi'') and believed to have magical virtues and a means to both spiritual and material ''karma''-related [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] making.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=103-105}} According to Braarvig, the dharanis are "seemingly meaningless strings of syllables". While they may once have been "memory aids", the dharanis that have survived into the modern era do not match with any text. In later practice, the dharanis were "hardly employed as summaries of doctrine, but were employed as aids to concentration and magical protection benefits".{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=105-106}}

According to Jan Nattier, Vedic mantras are more ancient than Buddhist dharani, but over time they both were forms of incantations that are quite similar.&lt;ref name="nattier202"/&gt; In the early texts of Buddhism, proposes Nattier,  "it would appear that the word dharani was first employed in reference to mnemonic devices used to retain (Skt. "hold") certain elements of Buddhist doctrine in one's memory". In Nattier's view, the term dharani is "peculiar to Buddhism".&lt;ref name="nattier202"&gt;{{harvnb|Nattier|1992|pp=201-202 note 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dhāraṇī can be a [[mnemonic]] to encapsulate the meaning of a section or chapter of a [[sutra]].&lt;ref name="nattier158"&gt;Nattier 1992, pg. 158&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Buddhism-related writer [[Red Pine (author)|Red Pine]], ''mantra'' and ''dharani'' were originally interchangeable, but at some point ''dhāraṇī'' came to be used for meaningful, intelligible phrases, and mantra for syllabic formulae which are not meant to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;Pine 2004, pg. 146&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Robert Buswell and Ronald Davidson, ''dharani'' were codes in some Buddhist texts. They appeared at the end of the text, and they may be seen as a coded, distilled summary of Buddhist teachings in the chapters that preceded it.&lt;ref name=Buswell240/&gt;{{sfn|Davidson|2014|pp=5-11}} For example, the ''Vajrasamadhi-sutra'' – a Korean Buddhist text likely composed in the 7th-century by an unknown monk, one important to the Ch'an ([[Zen Buddhism]]) tradition in East Asia, the ''Dharani'' chapter is the eighth (second last), with a brief conversational epilogue between the Tathagata Buddha and Ananda being the last chapter. This ''dharani'' chapter,  states Buswell, "encodes (''dharayati'') the important meanings, without forgetting them, and it reminds and codes the points to remember.&lt;ref name=Buswell240&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E.

The Indologist [[Frits Staal]] who is known for his scholarship on mantras and chants in Indian religions, states the Dharani mantras reflect a continuity of the Vedic mantras.&lt;ref name="Alper1991"/&gt; He quotes Wayman to be similarly stressing the view that the Buddhist chants have a "profound debt to the Vedic religion".&lt;ref name="Alper1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wayman1990p413"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Wayman|title=Buddhist Insight: Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNIdOsp3KIgC |year=1990|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0675-7|pages=430, context: 413–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yogacara scholars, states Staal, followed the same classification as one found in the Vedas – ''arthadharani'', ''dharmadharani'' and ''mantradharani'', along with express acknowledgment like the Vedas that some "dharani are meaningful and others are meaningless" yet all effective for ritual purposes.&lt;ref name="Alper1991"/&gt;

The early Buddhism literature includes the dharani spells and incantations. It demonstrates that dharanis were valued and in use within Buddhist communities before the 1st-century CE, state Charles Prebish and Damien Keown.&lt;ref name="PrebishKeown2010p92"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles S.

The role of dharanis in Buddhist practice of mid-1st-millennium CE is illustrated by numerous texts including the systematic treatises that emerged. According to Paul Copp, one of the earliest attestable literary mandate about writing dharanis as an effective spell in itself is found in a Chinese text dated between 317 and 420 CE.{{sfn|Copp|2014|pp=31-32}} This text is the ''Qifo bapusa suoshuo da tuoluoni shenzhou jing'' (or, Great Dharani Spirit-Spell Scripture Spoken by the Seven Buddhas and Eight Bodhisattvas).{{sfn|Copp|2014|pp=31-32}} ''The Collected Dhāraṇī Sūtras'', for example, were compiled in the mid-seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Shinohara | first=Koichi | title=Spells, Images, and Mandalas | publisher=Columbia University Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-231-53739-1 | pages=28-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the oldest Buddhist religious inscriptions in Stupas ([[Dagoba (architecture)|Dagoba]], Chörten) are extracts from dharani-genre compositions such as the ''Bodhigarbhalankaralaksa-dharani''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert N.

People who wish to perform the ceremony for it should, on the 8th, 13th, 14th or 15th day of the month, walk round and round the pagoda containing the relics a full seventy-seven times, with it on their right, reciting this charm [dhāraṇī] also seventy-seven times: they should build an altar and keep its surface clean. They should have the charm copied out seventy-seven times, and out of respect for the ceremony should give the copyist perfume, flowers, food and drink, clean clothes and a bath, and reward him either by anointing and covering him with perfumes or by giving him much money, or by paying him according to his ability. Then they should take these copies of the charms, place them inside the pagoda, and make offerings at the pagoda. Alternatively they should make seventy-seven small clay pagodas, place one copy inside each, and make offerings. If they duly perform this, people who are about to die will prolong their lives to old age, all their previous sins and evil deeds being completely destroyed.

Early mentions of dharani in the European literature are from the records left by John of Plano Carpini (1245–7) and William of Rubruck (1254) where they wrote in their respective memoirs that Uighurs and Mongols chanted "Om man baccam", later identified with "Om mani padme hum". They also mention that these Asians write "short sorcery sentences on paper and hang them up".{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=97-100}} Other than such scant remarks, little was known about the Dharani-genre of literature or its value in Buddhism till the mid-19th-century colonial era, when Brian Hodgson began buying Sanskrit and related manuscripts in Nepal, Tibet and India for a more thorough scholarship, often at his personal expense.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=97-100}} According to Hodgson, as quoted by Ronald Davidson, dharani were esoteric short prayers "derived from [Buddhist tantric] Upadesa" that are believed to be amulet to be constantly repeated or worn inside little lockets, something that leads to "a charmed life".{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=97-100}}&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p367"/&gt;

The colonial era scholarship initially proposed that the dharanis and related rituals may have been an influence on Buddhism of other Indian religions such as from the esoteric tantra traditions of Hinduism around the mid-1st-millennium CE. This assumption, along with the view that early Buddhism was an "abstract philosophy or even a broad-based social movement" is now a part of a scholarly debate. With increased access to the primary texts of Buddhism and the discoveries of historical manuscripts in China, Korea and Japan, such as those about early Silla Buddhism, McBride and others state that dharani incantations and ritualism had widespread significance in East Asia from the early years.&lt;ref name="McBride2008p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard D.

According to Richard McBride, as well as Richard Payne,&lt;ref name=payne2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard K.

There is no evidence for such a sequential development. Instead, the evidence points to an overlap but that the significance of the dharanis in mainstream Buddhist traditions and the esoteric Buddhist tantra tradition co-existed independent of each other.

The ''vidya'' mantra represent the mind of male Buddhist deities, while ''dharani'' mantras of the female Buddhist deities. Theologically, the ''vidya'' mantras constitute that knowledge in tantric Buddhism, according to Cabezon, which "pacifies the suffering experienced in the existential world (''samsara'') and the heaps of faults such as desire".&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p108"/&gt; The ''dharani'' mantras, in contrast, constitute that knowledge in tantric Buddhism which "causes one to hold onto the ''dhamma'', to remember the ''dhamma'', to remember virtue".&lt;ref name="Cabezon2013p108"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jose Ignacio Cabezon|title=The Buddha's Doctrine and the Nine Vehicles: Rog Bande Sherab's Lamp of the Teachings|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty3O7BZYO5QC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-995862-7|pages=108–111 with footnote 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is very little prescriptive or practical difference between dharani and mantras except that dharani are much longer, states Eugene Burnouf.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|p=100}}

According to Winternitz, a Buddhist dharani resembles the incantations and mantras found in Hinduism. A dharani may contain simple magical syllables and words without any literal meaning (''mantra-padani''), or its power is believed to result from it containing words or wisdom ''in nunce'' from a Buddhist Sutta.{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=101-102}}&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p368"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moriz Winternitz|title=A History of Indian Literature: Buddhist literature and Jaina literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lgz1eMhu0JsC|year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0265-0|pages=367–372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese Horiuzi manuscript of ''Prajna paramita hrdaya sutra'' and ''Usnisha Vijaya dharani'' dated to 609 CE illustrate both, with the latter being only invocations consisting of meaningless series of syllables.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p368"/&gt; In Buddhism, a dharani has been believed to have magical virtues and a means to earn [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] to offset the past ''karma'', allay fear, diseases and disasters in this life, and for a better [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. To the lay Buddhist communities, states Davidson, the material benefits encouraged the popularity and use of dharanis for devotionalism, rituals and rites in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p368"/&gt;{{sfn|Davidson|2009|pp=103-105}} According to Janet Gyatso, there is a difference between mantras and dharanis. The mantras are more than melodious sounds and have meaning, and these were found sporadically in pre-Mahayana Buddhism. With the emergence of the Mahayana Buddhism tradition, the dharanis became closely related to mantras. Later, as the Vajrayana Buddhism tradition grew, they proliferated. The dharanis and mantras overlap because in the Vajrayana tradition. There exist "single seed-syllable ''bija'' like dharanis, treated as having special powers to protect chanters from dangers such as "snakes, enemies, demons and robbers".&lt;ref name="Gyatso173"/&gt; The ''bija'' (seed) mantra condenses the protective powers of a Buddhist deity or a Buddhist text into a single syllable. For example, the single letter "a" (अ) condenses the 100,000 verses of the ''Prajna-paramita sutras'' into a single syllable.&lt;ref name="Gyatso174"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Gyatso|title=In the Mirror of Memory: Reflections on Mindfulness and Remembrance in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RCsM6GqjicQC&amp;pg=PA174| year=1992| publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0525-4|pages=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Buddhist monk [[Kūkai]] drew a distinction between ''dhāraṇī'' and ''mantra'' and used it as the basis of his theory of language. According to Kūkai, a Buddhist ''mantra'' is restricted to esoteric Buddhist practice whereas ''dhāraṇī'' is found in both esoteric and exoteric rituals. In the Nara and early [[Heian period]] of Japanese history, a monk or nun was tested for their fluency and knowledge of dharanis to confirm whether they are well trained and competent in Buddhist knowledge. Their appointment letters listed the sutras and dharanis that he or she could recite from memory.&lt;ref name="Abe1999159"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryûichi Abé|title=The Weaving of Mantra: Kûkai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ExNmHIACskC|year=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52887-0|pages=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an appointment recommendation letter dated 732 CE, as an example, a Japanese priest named Chishu supports the ordination of his student Hata no kimi Toyotari by listing that he can recite following dharanis: "the ''Greater Prajna-paramita'', Amoghapasa Avalokiteshvara, Eleven-faced Avalokiteshvara, the ''Golden Light'', Akashagarbha, Bhaisajyaguru, consecrating water, concealing ritual space" with the dharani rituals of prostration after eight years of training.&lt;ref name="Abe1999159"/&gt; A study of numerous such ''ubasoku koshinge'' recommendation letters from the 1st-millennium Japan confirm that dharanis were an essential and core part of monastic training, though the specific group of dharanis memorized by a monk or nun varied.&lt;ref name="Abe1999159"/&gt;

Kūkai classified mantras as a special class of dhāraṇīs and argued that every syllable of a dhāraṇī was a manifestation of the true nature of reality – in Buddhist terms, that all sound is a manifestation of ''[[śūnyatā]]'' or emptiness of self-nature. Thus, rather than being devoid of meaning, Kūkai suggests that dhāraṇīs are in fact saturated with meaning – every syllable is symbolic on multiple levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryûichi Abé|title=The Weaving of Mantra: Kûkai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ExNmHIACskC|year=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52887-0|pages=159–176, 490–491 with notes 72, 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Megha-Sutra'' is an example of an ancient Mahayana magico-religious text. In it, the snake deities appear before the Buddha and offer him adoration, then ask how the suffering of snakes, as well as people, can be alleviated. The text suggests friendliness (''maitri'') and lists numerous invocations such as those to female deities, exorcisms, means to induce rains, along with a series of magical formulae such as ''"sara sire sire suru suru naganam java java jivi jivi juvu juvu etc"'', states Moriz Winternitz.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p368"/&gt; The historic Mahayana dharanis have survived as single manuscripts as well as large collections.

The popularity of Buddhist spells in China was probably because older native Chinese religions valued spells already.&lt;ref name=mcbridechina/&gt;

According to Robert Buswell and Donald Lopez, it is "almost certain" that some of the East Asian Buddhist literature on dharani were indigenous Chinese texts and syncretic with the [[Daoism|Daoist]] practices.&lt;ref name="buswellLopez2013p330"/&gt; For example, the ''Guanding jing'' composed in mid-5th century in China is largely a collection of magical spells in the dharani-genre in twelve semi-independent chapters. It includes spells such as those of the 72,000 spirit kings to protect Bhikshus (Buddhist monks), spells of the 120,000 spirit kings to protect the Bhikshunis (Buddhist nuns), incantations of spirit kings to protect one's surroundings, seals and spells to subdue devils, chants to summon dragon kings to treat infections and remove pests, and seeking rebirth in pure lands of one's desire, state Buswell and Lopez.&lt;ref name="buswellLopez2013p330"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

The significance of dharanis was such that both the government and monastic organization had stipulated, by the 7th-century, how and when dharanis may or may not be used. A ''ritsuryo'' code for Buddhist clerics dated 718 CE, promulgated by the Nara government in Japan, forbid the use of dharani for any unauthorized medical, military and political rebellion. The code explicitly exempted their use for "healing of the sick by chanting dharanis in accordance with the Buddha dharma".&lt;ref name="Abe1999161"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryûichi Abé|title=The Weaving of Mantra: Kûkai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ExNmHIACskC|year=1999|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52887-0|pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another document dated 797 CE mentions "healer-meditation masters" (''kanbyo zenji'') in dharanis to protect the family of the ruler. Others evidence the use of dharani chanting by monks and nuns as "one of the common methods of healing during the Nara period", states Ryûichi Abé.&lt;ref name="Abe1999161"/&gt;

The dharanis were an essential part of the ''rokujikyoho'' (six-syllable sutra) liturgy ritual in Japan, states Benedetta Lomi.

===Theravada tradition===
The [[Theravada]] tradition is found in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asian Buddhist countries. The three historic ritual practices of the Theravada community include the Buddha puja (''[[triratna]]'' rite), the Five Precepts ceremony (''pancasil''), and the protective chanting of Paritrana (''[[paritta]]'').&lt;ref name="LeVineGellner2009"/&gt; The Theravada Paritrana texts are equivalent to the Dharani texts in the Mahayana tradition, both providing protective charm through chanting of hymns. According to Buddhist studies scholars Sarah LeVine and David Gellner, Theravada lay devotees traditionally invite the monks into their homes for rites of "protection from evil" and the monk(s) chant the paritrana hymns.&lt;ref name="LeVineGellner2009"/&gt; These rituals are particularly common during rites-of-passage ceremonies such as baby naming, first rice-eating and others.&lt;ref name="LeVineGellner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sarah LeVine |author2=David N Gellner |title=Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9C1iF3MAYgC |year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-04012-0|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhologist Karel Werner, some Mahayana and Vajrayana dharani texts influenced the paritta texts of Theravada tradition, such as the Gini (fire) Paritta, as the hymns are identical in parts and the Theravada text uses the same terms, for example, ''"dharani dharaniti"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karel Werner|title=Love Divine: Studies in 'Bhakti and Devotional Mysticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMxdAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77461-4|pages=82–83 note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pali canon makes many references to protective (''raksha'', ''paritta'') incantations and magical spells.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996p367"/&gt;&lt;ref name=skilling110/&gt; These invocations provide protection from "malignant spirits, disease and calamity". For example, in ''Digha Nikaya'' (DN I.116.14), Sonadanda remarks that wherever the Buddha stays, "non-humans do not harm the people of that town or village", states the Buddhism scholar Peter Skilling. This and similar statements are also found in the early Chinese translations of Indian Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=skilling110&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter Skilling| title= The ''Raksha'' Literature of the Sravakayana|journal= The Journal of the Pali Text Society|volume=XVI|year=1992|pages=110-111, 116-123}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Skilling, these "protective Buddhist literature" are used by both the monks and the laypeople of Theravada countries. These texts are a part of any "meagre library of Buddhist Sri Lankan households" and they are called ''Pirit Pota''.&lt;ref name=skilling110/&gt; In Myanmar, all classes of the Theravada community more widely know about the ''paritta'' incantation literature than any other Pali Buddhist work. The average Theravada monk in other southeast Asian countries who may not know much about a ''[[Tipitaka]]'', states Skilling, is likely to "be able to recite numerous chants [paritta, dharani] from memory".&lt;ref name=skilling110/&gt;

In northern Thailand, the ''Suat Boek Phranet'' (lit. Eye-Opening Sutta) is a Pali chant text used during rites such as the consecration of a Buddha image. The text, states Donald Swearer, includes a "unique dharani in praise of the Buddha" and his victory over the evil Mara.&lt;ref name="Swearer2004"/&gt; Though the dharani appears at the end of the text and the associated chant in Thai Buddhist practice occurs at the close of the ceremony, they highlight their key role in "the ''buddhabhiseka'' ritual".&lt;ref name="Swearer2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald K.

According to languages and ancient manuscripts scholar Ernst Wolff, "it was Buddhism, above all, that eminently stimulated and sustained printing activities". Its chants and ideas were in demand in East Asia, and this led to the development of wood-block based mass printing technology. The oldest known dharanis were mass produced by the 8th-century, and later in the 10th-century the canonical ''[[Tripitaka]]'' in addition to 84,000 copies of dharanis were mass printed.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernst Wolff|editor1=Allen Kent|editor2=Harold Lancour|editor3=Jay E.

The 8th-century dharanis are the "oldest authenticated printed texts in the world", states Robert Sewell.&lt;ref name=sewell/&gt; These were mass produced as a set consisting of miniature hollow wooden pagodas each containing a printed dharani prayer or charm in [[Sanskrit]] on thick paper strips.&lt;ref name=sewell/&gt;&lt;ref name=mellby&gt;Julie L.

[[Image:NSB-doubleelim-draw-2004.png|200px|right|thumb|A double-elimination [[bracket (tournament)|bracket]] from the 2004 National [[Science Bowl]]]]
A '''double-elimination tournament''' is a type of [[elimination tournament]] [[competition]] in which a participant ceases to be eligible to win the [[tournament]]'s championship upon having lost ''two'' games or matches. It stands in contrast to a [[single-elimination tournament]], in which only ''one'' defeat results in elimination.

One method of arranging a double-elimination tournament is to break the competitors into two sets of [[bracket (tournament)|brackets]], the ''winners bracket'' and ''losers bracket'' (''W'' and ''L'' brackets for short; also sometimes ''upper bracket'' and ''lower bracket'', respectively) after the first round. The first-round winners proceed into the W bracket and the losers proceed into the L bracket. The W bracket is conducted in the same manner as a single-elimination tournament, except that the losers of each round "drop down" into the L bracket. Another method of double-elimination tournament management is the ''Draw and Process''.

As with single-elimination tournaments, most often the number of competitors is equal to a [[power of two]] (8, 16, 32, etc.) so that in each round there is an even number of competitors and never any [[Bye (sports)|byes]]. The maximum number of games in a double-elimination tournament is one less than twice the number of teams participating (e.g., 8 teams – 15 games). The minimum number is two less than twice the number of teams (e.g., 8 teams – 14 games).

==Conducting the tournament==
If the standard double-elimination bracket arrangement is being used, then each round of the L Bracket is conducted in two stages; a minor stage followed by a major stage. Both contain the same number of matches (assuming there are no byes) which is the same again as the number of matches in the corresponding round of the W Bracket. If the minor stage of an L Bracket round contains ''N'' matches, it will produce ''N'' winners. Meanwhile, the ''N'' matches in the corresponding round of the W Bracket will produce ''N'' losers. These 2''N'' competitors will then pair off in the ''N'' matches of the corresponding major stage of the L Bracket.

For example, in an eight-competitor double-elimination tournament, the four losers of the first round, W Bracket quarter finals, pair off in the first stage of the L Bracket, the L Bracket minor semifinals. The two losers are eliminated, while the two winners proceed to the L Bracket major semifinals. Here, those two players/teams will each compete against a loser of the W Bracket semifinal in the L Bracket major semifinals. The winners of the L Bracket major semifinals compete against each other in the L Bracket minor-final, with the winner playing the loser of the W Bracket final in the L Bracket major final.

The championship finals of a double elimination tournament is usually set up to be a possible two games. The rationale is that since the tournament is indeed double elimination, it is unfair to have the W Bracket champion eliminated with its first loss. Therefore, while the W Bracket champion needs to beat the L Bracket champion only once to win the tournament, the L Bracket champion must beat the Winners' Bracket champion twice.

A Draw and Process tournament requires less intervention by the manager. The competitors are allocated their first round positions on the competition grid and this is played as if it were a single elimination event. This grid is called the "Draw". A second competition grid called the "Process" is then produced and again played as a single elimination event. The fixed arrangement of the Process ensures that players who met in the first round of the Draw cannot meet until the final of the Process. Similarly, players who meet in the second round of the Draw cannot meet until the semi finals of the Process. If the same person wins both the Draw and Process then they are the overall winner and the losing finalists will play each other for second and third place. Otherwise the winners of the Draw and Process will play off to determine the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = United States Croquet Association. Draw and Process Format. | url=http://www.croquetamerica.com/croquet/tournaments/DrawAndProcess.php | accessdate = 18 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pros and cons==
The double-elimination format has some advantages over the single-elimination format, most notably the fact that third and fourth places can be determined without the use of a consolation or "classification" match involving two contestants who have already been eliminated from winning the championship.

Some tournaments, such as in tennis, will use "[[Seed (sports)|seeding]]" to prevent the strongest contestants from meeting until the later round. However, in tournaments where contestants are placed randomly in the draw, or in situations where seeding is not available, it is possible for 2 of the strongest teams to meet in the early rounds rather than a final or semifinal as would be expected in a seeded draw. Double elimination overcomes this shortfall by allowing a strong team which loses early to work their way through the L Bracket and progress to the later rounds, despite meeting the strongest team in the early rounds of competition.

Another advantage of the double-elimination format is the fact that all competitors will play at least twice and three quarters will play three games or more. In a single-elimination tournament with no [[bye (sports)|byes]], half of the competitors will be eliminated after their first game. This can be disappointing to those who had to travel to the tournament and were only able to play once.

A disadvantage compared to the single-elimination format is that at least twice the number of matches have to be conducted. Since each player has to lose twice and since the tournament ends when only one player remains, in a tournament for ''n'' competitors there will be either 2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 or 2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 games depending on whether or not the winner was undefeated during the tournament. This may result in a scheduling hardship for venues where only one facility for play is available.

It is possible for the Championship finals to be determined by just a single match if the W Bracket winner defeats the L Bracket winner. It is therefore unknown, until this match has been concluded, whether the final scheduled match will in fact be required. This can be seen as a disadvantage of the system, particularly if broadcasting and ticket sales companies have an interest in the tournament.

==Examples of use==
One such athletic event that employs a double-elimination format is the NCAA baseball tournament, including the [[College World Series]], where a team is not eliminated until it loses twice in each of the four rounds (regional, super regional, College World Series, and CWS championship, with the super regional and CWS championship series featuring two teams in a best-of-3 format). The NCAA softball tournament (including the [[Women's College World Series]]) uses the same format. The [[Little League World Series]] switched from [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] to double-elimination formats for each of its pools starting in [[2010 Little League World Series|2010]] in an effort to eliminate meaningless games.

It is also used in [[Electronic sports|video game tournaments]] and [[table football]] tournaments. Double-elimination brackets are also popular in [[amateur wrestling]] of all levels, [[pool (cue sports)|pool]], [[surfing]], [[windsurfing]] and [[Kitesurfing|kiteboarding]] freestyle competitions, as well as [[Curling]] [[bonspiel]]s (where triple-elimination is also used), [[Hardcourt Bike Polo]]. The [[World Baseball Classic]] used a double-elimination format for its second rounds of the tournament in [[2009 World Baseball Classic|2009]] and [[2013 World Baseball Classic|2013]], as well as in its first round in 2009. In [[contract bridge]], the [[English Bridge Union]] Spring Foursomes, first contested in 1962, uses a double elimination format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ebu.co.uk/node/477 |title=Schapiro Spring Foursomes - history  |website=[[English Bridge Union]] |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ebu.co.uk/competitions/schapiro-spring-fours |title=Schapiro Spring Foursomes |website=[[English Bridge Union]] |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used, in modified form, in the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Senior Gaelic Football Championship]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]].

[[World Championship Wrestling]] was the only professional wrestling promotion to date to use the double-elimination format. They used the format for a tournament for the vacant [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] in 1999.

==Variations==
In [[judo]], players that end up in the L bracket can finish in third place at best. The winner of the W bracket will win the tournament, with the losing finalist finishing second. The other losers of the W bracket will end up in the L bracket, which will only be played to the minor stage of the final, resulting in two 3rd placed players. Thus, compared to double elimination, there is no major stage of the L Bracket final played, and there is no game between the winners of the W and L Brackets.

Another aspect of the system used in judo is that losers of the first round (of the W bracket) only advance to the L bracket if the player they lost to wins his or her second round match. If a player loses to a second round loser, they are eliminated from the tournament.

Another variant, called the ''(third-place) challenge'', is used, particularly in scholastic wrestling. The winner of the L bracket may challenge the loser of the finals in the W bracket, if and only if the two contestants had not faced each other previously; if the challenger (the winner of the L bracket) wins, he is awarded second place, and the loser of the W final is dropped to third place. This system is used particularly where the top '''two''' places advance to a higher level of competition (example: advancement from a regional tournament to a state tournament).

Another is the ''balanced'' variant which is a bracket arrangement that is ''not'' strictly divided into two brackets based on number of losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tournamentdesign.org TournamentDesign.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Players with different numbers of losses can play each other in any round. A goal of the variant is that no player sits idle for more than one round consecutively. The added complexity of the brackets is handled by using "if necessary" matches. The flexible approach allows practical bracket designs to be made for any number of competitors including odd numbers (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, etc.).

A possible alternative is a single-elimination format where each match is a best-of-5 or best-of-7 series. This format still allows a competitor to lose (perhaps multiple times) while still remaining eligible to win the tournament. Of course, having multiple games in each series ''also'' requires considerably more games to be conducted.

Another is the modified single elimination tournament which guarantees at least two games per competitor, but not necessarily two losses for elimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poolplayers.com/apa-rulebook-team-manual-scoresheets-and-other-materials/ APA Game Rules (Rulebook), Team Manual and other materials]&lt;/ref&gt; The brackets are similar to the double elimination format, except the two finalists from the L bracket (each with one loss) face the two finalists from the W bracket (neither with a loss) in a single elimination semi-final and final.

The [[College World Series]] (a [[baseball]] tournament) has frequently tried to modify the double-elimination format to set up, if possible, a single championship game. Until 1988, the College World Series did this by adding an extra round to the L Bracket. What would be the L Bracket major semifinals (i.e. the round where the W Bracket semifinal losers dropped down) became the L Bracket quarterfinals. The winners would then progress to the L Bracket semifinals against the two participants in the W Bracket final (i.e. the WINNERS of the W Bracket semifinals drop down). This thus left open the possibility that the W Bracket champion would pick up a loss, albeit in the L Bracket semifinal. If, however, the W Bracket champion prevailed in the L Bracket semifinal, the same two-game final setup existed in effect, albeit not in practice ... for under the CWS pre-1988 version, the unbeaten W Bracket champion would be playing a once-beaten L Bracket opponent in the L Bracket final, with the winner to advance to play the unbeaten W Bracket champion in the finals (if necessary). The CWS subsequently broke up its eight-team field into two four-team double elimination tournaments, with the winners meeting in either a sudden-death or, currently, a best-of-three final.

A way to reduce the number of rounds is to do cross-bracket elimination in the last rounds. For instance, in a double-elimination tournament of eight teams, you could have both the winner and the loser of the W Bracket final join the third round of the L Bracket, the winner facing the lowest-seeded L Bracket team or crossing inversely how W Bracket semifinal losers are placed in L Bracket. If the W Bracket team wins, there will be two teams left and they will go straight to the finals (with the W Bracket team having a one-game advantage as usual). However, if the W Bracket team loses then three teams will still be in the tournament, all with one loss. Usually in the subsequent fifth round either the last W Bracket team that just lost has a [[bye (sports)|bye]] round or the top seed remaining will have a bye, while the other two teams square off. This leaves two teams for a one-game final in the sixth and last round. Whether the W Bracket team wins or loses in round four, this cross-bracket procedure shortens an eight team double elimination tournament from 6–7 rounds to 5–6 rounds. This system also gives more odds to a single game final (75% of situations, instead the ordinary 50%)

The [[Little League World Series]] began using a modified double elimination bracket in 2011.  Eight U.S. teams and eight international teams compete in respective double elimination formats until their respective championship games, which are single elimination.  That is, irrespective of whether a team has one loss, or no losses, that team would be eliminated with a loss in either the U.S. or international championship game.  The two respective champions then play a single elimination game for the World Series championship.

==Other tournament systems==
Variations of the double-elimination tournament include:
* [[Elimination tournament]]
* [[Single-elimination tournament]]
Other common tournament types are
* [[Round-robin tournament]]
* [[Swiss system tournament]]
* [[Playoffs]] – a variation of the single-elimination tournament where instead of one win, a team needs to win a specific number of games in a series in order to advance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6167">:''"Eco-municipality" has a specific meaning. For a more general discussion of the sustainability of cities, see [[Sustainable city]].''

An '''eco-municipality''' or '''eco-town''' is a [[local government]] area that has adopted [[ecological]] and [[social justice]] values in its [[charter]]. The development of eco-municipalities stems from changing systems in [[Sweden]], where more than seventy municipal governments have accepted varying principles of [[sustainability]] in their operations as well as community-wide decision making processes.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Spencer (September 22, 2005) [http://sustainablebusiness.com/features/feature_template.cfm?ID=1269 Building Sustainable Cities: Scandinavia's "Eco-Municipalities" Show the Way].sustainablebusiness.com. Retrieved on: November 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these policies is to increase the overall sustainability of the community.

The distinction between an eco-municipality and other [[sustainable development]] projects (such as [[green building]] and [[alternative energy]]) is the focus on community involvement and social transformation in a public agency as well as the use of a [[holistic]] [[systems thinking|systems]] approach. An eco-municipality is one that recognizes that issues of sustainability are key to all decisions made by government. &lt;ref&gt;Torbjorn Lahti and Sarah James (May 17, 2005) [http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf The Eco-municipality Model for Sustainable Community Change: A systems approach to creating sustainable communities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807163009/http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf |date=2008-08-07 }}.

==History==
In 1983 the [[Övertorneå]] community of Sweden first adopted an Eco-municipality framework followed by a formal organization in 1995 (SEKOM).

==Framework==
In becoming an eco-municipality, cities or towns typically adopt a resolution, based on the [[Natural Step|Natural Step framework]] (or Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development ([[FSSD]])), which sets the following objectives:
* Reduce dependence upon fossil fuels.
* Reduce dependence upon synthetic chemicals.
* Reduce encroachment upon nature.
* Better meet human needs fairly and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Sustainability [http://www.afs.nonprofitoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B2E02B44E-ED9D-4C45-B7C7-A670267AE29A%7D&amp;DE=%7B037A8207-109E-46C0-B083-E96FD3882316%7D Ashland, WI and Duluth, MN become Sustainable Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903103742/http://www.afs.nonprofitoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B2E02B44E-ED9D-4C45-B7C7-A670267AE29A%7D&amp;DE=%7B037A8207-109E-46C0-B083-E96FD3882316%7D |date=2011-09-03 }}.

==Municipalities adopting framework==
Communities in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and Africa ranging in size from villages of 300 to cities of 700,000 have become eco-municipalities. In Sweden, over one hundred municipalities have officially become eco-municipalities. They have formed a [http://www.sekom.se national association of eco-municipalities] to assist one another and work to influence national policy. [[Whistler, BC]], was awarded first place in a [[United Nations]]-endorsed international competition for sustainable communities. Its long-term sustainability plan, Whistler 2020, is based on the Natural Step framework.&lt;ref&gt;Sustain Dane [http://www.sustaindane.org/Pages/ecomunicipality_where.htm Eco-municipalities: Where Are They?].

In [[Wisconsin]], there is a growing eco-municipality movement which began in the Chequamegon Bay region. As of November 2007, twelve local communities had formally adopted eco-municipality resolutions. The resolutions state the community's intention to become an eco-municipality, endorsing the Natural Step sustainability principles and framework as a guide.&lt;ref&gt;1,000 Friends of Wisconsin.

[[Jeremy Sherman]] writes on ententionality, "Deacon coins the term "ententional," to encompass the entire range of phenomena that must be explained, everything from the first evolvable function, to human social processes, everything traditionally called intentional but also everything merely functional, fitting and therefore representing its environment with normative (good or bad fit) consequences."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ambigamy/201111/scientific-explanation-the-emergence-mattering-matter&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;{{General relativity sidebar |fundamentals}}

In the [[theory]] of [[general relativity]], the '''equivalence principle''' is the equivalence of [[Gravitational mass|gravitational]] and [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]], and [[Albert Einstein's]] observation that the gravitational "force" as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the ''[[fictitious force|pseudo-force]]'' experienced by an observer in a non-[[inertial frame of reference|inertial]] (accelerated) [[frame of reference]].

== Einstein's statement of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass ==
{{Quotation|
A little reflection will show that the law of the equality of the inertial and gravitational mass is equivalent to the assertion that the acceleration imparted to a body by a gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. For Newton's equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out in full, it is:
:(Inertial mass) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Acceleration) &lt;math&gt; = &lt;/math&gt; (Intensity of the gravitational field) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Gravitational mass).
It is only when there is numerical equality between the inertial and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of the nature of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert, ''How I Constructed the Theory of Relativity'', translated by Masahiro Morikawa from the text recorded in Japanese by Jun Ishiwara, Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPPS) Bulletin, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 17–19, April 2005. Einstein recalls events of 1907 in a talk in Japan on 14 December 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=The Meaning of Relativity|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134449798|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== Development of gravitation theory ==
[[File:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogv|right|thumb|During the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, astronaut [[David Scott]] showed that Galileo was right: acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even for a hammer and a feather.]]Something like the equivalence principle emerged in the early 17th century, when [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] expressed [[experiment]]ally that the [[acceleration]] of a [[test mass]] due to [[gravitation]] is independent of the amount of [[mass]] being accelerated.

Kepler, using Galileo's discoveries, showed knowledge of the equivalence principle by accurately describing what would occur if the moon were stopped in its orbit and dropped towards Earth. This can be deduced without knowing if or in what manner gravity decreases with distance, but requires assuming the equivalency between gravity and inertia.

{{quote|If two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the other. If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same density.|Kepler, "Astronomia Nova", 1609&lt;ref&gt;http://quotes.yourdictionary.com/orbits/quote/71225/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The 1/54 ratio is [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s estimate of the Moon–Earth mass ratio, based on their diameters. The accuracy of his statement can be deduced by using [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s inertia law F=ma and Galileo's gravitational observation that distance &lt;math&gt;D = (1/2)at^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Setting these accelerations equal for a mass is the equivalence principle. Noting the time to collision for each mass is the same gives Kepler's statement that D&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;=M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;, without knowing the time to collision or how or if the acceleration force from gravity is a function of distance.

Newton's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational theory]] simplified and formalized [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s and Kepler's ideas by recognizing Kepler's "animal force or some other equivalent" beyond gravity and inertia were not needed, deducing from Kepler's planetary laws how gravity reduces with distance.

The equivalence principle was properly introduced by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1907, when he observed that the acceleration of bodies towards the center of the Earth at a rate of 1''[[g-force|''g'']]'' (''g'' = 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being a standard reference of gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface) is equivalent to the acceleration of an inertially moving body that would be observed on a rocket in free space being accelerated at a rate of 1''g''. Einstein stated it thus:

{{quote|we [...] assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding [[accelerated reference frame|acceleration of the reference system]].|Einstein, 1907}}

That is, being on the surface of the Earth is equivalent to being inside a spaceship (far from any sources of gravity) that is being accelerated by its engines. The direction or vector of acceleration equivalence on the surface of the earth is "up" or directly opposite the center of the planet while the vector of acceleration in a spaceship is directly opposite from the mass ejected by its thrusters. From this principle, Einstein deduced that [[free-fall]] is [[inertial frame|inertial motion]]. Objects in free-fall do not experience being accelerated downward (e.g. toward the earth or other massive body) but rather weightlessness and no acceleration. In an [[inertial frame of reference]] bodies (and photons, or light) obey [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|Newton's first law]], moving at constant velocity in straight lines. Analogously, in a curved [[spacetime]] the [[world line]] of an inertial particle or pulse of light is ''as straight as possible'' (in space ''and'' time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/EGR.pdf |page=32 |title=General Relativity in a Nutshell |first=Alan |last=Macdonald |date=September 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 |publisher=[[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a world line is called a [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]] and from the point of view of the inertial frame is a straight line. This is why an [[accelerometer]] in free-fall doesn't register any acceleration; there isn't any.

As an example: an inertial body moving along a geodesic through space can be trapped into an orbit around a large gravitational mass without ever experiencing acceleration. This is possible because spacetime is radically curved in close vicinity to a large gravitational mass. In such a situation the [[geodesic]] lines bend inward around the center of the mass and a free-floating (weightless) inertial body will simply follow those curved geodesics into an elliptical orbit. An accelerometer on-board would never record any acceleration.

By contrast, in [[Newtonian mechanics]], [[gravity]] is assumed to be a [[force]]. This force draws objects having mass towards the center of any massive body. At the Earth's surface, the force of gravity is counteracted by the mechanical (physical) resistance of the Earth's surface. So in Newtonian physics, a person at rest on the surface of a (non-rotating) massive object is in an inertial frame of reference. These considerations suggest the following corollary to the equivalence principle, which Einstein formulated precisely in 1911:

{{quote|Whenever an observer detects the local presence of a force that acts on all objects in direct proportion to the inertial mass of each object, that observer is in an accelerated frame of reference.}}

Einstein also referred to two reference frames, K and K'. K is a uniform gravitational field, whereas K' has no gravitational field but is [[uniform acceleration|uniformly accelerated]] such that objects in the two frames experience identical forces:

{{quote|We arrive at a very satisfactory interpretation of this law of experience, if we assume that the systems K and K' are physically exactly equivalent, that is, if we assume that we may just as well regard the system K as being in a space free from gravitational fields, if we then regard K as uniformly accelerated. This assumption of exact physical equivalence makes it impossible for us to speak of the absolute acceleration of the system of reference, just as the usual theory of relativity forbids us to talk of the absolute velocity of a system; and it makes the equal falling of all bodies in a gravitational field seem a matter of course.|Einstein, 1911}}

This observation was the start of a process that culminated in [[general relativity]]. Einstein suggested that it should be elevated to the status of a general principle, which he called the "principle of equivalence" when constructing his theory of relativity:

{{quote|As long as we restrict ourselves to purely mechanical processes in the realm where Newton's mechanics holds sway, we are certain of the equivalence of the systems K and K'. But this view of ours will not have any deeper significance unless the systems K and K' are equivalent with respect to all physical processes, that is, unless the laws of nature with respect to K are in entire agreement with those with respect to K'. By assuming this to be so, we arrive at a principle which, if it is really true, has great heuristic importance. For by theoretical consideration of processes which take place relatively to a system of reference with uniform acceleration, we obtain information as to the career of processes in a homogeneous gravitational field.|Einstein, 1911}}

Einstein combined ([[postulate]]d) the equivalence principle with [[special relativity]] to predict that clocks run at different rates in a [[gravitational potential]], and light rays [[bending of starlight|bend]] in a gravitational field, even before he developed the concept of curved spacetime.

So the original equivalence principle, as described by Einstein, concluded that free-fall and inertial motion were physically equivalent. This form of the equivalence principle can be stated as follows. An observer in a windowless room cannot distinguish between being on the surface of the Earth, and being in a spaceship in deep space accelerating at 1g. This is not strictly true, because massive bodies give rise to [[tidal force|tidal effects]] (caused by variations in the strength and direction of the gravitational field) which are absent from an accelerating spaceship in deep space. The room, therefore, should be small enough that tidal effects can be neglected.

Although the equivalence principle guided the development of [[general relativity]], it is not a founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the ''geometrical'' nature of the theory. In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]]s of spacetime, and what we perceive as the force of [[gravity]] is instead a result of our being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of matter prevents us from doing so.

Since Einstein developed general relativity, there was a need to develop a framework to test the theory against other possible theories of gravity compatible with [[special relativity]]. This was developed by [[Robert H. Dicke|Robert Dicke]] as part of his program to test general relativity. Two new principles were suggested, the so-called Einstein equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle, each of which assumes the weak equivalence principle as a starting point. They only differ in whether or not they apply to gravitational experiments.

Another clarification needed is that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means there is a constant force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.

==Modern usage==
Three forms of the equivalence principle are in current use: weak (Galilean), Einsteinian, and strong.

===The weak equivalence principle===
&lt;!-- Universality of free fall and weak equivalence principle redirect to this subsection.  Please do not change its title without making sure the redirects work properly. --&gt;
The '''weak equivalence principle''', also known as the '''universality of free fall''' or the '''Galilean equivalence principle''' can be stated in many ways.  The strong EP includes (astronomic) bodies with gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Todd A.; Schlamminger, Stephan; Gundlach, Jens H.; Adelberger, Eric G.; "Torsion-balance tests of the weak equivalence principle", ''Classical and Quantum Gravity'' 29, 184002 (2012); https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2442&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., 1.74 solar-mass pulsar PSR J1903+0327, 15.3% of whose separated mass is absent as gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Champion, David J.; Ransom, Scott M.; Lazarus, Patrick; Camilo, Fernando; et al.; ''Science'' 320(5881), 1309 (2008), https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2396&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2018}}).  The weak EP assumes falling bodies are bound by non-gravitational forces only. Either way:

:The trajectory of a point mass in a gravitational field depends only on its initial position and velocity, and is independent of its composition and ''structure''.

:All test particles at the alike spacetime point, in a given gravitational field, will undergo the same acceleration, independent of their properties, including their rest mass.&lt;ref name="Wesson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Five-dimensional Physics |first=Paul S. |last=Wesson |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSv8ksxHR0oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Five+intitle:Dimensional+intitle:Physics |isbn=978-981-256-661-4 |publisher=World Scientific |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:All local centers of mass free-fall (in vacuum) along identical (parallel-displaced, same speed) minimum action trajectories independent of all observable properties.

:The vacuum world-line of a body immersed in a gravitational field is independent of all observable properties.

:The local effects of motion in a curved spacetime (gravitation) are indistinguishable from those of an accelerated observer in flat spacetime, without exception.

:Mass (measured with a balance) and weight (measured with a scale) are locally in identical ratio for all bodies (the opening page to Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', 1687).

'''Locality''' eliminates measurable tidal forces originating from a radial divergent gravitational field (e.g., the Earth) upon finite sized physical bodies.  The "falling" equivalence principle embraces Galileo's, Newton's, and Einstein's conceptualization.  The equivalence principle does not deny the existence of measurable effects caused by a ''rotating'' gravitating mass ([[frame dragging]]), or bear on the measurements of [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|light deflection and gravitational time delay]] made by non-local observers.

==== Active, passive, and inertial masses ====

By definition of active and passive gravitational mass, the force on &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; due to the gravitational field of &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise the force on a second object of arbitrary mass&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to the gravitational field of mass&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_2 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition of inertial mass:

::&lt;math&gt;F = m^\mathrm{inert} a&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; are the same distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; then, by the weak equivalence principle, they fall at the same rate (i.e. their accelerations are the same)

::&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{F_1}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = a_2 = \frac{F_2}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to inertial mass for all objects.

Furthermore, by [[Newton's third law of motion]]:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
must be equal and opposite to

::&lt;math&gt;F_0 = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}  M_0^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}}{M_0^\mathrm{pass}} = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}}{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to active gravitational mass for all objects.

The dimensionless Eötvös-parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of the ratios of gravitational and inertial masses divided by their average for the two sets of test masses "A" and "B."

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)=2\frac{ \left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A-\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B }{\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A+\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- I have created [[User talk:Lemmiwinks2#Redundant edits (active, passive, and inertial masses)|a list of known places where the above material appears]]. --&gt;

====Tests of the weak equivalence principle====

Tests of the weak equivalence principle are those that verify the equivalence of gravitational mass and inertial mass. An obvious test is dropping different objects, ideally in a vacuum environment, e.g., inside the [[Fallturm Bremen]] drop tower.

With the first successful production of antimatter, in particular anti-hydrogen, a new approach to test the weak equivalence principle has been proposed. Experiments to compare the gravitational behavior of matter and antimatter are currently being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing the Weak Equivalence Principle with an antimatter beam at CERN|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date=2015|volume=631|issue=1|page=012047|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/631/i=1/a=012047|bibcode = 2015JPhCS.631a2047K |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/631/1/012047 |last1=Kimura|first1=M.|last2=Aghion|first2=S.|last3=Amsler|first3=C.|last4=Ariga|first4=A.|last5=Ariga|first5=T.|last6=Belov|first6=A.|last7=Bonomi|first7=G.|last8=Bräunig|first8=P.|last9=Bremer|first9=J.|last10=Brusa|first10=R.

Proposals that may lead to a [[quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]] such as [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]] predict violations of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light [[scalar field]]s with long [[Compton wavelength]]s, which should generate [[fifth force]]s and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; range.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009" /&gt; Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle are approaching a degree of sensitivity such that ''non-discovery'' of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Overduin | first1 = James | last2 = Everitt | first2 = Francis | last3 = Mester | first3 = John | last4 = Worden | first4 = Paul | title = The Science Case for STEP | doi = 10.1016/j.asr.2009.02.012 | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1532–1537 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0902.2247 |bibcode = 2009AdSpR..43.1532O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Einstein equivalence principle===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gravitational field]] --&gt;
What is now called the "Einstein equivalence principle" states that the weak equivalence principle holds, and that:&lt;ref name="Lāmmerzahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haugen |first=Mark P. |first2=Claus |last2=Lämmerzahl |title=Principles of Equivalence: Their Role in Gravitation Physics and Experiments that Test Them |journal=Gyros |volume=562 |pages=195–212 |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-41236-6 |arxiv=gr-qc/0103067|bibcode=2001LNP...562..195H |doi=10.1007/3-540-40988-2_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
Here "local" has a very special meaning: not only must the experiment not look outside the laboratory, but it must also be small compared to variations in the gravitational field, [[tidal forces]], so that the entire laboratory is freely falling. It also implies the absence of interactions with "external" fields ''other than the gravitational field''.{{Citation needed|reason = Definition of "local" in this context. In particular its relation to external fields as stated is dubious. If there are external fields than the equivalence principle doesn't trigger due to the "in a freely falling"-part in the statement. If *no external fields* would be part of the definition of "local", then "free falling" would be redundant.|date=August 2011}}

The [[principle of relativity]] implies that the outcome of local experiments must be independent of the velocity of the apparatus, so the most important consequence of this principle is the Copernican idea that [[dimensionless]] physical values such as the [[fine-structure constant]] and [[electron]]-to-[[proton]] mass ratio must not depend on where in space or time we measure them.  Many physicists believe that any [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] theory that satisfies the weak equivalence principle also satisfies the Einstein equivalence principle.

''[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture'' suggests that the weak equivalence principle implies the Einstein equivalence principle, but it has not been proven. Nonetheless, the two principles are tested with very different kinds of experiments. The Einstein equivalence principle has been criticized as imprecise, because there is no universally accepted way to distinguish gravitational from non-gravitational experiments (see for instance Hadley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Hadley |doi=10.1007/BF02764119 |journal=Foundations of Physics Letters |volume=10 |issue=1 |title=The Logic of Quantum Mechanics Derived from Classical General Relativity |pages=43–60 |year=1997 |arxiv=quant-ph/9706018|bibcode = 1997FoPhL..10...43H |citeseerx=10.1.1.252.6335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Durand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durand | first1 = Stéphane | year = 2002| title = An amusing analogy: modelling quantum-type behaviours with wormhole-based time travel | url = http://stacks.iop.org/ob/4/S351 | journal = Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = S351–S357| doi = 10.1088/1464-4266/4/4/319 | bibcode = 2002JOptB...4S.351D }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle====
In addition to the tests of the weak equivalence principle, the Einstein equivalence principle can be tested by searching for variation of [[dimensionless]] [[fundamental physical constants|constants and mass ratios]]. The present best limits on the variation of the fundamental constants have mainly been set by studying the naturally occurring [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]], where nuclear reactions similar to ones we observe today have been shown to have occurred underground approximately two billion years ago. These reactions are extremely sensitive to the values of the fundamental constants.

There have been a number of controversial attempts to constrain the variation of the [[strong interaction]] constant. There have been several suggestions that "constants" do vary on cosmological scales. The best known is the reported detection of variation (at the 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; level) of the fine-structure constant from measurements of distant [[quasar]]s, see Webb et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Michael T. |last2=Murphy |first3=Victor V. |last3=Flambaum |first4=Vladimir A. |last4=Dzuba |first5=John D. |last5=Barrow |first6=Chris W. |last6=Churchill |first7=Jason X. |last7=Prochaska |first8=Arthur M. |last8=Wolfe |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.091301 |journal=Physical Review Letters |title=Further Evidence for Cosmological Evolution of the Fine Structure Constant |volume=87 |issue=9 |year=2001 |arxiv=astro-ph/0012539 |pmid=11531558 |bibcode=2001PhRvL..87i1301W |pages=091301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} dispute these findings. Other tests of the Einstein equivalence principle are [[gravitational redshift]] experiments, such as the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]] which test the position independence of experiments.

===The strong equivalence principle===
The strong equivalence principle suggests the laws of gravitation are independent of velocity and location. In particular,
:''The gravitational motion of a small test body depends only on its initial position in spacetime and velocity, and not on its constitution.''
and
: ''The outcome of any local experiment (gravitational or not) in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
The first part is a version of the weak equivalence principle that applies to objects that exert a gravitational force on themselves, such as stars, planets, black holes or [[Cavendish experiment]]s. The second part is the Einstein equivalence principle (with the same definition of "local"), restated to allow gravitational experiments and self-gravitating bodies. The freely-falling object or laboratory, however, must still be small, so that tidal forces may be neglected (hence "local experiment").

This is the only form of the equivalence principle that applies to self-gravitating objects (such as stars), which have substantial internal gravitational interactions. It requires that the [[gravitational constant]] be the same everywhere in the universe and is incompatible with a [[fifth force]]. It is much more restrictive than the Einstein equivalence principle.

The strong equivalence principle suggests that gravity is entirely geometrical by nature (that is, the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] alone determines the effect of gravity) and does not have any extra fields associated with it. If an observer measures a patch of space to be flat, then the strong equivalence principle suggests that it is absolutely equivalent to any other patch of flat space elsewhere in the universe. Einstein's theory of general relativity (including the [[cosmological constant]]) is thought to be the only theory of gravity that satisfies the strong equivalence principle. A number of alternative theories, such as [[Brans–Dicke theory]], satisfy only the Einstein equivalence principle.

====Tests of the strong equivalence principle====
The strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for a variation of Newton's gravitational constant ''G'' over the life of the universe, or equivalently, variation in the masses of the fundamental particles. A number of independent constraints, from orbits in the solar system and studies of [[big bang nucleosynthesis]] have shown that ''G'' cannot have varied by more than 10%.

Thus, the strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for [[fifth force]]s (deviations from the gravitational force-law predicted by general relativity). These experiments typically look for failures of the [[inverse-square law]] (specifically [[Yukawa potential|Yukawa forces]] or failures of [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]]) behavior of gravity in the laboratory. The most accurate tests over short distances have been performed by the Eöt–Wash group. A future satellite experiment, SEE (Satellite Energy Exchange), will search for fifth forces in space and should be able to further constrain violations of the strong equivalence principle. Other limits, looking for much longer-range forces, have been placed by searching for the [[Nordtvedt effect]], a "polarization" of solar system orbits that would be caused by gravitational self-energy accelerating at a different rate from normal matter. This effect has been sensitively tested by the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]]. Other tests include studying the deflection of radiation from [[astronomical radio source|distant radio sources]] by the sun, which can be accurately measured by [[very long baseline interferometry]]. Another sensitive test comes from measurements of the frequency shift of signals to and from the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft. Together, these measurements have put tight limits on [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and other alternative theories of gravity.

In 2014, astronomers discovered a stellar triple system including a millisecond [[pulsar]] [[PSR J0337+1715]] and two [[white dwarf]]s orbiting it. The system provided them a chance to test the strong equivalence principle in a strong gravitational field with high accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12917.html#ref7 |title=A millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system |first1=Scott M. |last1=Ransom |display-authors=etal |journal=Nature |year=2014 |accessdate=8 January 2014 |doi=10.1038/nature12917 |arxiv = 1401.0535 |bibcode = 2014Natur.505..520R |volume=505 |issue=7484 |pages=520–524 |pmid=24390352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Universality of free fall from the orbital motion of a pulsar in a stellar triple system|author=Anne M.

==Challenges==
One challenge to the equivalence principle is the [[Brans–Dicke theory]]. [[Self-creation cosmology]] is a modification of the Brans–Dicke theory. The [[Fredkin Finite Nature Hypothesis]] is an even more radical challenge to the equivalence principle and has even fewer supporters.

In August 2010, researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology, and Cambridge University published a paper titled "Evidence for spatial variation of the [[fine structure constant]]", whose tentative conclusion is that, "qualitatively, [the] results suggest a violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle, and could infer a very large or infinite universe, within which our 'local' [[Hubble volume]] represents a tiny fraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1008.3907 |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Julian A. |last2=King |first3=Michael T. |last3=Murphy |first4=Victor V. |last4=Flambaum |first5=Robert F. |last5=Carswell |first6=Matthew B. |last6=Bainbridge |title=Evidence for spatial variation of the fine structure constant |year=2010 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.191101 |pmid=22181590 |volume=107 |issue=19 |pages=191101 |journal=Physical Review Letters |bibcode=2011PhRvL.107s1101W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Einstein's Mistakes'', pages 226–227, Hans C. Ohanian describes several situations which falsify Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Inertial accelerative effects are analogous to, but not equivalent to, gravitational effects.  Ohanian cites Ehrenfest for this same opinion.

==Explanations==
Dutch physicist and [[string theory|string theorist]] [[Erik Verlinde]] has generated a self-contained, logical derivation of the equivalence principle based on the starting assumption of a [[holographic universe]].  Given this situation, gravity would not be a true [[fundamental force]] as is currently thought but instead an "[[emergent property]]" related to [[entropy]].  Verlinde's [[entropic gravity]] theory apparently leads naturally to the correct observed strength of [[dark energy]]; previous failures to explain its incredibly small magnitude have been called by such people as cosmologist [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]] (who is credited as having coined the term "dark energy") as "the greatest embarrassment in the history of theoretical physics".&lt;ref name=Wright2001&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Karen |title=Very Dark Energy |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/mar/featdark#.USwYk6XmjoI |publisher=Discover Magazine |accessdate=26 February 2013 |date=1 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it should be noted that these ideas are far from settled and still very controversial.

Extrajudicial killings (EJKs) is also synonymous with the term "extralegal killings" (ELKs). Extrajudicial/ extralegal killings (EJKs/ ELKs) and enforced disappearances (EDs) are unique in the Philippines in as much as it is publicly and commonly known to be committed also by non-state armed groups (NAGs) such as the New Peoples Army (NPA) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Although cases have been well documented with conservative estimates of EJKs/ ELKs and EDs committed by the NPAs numbering to about 900-1,000 victims based on the discovery of numerous mass grave sites all over country, legal mechanisms for accountability of non-state actors have been weak if not wholly non-existent.

==Nature==
{{update|section|January 1, 2018|date=January 2018}}
Philippine extrajudicial killings are politically motivated murders committed by government officers, punished by local and [[international law]] or [[Treaty|convention]]. They include assassinations; deaths due to strafing or indiscriminate firing; massacre; [[summary execution]] is done if the victim becomes passive before the moment of death (i.e., abduction leading to death); assassination means forthwith or instant killing while [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]] is akin to [[genocide]] or mass extermination; thus, killings occurred in many regions or places throughout the Philippines in different times - 136 killings in Southern Tagalog region were recorded by human rights group [[Karapatan]] from 2001 to May 19, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/publications/summit/Summit%20Papers/ta%C3%B1ada%20-%20ending%20extrajudicial%20killings.pdf|title=www.supremecourt.gov.ph, ENDING EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS AND ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES: REFRAMING THE NATIONAL SECURITY PARADIGM AND PUTTING HUMAN RIGHTS AT THE HEART OF THE PROCESS - WIGBERTO E.

A [[forced disappearance]] (desaparecidos), on the other hand, as form of [[extrajudicial punishment]] is perpetrated by government officers, when any of its public officers abducts an individual, to vanish from public view, resulting to murder or plain [[Sequestration (law)|sequestration]]. The victim is first kidnapped, then  illegally detained in [[concentration camps]], often tortured, and finally executed and the corpse hidden. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], "disappeared people" are called ''desaparecidos'', a term which specifically refers to the mostly [[South America]]n victims of [[state terrorism]] during the 1970s and the 1980s, in particular concerning [[Operation Condor]]. In the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]], "Enforced disappearance" is defined in Article 2 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] as "the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx|title=redirect page|website=www.ohchr.org|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AsiaRegion/Pages/PHIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR - Philippines Homepage|website=www.ohchr.org|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Marcos regime===
In 1995, 10,000 Filipinos won a U.S. class-suit against the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] estate. The charges were filed by victims or their surviving relatives for torture, execution and disappearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1344412006 |title=No hero's resting place as Imelda Marcos finds site for husband's grave |author=Hrvoje Hranjski |work=The Scotsman |date=12 September 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights groups placed the number of victims of extrajudicial killings under martial law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/121365-torture-martial-law-marcos-regime|title=Worse than death: Torture methods during martial law|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 1500 and over 800 abductions; [[Karapatan]] (a local human rights group's) records show 759 involuntarily disappeared (their bodies never found). Military historian [[Alfred W. McCoy|Alfred McCoy]] in his book "Closer than Brothers: Manhood at the Philippine Military Academy" and in his speech "Dark Legacy" cites 3,257 extrajudicial killings, 35,000 torture victims, and 70,000 incarcerated during the Marcos years.&lt;ref name="hartford-hwp.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54a/062.html|title=Alfred McCoy, Dark Legacy: Human rights under the Marcos regime|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/6-32/6-32-power.htm |title=Marcos Kin, Allies Still within Corridors of Power |work=Bulatalat |author=Alexander Martin Remollino |date=September 17, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper "Bulatlat" places the number of victims of arbitrary arrest and detention at 120,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/6-32/6-32-specter.htm |title=The Specter of Martial Law |work=Bulatalat |author=Benjie Oliveros |date=September 17, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080105131654/http://news.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2809885 scotsman.com, No hero's resting place as Imelda Marcos finds site for husband's grave] (archived from [http://news.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2809885 the original] on 2008-01-05)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2007/10/01/18450919.php|title=Memoirs of Martial Law in the Philippines : Indybay|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New People's Army]] (NPA) groups known as "Sparrow Units" were active in the mid-1980s, killing government officials, police personnel, military members, and anyone else they targeted for elimination. They were also part of an NPA operation called "Agaw Armas" ([[Filipino language|Filipino]] for "Stealing Weapons"), where they raided government armories as well as stealing weapons from slain military and police personnel. A low level civil war with south [[Muslims]], [[Al-Qaeda]] sympathizers and [[communist]] insurgents has led to a general break down of [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. The [[Politics of the Philippines#National Government of the Philippines|Philippines government]] has promised to curb the killings, but is itself implicated in many of the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoyhr.net/|title=Supporters of Marijuana Legalization|website=Supporters of Marijuana Legalization|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060107160314/http://www.philippinerevolution.net/index.shtml  philippinerevolution.net, website, CCP] (archived from [http://www.philippinerevolution.net/index.shtml the original] on 2006-01-07)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070105153252/http://www.philippinerevolution.net/npa/index.shtml  philippinerevolution.net, website NPA] (archived from [http://www.philippinerevolution.net/npa/index.shtml the original] on 2007-01-05)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1975, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) was deeply concerned in politics. Because of the armed conflict, the military continued its campaign versus the New People's Army of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP). Since 1969 it aimed to establish a Marxist regime with armed rebellion against the government. On top of all these chaos, left-wing non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were/are critical of the [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] administration. The members who associated with the CPP and NPA had been targeted as victims in the spate of political killings. [[Human Rights Watch]] investigated extrajudicial murders in the Philippines in September 2007.&lt;ref name="hartford-hwp.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/asia-pacific/048/05.html|title=Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions&lt;br&gt;In the Philippines, 2001-2006  - ヒューライツ大阪|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcij.org/blog/wp-docs/karapatan_2007_hr_report.pdf  www.pcij.org, Karapatan’s 2007 human rights report] {{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three major investigation groups were commissioned and their final reports had been submitted and published: the [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] government-appointed bodies: a) Task Force Usig created by her on August; as a special police body, it was assigned to solve 10 cases of killings; it claimed having solved 21 cases, by initiating court cases, but only 12 suspects were arrested; b) the Melo Commission (chaired by Supreme Court Associate Justice Jose Melo) with members National Bureau of Investigation Director Nestor Mantaring, Chief State Prosecutor Jovencito Zuño, Bishop Juan de dios Pueblos, and Nelia Torres Gonzales; its final report states: "There is no official or sanctioned policy on the part of the military or its civilian superiors to resort to what other countries euphemistically call "alternative procedures"{{snd}}meaning illegal executions. However, there is certainly evidence pointing the finger of suspicion at some elements and personalities in the armed forces, in particular General [[Jovito Palparan]], as responsible for an undetermined number of killings, by allowing, tolerating, and even encouraging the killings."

==Remedies==

===Malacañang's peace summit and Puno's killings summit===
* Because of the magnitude of Philippine killings and desaparecidos, 22nd [[Chief Justice]] [[Reynato Puno]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] called a National Consultative Summit on extrajudicial killings on July 16 and 17, 2007 at the [[Manila Hotel]]. Invited representatives from the branches of the government participated (including the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], the PNP, [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)]], media, [[academe]], [[civil society]] and other stakeholders). On the other hand, the [[Malacañang]]-sponsored "Mindanao Peace and Security Summit" (July 8–10, 2007 at [[Cagayan de Oro City]]) concentrated on the anti-terror law, or the Human Security Act (HSA) of 2007, to make it more acceptable to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=75094|title=Inquirer.net, SC slates summit on extrajudicial killings|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708181922/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=75094|archivedate=8 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/49959/SC-slates-summit-on-extrajudicial-killings|title=SC slates summit on extrajudicial killings|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the July 16 summit, Reynato Puno stated that he Commission on Human Rights reported the number of victims at 403 from 2001 to May 31, 2007, while [[Karapatan]] reported 863 deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view_article.php?article_id=78036 |title=Inquirer Opinion - Inquirer Opinion |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605022710/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view_article.php?article_id=78036 |archivedate=5 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2007, and more than 900 as of May, 2008, and most of them were members of left wing groups.

===Promulgation of Writs of Amparo and Habeas Data===
Because of the inefficacy and insufficiency of the Philippines [[Writ of Habeas Corpus]], on September 25, 2007, Chief Justice Reynato Puno signed and released the Writ of Amparo: "This rule will provide the victims of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances the protection they need and the promise of vindication for their rights. This rule empowers our courts to issue reliefs that may be granted through judicial orders of protection, production, inspection and other relief to safeguard one's life and liberty The writ of amparo shall hold public authorities, those who took their oath to defend the constitution and enforce our laws, to a high standard of official conduct and hold them accountable to our people.

Puno explained that the ''writ of amparo'' denies to authorities defense of simple denial, and ''habeas data'' can find out what information is held by the officer, rectify or even the destroy erroneous data gathered.

===International criticism===
On September 28, 2007, the [[Asian Human Rights Commission]] (AHRC) criticized the [[Writ of Amparo and Habeas Data (Philippines)]] for being insufficient: "Though it responds to practical areas it is still necessary that further action must be taken in addition to this.

==International reports - the root cause of killings==

===Alston UN report===
* [[Philip Alston]] submitted his final report on the killings; he found that the Armed Forces of the Philippines killed left-wing activists to get rid of communist insurgents: "the executions had "eliminated civil society leaders, including human rights defenders, trade unionists and land reform advocates, intimidated a vast number of civil society actors, and narrowed the country’s political discourse." Alston denied for lack of merit the government's claim that killings were perpetrated by communists to exterminate spies and to make negative propaganda versus government. Alston, in February 2007 stated that the military made alibis or denials on its role about 800 deaths of activists and journalists since 2001. Alston blamed "impunity" which caused the executions of journalists and leftist activists: "the priorities of the criminal justice system had been "distorted," and had "increasingly focused on prosecuting civil society leaders rather than their killers." But Alston noted the government's creation of{{snd}}special courts to try extrajudicial killings, the Melo Commission and the Philippine National Police's Task Force Usig.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080125073614/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=103513 newsinfo.inquirer.net, Alston report: AFP behind killings, Report rejects RP claim of Red purge] (archived from [http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=103513 the original] on 2008-01-25)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080507174217/http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/about/people.html Philip Alston, UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions] (archived from [http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/about/people.html#alston the original] on 2008-05-07&lt;!-- data retrieval error being reported as of 2010-12-10--&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt; In the November U.N. Alston report - the killings in 2007 was only 68, huge drop from the 209 murdered in 2006.

===Failed investigations and prosecutions===
*The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Execution found that just on paper trails, cases are filed; but Alston officially concluded that “there is a passivity, bordering on an abdication of responsibility, which affects the way in which key institutions and actors approach their responsibilities in relation to such human rights concerns; prosecutors refused to take a role in gathering evidence, and instead being purely passive, waiting for the police to present them with a file; the Ombudsman’s office did almost nothing in recent years in this regard, failing to act in any of the 44 complaints alleging extrajudicial executions attributed to State agents submitted from 2002 to 2006." (“Preliminary note on the visit of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, to the Philippines (12–21 February 2007),” A/HRC/4/20/Add.3, March 22, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;4., etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2007/philippines0607/5.htm#_ftn104|title=Scared Silent: Impunity for Extrajudicial Killings in the Philippines: V.

===Eric G. John and G. Eugene Martin testimonies===
* On March 14, 2007, Eric G. John, Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs testified before the USA Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations at [[Washington, D.C.]] John submitted his written statement: a) the increase in extrajudicial killings, b) the “Huk Rebellion” in the 1940s and 50s causing thousands of murdered victims; c) the communist New People's Army (NPA), which was listed in the [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]] campaigned to overthrow the government since 1968; d) Extrajudicial killings by the security forces, the NPA, etc. during the Marcos regime, were less; and e) noted the report of UN Special Rapporteur Alston which submitted the Philippine Government's recognition of the gravity of the problem, expresses concern about the views of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regarding the problem, but much had to submitted that the reforms made did not and will not resolve the killings. Mr. Alston's March report stated that "the question of resources or technical expertise will partly resolve the killings but the strong risk is that these measures will treat only some of the symptoms of the crisis, and will fail to address meaningfully two of the most important underlying causes of a great many of the killings." (A/HRC/4/20/Add.3, March 22, 2007) Alston named two root causes of the killings: (1) 'vilification', 'labeling’, or 'guilt by association'{{snd}}"characterization of most groups on the left of the political spectrum as ‘front organizations’ for armed groups whose aim is to destroy democracy" making the groups "considered to be legitimate targets; and (2) the Government’s counter-insurgency strategy's extent of facilitating killings of activists and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alrc.net/doc/mainfile.php/alrc_statements/453/|title=[ALRC Joint Statement] PHILIPPINES: Extrajudicial killings|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usip.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/congress/testimony/2007/0314_martin.html|title=www.usip.org, Briefings and Congressional Testimony - Testimony of G.

Eugene Martin specifically expanded the 2 causes of the violence and killings: a) weak political and social institutions, corrupt and ineffective judicial system, resulting to failure to obtain justice from corrupt Philippine courts; and b) the legacy of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] regime; [[Martial law]] caused the corrupt system where soldiers, police, judges and prosecutors became principals of offenses like extralegal arrest, detention, incarceration, disappearances and killings (salvaging), all permitted or allowed. He traced the spate of violence and killings to political instability of President Arroyo government; while she created the Independent Commission to Address Media and Activist Killings, Melo Commission, she had no capability to end the killings, due to her political lameness because of the 2004 election controversy.&lt;ref name="usip.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usip.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080801144003/https://www.senate.gov/~foreign/hearings/2007/hrg070314p.html www.senate.gov, Extrajudicial Killings In The Philippines: Strategies To End The Violence] (archived from [https://www.senate.gov/~foreign/hearings/2007/hrg070314p.html the original] on 2008-08-01)&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIDH report===
* Three experts from the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (abbreviated ''FIDH''), Mr. Nabeel Rajab (Bahrain), Mr. Mouloud Boumghar (France) and Mr. Frédéric Ceuppens (Belgium), came to the Philippines on August 13 to 23, 2007. Their FIDH mission report stated that torture and ill-treatment was widespread versus suspected "terrorists". The Filipino government is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the UN Convention against Torture (CAT). The FIDH dismissed the Philippines government's claim doubts that mechanisms were placed to stop the killings, as it questioned the efficiency of{{snd}}the corrupt judiciary, the government “Witness Protection Programme” ; also, judges and lawyers were victims themselves of killings. It also found the Philippine anti-terrorism law ( “Human Security Act”) to result in more torture and extrajudicial killings as a fight against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/philippines-mission.pdfwww.fidh.org,|title=Philippines International Fact-Finding Mission|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial corruption===
On January 25, 2005, and on December 10, 2006, Philippines [[Social Weather Stations]] released the results of its two surveys on corruption in the judiciary; it published that: a) like 1995, 1/4 of lawyers said many/very many judges are corrupt. But (49%) stated that a judges received bribes, just 8% of lawyers admitted they reported the [[bribery]], because they could not prove it. [Tables 8-9]; judges, however, said, just 7% call many/very many judges as corrupt[Tables 10-11];b) "Judges see some corruption; proportions who said - many/very many corrupt judges or justices: 17% in reference to RTC judges, 14% to MTC judges, 12% to Court of Appeals justices, 4% i to Shari'a Court judges, 4% to [[Sandiganbayan]] justices and 2% in reference to Supreme Court justices [Table 15].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sws.org.ph/pr061210.htm |title=SWS Media Release: 6 July 2006 |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517073044/http://www.sws.org.ph/pr061210.htm |archivedate=17 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sws.org.ph/pr050125.htm |title=SWS Media Release |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517072913/http://www.sws.org.ph/pr050125.htm |archivedate=17 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In February, 2007, The U.S. ambassador to the Philippines has broken her silence and called on Manila to end extrajudicial killings. On Feb. 27, [[Kristie Kenney]] U.S. ambassador to the Philippines alerted Mrs. Arroyo as she voiced her call to end these killings: "Let's beef up the human rights in the Armed Forces of the Philippines and make every effort to investigate, prosecute those responsible, [and] exonerate the innocent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/article.aspx?id=583|title=Philippines Reeling From Revelations of Extrajudicial Killings|author=Fabio Scarpello|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4341">'''Feed The Deed''', also known as '''#FeedtheDeed''', is a social media [[Pay it forward|pay-it-forward]] initiative that started in February 2014. Participants film themselves performing a creative [[random act of kindness]], then nominate friends and family to continue on the chain. The participant usually uploads a video or pictures of the kind act to [[Facebook]], then will tag four or five friends in the post. The nominated person is generally told to complete the task within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2014/02/06/online-drinking-game-sparks-kindness-challenge |title=Online drinking game sparks kindness challenge &amp;#124; Toronto &amp; GTA &amp;#124; News |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2014-02-06 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this initiative was started, over 10,000 #FeedtheDeed posts have been uploaded to various forms of social media.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Megan Griffo |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/05/feed-the-deed_n_4898943.html |title=5 Priceless Ways These People Made Someone Else's Day Just A Little Bit Brighter |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend is most popular in Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Mexico, but has since spread to over 30 countries.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; The act of kindness can be anything – from donating food and clothes to the homeless, to giving blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Feed+Deed+fuels+positivity+Canadian+university+campuses/9527086/story.html |title=Feed the Deed fuels positivity on Canadian university campuses |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Feed The Deed originated as a response to the [[Neknominate]] drinking game, in which participants film themselves drinking alcohol then nominate friends to do the same.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"/&gt;

Josh Stern, a medical student at the [[University of Ottawa]], posted his original #FeedtheDeed video to his Facebook page. He was then contacted by his friend Russell Citron, who is president and founder of the non-profit organization [[Kindness Counts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/heebonics/spread-kindness-not-drunken-recklessness |title=Spread kindness, not drunken recklessness &amp;#124; The Canadian Jewish News |publisher=Cjnews.com |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two decided to collaborate on the project by taking Stern's #FeedtheDeed moniker and running it through Citron's organization Kindness Counts.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"/&gt;

Stern says that the inspiration for #FeedtheDeed came from a [[YouTube]] video in which Brent Lindeque decided to use his neknomination to give food to a homeless man instead of drinking alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritanmag.com/features/alcohol-fuelled-neknominations-replaced-feed-deed-kindness |title=Alcohol-Fuelled Neknominations Replaced by Feed The Deed Kindness &amp;#124; Samaritanmag.com - The Anti-Tabloid |publisher=Samaritanmag.com |date=2014-02-18 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindeque is currently running a similar campaign in [[South Africa]] called #ChangeOneThing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsu.ca/interrobang_article.php?storyID=10413&amp;sectionID=1&amp;issueID=251 |title=Fanshawe Student Union &gt; Interrobang |publisher=Fsu.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flajolet–Martin algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for approximating the number of distinct elements in a stream with a single pass and space-consumption logarithmic in the maximal number of possible distinct elements in the stream (the [[count-distinct problem]]). The algorithm was introduced by [[Philippe Flajolet]] and [[G. Nigel Martin]] in their 1984 article "Probabilistic Counting Algorithms for Data Base Applications".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0000(85)90041-8 |title=Probabilistic counting algorithms for data base applications |journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=182&amp;ndash;209 |year=1985 |last1=Flajolet |first1=Philippe |last2=Martin |first2=G. Nigel |url=http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlMa85.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it has been refined in "LogLog counting of large cardinalities" by [[Marianne Durand]] and [[Philippe Flajolet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-39658-1_55 |chapter=Loglog Counting of Large Cardinalities |chapter-url=http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/DuFl03-LNCS.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-11 |title= Algorithms - ESA 2003 |volume=2832 |pages=605 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=2003 |last1=Durand |first1=Marianne |last2=Flajolet |first2=Philippe |isbn=978-3-540-20064-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[HyperLogLog]]: The analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm" by [[Philippe Flajolet]] et al.&lt;ref name="flajolet07"&gt;{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.76.4286 |first1=Philippe |last1=Flajolet |first2=Éric |last2=Fusy |first3=Olivier |last3=Gandouet |first4=Frédéric |last4=Meunier |title=Hyperloglog: The analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm |url=http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf  |accessdate=2016-12-11 |year=2007 |volume=AH |pages=127–146 |journal=Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science proceedings |location=[[Nancy, France]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2010 article "An optimal algorithm for the distinct elements problem",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1145/1807085.1807094 |chapter=An optimal algorithm for the distinct elements problem|chapter-url=http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-dpwoodru/knw11.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-11 |title=Proceedings of the twenty-ninth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems of data - PODS '10 |page=41 |year=2010 |last1=Kane |first1=Daniel M. |last2=Nelson |first2=Jelani |last3=Woodruff |first3=David P. |isbn=978-1-4503-0033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel M. Kane, Jelani Nelson and David P. Woodruff give an improved algorithm, which uses nearly optimal space and has optimal ''O''(1) update and reporting times.

==The algorithm==
Assume that we are given a [[hash function]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{hash}(x)&lt;/math&gt; that maps input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to integers in the range &lt;math&gt;[0; 2^L - 1]&lt;/math&gt;, and where the outputs are sufficiently [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniformly distributed]]. Note that the set of integers from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2^L - 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the set of binary strings of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. For any non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{bit}(y,k)&lt;/math&gt; to be the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th bit in the binary representation of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, such that:

:&lt;math&gt;
y = \sum_{k \geq 0} \mathrm{bit}(y,k) 2^k.
&lt;/math&gt;

We then define a function &lt;math&gt;\rho(y)&lt;/math&gt; that outputs the position of the least-significant set bit in the binary representation of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(y) = \min \{k \geq 0 \mid \mathrm{bit}(y,k) \neq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho(0) = L&lt;/math&gt;. Note that with the above definition we are using 0-indexing for the positions. For example, &lt;math&gt;\rho(13) = \rho(1101_{2}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, since the least significant bit is a 1 (0th position), and &lt;math&gt;\rho(8) = \rho(1000_{2}) = 3&lt;/math&gt;, since the least significant bit is at the 3rd position. At this point, note that under the assumption that the output of our hash function is uniformly distributed, then the probability of observing a hash output ending with &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt; (a one, followed by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; zeroes) is &lt;math&gt;2^{-(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt;, since this corresponds to flipping &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; heads and then a tail with a fair coin.

Now the Flajolet–Martin algorithm for estimating the cardinality of a [[multiset]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:
# Initialize a bit-vector BITMAP to be of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and contain all 0s.
# For each element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
## Calculate the index &lt;math&gt;i = \rho(\mathrm{hash}(x))&lt;/math&gt;.
## Set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[i] = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote the smallest index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[i] = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Estimate the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;2^R / \phi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi \approx 0.77351&lt;/math&gt;.

The idea is that if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of distinct elements in the multiset &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[0]&lt;/math&gt; is accessed approximately &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; times, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[1]&lt;/math&gt; is accessed approximately &lt;math&gt;n/4&lt;/math&gt; times and so on. Consequently, if &lt;math&gt;i \gg \log_2 n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[i]&lt;/math&gt; is almost certainly 0, and if &lt;math&gt;i \ll \log_2 n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[i]&lt;/math&gt; is almost certainly 1. If &lt;math&gt;i \approx \log_2 n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[i]&lt;/math&gt; can be expected to be either 1 or 0.

The correction factor &lt;math&gt;\phi \approx 0.77351&lt;/math&gt; is found by calculations, which can be found in the original article.

==Improving accuracy==
A problem with the Flajolet–Martin algorithm in the above form is that the results vary significantly. A common solution has been to run the algorithm multiple times with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; different hash functions and combine the results from the different runs. One idea is to take the mean of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; results together from each hash function, obtaining a single estimate of the cardinality. The problem with this is that averaging is very susceptible to outliers (which are likely here). A different idea is to use the [[median]], which is less prone to be influences by outliers. The problem with this is that the results can only take form &lt;math&gt;2^R / \phi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is integer. A common solution is to combine both the mean and the median: Create &lt;math&gt;k \cdot l&lt;/math&gt; hash functions and split them into &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; distinct groups (each of size &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;). Within each group use the median for aggregating together the &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; results, and finally take the mean of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; group estimates as the final estimate.

The 2007 [[HyperLogLog]] algorithm splits the multiset into subsets and estimates their cardinalities, then it uses the [[harmonic mean]] to combine them into an estimate for the original cardinality.&lt;ref name="flajolet07"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40353">The '''Gettier problem''', in the field of [[epistemology]], is a landmark [[philosophy|philosophical]] problem concerning our understanding of [[descriptive knowledge]]. Attributed to American philosopher [[Edmund Gettier]], Gettier-type counterexamples (called "Gettier-cases") challenge the long-held [[justified true belief]] (JTB) account of knowledge. The JTB account holds that knowledge is equivalent to justified true belief; if all three conditions (justification, truth, and belief) are met of a given claim, then we have knowledge of that claim. In his 1963 three-page paper titled "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", Gettier attempts to illustrate by means of two counterexamples that there are cases where individuals can have a justified, true belief regarding a claim but still fail to know it because the reasons for the belief, while justified, turn out to be false. Thus, Gettier claims to have shown that the JTB account is inadequate; that it does not account for all of the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge.

The term "Gettier problem", "Gettier case", or even the adjective "Gettiered", is sometimes used to describe any case in the field of epistemology that purports to repudiate the JTB account of knowledge.

Responses to Gettier's paper have been numerous; some reject Gettier's examples, while others seek to adjust the JTB account of knowledge and blunt the force of these counterexamples. Gettier problems have even found their way into sociological experiments, where the intuitive responses from people of varying demographics to Gettier cases have been studied.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==History==
The question of what constitutes "knowledge" is as old as philosophy itself. Early instances are found in Plato's dialogues, notably ''[[Meno]]'' (97a–98b) and ''[[Theaetetus_(dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.  Gettier himself was not actually the first to raise the problem named after him; its existence was acknowledged by both [[Alexius Meinong]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], the latter of which discussed the problem in his book ''Human knowledge: Its scope and limits''.

Russell's case, called the stopped clock case, goes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;'Conditions of Knowledge' (1965). Chicago: Scott, Foresman&lt;/ref&gt; Alice sees a clock that reads two o'clock and believes that the time is two o'clock.  It is, in fact, two o'clock. There's a problem, however: unknown to Alice, the clock she's looking at stopped twelve hours ago.  Alice thus has an accidentally true, justified belief. Russell provides an answer of his own to the problem. Edmund Gettier's formulation of the problem was important as it coincided with the rise of the sort of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|philosophical naturalism]] promoted by [[W. V. O. Quine]] and others, and was used as a justification for a shift towards [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] theories of justification.&lt;ref name="McGrews_on_Gettier"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Routledge |publication-place = Abingdon, Oxon |author = Timothy McGrew |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24647810M/Internalism_and_Externalism |title = Internalism and Externalism |publication-date = 2007 }}, chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John L. Pollock]] and Joseph Cruz have stated that the Gettier problem has "fundamentally altered the character of contemporary epistemology" and has become "a central problem of epistemology since it poses a clear barrier to analyzing knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |isbn = 0-8476-8936-0 |publication-place = Lanham, Md |title = Contemporary theories of knowledge |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL31726M/Contemporary_theories_of_knowledge |author1 = John L. Pollock |author2 = Joseph Cruz |publication-date = 1999 |id = 0847689360 |pages= 13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alvin Plantinga]] rejects the historical analysis:
{{Quote|According to the inherited lore of the epistemological tribe, the JTB [justified true belief] account enjoyed the status of epistemological orthodoxy until 1963, when it was shattered by Edmund Gettier...  Of course, there is an interesting historical irony here: it isn't easy to find many really explicit statements of a JTB analysis of knowledge prior to Gettier.  It is almost as if a distinguished critic created a tradition in the very act of destroying it.&lt;ref name="PlantingaWCD"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Alvin Plantinga|title=Warrant: The Current Debate|publication-date=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-507862-4|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite this, Plantinga ''does'' accept that some philosophers before Gettier have advanced a JTB account of knowledge, specifically [[C. I. Lewis]] and [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name="PlantingaWCD" /&gt;

==Knowledge as justified true belief (JTB)==

The JTB account of knowledge is the claim that knowledge can be conceptually analyzed as justified true belief, which is to say that the ''meaning'' of sentences such as "Smith knows that it rained today" can be given with the following set of conditions, which are [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient]] for knowledge to obtain:

:A subject &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; ''knows'' that a proposition &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is true [[if and only if]]:

:# &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is true, and
:# &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; believes that &lt;var&gt;P &lt;/var&gt; is true, and
:# &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; is [[theory of justification|justified]] in believing that &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is true

The JTB account was first credited to [[Plato]], though Plato argued against this very account of knowledge in the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (210a). This account of knowledge is what Gettier subjected to criticism.

==Gettier's two original counterexamples==

Gettier's paper used counterexamples (see also [[thought experiment]]) to argue that there are cases of beliefs that are both true and justified—therefore satisfying all three conditions for knowledge on the JTB account—but that do not appear to be genuine cases of knowledge. Therefore, Gettier argued, his counterexamples show that the JTB account of knowledge is false, and thus that a different conceptual analysis is needed to correctly track what we mean by "knowledge".

Gettier's case is based on two counterexamples to the JTB analysis. Each relies on two claims. Firstly, that justification is preserved by [[entailment]], and secondly that this applies coherently to Smith's putative "belief". That is, that if Smith is justified in believing P, and Smith realizes that the truth of P entails the truth of Q, then Smith would ''also'' be justified in believing Q. Gettier calls these counterexamples "Case I" and "Case II":

===Case I===
: Suppose that Smith and Jones have applied for a certain job. And suppose that Smith has strong evidence for the following conjunctive proposition: (d) Jones is the man who will get the job, and Jones has ten coins in his pocket.

: Smith's evidence for (d) might be that the president of the company assured him that Jones would, in the end, be selected and that he, Smith, had counted the coins in Jones's pocket ten minutes ago. Proposition (d) entails: (e) The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.

: Let us suppose that Smith sees the entailment from (d) to (e), and accepts (e) on the grounds of (d), for which he has strong evidence. In this case, Smith is clearly justified in believing that (e) is true.

: But imagine, further, that unknown to Smith, he himself, not Jones, will get the job. And, also, unknown to Smith, he himself has ten coins in his pocket. Proposition (e) is true, though proposition (d), from which Smith inferred (e), is false. In our example, then, all of the following are true: (i) (e) is true, (ii) Smith believes that (e) is true, and (iii) Smith is justified in believing that (e) is true. But it is equally clear that Smith does not ''know'' that (e) is true; for (e) is true in virtue of the number of coins in Smith's pocket, while Smith does not know how many coins are in Smith's pocket, and bases his belief in (e) on a count of the coins in Jones's pocket, whom he falsely believes to be the man who will get the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gettier|first1=Edmund L.|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?|journal=Analysis|date=1 June 1963|volume=23|issue=6|pages=121–123|doi=10.1093/analys/23.6.121|url=https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/23/6/121/109949?redirectedFrom=fulltext|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case II===
: Smith, it is claimed by the hidden [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]], has a justified belief that "Jones owns a Ford". Smith therefore (justifiably) concludes (by the rule of [[disjunction introduction]]) that "Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona", even though Smith has no information whatsoever about the location of Brown.

: In fact, Jones does not own a Ford, but by sheer coincidence, Brown really is in Barcelona. Again, Smith had a belief that was true and justified, but not knowledge.

==False premises==
In both of Gettier's actual examples (see also [[counterfactual conditional]]), the justified true belief came about, if Smith's purported claims are disputable, as the result of entailment (but see also [[material conditional]]) from justified false beliefs that "Jones will get the job" (in case I), and that "Jones owns a Ford" (in case II). This led some early responses to Gettier to conclude that the definition of knowledge could be easily adjusted, so that knowledge was justified true belief that does not depend on [[false premise]]s.

==More general Gettier-style problems==

{{anchor|The sheep in the field}}In a 1966 scenario known as "The sheep in the field", [[Roderick Chisholm]] asks us to imagine that someone is standing outside a field looking at something that looks like a sheep (although in fact, it is a dog disguised as a sheep). They believe there is a sheep in the field, and in fact, they are right because there is a sheep behind the hill in the middle of the field. Hence, they have a justified true belief that there is a sheep in the field. But is that belief knowledge? {{anchor|Cow in the Field}}A similar problem which seeks to be more plausible called the "Cow in the Field" appears in [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]]'s book ''[[101 Philosophy Problems]]'', where it is supposed that a farmer checking up on his favourite cow confuses a piece of black and white paper caught up in a distant bush for his cow. However, since the animal actually is in the field, but hidden in a hollow, again, the farmer has a justified, true belief which seems nonetheless not to qualify as "knowledge". 

{{anchor|The Pyromaniac}}Another scenario by [[Brian Skyrms]] is "The Pyromaniac",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skyrms|first1=Brian|title=The Explication of 'X knows that p'|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=22 June 1967|volume=64|issue=12|pages=373–389|doi=10.2307/2024269|jstor=2024269}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a struck match lights not for the reasons the pyromaniac imagines but because of some unknown "Q radiation". 

{{anchor|Fake barns}}A different perspective on the issue is given by [[Alvin Goldman]] in the "fake barns" scenario (crediting [[Carl Ginet]] with the example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldman|first1=Alvin I.|title=Discrimination and Perceptual Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=18 November 1976|volume=73|issue=20|pages=771–791|doi=10.2307/2025679|jstor=2025679}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this one, a man is driving in the countryside, and sees what looks exactly like a barn. Accordingly, he thinks that he is seeing a barn. In fact, that is what he is doing. But what he does not know is that the neighborhood generally consists of many fake barns — [[Potemkin village|barn facades]] designed to look exactly like real barns when viewed from the road, as in the case of a visit in the countryside by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of Russia, just to please her. Since if he had been looking at one of them, he would have been unable to tell the difference, his "knowledge" that he was looking at a barn would seem to be poorly founded. A similar process appears in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' as an example of [[Stranger in a Strange Land#Fair Witness|Fair Witness]] behavior.

The "no false premises" (or "no false lemmas") solution which was proposed early in the discussion proved to be somewhat problematic, as more general Gettier-style problems were then constructed or contrived in which the justified true belief does not seem to be the result of a chain of reasoning from a justified false belief.

For example:

: After arranging to meet with Mark for help with homework, Luke arrives at the appointed time and place. Walking into Mark's office Luke clearly sees Mark at his desk; Luke immediately forms the belief "Mark is in the room. He can help me with my logic homework". Luke is justified in his belief; he clearly sees Mark at his desk. In fact, it's ''not'' Mark that Luke saw; it was a marvelous hologram, perfect in every respect, giving the appearance of Mark diligently grading papers at his desk. Nevertheless, Mark ''is'' in the room; he is crouched under his desk reading [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. Luke's belief that Mark is in the room is true (he is in the room, under his desk) and justified (Mark's hologram is giving the appearance of Mark hard at work).

Again, it seems as though Luke does not "know" that Mark is in the room, even though it is claimed he has a justified true belief that Mark is in the room, but it is not nearly so clear that the ''perceptual belief'' that "Mark is in the room" was inferred from any premises at all, let alone any false ones, nor led to significant conclusions on its own; Luke did not seem to be reasoning about anything; "Mark is in the room" seems to have been part of what he ''seemed to see''.

To save the "no false lemmas" solution, one must logically say that Luke's inference from sensory data does not count as a justified belief unless he consciously or unconsciously considers the possibilities of deception and self-deception. A justified version of Luke's thought process, by that logic, might go like this:
#That looks to me like Mark in the room.
#No factor, right now, could deceive me on this point.
#Therefore, I can safely ignore that possibility.
#"Mark is in the room" (or, "I can safely treat that as Mark").

The second line counts as a false premise. However, by the previous argument, this suggests we have fewer justified beliefs than we think we do.

==Constructing arbitrary Gettier problems==

The main idea behind Gettier's examples is that the justification for the belief is flawed or incorrect, but the belief turns out to be true by sheer luck. Thus, a general scenario can be constructed as such:

Bob believes A is true because of B. Argument B is flawed, but A turns out to be true by a different argument C. Since A is true, Bob believes A is true, and Bob has justification B, all of the conditions (JTB) are satisfied. However, Bob had no knowledge of A.

==Responses to Gettier==

The Gettier problem is formally a problem in first-order logic, but the introduction by Gettier of terms such as ''believes'' and ''knows'' moves the discussion into the field of epistemology. Here, the sound (true) arguments ascribed to Smith then need also to be valid (believed) and convincing (justified) if they are to issue in the real-world discussion about ''justified true belief''.
&lt;ref&gt;James Pryor. [http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/courses/epist2004/notes/gettier.html Theory of Knowledge - The Gettier Problem] (archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses to Gettier problems have fallen into one of three categories:

* '''Affirmations of the JTB account:''' This response affirms the JTB account of knowledge, but rejects Gettier cases. Typically, the proponent of this response rejects Gettier cases because, they say, Gettier cases involve insufficient levels of justification. Knowledge actually requires higher levels of justification than Gettier cases involve.
* '''Fourth condition responses:''' This response accepts the problem raised by Gettier cases, and affirms that JTB is ''necessary'' (but not ''sufficient'') for knowledge. A proper account of knowledge, according to this type of view, will contain some fourth condition (JTB + ?). With the fourth condition in place, Gettier counterexamples (and other similar counterexamples) will not work, and we will have an adequate set of criteria that are both necessary and sufficient for knowledge.
* '''Justification replacement response:''' This response also accepts the problem raised by Gettier cases. However, instead of invoking a fourth condition, it seeks to replace Justification itself for some other third condition (?TB) (or remove it entirely) that will make counterexamples obsolete.

One response, therefore, is that in none of the above cases was the belief justified because it is impossible to justify anything that is not true.  Conversely, the fact that a proposition turns out to be untrue is proof that it was not sufficiently justified in the first place.  Under this interpretation, the JTB definition of knowledge survives. This shifts the problem to a definition of justification, rather than knowledge.  Another view is that justification and non-justification are not in [[binary opposition]].  Instead, justification is a matter of degree, with an idea being more or less justified.  This account of justification is supported by mainstream philosophers such as Paul Boghossian &lt;ref name="Boghossian on Justification"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Clarendon Press |publication-place = Oxford, UK |author = Paul Boghossian |url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fear-of-knowledge-9780199230419?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |title = Fear of Knowledge: Against relativism and constructivism |publication-date = 2007 }}, Chapter 7, p 95-101.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHTYzyzRt70&amp;feature=youtu.be] and [[Stephen Hicks]][https://web.archive.org/web/20141222000209/http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/hicks-ep-full.pdf][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhK6XOT3uAA].  In common sense usage, an idea can not only be more justified or less justified, but it can also partially justified (Smith's boss told him X) and partially unjustified (Smith's boss is a liar).  Gettier's cases involve propositions that were true, believed, but which had weak justification.  In case 1, the premise that the testimony of Smith's boss is "strong evidence" is rejected.  The case itself depends on the boss being either wrong or deceitful (Jones did not get the job) and therefore unreliable.  In case 2, Smith again has accepted a questionable idea (Jones owns a Ford) with unspecified justification.  Without justification, both cases do not undermine the JTB account of knowledge.

Other epistemologists accept Gettier's conclusion. Their responses to the Gettier problem, therefore, consist of trying to find alternative analyses of knowledge. They have struggled to discover and agree upon as a beginning any single notion of truth, or belief, or justifying which is wholly and obviously accepted. Truth, belief, and justifying have not yet been satisfactorily defined{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}, so that JTB (justified true belief) may be defined satisfactorily is still problematical, on account or otherwise of Gettier's examples. Gettier, for many years a professor at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] later also was interested in the [[epistemic logic]] of [[Jaako Hintikka|Hintikka]], a Finnish philosopher at [[Boston University]], who published ''Knowledge and Belief'' in 1962.
[http://www.umass.edu/chronicle/archives/00/08-25/philosopher41.html]

===Fourth condition (JTB+G) approaches===
The most common direction for this sort of response to take is what might be called a "JTB+G" analysis: that is, an analysis based on finding some ''fourth'' condition—a "no-Gettier-problem" condition—which, when added to the conditions of justification, truth, and belief, will yield a set of necessary and jointly sufficient conditions.

====Goldman's causal theory====
One such response is that of [[Alvin Goldman]] (1967), who suggested the addition of a ''causal'' condition: a subject's belief is justified, for Goldman, only if the truth of a belief has ''caused'' the subject to have that belief (in the appropriate way); and for a justified true belief to count as knowledge, the subject must ''also'' be able to "correctly reconstruct" (mentally) that causal chain. Goldman's analysis would rule out Gettier cases in that Smith's beliefs are not caused by the truths of those beliefs; it is merely ''accidental'' that Smith's beliefs in the Gettier cases happen to be true, or that the prediction made by Smith: " The winner of the job will have 10 coins", on the basis of his putative belief, (see also [[Bundle theory|bundling]]) came true in this one case. This theory is challenged by the difficulty of giving a principled explanation of how an appropriate causal relationship differs from an inappropriate one (without the circular response of saying that the appropriate sort of causal relationship is the knowledge-producing one); or retreating to a position in which justified true belief is weakly defined as the consensus of learned opinion. The latter would be useful, but not as useful nor desirable as the unchanging definitions of scientific concepts such as momentum. Thus, adopting a causal response to the Gettier problem usually requires one to adopt (as Goldman gladly does) some form of [[reliabilism]] about justification. See ''Goldman''s [[Theory of justification]].

====Lehrer–Paxson's defeasibility condition====
[[Keith Lehrer]] and [[Thomas Paxson]] (1969) proposed another response, by adding a ''[[defeasibility]] condition'' to the JTB analysis. On their account, knowledge is '''''undefeated''' justified true belief'' — which is to say that a justified true belief counts as knowledge if and only if it is also the case that there is no further truth that, had the subject known it, would have defeated her present justification for the belief. (Thus, for example, Smith's justification for [[Epistemic modality|believing]] that the person who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket is his justified belief that Jones will get the job, combined with his justified belief that Jones has ten coins in his pocket. But if Smith had known the truth that Jones will ''not'' get the job, that would have defeated the justification for his belief.) However, many critics (such as Marshall Swain [1974]) have argued that the notion of a ''defeater'' fact cannot be made precise enough to rule out the Gettier cases without also ruling out ''a priori'' cases of knowledge {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.

====Pragmatism====
[[Pragmatism]] was developed as a philosophical doctrine by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S.Peirce]] and [[William James]] (1842–1910). In Peirce's view, the truth is nominally defined as a sign's correspondence to its object and pragmatically defined as the ideal final opinion to which sufficient investigation ''would'' lead sooner or later. James' [[William James#Epistemology|epistemological]] model of truth was that which ''works'' in the way of belief, and a belief was true if in the long run it ''worked'' for all of us, and guided us expeditiously through our semihospitable world.
Peirce argued that [[metaphysics]] could be cleaned up by a pragmatic approach.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider what effects that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have.  Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 481 in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1905), "Issues of Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', vol. 15, pp. 481–499, ''Google Book Search Beta'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=501 Eprint], ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/details/monistquart15hegeuoft Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 5 paragraphs 438–463, see 438, and in ''Charles S. Peirce: Selected Writings'', pp. 203–226)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From a pragmatic viewpoint of the kind often ascribed to James, defining on a particular occasion whether a particular belief can rightly be said to be both true and justified is seen as no more than an exercise in [[pedant]]ry, but being able to [[Decision making|discern]] whether that belief led to fruitful outcomes is a fruitful [[action (philosophy)|enterprise]]. Peirce emphasized [[fallibilism]], considered the assertion of absolute certainty a barrier to inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1899), "F.R.L." &amp;#91;First Rule of Logic&amp;#93;, unpaginated manuscript, c. 1899, CP 1.135–140. [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106071421/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm |date=January 6, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1901 defined truth as follows: "Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 718–720 in J.M. Baldwin. ed., ''[[James Mark Baldwin#dpp|Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]]'', vol. 2. Reprinted, CP 5.565–573.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, any unqualified assertion is likely to be at least a little wrong or, if right, still right for not entirely the right reasons. Therefore one is more veracious by being Socratic, including a recognition of one's own ignorance and knowing one may be proved wrong. This is the case, even though in practical matters one sometimes must act, if one is to act at all, with decision and complete confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1898), "Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 1, paragraphs 616–48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., commentary), 105–22, reprinted in ''The Essential Peirce'', v. 2, 27–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisions of JTB approaches===
The difficulties involved in producing a viable fourth condition have led to claims that attempting to repair the JTB account is a deficient strategy. For example, one might argue that what the Gettier problem shows is not the need for a fourth independent condition in addition to the original three, but rather that the attempt to build up an account of knowledging by conjoining a set of independent conditions was misguided from the outset. Those who have adopted this approach generally argue that epistemological terms like [[Theory of justification|justification]], [[evidence]], [[certainty]], etc. should be analyzed in terms of a primitive notion of ''knowledge,'' rather than vice versa. Knowledge is understood as ''factive,'' that is, as embodying a sort of epistemological "tie" between a truth and a belief. The JTB account is then criticized for trying to get and encapsulate the factivity of knowledge "on the cheap," as it were, or via a circular argument, by replacing an irreducible notion of factivity with the conjunction of some of the properties that accompany it (in particular, truth and justification). Of course, the introduction of irreducible primitives into a philosophical theory is always problematical (some would say a sign of desperation), and such anti-reductionist accounts are unlikely to please those who have other reasons to hold fast to the method behind JTB+G accounts.

==== Fred Dretske's conclusive reasons and Robert Nozick's truth-tracking ====
[[Fred Dretske]] (1971) developed an account of knowledge which he called "conclusive reasons", revived by [[Robert Nozick]] as what he called the ''subjunctive'' or truth-tracking account (1981). Nozick's formulation posits that proposition P is an instance of knowledge when:

#p is true
#S believes that p
#if p were true, S would believe that p
#if p weren't true, S wouldn't believe that p

Nozick's definition is intended to preserve Goldman's intuition that Gettier cases should be ruled out by disacknowledging  "accidentally" true justified beliefs, but without risking the potentially onerous consequences of building a causal requirement into the analysis. This  tactic though, invites the riposte that Nozick's account merely hides the problem and does not solve it, for it leaves open the question of ''why'' Smith would not have had his belief if it had been false. The most promising answer seems to be that it is because Smith's belief was ''caused'' by the truth of what he believes; but that puts us back in the causalist camp.

Criticisms and counter examples (notably the ''Grandma case'') prompted a revision, which resulted in the alteration of (3) and (4) to limit themselves to the same method (i.e. vision):

#p is true
#S believes that p
#if p were true, S ''(using M)'' would believe that p
#if p weren't true, S ''(using method M)'' wouldn't believe that p

[[Saul Kripke]] has pointed out that this view remains problematic and uses a counterexample called the ''Fake Barn Country example'', which describes a certain locality containing a number of fake barns or facades of barns.  In the midst of these fake barns is one real barn, which is painted red.  There is one more piece of crucial information for this example: the fake barns cannot be painted red.

Jones is driving along the highway, looks up and happens to see the real barn, and so forms the belief

*I see a barn

Though Jones has gotten lucky, he could have just as easily been deceived and not have known it.  Therefore it doesn't fulfill premise 4, for if Jones saw a fake barn he wouldn't have any idea it was a fake barn.  So this is not knowledge.

An alternate example is if Jones looks up and forms the belief

*I see a red barn.

According to Nozick's view this fulfills all four premises.  Therefore this is knowledge, since Jones couldn't have been wrong, since the fake barns cannot be painted red.  This is a troubling account however, since it seems the first statement ''I see a barn'' can be inferred from ''I see a red barn''; however by Nozick's view the first belief is ''not'' knowledge and the second is knowledge.

===Robert Fogelin's perspectival account===
In the first chapter of his book ''Pyrronian Reflexions on Truth and Justification''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.example Oxford, Oxford University Press], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;,  [[Robert Fogelin]] gives a diagnosis that leads to a dialogical solution to Gettier's problem. The problem always arises when the given justification has nothing to do with what really makes the proposition true. Now, he notes that in such cases there is always a mismatch between the information disponible to the person who makes the knowledge-claim of some proposition p and the information disponible to the evaluator of this knowledge-claim (even if the evaluator is the same person in a later time). A Gettierian counterexample arises when the justification given by the person who makes the knowledge-claim cannot be accepted by the knowledge evaluator because it does not fit with his wider informational setting. For instance, in the case of the fake barn the evaluator knows that a superficial inspection from someone who does not know the peculiar circumstances involved isn't a justification aceptable as making the proposition p (that it is a real barn) true.&lt;ref&gt;For a precise formulation of Fogelin's view, see Claudio Costa [http://www.example ''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''], CSP, 2014, ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
====Richard Kirkham's skepticism====
[[Richard Kirkham]] has proposed that it is best to start with a definition of knowledge so strong that giving a counterexample to it is logically impossible. Whether it can be weakened without becoming subject to a counterexample should then be checked. He concludes that there will always be a counterexample to any definition of knowledge in which the believer's evidence does not logically necessitate the belief. Since in most cases the believer's evidence does not necessitate a belief, Kirkham embraces skepticism about knowledge. He notes that a belief can still be rational even if it is not an item of knowledge. (see also: [[fallibilism]])

===Attempts to dissolve the problem===

One might respond to Gettier by finding a way to avoid his conclusion(s) in the first place. However, it can hardly be argued that knowledge is justified true belief if there are cases that are justified true belief without being knowledge; thus, those who want to avoid Gettier's conclusions have to find some way to defuse Gettier's counterexamples. In order to do so, within the parameters of the particular counter-example or [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]], they must then either accept that

# Gettier's cases are not really cases of justified true belief, or
# Gettier's cases really are cases of knowledge after all,

or, demonstrate a case in which it is possible to circumvent surrender to the exemplar by eliminating any necessity for it to be considered that JTB apply in just those areas that Gettier has rendered obscure, without thereby lessening the force of JTB to apply in those cases where it actually is crucial.
Then, though Gettier's cases ''stipulate'' that Smith has a certain belief and that his belief is true, it seems that in order to propose (1), one must argue that Gettier, (or, that is, the writer responsible for the particular form of words on this present occasion known as case (1), and who makes assertion's about Smith's "putative" beliefs), goes wrong because he has the wrong notion of ''justification.'' Such an argument often depends on an [[externalism|externalist]] account on which "justification" is understood in such a way that whether or not a belief is "justified" depends not just on the internal state of the believer, but also on how that internal state is related to the outside world. Externalist accounts typically are constructed such that Smith's putative beliefs in Case I and Case II are not really justified (even though it seems to Smith that they are), because his beliefs are not lined up with the world in the right way, or that it is possible to show that it is invalid to assert that "Smith" has any significant "particular" belief at all, in terms of JTB or otherwise. Such accounts, of course, face the same burden as causalist responses to Gettier: they have to explain what sort of relationship between the world and the believer counts as a justificatory relationship.

Those who accept (2) are by far in the minority in analytic philosophy; generally those who are willing to accept it are those who have independent reasons to say that more things count as knowledge than the intuitions that led to the JTB account would acknowledge. Chief among these are [[epistemic minimalism|epistemic minimalists]] such as [[Crispin Sartwell]], who hold that all true belief, including both Gettier's cases and lucky guesses, counts as knowledge.

===Experimental research===

Some early work in the field of [[experimental philosophy]] suggested that traditional intuitions about Gettier cases might vary cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=Nichols|first2=Shaun|last3=Stich|first3=Stephen|title=Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions|journal=Philosophical Topics|date=Spring–Fall 2001|volume=29|issue=1–2|pages=429–460|doi=10.5840/philtopics2001291/217}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent studies have consistently failed to replicate these results, instead finding that participants from different cultures do share the traditional intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Minsun|last2=Yuan|first2=Yuan|title=No cross-cultural differences in the Gettier car case intuition: A replication study of Weinberg et al. 2001|journal=Episteme|date=2015|volume=12|issue=3|pages=355–361|doi=10.1017/epi.2015.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seyedsayamdost|first1=Hamid|title=On Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions: Failure of Replication|journal=Episteme|date=2014|volume=12|issue=1|pages=95–116|doi=10.1017/epi.2014.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nagel|first1=Jennifer|title=Intuitions and Experiments: A Defense of the Case Method in Epistemology|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=November 2012|volume=85|issue=3|pages=495–527|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2012.00634.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, more recent studies have actually been providing evidence for the opposite hypothesis, that people from a variety of different cultures have surprisingly similar intuitions in these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Machery|first1=Edouard|last2=Stich|first2=Stephen|last3=Rose|first3=David|last4=Chatterjee|first4=Amita|last5=Karasawa|first5=Kaori|last6=Struchiner|first6=Noel|last7=Sirker|first7=Smita|last8=Usui|first8=Naoki|last9=Hashimoto|first9=Takaaki|title=Gettier Across Cultures|journal=Noûs|date=August 2015|doi=10.1111/nous.12110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17865">The Growth and Underinvestment Archetype is one of the common [[system archetype]] patterns defined as part of the [[system dynamics]] discipline.

[[System dynamics]] is an approach which strives to understand, describe and optimize nonlinear behaviors of complex systems over time, using tools such as feedback loops in order to find a [http://www.donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/ leverage point] of the system. As part of this discipline, several commonly found patterns of system behavior were found, named and described in detail. The Growth and Underinvestment Archetype is one of such patterns.

[[File:Growth and underinvestment.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Growth and underinvestment"''']]

== Elements of Archetype ==

The system described in the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype consists of three feedback loops. Each feedback loop can be one of two types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Senge|first1=Peter M.|title=The fifth discipline the art and practice of the learning organization|date=2006|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-47764-4|pages=82–83|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reinforcing loop''' – A reinforcing loop is a type of a feedback loop, where a positive increase of variable A causes an '''increase''' in variable B, which then in turn causes a positive increase in variable A. The behavior of such system in time is an exponential increase in both variables A and B. As an example, consider the behavior of a long-term bank savings account. As your savings accumulate, the more interest per time period you receive, further increasing the balance on your savings account. This is the crowning principle of retirement planning schemes, such as the American [[401k]] pension system. In many cases however, there is a balancing loop to prevent the reinforcing behavior from occurring indefinitely.
* '''Balancing loop''' – A balancing loop is a type of a feedback loop, where a positive increase of variable A causes a '''decrease''' in variable B, which in turn causes a positive increase in variable A. The behavior of such a system leads to the system finding stable state over time. Consider the behavior of a thermostat. The thermostat is a very simple device in its core. If the measured temperature exceeds a certain preconfigured value, the heating is turned off. Otherwise the heating is turned on. The heating in turn influences the temperature, forcing the thermostat to reevaluate its behavior periodically. Since there is a delay in the system (it takes a while for the room to heat up after the heating has been turned on), the temperature in the room will oscillate around the preconfigured value. This happens because when the heating is turned on, it doesn’t have an immediate effect (the body emitting heat must warm up first), causing the temperature to fall below desired level. The same effect is in play when the temperature exceeds the desired value and the heating is turned off, since it takes a while for the heating body to cool down, causing further undesired temperature increases. This behavior could be potentially mitigated by setting two separate temperature thresholds, a lower one as a signal for the heating to activate and a higher one as a signal for the heating to deactivate.

=== Reinforcing loop ===

The reinforcing loop consists of a growing action, such as units of a specific product shipped to a customer, and a current state, such as current demand for a specific product. The growing action causes a positive increase in the current state. The increase of the current state then in turn causes a positive increase of the growing action, thereby creating the reinforcing characteristic of the loop.

As discussed above, this reinforcing loop would have exponential behavior in time, if its growth wouldn’t be bound by the combination of the two balancing loops present in the system.

=== First balancing loop ===

The first balancing loop is directly connected to the reinforcing loop via the current state variable. The first balancing loop consists of a current state and a slowing action (for example exceeding capacity limits). The growth of the current state causes the growth of the slowing action. The growth of the slowing action in turn reduces the current state, thereby creating a balancing loop.

One example of this balancing loop is a situation where a number of units manufactured is increasing (current state), which causes the manufacturing utilization to increase (end eventually exceed capacity). This will make each additional unit of manufacturing more expensive, reducing the growth in units manufacture. One can note that a rubber-banding effect occurs, since the more units are manufactured, the more expensive the manufacturing is. This loop taken in isolation would eventually find a stable state, independently of its beginning state.

=== Second balancing loop ===

The second balancing loop is what differentiates the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype from other archetypes. It is directly connected to the first balancing loop via the slowing action variable. The balancing loop consists of several elements:

* A slowing action
* A performance standard – represents a pressure on upholding a certain standard of the system's output (e.g. the manufactured product)
* A perceived need for investment – the first step toward an actual investment
* An investment
* A delay in investment – represents the time needed for the system to go from a perception of an investment need to actually making the investment. In the real world this element is often caused by hesitation of management to invest in additional capacity.

First, the growth of the slowing action causes growth of the perceived need for investment (e.g. building additional manufacturing capacity). Another factor that can positively contribute to the perceived need to invest is the failure to uphold the performance standard (for example manufacturing error rate). The perceived need to invest positively translates into actually making the investment. The investment made then negatively influences the slowing action (e.g. removal of capacity limits).

The last element of the second balancing loop is the delay in investment, which happens for a variety of reasons, for example hesitation of management to invest in additional capacity.

=== Behavior of Archetype ===
The key to understanding the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype is in the delay in investment. This delay causes the second balancing loop to have longer cycle times than the first balancing loop. That in turn has the following effect:

Since the second balancing loop has a shorter loop cycle, it causes the current state to be reduced, which in turn decreases the slowing action. This happens before an investment is made, in effect reducing the perceived need for investment.

In effect, the first and second reinforcing loop act together as a reinforcing loop to restrict growth.

If it were not for the delay, the whole system would work optimally thanks to timely investments.

==== Difficulties Identifying Archetype ====
At least two factors can contribute to the difficulty of identifying the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype in real-world complex systems.

First, the archetype can be temporarily covered up by [http://www.systems-thinking.org/theWay/ssb/sb.htm shifting the burden], that is, by trying to solve the underlying problem by a symptomatic solution, instead of a fundamental one. This leads to further delaying the investment decision, narrowing the window for effective and timely investment or missing it entirely.

Second, in order to recognize the archetype, a holistic view of the system is required. This can be difficult, since the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype can create many issues that management must attend to,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Senge|first1=Peter M.|title=The fifth discipline the art and practice of the learning organization|date=2006|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-47764-4|page=117|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in effect preventing them from stepping back and seeing the bigger picture.

=== Optimizing the System ===
When discussing how to optimize the system, it can be beneficial to discuss what a leverage point is.

The leverage point in the system is a place where structural changes can lead to significant and lasting improvements to the system. There are two kinds of leverage points:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leverage Point|url=http://thwink.org/sustain/glossary/LeveragePoint.htm|website=thwink.org|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Low leverage point''' – These points are usually the places in the system where the stress is greatest. However, solving problems at these points usually doesn’t lead to a lasting improvement
* '''High leverage point''' – These points are often hidden in the system, but even smaller changes in these components can lead to significant and lasting improvements in the system as a whole

When dealing with this archetype, several generic strategies can be considered in order to solve the problem the archetype presents.

==== Reduction of Investment Delay ====
The first strategy to consider is whether it is possible to shorten the delay between the perceived need to invest and actually making an investment.

One tool one can utilize in order to shorten the delay is [[Business Process Management]], a field of study focusing on improving the efficiency of business processes. With its help, we might be able to identify the excessive delays in the investment process and shorten the delays or eliminate the parts of process that cause it entirely.

==== Plan Ahead, Identify Growth Potential ====
When the reduction of investment delay is not possible, consider having a plan in advance. This includes monitoring the right [[key performance indicators]] (some KPIs such as [[utilization rate]] might act as an inhibitor for investment, since they frown upon unused capacity) and have an investment plan prepared in advance.

Such plan can also include a stop-gap solution that can temporarily weaken the growth inhibitor, such as hiring outside help in the form of contractors or lending additional capacity. But beware to not let the stop-gap solution become a permanent one, which could become a [[Shifting the Burden]] archetype.

== Example – Home Delivery Pizza ==
A new home delivery-focused pizzeria opens up in the neighborhood. At first, the demand is low, but the pizza’s quality is excellent, as well as the delivery times. After a while, the pizzeria gets noticed and is featured in a local online food blog. As a result, the demand for the pizza rises sharply. But the pizzeria owners are reluctant to purchase more delivery capacity (pizza delivery vehicles and personnel) along with higher pizza production capacity (additional pizza ovens). That results in higher delivery times and a larger percentage of undercooked pizzas, in turn lowering the number of returning customers. As a result, the pressure for additional investment in both delivery and production capacity is eliminated. The pizzeria owners are happy that they held off on the additional investment.

[[File:Home Delivery Pizza Company - Growth and Underinvestment Archetype.PNG|none|framed|Home Delivery Pizza Company - Growth and Underinvestment Archetype]]

Such an example clearly represents a missed opportunity for further growth. It could have been avoided in two ways:
* '''Reduction of the delay in investment.''' If the owners would react quicker, they could have seized the opportunity and convert more of the opportune customers into recurring ones, creating a sustained growth.
* '''Having a plan in advance.''' This might include having a trigger for when a certain amount of pizza is delivered, that will act as an indicator that an investment is needed. Such a trigger needs to be triggered with minimal delay based on the growth variable. Also having a simulation prepared might be helpful, in order to predict the demand in the future based on the current trend, which can be used as a tool to justify the investment, shortening the time needed to make an investment decision.

== Example – Startup Company ==
The application of the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype can be especially crucial for startup businesses, which need to grow fast or might have to face failure to raise additional funds. For them, the growing concern is a [[going concern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=David|first1=Schneider|title=Growth &amp; Underinvestment - System Archetype 10|url=http://wearethepractitioners.com/library/the-practitioner/2013/08/05/growth-underinvestment---system-archetype-10|website=We Are the Practitioners|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new startup company focused on developing mobile gaming experiences has recently released its first game after successfully completing the first round of raising capital from investors. The game is initially priced at $5.99 in the Store. After the initial release, the game starts gaining a little bit of traction, but not enough to be considered a success. The company operates as usual, adding more content into the game and fixing bugs. Also, the game has an online component that is sized well for the current audience.

After several weeks, the company comes to a major decision. It will re-release the game as free, instead focusing on selling additional content on the form in in-app purchases. The strategy works and many new users start playing the game. This has two effects:
* The online component of the game becomes overloaded. It becomes clear that an investment is needed to rearchitect the component in order to scale it up without friction 
* The company is making little money from in-app purchases, since it doesn’t have a lot of premium content built for the game yet

Shortly after the free version of the game comes out, the influx of players starts to affect the online component, which occasionally crashes and disconnects users, causing them to save progress they have made in the game. The company redeploys its resources and tries to mitigate the situation by incrementally improving the online component. It is clear, however, that a complete rewrite of the online component is needed on order to eliminate the problem entirely. Therefore the company contacts its investors in order to raise additional funds to rebuild the online component.

Meanwhile, the number of active players dwindles. In response to this fact, as well as the weak cash flow generated by the game, the investor decides to take time to make the investment decision. Unfortunately, the cash flow from the game is not improving, since the remaining user base purchased the content they were interested in and new content is delayed, since most of the developers have been reassigned to solving the online component woes. In response to this, the investor sees the ever-flattening sales and dwindling user base and decides not to invest further resources into the company. A few weeks later, the company runs out of funds and declares bankruptcy.

[[File:Mobile Gaming Startup - Growth and Underinvestment Archetype.PNG|none|framed|Mobile Gaming Startup - Growth and Underinvestment Archetype]]

How such a situation could be prevented:
* The company clearly didn’t calculate with growing quickly and haven’t prepared its infrastructure for it. If it set out to build an architecture that scales out well from the outset, it would diminish the power of the slowing action significantly.
* Instead of redeploying resources when the system was under stress, it might have introduced a stop-gap solution, such as restricting the number of players online in order to keep the standard for the users that got online. Meanwhile, it would produce new content to prove to its investors, that the in-app purchase model will work in the longer-term

== Modification with a Drifting Standard ==
[[File:Growth and Underinvestment Archetype with Drifting Standard.png|none|framed|A casual loop diagram describing the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype with Drifting Standard]]
The Growth and Underinvestment with a Drifting Standard is a special case of the archetype.

It adds an additional relationship between the slowing action and the performance standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherrer|first1=J. Alex|title=A Project Manager's Guide to Systems Thinking: Part II|url=http://www.projectsmart.co.uk/project-managers-guide-to-systems-thinking-part-2.php|website=Project Smart|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the slowing action is growing (e.g. the backlog of order is increasing in size), it has a negative effect on the performance standard (e.g. raising the maximum permitted time it takes to deliver an order). The rest of the system behaves in the same way as the original archetype.

This additional relationship can have severe consequences, since in some cases the performance standard can have major contribution to pressure exerted on individuals deciding whether to make the investment. With the slowing action actively undermining the performance standard, it can be harder to find the incentive to invest into additional resources.

== Related Archetypes ==
The Growth and Underinvestment Archetype can be considered to be an elaboration o the [http://www.systems-thinking.org/arch/arch.htm#archls Limits to Success archetype].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellinger|first1=Gene|author-link=Gene Bellinger|title=Archetypes|url=http://www.systems-thinking.org/arch/arch.htm#archgu|website=Systems Thinking|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adds another feedback loop which effectively elaborates the Limiting State part of the Limits to Success archetype.

In [[cultural anthropology]], the distinction between a '''guilt society''' (or '''guilt culture'''), '''shame society''' (also '''shame culture''' or '''honor-shame culture'''), and a '''fear society''' (or [[culture of fear]]) has been used to categorize different cultures.  The differences can apply to how behavior is governed with respect to government laws, business rules, or social etiquette. This classification has been applied especially to [[Apollonian and Dionysian#In_anthropology|apollonian]] societies, sorting them according to the emotions they use to control individuals (especially children) and maintaining [[social order]], swaying them into norm obedience and conformity.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Alan [https://books.google.com/books?id=gqyiX6bg0TYC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161 ''Jews, Myth and History: A Critical Exploration of Contemporary Jewish Belief ''] p.161&lt;/ref&gt; 

* In a [[guilt society]], control is maintained by creating and continually reinforcing the feeling of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] (and the expectation of [[punishment]] now or in the [[afterlife]]) for certain condemned behaviors. The guilt-innocence world view focuses on law and punishment.  A person in this type of culture may ask, "Is my behavior fair or unfair?"{{fact|date=June 2018}}  This type of culture also emphasizes individual [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="DeMente96p79"/&gt; 
* In a shame society, the means of control is the [[inculcation]] of [[shame]] and the complementary threat of [[social rejection|ostracism]]. The shame-honor worldview seeks an "honor balance" and can lead to [[revenge#Revenge dynamics|revenge dynamics]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}  A person in this type of culture may ask, "Shall I look ashamed if I do X?" or "How people will look at me if I do Y?"  Shame cultures are typically based on the concepts of [[pride]] and [[honour]],&lt;ref name="LloydJones1983p26"&gt;Lloyd-Jones, Hugh (1983) [https://books.google.com/books?id=68j3DZ-a04YC&amp;pg=PA26 ''The Justice of Zeus'']&lt;/ref&gt; and appearances are what counts.
* In a fear society, control is kept by the [[fear]] of retribution. The fear-power worldview focuses on physical dominance.  A person in this culture may ask, "Will someone hurt me if I do this?"{{fact|date=January 2018}}

The terminology were popularized by [[Ruth Benedict]] in ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'', who described [[American culture]] as a "guilt culture" and [[Japanese culture]] as a "shame culture".&lt;ref&gt;Ezra F. Vogel, Foreword, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (Boston: Houghton Mifflin 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ying and Wong. "Cultural Models of Shame and Guilt". ''Cultural Influences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the same person may emphasize different considerations depending on the situation, government and business projects that bring together people from different types of cultures may experience problems.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Guilt societies==

In a guilt society, the primary method of [[social control]] is the [[inculcation]] of feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for behaviors that the individual believes to be undesirable. A prominent feature of guilt societies is the provision of sanctioned releases from guilt for certain behaviors, whether before or after the fact.  There is opportunity in such cases for authority figures to derive power, monetary and/or other advantages, etc. by manipulating the conditions of guilt and the forgiveness of guilt.

[[Paul Hiebert (missiologist)|Paul Hiebert]] characterizes the guilt society as follows:

:Guilt is a feeling that arises when we violate the absolute standards of [[morality]] within us, when we violate our conscience. A person may suffer from guilt although no one else knows of his or her misdeed; this feeling of guilt is relieved by confessing the misdeed and making restitution. True guilt cultures rely on an internalized conviction of sin as the enforcer of good behavior, not, as shame cultures do, on external sanctions. Guilt cultures emphasize punishment and forgiveness as ways of restoring the moral order; shame cultures stress self-denial and humility as ways of restoring the social order. (Hiebert 1985, 213)

==Geographical distribution==
* Guilt-Innocence: more associated with Catholicism and Judaism{{fact|date=June 2018}}
* Shame-Honour: more associated with Islam, Protestantism, and Eastern religions{{fact|date=June 2018}}
* Fear-Power: more associated with animist and tribal societies{{fact|date=June 2018}}

===England===
[[Anglo-Saxon England]] is particularly notable as a shame culture, and this trait survived even after [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|its conversion to Christianity]], which is typically a guilt culture.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Bjork, John D. Niles (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SaFdpGdjvtoC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285 ''A Beowulf Handbook''] p.285 quotation: {{quotation|The introduction of a new state-sanctioned (or ruler-sanctioned) religion does not necessarily effect radical changes in a culture's basic structure of values. Not only ''Beowulf'' but the ''Maxims'' of the Exeter Book — "Dom bib selast" (Fame is best, 80) — and  ''The Battle of Maldon'' attest to the vitality of the shame culture and its values in Anglo-Saxon England long after the Conversion. The theme of "worship" (i.e., Anglo-Saxon weordscipe [honor]) running through Malory's stories suggests that the ethos of the shame culture survived both the Conversion and the Conquest.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of shame culture under Christianity are the cultures of [[Mexico]],&lt;ref name="DeMente96p79"&gt;De Mente, Boye Lafayette (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RL_UsrfTICoC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79 ''There's a Word for It in Mexico''] pp.79-80&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andalusia]]&lt;ref name="LloydJones1983p26"/&gt; and generally Christian [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean societies]].&lt;ref&gt;Satlow, Michael L. (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XJjXAAAAMAAJ ''Tasting the dish: rabbinic rhetorics of sexuality''] p.142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odd Magne Bakke (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=cI1btFqWegoC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305 ''"Concord and Peace"''] p.305&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In China, the concept of shame is widely accepted&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bedford|first1=Olwen|title=Source:2014 Journal Citation Reports® (Thomson Reuters, 2015) The Individual Experience of Guilt and Shame in Chinese Culture|journal=Culture &amp; Psychology|date=2004|volume=10|issue=1|pages=29–52|doi=10.1177/1354067X04040929}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings. In ''[[Analects]]'', [[Confucius]] is quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lead the people with administrative injunctions and put them in their place with penal law, and they will avoid punishments but will be without a sense of shame. Lead them with excellence and put them in their place through roles and ritual practices, and in addition to developing a sense of shame, they will order themselves harmoniously.&lt;ref&gt;Confucius, ''The Analects''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Japan ===
The society of traditional [[Japan]] was long held to be a good example of one in which shame is the primary agent of social control.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The first book to cogently explain the workings of the Japanese society for the Western reader was ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' by [[Ruth Benedict]]. This book was produced under less than ideal circumstances since it was written during the early years of [[World War II]] in an attempt to understand the people who had become such a powerful enemy of the West. Under the conditions of war, it was impossible to do [[field research]] in Japan.

Without being able to study in Japan, Benedict relied on newspaper clippings, histories, literature, films, and interviews of [[Japanese-American]]s. Her studies came to conclusions about Japanese culture and society that are still widely criticized today, both in America and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=Pauline|title=Japanese Perceptions of The Chrysanthemum and the Sword|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|date=June 1999|volume=24|issue=2|pages=181–192|doi=10.1023/a:1007082930663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romani ===
To the [[Romani people|Roma]], though living as local minorities in mostly [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Islam]]ic societies, the concept of ''lajav'' ("shame") is important, while the concept of ''bezax'' ("sin") does not have such significance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Grigore]], ''Rromanipen-ul (rromani dharma) şi mistica familiei'' "Rromanipen (Rromani Dharma) and the Family Mystics" (2001, Salvaţi copiii, Bucharest)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
HAKMEM is notable as an early compendium of [[algorithm]]ic technique, particularly for its practical bent, and as an illustration of the wide-ranging interests of AI Lab people of the time, which included almost anything other than AI research.

HAKMEM contains original work in some fields, notably [[continued fraction]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== Introduction ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Compiled with the hope that a record of the random things people do around here can save some duplication of effort -- except for fun.

:Here is some little known data which may be of interest to computer [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]]. The items and examples are so sketchy that to decipher them may require more sincerity and curiosity than a non-hacker can muster. Doubtless, little of this is new, but nowadays it's hard to tell. So we must be content to give you an insight, or save you some cycles, and to welcome further contributions of items, new or used.

The '''health management system''' (HMS) is an [[evolutionary medicine]] regulative process proposed by [[Nicholas Humphrey]]&lt;ref name="Great"&gt;{{cite book |author=Humphrey, Nicholas |chapter=19. Great Expectations: The Evolutionary Psychology of Faith-Healing and the Placebo Effect |chapterurl=http://www.humphrey.org.uk/papers/2002GreatExpectations.pdf |title=The Mind Made Flesh: Essays from the Frontiers of Psychology and Evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2002 |pages=255–85 |isbn=0-19-280227-5 }} reprinted from {{cite book |author=Hofsten, Claes von |title=Psychology at the Turn of the Millennium: Social, Developmental and Clinical Perspectives |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=2002 |pages=225–46 |isbn=1-84169-199-2 |volume=2}}

This incorporation of cost–benefit calculations into body regulation provides a science grounded approach to [[Mind-body connection|mind–body]] phenomena such as [[placebos]] that are otherwise not explainable by low level, noneconomic, and purely feedback based [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] or [[allostasis|allostatic]] theories.

* Many medical [[symptoms]] such as [[inflammation]], [[fever]], pain, [[sickness behavior]], or [[morning sickness]] have an [[evolutionary medicine]] function of enabling the body to protect, heal or restore itself from [[injury]], [[infection]] or other physiological disruption.
* The deployment of self-treatments have [[Deployment cost–benefit selection in physiology|costs]] as well as benefits with the result that evolution has selected management processes in the brain such that self-treatments are used only when they provide an overall [[cost–benefit]] advantage. The brain controls such physiological process through [[Neural top–down control of physiology|top–down regulation]].
* External treatment and the availability of support is factored into the health management system’s cost–benefit assessment as to whether to deploy or not an evolved self-treatment.

[[Placebos]] are explained as the result of false information about the availability of external treatment and support that mislead the health management system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=Selvanski Monsu |title=Healthcare Management Systems |date=December 2012 |url=http://www.nintec.com/healthcare}}&lt;/ref&gt; into not deploying evolved self-treatments. This results in the placebo suppression of medical symptoms.

==Evolutionary medicine==

Since [[Hippocrates]], it has been recognized that the body has self-healing powers ([[vis medicatrix naturae]]). Modern [[evolutionary medicine]] identifies them with physiologically based self-treatments that provide the body with [[prophylactic]], healing, or restorative capabilities against injuries, infections and physiological disruption.  Examples include:

* [[Immunity (medical)|Immune responses]]
* [[Fever]]
* [[Sickness behavior]]
* [[Nausea]]
* [[Morning sickness]]
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|Hypoferremia]]
* [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]]
* [[pain#Evolutionary and behavioral role|Pain]]

These evolved self-treatments deployed by the body are experienced by humans as unpleasant and unwanted illness [[symptoms]].

==Deployment==

Such self-treatments according to evolutionary medicine are deployed to increase an individual’s  [[biological fitness]].

Two factors affect their deployment.

First, it is usually advantageous to deploy them on a [[precautionary principle|precautionary basis]].&lt;ref  name="Nesse"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03472.x |author=Nesse RM |authorlink=Randolph M. Nesse |title=The smoke detector principle. Natural selection and the regulation of defensive responses |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=935 |issue= |pages=75–85 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11411177 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0077-8923&amp;date=2001&amp;volume=935&amp;spage=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, it will often turn out that they have been deployed apparently unnecessarily, though this has in fact been advantageous since in probabilistic terms they have provided an insurance against a potentially costly outcome. As Nesse notes: "Vomiting, for example, may cost only a few hundred calories and a few minutes, whereas not vomiting may result in a 5% chance of death" page 77.&lt;ref  name="Nesse"/&gt;

Second, self-treatments are costly both in using energy, and also in their risk of damaging the body.

* Immunity – energy for activating lymphocyte and antibody production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lochmiller R, Deerenberg C |title=Trade-offs in evolutionary immunology: just what is the cost of immunity? |journal=Oikos |volume=88 |issue= |pages=87–98 |year=2000 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880110.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Romanyukha06&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Romanyukha AA, Rudnev SG, Sidorov IA |title=Energy cost of infection burden: an approach to understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions |journal=J.

Biol. |volume=241 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16378624 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.11.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5193(05)00479-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the risk of an immune response resulting in an [[immune disorders|immune related disorder]].
* Fever – energy (each 1&amp;nbsp;°C raise in blood temperature increases energy expenditure by  10–15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodriguez DJ, Sandoval W, Clevenger FW |title=Is measured energy expenditure correlated to injury severity score in major trauma patients? |journal=J.

Surg. |volume=161 |issue= 1|pages=140–7 |date=January 1965 |pmid=14252624 |pmc=1408758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 90% of the total cost of fighting [[pneumonia]] goes on increased body temperature.&lt;ref name=Romanyukha06/&gt; There is also the risk of [[hyperpyrexia]].
* Sickness behavior – restricted ability by an animal to forage and defend itself
* Nausea – loss of food nutrients, and potential risk of [[Vomiting#Complications|aspiration]]
* Morning sickness – loss of food nutrients when a mother needs additional, not less, nourishment
* Hypoferremia – impairment in biological processes needing iron resulting in [[iron deficiency anemia]]
* Depression – [[Evolutionary approaches to depression|impaired activity and problem solving]].
* Pain – restricted movement and the [[Chronic pain#Related sequelae|inability to concentrate]]

One factor in deployment is low level physiological control by [[proinflammatory cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]] triggered by bacterial [[lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS).

Another is [[Neural top down control of physiology|higher level control]] in which the brain takes into account what it learns about circumstances and how that makes it well and ill. [[Classical conditioning|Conditioning]] shows the existence of such learnt control: give saccharin paired in a drink with a drug that creates [[immunosuppression]], and later on, giving saccharin alone will produce immunosuppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ader R, Cohen N |title=Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=333–40 |year=1975 |pmid=1162023 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1162023 |doi=10.1097/00006842-197507000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nlme.1995.1048 |vauthors=Alvarez-Borda B, Ramírez-Amaya V, Pérez-Montfort R, Bermúdez-Rattoni F |title=Enhancement of antibody production by a learning paradigm |journal=Neurobiol Learn Mem |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=103–5 |date=September 1995 |pmid=7582817 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1074742785710489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00031-4 |vauthors=Oberbeck R, Kromm A, Exton MS, Schade U, Schedlowski M |title=Pavlovian conditioning of endotoxin-tolerance in rats |journal=Brain Behav.

==Cost benefit analysis==

=== Economic resource management===
Evolution, according to [[Nicholas Humphrey]], has selected an internal health management system that uses [[cost benefit analysis]] upon whether the deployment of a self-treatment aids [[biological fitness]], and so should be activated. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;a specially designed procedure for “economic resource management” that is, I believe, one of the key features of the “natural health-care service” which has evolved in ourselves and other animals to help us deal throughout our lives with repeated bouts of sickness, injury, and other threats to our well-being.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An analogy is explicitly made with the [[health economics]] consideration used in management decisions involving external medical treatment.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, if you wonder about this choice of managerial terminology for talking about biological healing systems, I should say that it is quite deliberate (and so is the pun on NHS.) With the phrase “natural health-care service” I do intend to evoke, at a biological level, all the economic connotations that are so much a part of modern health-care in society.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===External medications===
External medications will affect the cost benefits advantages of deploying an evolved self-treatment. Some animals use [[Zoopharmacognosy|external ones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engel, Cindy |title=Wild Health : Lessons in Natural Wellness from the Animal Kingdom |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-618-34068-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wildlife|Wild animals]], including [[apes]],  do so in the form of ingested [[geophagy|detoxifying clays]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klein N, Fröhlich F, Krief S |title=Geophagy: soil consumption enhances the bioactivities of plants eaten by chimpanzees |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=325–31 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18188538 |doi=10.1007/s00114-007-0333-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; rough leaves that clear gut parasites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fowler A, Koutsioni Y, Sommer V |title=Leaf-swallowing in Nigerian chimpanzees: evidence for assumed self-medication |journal=Primates |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=73–6 |date=January 2007 |pmid=16897194 |doi=10.1007/s10329-006-0001-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pharmacologically active plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1079/PNS2003257 |author=Huffman MA |title=Animal self-medication and ethno-medicine: exploration and exploitation of the medicinal properties of plants |journal=Proc Nutr Soc |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=371–81 |date=May 2003 |pmid=14506884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90368-9 |vauthors=Koshimizu K, Ohigashi H, Huffman MA |title=Use of Vernonia amygdalina by wild chimpanzee: possible roles of its bitter and related constituents |journal=Physiol. Behav. |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=1209–16 |date=December 1994 |pmid=7878093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary to this, research finds that animals have the ability to select and prefer substances that aid their recuperation from illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.173.3998.749 |vauthors=Green KF, Garcia J |title=Recuperation from illness: flavor enhancement for rats |journal=Science |volume=173 |issue=3998 |pages=749–51 |date=August 1971 |pmid=5568508 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5568508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social support===
The welfare of social animals (including humans) depends upon other individuals ([[Tend and befriend|social buffering]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kikusui T, Winslow JT, Mori Y |title=Social buffering: relief from stress and anxiety |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. |volume=361 |issue=1476 |pages=2215–28 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17118934 |pmc=1764848 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1941 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17118934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actuarial assessments of the costs and benefits of deploying a self-treatment therefore will depend upon the presence, or not, of  other individuals. The presence of helpful others will affect, for example, the risk of predators when incapacitated, and—in those case in which animals do this (such as humans)—the provision of food, and care during sickness.

The health management system factors in the presence of such external treatment and social support as one aspect of the circumstances needed to determine whether it is advantageous to deploy or not an evolved self-treatment.

==Placebos==

===False information===
All humans societies use external medications, and some individuals exist that are considered to have special [[healers|healing]] knowledge about illnesses and their treatments. Humans are also usually supportive to those in their group. The availability of these things will affect the cost benefits of the body deploying its own biological ones. This could, in turn, lead to the health management system (given its beliefs (information) about treatments and support) to deploy or not, or doing so differently, the body’s own treatments.

Nicholas Humphrey describes how the health management system explains placebos – an external treatment without direct physiological effects – as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose, for example, a doctor gives someone who is suffering an infection a pill that she rightly believes to contain an antibiotic: because her hopes will be raised she will no doubt make appropriate adjustments to her health-management strategy – lowering her precautionary defences in anticipation of the sickness not lasting long.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The health management system, in other words, when faced with an infection is tricked into making a mistaken cost benefit analysis using false information. The effect of that false information is that the benefits of the self-treatment cease to outweigh its costs. As a result, it is not deployed, and an individual does not experience unwanted medical symptoms.

===Lack of harm===
Failure to deploy an evolved self-treatment need not put an individual at risk since evolution has advantaged their deployment on a precautionary basis.&lt;ref  name="Nesse"/&gt; As Nicholas Humphrey notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; many of the health-care measures we’ve been discussing are precautionary measures designed to protect from dangers that lie ahead in an uncertain future. Pain is a way of making sure you give your body rest just in case you need it. Rationing the use of the immune system is a way of making sure you have the resources to cope with renewed attacks just in case they happen. Your healing systems are basically tending to be cautious, and sometimes over-cautious, as if working on the principle of better safe than sorry.&lt;ref name="Great"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, not deploying an evolved self-treatment, and so not having a medical symptom due to placebo false information might be without consequence.

==Central governor==

The health management system’s idea of a top down neural control of the body is also found in the idea that a [[central governor]] regulates [[muscle weakness|muscle fatigue]] to protect the body from the harmful effects (such as [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] and [[hyperglycemia]]) of over prolonged exercise.

The idea of a fatigue governor was first proposed in 1924 by the 1922 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Archibald Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill AV, Long CN, Lupton H |title=Muscular exercise, lactic acid and the supply and utilisation of oxygen. Parts I–III |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. |volume=97 |pages=438–75 |year=1924 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/k51611345m783727/fulltext.pdf }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, on the basis of modern research, by  [[Tim Noakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00007256-200333030-00001  |vauthors=St Clair Gibson A, Baden DA, Lambert MI, etal |title=The conscious perception of the sensation of fatigue |journal=Sports Med |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=167–76 |year=2003 |pmid=12656638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Noakes TD, St Clair Gibson A, Lambert EV |title=From catastrophe to complexity: a novel model of integrative central neural regulation of effort and fatigue during exercise in humans: summary and conclusions |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=120–4 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15665213 |pmc=1725112 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2003.010330 |url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15665213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Noakes TD, Peltonen JE, Rusko HK |title=Evidence that a central governor regulates exercise performance during acute hypoxia and hyperoxia |journal=J.

Biol. |volume=204 |issue=Pt 18 |pages=3225–34 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11581338 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/204/18/3225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0838.2000.010003123.x |author=Noakes TD |title=Physiological models to understand exercise fatigue and the adaptations that predict or enhance athletic performance |journal=Scand J Med Sci Sports |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=123–45 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10843507 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0905-7188&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00007256-200131090-00001 |vauthors=St Clair Gibson A, Lambert ML, Noakes TD |title=Neural control of force output during maximal and submaximal exercise |journal=Sports Med |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=637–50 |year=2001 |pmid=11508520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like with the health management system, the central governor shares the idea that much of what is attributed to low level feedback homeostatic regulation is, in fact, due to [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down]] control by the brain.  The advantage of this top down management is that the brain can enhance such regulation by allowing it to be modified by information. For example, in endurance running, a [[Cost-benefit analysis|cost benefit]] trade exists off between the advantages of continuing to run, and the risk if this is too prolonged that it might harm the body. Being able to regulate fatigue in terms of information about the benefits and costs of continued exercise would enhance biological fitness.

Low level theories exist that suggest that fatigue is due  mechanical failure of the exercising muscles ("peripheral fatigue").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards RHT |chapter=Biochemical bases for fatigue in exercise performance: catastrophe theory in muscular fatigue |veditors=Knuttgen HG, Vogel JA, Poortmans J |title=Biochemistry of exercise |publisher=Human Kinetics |location=Champaign, IL |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-608-07112-1 |pages=1–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such low level theories do not explain why running muscle fatigue is affected by information relevant to cost benefit trade offs. For example, [[marathon]] runners can carry on running longer if told they are near the finishing line, than far away. The existence of a central governor can explain this effect.

In [[mathematics]], '''hyperbolic space''' is a [[homogeneous space]] that has a [[constant function|constant]] negative [[Constant curvature|curvature]], where in this case the curvature is the sectional curvature.
It is [[hyperbolic geometry]] in more than 2 [[dimension (mathematics)|dimensions]], and is distinguished from [[Euclidean space]]s with [[zero]] curvature that define the [[Euclidean geometry]], and [[elliptic geometry]] that have a constant positive curvature.

When embedded to a Euclidean space (of a higher dimension), every point of a hyperbolic space is a [[saddle point]]. Another distinctive property is the [[Riemannian volume form|amount of space]] covered by the [[n-ball|''n''-ball]] in hyperbolic ''n''-space: it increases [[exponential growth|exponentially]] with respect to the radius of the ball for large radii, rather than polynomially.

==Formal definition==
'''Hyperbolic ''n''-space''', denoted '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, is the maximally symmetric, [[simply connected]], ''n''-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] with a constant negative [[sectional curvature]]. 
Hyperbolic space is a space exhibiting [[hyperbolic geometry]]. 
It is the negative-curvature analogue of the ''n''-[[sphere]].  Although hyperbolic space '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[diffeomorphic]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, its negative-curvature metric gives it very different geometric properties.

Hyperbolic 2-space, '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is also called the [[hyperbolic plane]].

==Models of hyperbolic space==
Hyperbolic space, developed independently by [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] and [[János Bolyai]], is a geometrical space analogous to [[Euclidean space]], but such that [[parallel postulate|Euclid's parallel postulate]] is no longer assumed to hold.  Instead, the parallel postulate is replaced by the following alternative (in two dimensions):
* Given any line ''L'' and point ''P'' not on ''L'', there are at least two distinct lines passing through ''P'' which do not intersect ''L''.
It is then a theorem that there are infinitely many such lines through ''P''. This axiom still does not uniquely characterize the hyperbolic plane up to [[isometry]]; there is an extra constant, the curvature {{nowrap|''K'' &lt; 0}},  which must be specified. However, it does uniquely characterize it up to [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]], meaning up to bijections which only change the notion of distance by an overall constant. By choosing an appropriate length scale, one can thus assume, without loss of generality, that {{nowrap|1=''K'' = −1}}.

Models of hyperbolic spaces that can be embedded in a flat (e.g. Euclidean) spaces may be constructed.  In particular, the existence of model spaces implies that the parallel postulate is [[logically independent]] of the other axioms of Euclidean geometry.

There are several important models of hyperbolic space: the '''Klein model''', the '''hyperboloid model''', the '''Poincaré ball model''' and the '''Poincaré half space model'''.  These all model the same geometry in the sense that any two of them can be related by a transformation that preserves all the geometrical properties of the space, including [[isometry]] (though not with respect to the metric of a Euclidean embedding).

===The hyperboloid model===
{{main|Hyperboloid model}}
The hyperboloid model realizes hyperbolic space as a hyperboloid in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;∈'''R''',&amp;nbsp;''i''=0,1,...,''n''}.  The hyperboloid is the locus '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of points whose coordinates satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;x_0^2-x_1^2-\cdots-x_n^2=1,\quad x_0&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;
In this model a ''line'' (or [[geodesic]]) is the curve formed by the intersection of '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with a plane through the origin in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The hyperboloid model is closely related to the geometry of [[Minkowski space]].  The [[quadratic form]]
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = x_0^2 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 - \cdots - x_n^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
which defines the hyperboloid, [[polarization identity|polarizes]] to give the [[bilinear form]]
:&lt;math&gt;B(x,y) = (Q(x+y)-Q(x)-Q(y))/2=x_0y_0 - x_1y_1 - \cdots - x_n y_n .&lt;/math&gt;
The space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, equipped with the bilinear form ''B'', is an (''n''+1)-dimensional Minkowski space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sup&gt;.

One can associate a ''distance'' on the hyperboloid model by defining&lt;ref&gt;Note the similarity with the [[Elliptic geometry|chordal metric]] on a sphere, which uses trigonometric instead of hyperbolic functions.&lt;/ref&gt; the distance between two points ''x'' and ''y'' on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to be
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \operatorname{arcosh} B(x,y) .&lt;/math&gt;
This function satisfies the axioms of a [[metric space]].  It is preserved by the action of the [[Lorentz group]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Hence the Lorentz group acts as a [[transformation group]] preserving [[isometry]] on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===The Klein model===
{{main|Klein model}}
An alternative model of hyperbolic geometry is on a certain [[open set|domain]] in [[projective space]].  The Minkowski quadratic form ''Q'' defines a subset {{nowrap|''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊂ '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} given as the locus of points for which {{nowrap|''Q''(''x'') &gt; 0}} in the [[homogeneous coordinates]] ''x''.  The domain ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the '''Klein model''' of hyperbolic space.

The lines of this model are the open line segments of the ambient projective space which lie in ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The distance between two points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \operatorname{arcosh}\left(\frac{B(x,y)}{\sqrt{Q(x)Q(y)}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This is well-defined on projective space, since the ratio under the inverse hyperbolic cosine is homogeneous of degree 0.

This model is related to the hyperboloid model as follows.  Each point {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} corresponds to a line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; through the origin in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, by the definition of projective space.  This line intersects the hyperboloid '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; in a unique point.  Conversely, through any point on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, there passes a unique line through the origin (which is a point in the projective space).   This correspondence defines a [[bijection]] between ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is an isometry, since evaluating {{nowrap|''d''(''x'',''y'')}} along {{nowrap|1=''Q''(''x'') = ''Q''(''y'') = 1}} reproduces the definition of the distance given for the hyperboloid model.

===The Poincaré ball model ===
{{main|Poincaré disc model}}

A closely related pair of models of hyperbolic geometry are the Poincaré ball and Poincaré half-space models.

The ball model comes from a [[stereographic projection]] of the hyperboloid in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; onto the hyperplane {''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}. In detail, let ''S'' be the point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sup&gt;  with coordinates (−1,0,0,...,0): the ''South pole'' for the stereographic projection.   For each point ''P'' on the hyperboloid '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, let ''P''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; be the unique point of intersection of the line ''SP'' with the plane {''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}.

This establishes a bijective mapping of '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; into the unit ball
:&lt;math&gt; B^n = \{(x_1,\ldots,x_n) | x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2 &lt; 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
in the plane {''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}.

The geodesics in this model are [[semicircle]]s that are perpendicular to the boundary sphere of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Isometries of the ball are generated by [[inversive geometry|spherical inversion]] in hyperspheres perpendicular to the boundary.

===The Poincaré half-space model ===
{{main|Poincaré half-plane model}}

The half-space model results from applying [[inversion in a circle]] with centre a boundary point of the Poincaré ball model ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; above and a radius of twice the radius.

This sends circles to circles and lines, and is moreover a [[conformal transformation]].  Consequently, the geodesics of the half-space model are lines and circles perpendicular to the boundary hyperplane.

==Hyperbolic manifolds==

Every [[complete space|complete]], [[connected space|connected]], [[simply connected]] manifold of constant negative curvature &amp;minus;1 is [[Isometry|isometric]] to the real hyperbolic space '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, the [[universal cover]] of any [[closed manifold]] ''M'' of constant negative curvature &amp;minus;1, which is to say, a [[hyperbolic manifold]], is  '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, every such ''M'' can be written as '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/Γ where Γ is a [[torsion (algebra)|torsion-free]] [[discrete group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  That is, Γ is a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in [[Indefinite orthogonal group|SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'',1)]].

=== Riemann surfaces ===
Two-dimensional hyperbolic surfaces can also be understood according to the language of [[Riemann surface]]s. According to the [[uniformization theorem]], every Riemann surface is either elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic. Most hyperbolic surfaces have a non-trivial [[fundamental group]] π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=Γ; the groups that arise this way are known as [[Fuchsian group]]s. The [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] '''H'''²/Γ of the upper half-plane [[Ideal (ring theory)|modulo]] the fundamental group is known as the [[Fuchsian model]] of the hyperbolic surface. The [[Poincaré half plane]] is also hyperbolic, but is [[simply connected]] and [[noncompact]]. It is the [[universal cover]] of the other hyperbolic surfaces.

The analogous construction for three-dimensional hyperbolic surfaces is the [[Kleinian model]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12858">'''Latent inhibition'''  is a technical term used in [[classical conditioning]] to refer to the observation that a familiar [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] takes longer to acquire meaning (as a signal or conditioned stimulus) than a new stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Bouton, M. E. (2007) ''Learning and Behavior'' Sunderland, MA: Sinauer&lt;/ref&gt; The term "latent inhibition" dates back to Lubow and Moore.&lt;ref&gt;Lubow, R. E. (1973). Latent inhibition. Psychological bulletin, 79(6), 398.&lt;/ref&gt; The LI effect is "latent" in that it is not exhibited in the stimulus pre-exposure phase, but rather in the subsequent test phase. "Inhibition", here, simply connotes that the effect is expressed in terms of relatively poor learning. The LI effect is extremely robust, appearing in all mammalian species that have been tested and across many different learning paradigms, thereby suggesting some adaptive advantages, such as protecting the organism from associating irrelevant stimuli with other, more important, events. 

==Theories==
The LI effect has received a number of theoretical interpretations. One class of theory holds that inconsequential stimulus pre-exposure results in reduced associability for that stimulus. The loss of associability has been attributed to a variety of mechanisms that reduce attention, which then must be reacquired in order for learning to proceed normally.&lt;ref&gt;see Lubow &amp; Weiner, 2010, for reviews&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been proposed that LI is a result of retrieval failure rather than acquisition failure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lowlatentinhibition.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Such a position advocates that, following stimulus pre-exposure, the acquisition of the new association to the old stimulus proceeds normally.   However, in the test stage, two associations (the stimulus-no consequence association from the pre-exposure stage and the stimulus-consequence stimulus association of the acquisition stage) are retrieved and compete for expression. The group not pre-exposed to the stimulus performs better than the pre-exposed group because for the first group there is only the second association to be retrieved.

==Variation==
LI is affected by many factors, one of the most important of which is context. In virtually all LI studies, the context remains the same in the stimulus pre-exposure and test phases. However, if context is changed from the pre-exposure to the test phase, then LI is severely attenuated. The context-dependency of LI  plays major roles in all current theories of LI, and in particular to their applications to schizophrenia,&lt;ref&gt;for reviews, see Lubow &amp; Weiner, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; where it has been proposed that relationship between the pre-exposed stimulus and the context breaks down; context no longer sets the occasion for the expression of the stimulus-no consequence association. Consequently, working-memory is inundated with experimentally familiar but phenomenally novel stimuli, each competing for the limited resources required for efficient information processing. This description fits well with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly high distractibility, as well as with research findings.

==Physiology==
The assumption that the attentional process that produces LI in normal subjects is dysfunctional in schizophrenia patients has stimulated considerable research, with humans, as well as with rats and mice. There is much data that indicate that dopamine agonists and antagonists modulate LI in rats and in normal humans. Dopamine agonists, such as amphetamine, abolish LI while dopamine antagonists, such as haloperidol and other anti-psychotic drugs, produce a super-LI effect.&lt;ref&gt;for review, Weiner &amp; Arad, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, manipulations of putative dopamine pathways in the brain also have the expected effects on LI. Thus, hippocampal and septal lesions interfere with the development of LI, as do lesions in selective portions of the nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref&gt;for review, Weiner, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; With human subjects, there is evidence that acute, non-medicated schizophrenics show reduced LI compared to chronic, medicated schizophrenics and to  healthy subjects, while there is no difference in the amount of LI in the latter two groups. Finally, symptomatically normal subjects who score high on self-report questionnaires that measure psychotic-proneness or schizotypality also exhibit reduced LI compared to those who score low on the scales.&lt;ref&gt;For reviews, Kumari &amp; Ettinger, 2010; Lubow, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to LI illustrating a fundamental strategy for information processing and providing a useful tool for examining attentional dysfunctions in pathological groups,  the LI procedure has been used to screen for drugs that can ameliorate schizophrenia symptoms LI.  LI has also been used to explain why certain therapies, such as alcohol aversion treatments, are not as effective as might be expected. On the other hand, LI procedures may be useful in counteracting some of the undesirable side-effects that frequently accompany radiation and chemo-therapies for cancer, as for example food aversion. LI research also has suggested techniques that may be efficacious in the prophylactic treatment of certain fears and phobias. Of popular interest, several studies have attempted to relate LI to creativity.&lt;ref&gt;for review, Carson, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the basic LI phenomenon represents some output of a selective attention process that results in learning to ignore irrelevant stimuli. It has become an important tool for understanding information processing in general, as well as attentional dysfunctions in schizophrenia, and it has implications for a variety of practical problems.

==Pathology==

===Low latent inhibition===
Most people are able to ignore the constant stream of incoming stimuli, but this capability is reduced in those with low latent inhibition. Low latent inhibition (that may resemble hyper-activity or [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) in early decades of the individual life) seems to often correlate with distracted behaviors.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/09/are-distractible-people-more-creative/ | work=Wired | first=Jonah | last=Lehrer | title=Are Distractible People More Creative? | date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This distractedness can manifest itself as general inattentiveness, a tendency to switch subjects without warning in conversation, and other absentminded habits.  This is not to say that all distractedness can be explained by low latent inhibition, nor does it necessarily follow that people with low LI will have a hard time paying attention.  It does mean, however, that the higher quantity of incoming information requires a mind capable of handling it. 
Those of above average intelligence are thought to be capable of processing this stream effectively, enabling their [[creativity]] and increasing their [[awareness]] of their surroundings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Those with average and, less than average intelligence, on the other hand, are less able to cope and as a result are more likely to suffer from mental illness and sensory overload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lubow | first1 = RE | last2 = Gewirtz | first2 = JC | title = Latent inhibition in humans: data, theory, and implications for schizophrenia | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 87–103 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7870865  |name-list-format=vanc | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hypothesized that a low level of latent inhibition can cause either [[psychosis]] or a high level of [[creativity|creative achievement]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/carson-peterson-higgins.pdf Decreased Latent Inhibition Is Associated With Increased Creative Achievement in High-Functioning Individuals];[https://web.archive.org/web/20071129121745/http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/carson-peterson-higgins.pdf Archive link]&lt;/ref&gt; or both, which is usually dependent on the individual's [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name="UofT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talentdevelop.com/articles/CPMOTSFE.html |title=Creative people more open to stimuli from environment |publisher=Talentdevelop.com |accessdate=2013-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601115849/http://talentdevelop.com/articles/CPMOTSFE.html |archive-date=2012-06-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When they cannot develop the creative ideas, they become frustrated and/or depressive.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

High levels of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]] (or its [[agonist]]s) in the [[ventral tegmental area]] of the [[brain]] have been shown to decrease latent inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swerdlow | first1 = NR | last2 = Stephany | first2 = N | last3 = Wasserman | first3 = LC | last4 = Talledo | first4 = J | last5 = Sharp | first5 = R | last6 = Auerbach | first6 = PP | title = Dopamine agonists disrupt visual latent inhibition in normal males using a within-subject paradigm | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 169 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 314–20 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12610717  |name-list-format=vanc | doi = 10.1007/s00213-002-1325-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain dysfunctions of the [[neurotransmitters]] [[glutamate]], [[serotonin]] and [[acetylcholine]] have also been implicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2004.06.011 | last1=Bills | first1=C | year=2005 | pages=71–8 | volume=157 | last2=Schachtman | journal=Behavioural Brain Research | first2=T | last3=Serfozo | first3=P | last4=Spooren | first4=W | last5=Gasparini | first5=F | last6=Simonyi | first6=A |title=Effects of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 on latent inhibition in conditioned taste aversion  |name-list-format=vanc | pmid = 15617773 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low latent inhibition is not a [[mental disorder]] but an observed [[personality trait]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, and a description of how an individual absorbs and assimilates data or stimuli. Furthermore, it does not necessarily lead to mental disorder or creative achievement—this is, like many other factors of life, a case of environmental and [[Genetic predisposition|predispositional]] influences, whether these be positive (e.g., [[education]]) or negative (e.g., abuse) in nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4694">'''Lawlessness''' is a lack of [[law]], in any of the various senses of that word. Lawlessness may describe various conditions.
{{TOC right}}

==In society==
'''[[Anomie]]''' is a breakdown of social bonds between an individual and their community, in which individuals do not feel bound by the moral strictures of society. The term was popularized by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] in his influential 1897 book ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mestrovic |first=Stjepan |title=Emile Durkheim and The Reformation of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anarchy]]''' (meaning "without leadership") is a condition in which a person or group of people reject societal hierarchies, laws, and other institutions. It often entails the dissolution of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1551642484 |title=Decentralism: Where It Came From-Where Is It Going? |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anarchism]]''' is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies." George Woodcock. "Anarchism" at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. "Anarchism" from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Anarchism." The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 "Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state." Judith Suissa. ''Anarchism and Education: a Philosophical Perspective''. Routledge. New York. 2006. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organisation and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist." [[Peter Kropotkin]]. [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Anarchism__its_philosophy_and_ideal.html Anarchism: its philosophy and ideal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority, in other words, hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalisation of authority within a society." [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__An_Anarchist_FAQ__03_17_.html#toc2 "B.1 Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?"] in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Civil disorder]]''', or civil unrest, refers to public disturbances generally involving groups of people, and resulting in danger or damage to persons or property.&lt;ref&gt;Schurink, W.J. (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KMlv2eJozAUC&amp;pg=PA416 ''Victimization: Nature and Trends.''] Human Sciences Research Council. {{ISBN|0796912580}}. p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil disorder is a breakdown of civil society, and may be a form of protest. It may take various forms, such as illegal parades, sit-ins, riots, sabotage, and other forms of crime.

==In nature==
'''[[Randomness]]''' is the lack of [[pattern]] or [[predictability]] in events.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines "random" as "Having no definite aim or purpose; not sent or guided in a particular direction; made, done, occurring, etc., without method or conscious choice; haphazard."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
'''[[Antinomianism]]''', in [[Christianity]], is a theological position which takes the principle of [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] by [[Faith#Christianity|faith]] and [[divine grace]] to the point of asserting that the saved are not bound to follow the [[Law of Moses]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28267/antinomianism Encyclopædia Britannica: Antinomianism]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lemuria''' {{IPAc-en|l|ᵻ|ˈ|m|juː|r|i|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;OED&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Limuria''' is a hypothetical "[[Lost lands|lost land]]" located either in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] or the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Ocean, as postulated by a now-discredited [[19th century in science|19th-century]] [[scientific theory]]. The idea was then adopted by the [[occultists]] of the time and consequently has been [[Lemuria in popular culture|incorporated into pop culture]].

==Evolution of the idea==
Originally, Lemuria was hypothesized as a [[land bridge]], now sunken, which would account for certain discontinuities in [[biogeography]]. This idea has been rendered obsolete by modern theories of [[plate tectonics]]. Sunken continents such as [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]] in the Pacific, [[Mauritia (microcontinent)|Mauritia]]&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21551149 |title=BBC News - Fragments of ancient continent buried under Indian Ocean |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] in the Indian Ocean do exist, but no geological formation under the Indian or Pacific Oceans is known that could have served as a land bridge between continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&amp;page=archiveSearch&amp;aid=20110422280809000&amp;ais=08&amp;avol=28 |title=Navigation News |publisher=Frontline.in |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Lemuria was subsequently incorporated into the proto-[[New Age]] philosophy of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and subsequently into general fringe belief. Accounts of Lemuria here differ. All share a common belief that a [[continent]] existed in ancient times and sank beneath the ocean as a result of a geological, often [[wikt:cataclysmic|cataclysmic]], change, such as [[pole shift]], which such theorists anticipate will destroy and transform the modern world.

==Scientific origins==
===Postulation===
In 1864, "The Mammals of Madagascar" by [[zoologist]] and biogeographer [[Philip Sclater]] appeared in ''[[The Quarterly Journal of Science]]''. Using a classification he referred to as [[lemur]]s, but which included related primate groups,&lt;ref name="Neild, Ted 2007 pp. 38–39"&gt;Neild, Ted ''Supercontinent: Ten Billion Years in the Life of Our Planet'' pp.Harvard University Press (2 Nov 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-674-02659-9}} pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; and puzzled by the presence of their [[fossil]]s in both [[Madagascar]] and [[India]], but not in [[Africa]] or the [[Middle East]], Sclater proposed that Madagascar and India had once been part of a larger continent (he was correct in this; though in reality this was the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]]).

&lt;blockquote&gt;The anomalies of the mammal fauna of Madagascar can best be explained by supposing that ... a large continent occupied parts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans ... that this continent was broken up into islands, of which some have become amalgamated with ... Africa, some ... with what is now Asia; and that in Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands we have existing relics of this great continent, for which ... I should propose the name Lemuria!&lt;ref name="Neild, Ted 2007 pp. 38–39"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Parallels===
Sclater's [[theory]] was hardly unusual for his time; "[[land bridge]]s", real and imagined, fascinated several of Sclater's contemporaries. [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], also looking at the relationship between animals in India and Madagascar, had suggested a southern continent about two decades before Sclater, but did not give it a name.&lt;ref&gt;
Neild, Ted ''Supercontinent: Ten Billion Years in the Life of Our Planet'' pp.Harvard University Press (2 Nov 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-674-02659-9}} p.38&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance of [[Darwinism]] led scientists to seek to trace the diffusion of species from their points of [[evolution]]ary origin. Prior to the acceptance of [[continental drift]], [[biology|biologists]] frequently postulated submerged land masses to account for populations of land-based species now separated by barriers of water. Similarly, [[geology|geologists]] tried to account for striking resemblances of rock formations on different continents. The first systematic attempt was made by [[Melchior Neumayr]] in his book ''Erdgeschichte'' in 1887. Many [[hypothetical]] submerged [[land bridge]]s and [[continents]] were proposed during the 19th century to account for the present distribution of [[species]].

===Promulgation===
After gaining some acceptance within the scientific community, the concept of Lemuria began to appear in the works of other scholars. [[Ernst Haeckel]], a Darwinian [[taxonomist]], proposed Lemuria as an explanation for the absence of "[[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]]" fossil records. According to another source, Haeckel put forward this thesis prior to Sclater (but without using the name "Lemuria").&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Lost Continents]], 1954 (First Edition), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Locating the origins of the human species on this lost continent, he claimed the fossil record could not be found because it sank beneath the sea.

Other scientists hypothesized that Lemuria had extended across parts of the Pacific Ocean, seeking to explain the distribution of various species across [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]].

===Supersession===
The Lemuria theory disappeared completely from conventional scientific consideration after the theories of plate tectonics and continental drift were accepted by the larger scientific community. According to the theory of plate tectonics, Madagascar and India were indeed once part of the same landmass (thus accounting for geological resemblances), but plate movement caused India to break away millions of years ago, and move to its present location. The original landmass, the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], broke apart; it did not sink beneath sea level.

==Kumari Kandam==

Some Tamil writers such as [[Devaneya Pavanar]] have associated Lemuria with [[Kumari Kandam]], a legendary sunken landmass mentioned in the Tamil literature, claiming that it was the [[cradle of civilization]].

'''Linked timestamping''' is a type of [[trusted timestamping]] where issued time-stamps are related to each other.

==Description==
Linked timestamping creates time-stamp tokens which are dependent on each other, entangled in some [[authenticated]] [[data structure]]. Later modification of the issued time-stamps would invalidate this structure. The temporal order of issued time-stamps is also protected by this data structure, making backdating of the issued time-stamps impossible, even by the issuing server itself.

The top of the authenticated data structure is generally ''published'' in some hard-to-modify and widely witnessed media, like printed [[newspaper]] or public [[blockchain]]. There are no (long-term) [[Public-key cryptography|private keys]] in use, avoiding [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]-related risks.

Suitable candidates for the authenticated data structure include:
* Linear [[hash chain]]
* [[Merkle tree]] (binary hash tree)
* [[Skip list]]

The simplest linear hash chain-based time-stamping scheme is illustrated in the following diagram:
[[File:Hashlink timestamping.svg|none|600px]]

The linking-based [[Timestamping authority|time-stamping authority]] (TSA) usually performs the following distinct functions:

;Aggregation
:For increased scalability the TSA might group time-stamping requests together which arrive within a short time-frame. These requests are ''aggregated'' together without retaining their temporal order and then assigned the same time value. Aggregation creates a [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] connection between all involved requests; the authenticating aggregate value will be used as input for the ''linking'' operation.

;Linking
:Linking creates a verifiable and ordered cryptographic link between the current and already issued time-stamp tokens.

[[File:Root of Merkle tree as published in Widely Witnessed Media.png|thumb|321px|right|Example newspaper publication of hash-linked time-stamping service]]

;Publishing
:The TSA periodically ''publishes'' some links, so that all previously issued time-stamp tokens depend on the published link and that it is practically impossible to forge the published values. By publishing widely witnessed links, the TSA creates unforgeable verification points for validating all previously issued time-stamps.

==Security==
Linked timestamping is inherently more secure than the usual, public-key signature based time-stamping. All consequential time-stamps "seal" previously issued ones - hash chain (or other authenticated dictionary in use) could be built only in one way; modifying issued time-stamps is nearly as hard as finding a preimage for the used [[cryptographic hash function]]. Continuity of operation is observable by users; periodic publications in widely witnessed media provide extra transparency.

Tampering with absolute time values could be detected by users, whose time-stamps are relatively comparable by system design.

Absence of secret keys increases system trustworthiness. There are no keys to leak and hash algorithms are considered more future-proof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-88702-7_3| isbn = 978-3-540-88701-0| title = Post-Quantum Cryptography| year = 2009| last1 = Buchmann | first1 = J.| chapter = Hash-based Digital Signature Schemes| last2 = Dahmen | first2 = E.| last3 = Szydlo | first3 = M.| pages = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; than modular arithmetic based algorithms, e.g. [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]].

Linked timestamping scales well - hashing is much faster than public key cryptography. There is no need for specific cryptographic hardware with its limitations.

The common technology&lt;ref&gt;See ISO/IEC 18014-1:2002 Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; for guaranteeing long-term attestation value of the issued time-stamps (and digitally signed data&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[XAdES|XAdES-A]].&lt;/ref&gt;) is periodic over-time-stamping of the time-stamp token. Because of missing key-related risks and of the plausible safety margin of the reasonably chosen hash function this over-time-stamping period of hash-linked token could be an order of magnitude longer than of public-key signed token.

==Research==

===Foundations===

Haber and Stornetta proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00196791 | title = How to time-stamp a digital document | year = 1991 | last1 = Haber | first1 = S. | issue = 2 | last2 = Stornetta | first2 = W. S. | journal = Journal of Cryptology | volume = 3| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/haber91how.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 to link issued time-stamps together into linear hash-chain, using a collision-resistant hash function. The main rationale was to diminish [[Timestamping authority|TSA]] trust requirements.

Tree-like schemes and operating in rounds were proposed by Benaloh and de Mare in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Benaloh and de Mare constructed a one-way accumulator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/3-540-48285-7_24| isbn = 978-3-540-57600-6| title = Advances in Cryptology — EUROCRYPT '93| year = 1994| last1 = Benaloh| chapter = One-Way Accumulators: A Decentralized Alternative to Digital Signatures | first1 = J.| last2 = Mare | first2 = M.| volume = 765| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| pages = 274| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/benaloh94oneway.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994 and proposed its use in time-stamping. When used for aggregation, one-way accumulator requires only one constant-time computation for round membership verification.

Surety&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surety.com/&lt;/ref&gt; started the first commercial linked timestamping service in January 1995. Linking scheme is described and its security is analyzed in the following article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/266420.266430 | isbn = 0897919122 | title = Proceedings of the 4th ACM conference on Computer and communications security  - CCS '97 | year = 1997 | last1 = Haber | chapter = Secure names for bit-strings | first1 = S. | last2 = Stornetta | first2 = W.

Skip-list based time-stamping system was implemented in 2005; related algorithms are quite efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/11751595_43| isbn = 978-3-540-34075-1| title = Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2006| year = 2006| last1 = Blibech| chapter = A New Timestamping Scheme Based on Skip Lists | first1 = K.| last2 = Gabillon | first2 = A.| volume = 3982| pages = 395| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Sciencef}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provable security===

Security proof for hash-function based time-stamping schemes was presented by Buldas, Saarepera&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

There is an explicit upper bound &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; for the number of time stamps issued during the aggregation period; it is suggested that it is probably impossible to prove the security without this explicit bound - the so-called black-box reductions will fail in this task. Considering that all known practically relevant and efficient security proofs are black-box, this negative result is quite strong.

Next, in 2005 it was shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buldas|first1=A.|last2=Laud|first2=P.|last3=Saarepera|first3=M. R.|last4=Willemson|first4=J.|date=|year=2005|title=Universally Composable Time-Stamping Schemes with Audit.|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.59.2070|journal=LNCS|volume=3650|pages=359–373|doi=10.1007/11556992+26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that bounded time-stamping schemes with a trusted audit party (who periodically reviews the list of all time-stamps issued during an aggregation period) can be made ''universally composable'' - they remain secure in arbitrary environments (compositions with other protocols and other instances of the time-stamping protocol itself).

Buldas, Laur showed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-71677-8_11 | isbn = 978-3-540-71676-1 | title = Knowledge-Binding Commitments with Applications in Time-Stamping | year = 2007 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laur | first2 = S.| journal = LNCS| volume = 4450 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 150–165| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.102.2680}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 that bounded time-stamping schemes are secure in a very strong sense - they satisfy the so-called "knowledge-binding" condition. The security guarantee offered by Buldas, Saarepera in 2004 is improved by diminishing the security loss coefficient from &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

The hash functions used in the secure time-stamping schemes do not necessarily have to be collision-resistant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-75670-5_9 | isbn = 978-3-540-75669-9 | title = Does Secure Time-Stamping Imply Collision-Free Hash Functions? | year = 2007 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Jürgenson | first2 = A.| journal = LNCS| volume = 4784 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 138–150| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.110.4564}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even one-way;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/11767480_4 | isbn = 978-3-540-34703-3 | title = Do Broken Hash Functions Affect the Security of Time-Stamping Schemes? | year = 2006 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laur | first2 = S.| journal = LNCS| volume = 3989 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 50–65| url = http://www.cs.ut.ee/~swen/publications/articles/buldas-laur-2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; secure time-stamping schemes are probably possible even in the presence of a universal collision-finding algorithm (i.e. universal and attacking program that is able to find collisions for any hash function). This suggests that it is possible to find even stronger proofs based on some other properties of the hash functions.

[[File:Hashtree timestamping.svg|thumb|none|600px|Hash tree based linking scheme]]
At the illustration above hash tree based time-stamping system works in rounds (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t+2&lt;/math&gt;, ...), with one aggregation tree per round. Capacity of the system (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) is determined by the tree size (&lt;math&gt;N=2^l&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; denotes binary tree depth). Current security proofs work on the assumption that there is a hard limit of the aggregation tree size, possibly enforced by the subtree length restriction.

==Standards==
[[ISO 18014]] part 3 covers 'Mechanisms producing linked tokens'.

[[American National Standards Institute|American National Standard]] for Financial Services, "Trusted Timestamp Management and Security" ([[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard]]) from June 2005 covers linking-based and hybrid time-stamping schemes.

There is no [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]] or standard draft about linking based time-stamping. RFC 4998 (Evidence Record Syntax) encompasses hash tree and time-stamp as an integrity guarantee for long-term archiving.

and the Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL), adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 13 October 2010 at the 1095th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies&lt;/ref&gt; with 47 member states, reporting directly to its principal organ, the [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name=fatf-gafi/&gt;

The task of Moneyval is assessing compliance with the principal international standards to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism and the effectiveness of their implementation, as well as making recommendations to national authorities in respect of necessary improvements to their systems.&lt;ref name=fatf-gafi&gt;FATF, [http://www.fatf-gafi.org/pages/moneyval.html Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (MONEYVAL)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1997, the [[Council of Europe]] established the "Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation
of Anti-[[Money Laundering]] Measures", carrying the official [[abbreviation]] of '''PC-R-EV''', as a sub-committee of the European Committee on Crime Problems (CDPC, for ''Comité Européen pour les Problèmes Criminels'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/1998%201999%20ENG.pdf  Annual Report 1998-99], Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering&lt;/ref&gt; The functions of PC-R-EV were to be regulated by the general provisions of Resolution Res(2005)47 on committees and subordinate bodies.

In 2002, the name of the committee was changed to "Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism", with the [[abbreviation]] '''Moneyval''', on the grounds that "the abbreviation 'PC-R-EV' does not express the aim of the committee’s activities sufficiently clearly."&lt;ref name=monaco&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=281665&amp;Site=COE Request by the Principality of Monaco to be evaluated by the Select Committee of Experts on the evaluation of anti-money laundering measures], Rapporteur Group on Legal Co-operation, Council of Europe, 13 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; 

At their meeting of 13 October 2010, the Committee of Ministers adopted a resolution elevating Moneyval, from 1 January 2011, to an "independent monitoring mechanism within the Council of Europe, answerable directly to the [[Committee of Ministers]]".&lt;ref name=council&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/moneyval/About/MONEYVAL_in_brief_en.asp Moneyval in brief], Council of Europe website&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14007">In [[multilinear algebra]], applying a map that is the [[Tensor product#Tensor product of linear maps|tensor product of linear maps]] to a [[tensor]] is called a '''multilinear multiplication'''.

== Abstract definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;F
   &lt;/math&gt; be a field of characteristic zero, such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}
   &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}
   &lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;V_k&lt;/math&gt; be a finite-dimensional vector space over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d&lt;/math&gt; be an order-d simple [[tensor]], i.e., there exist some vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_k \in V_k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \mathbf{v}_1 \otimes \mathbf{v}_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{v}_d&lt;/math&gt;. If we are given a collection of linear maps &lt;math&gt;A_k : V_k \to W_k&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''multilinear multiplication''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_d)&lt;/math&gt; is defined&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/733546583|title=Tensors : geometry and applications|last=M.|first=Landsberg, J.|date=2012|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=9780821869079|location=Providence, R.I.|oclc=733546583}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the action on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[tensor product]] of these linear maps,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387902845|title=Multilinear Algebra {{!}} Werner Greub {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
A_1 \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d : V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d &amp; \to W_1 \otimes W_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes W_d, \\
\mathbf{v}_1 \otimes \mathbf{v}_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{v}_d &amp; \mapsto A_1(\mathbf{v}_1) \otimes A_2(\mathbf{v}_2) \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d(\mathbf{v}_d)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[tensor product]] of linear maps is itself a linear map,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and because every tensor admits a [[tensor rank decomposition]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the above expression extends linearly to all tensors. That is, for a general tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d&lt;/math&gt;, the multilinear multiplication is

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \mathcal{B} := (A_1 \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d)(\mathcal{A}) \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; (A_1 \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d)\left(\sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{a}_i^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^d\right) \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; \sum_{i=1}^r A_1(\mathbf{a}_i^1) \otimes A_2(\mathbf{a}_i^2) \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d( \mathbf{a}_i^d )
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{a}_i^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^d&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_i^k \in V_k&lt;/math&gt; is one of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;'s tensor rank decompositions. The validity of the above expression is not limited to a tensor rank decomposition; in fact, it is valid for any expression of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of pure tensors, which follows from the [[Tensor product#Universal property|universal property of the tensor product]].

It is standard to use the following shorthand notations in the literature for multilinear multiplications:&lt;math display="block"&gt;
(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_d) \cdot \mathcal{A} := (A_1 \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d)(\mathcal{A}) 
&lt;/math&gt;and&lt;math display="block"&gt;
A_k \cdot_k \mathcal{A} := (\operatorname{Id}_{V_1}, \ldots, \operatorname{Id}_{V_{k-1}}, A_k, \operatorname{Id}_{V_{k+1}}, \ldots, \operatorname{Id}_{V_{d}}) \cdot \mathcal{A},
&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Id}_{V_k} : V_k \to V_k &lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity operator]].

== Definition in coordinates ==
In computational multilinear algebra it is conventional to work in coordinates. Assume that an [[Inner product space|inner product]] is fixed on &lt;math&gt;V_k&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;V_k^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[dual vector space]] of &lt;math&gt;V_k &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\{ e_1^k, \ldots, e_{n_k}^k \} &lt;/math&gt; be a basis for &lt;math&gt;V_k &lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\{ (e_1^k)^*, \ldots, (e_{n_k}^k)^* \} &lt;/math&gt; be the dual basis, and let &lt;math&gt;\{f_1^k, \ldots, f_{m_k}^k \} &lt;/math&gt; be a basis for &lt;math&gt;W_k &lt;/math&gt;. The linear map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;M_k = \sum_{i=1}^{m_k} \sum_{j=1}^{n_k} m_{i,j}^{(k)} f_i^k \otimes (e_j^k)^* &lt;/math&gt; is then represented by the matrix &lt;math&gt;\widehat{M}_k = [m_{i,j}^{(k)}] \in F^{m_k \times n_k}&lt;/math&gt;.  Likewise, with respect to the standard tensor product basis &lt;math&gt;\{ e_{j_1}^1 \otimes e_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{j_d}^d \}_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d}  &lt;/math&gt;, the abstract tensor&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} e_{j_1}^1 \otimes e_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{j_d}^d
   &lt;/math&gt;is represented by the multidimensional array &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{A}} = [a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d}] \in F^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d}
   &lt;/math&gt; . Observe that &lt;math display="block"&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{A}} = \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d,
   &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_j^k \in F^{n_k} &lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''th standard basis vector of &lt;math&gt;F^{n_k} &lt;/math&gt; and the tensor product of vectors is the affine [[Segre map]] &lt;math&gt;\otimes : (\mathbf{v}^{(1)}, \mathbf{v}^{(2)}, \ldots, \mathbf{v}^{(d)}) \mapsto [v_{i_1}^{(1)} v_{i_2}^{(2)} \cdots v_{i_d}^{(d)}]_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_d} &lt;/math&gt;. It follows from the above choices of bases that the multilinear multiplication &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B} = (M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; becomes

&lt;math display="block" id="abba"&gt;
\begin{align}
\widehat{\mathcal{B}} &amp;= (\widehat{M}_1, \widehat{M}_2, \ldots, \widehat{M}_d) \cdot \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d \\
&amp;= \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} (\widehat{M}_1, \widehat{M}_2, \ldots, \widehat{M}_d) \cdot (\mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d) \\
&amp;= \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} (\widehat{M}_1 \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1) \otimes (\widehat{M}_2 \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2) \otimes \cdots \otimes (\widehat{M}_d \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting tensor &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{B}}&lt;/math&gt; lives in &lt;math&gt;F^{m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_d}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Element-wise definition ===
From the above expression, an element-wise definition of the multilinear multiplication is obtained. Indeed, since &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{B}}&lt;/math&gt; is a multidimensional array, it may be expressed as &lt;math display="block"&gt;\widehat{\mathcal{B}} = \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} b_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d,
   &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;b_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \in F
   &lt;/math&gt; are the coefficients. Then it follows from the above formulae that

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left( (\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^1)^T, (\mathbf{e}_{i_2}^2)^T, \ldots, (\mathbf{e}_{i_d}^d)^T \right) \cdot \widehat{\mathcal{B}} \\
= {} &amp; \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} b_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \left( (\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^1)^T \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \right) \otimes \left((\mathbf{e}_{i_2}^2)^T \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2\right) \otimes \cdots \otimes \left( (\mathbf{e}_{i_d}^d)^T \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d \right) \\
= {} &amp; \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} b_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \delta_{i_1, j_1} \cdot \delta_{i_2,j_2} \cdots \delta_{i_d, j_d} \\
= {} &amp; b_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_d},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{i,j} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B} = (M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math display="block" id="abba"&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; b_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_d} = \left( (\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^1)^T, (\mathbf{e}_{i_2}^2)^T, \ldots, (\mathbf{e}_{i_d}^d)^T \right) \cdot \widehat{\mathcal{B}} \\
= {} &amp; \left( (\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^1)^T, (\mathbf{e}_{i_2}^2)^T, \ldots, (\mathbf{e}_{i_d}^d)^T \right) \cdot (\widehat{M}_1, \widehat{M}_2, \ldots, \widehat{M}_d) \cdot 
\sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d \\
= {} &amp; \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} ((\mathbf{e}_{i_1}^1)^T \widehat{M}_1 \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1) \otimes ((\mathbf{e}_{i_2}^2)^T \widehat{M}_2 \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2) \otimes \cdots \otimes ((\mathbf{e}_{i_d}^d)^T \widehat{M}_d \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d) \\
= {} &amp; \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} m_{i_1,j_1}^{(1)} \cdot m_{i_2,j_2}^{(2)} \cdots m_{i_d,j_d}^{(d)},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;m_{i,j}^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt; are the elements of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{M}_k &lt;/math&gt; as defined above.

== Properties ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d &lt;/math&gt; be an order-d tensor over the tensor product of &lt;math&gt;F &lt;/math&gt;-vector spaces.  

Since a multilinear multiplication is the tensor product of linear maps, we have the following multilinearity property (in the construction of the map):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;math display="block"&gt;A_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_{k-1} \otimes (\alpha A_k + \beta B) \otimes A_{k+1} \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d = 
\alpha A_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d + \beta A_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes A_{k-1} \otimes \beta B_k \otimes A_{k+1} \otimes \cdots \otimes A_d 
&lt;/math&gt; 

Multilinear multiplication is a [[linear map]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;math display="block"&gt;(M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot (\alpha \mathcal{A} + \beta \mathcal{B}) 
= \alpha \; (M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \mathcal{A} +
\beta \; (M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; 

It follows from the definition that the [[Composition of maps|composition]] of two multilinear multiplications is also a multilinear multiplication:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;math display="block"&gt;(M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \left( (K_1, K_2, \ldots, K_d) \cdot \mathcal{A} \right)
= (M_1 \circ K_1, M_2 \circ K_2, \ldots, M_d \circ K_d) \cdot \mathcal{A}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_k : U_k \to W_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_k : V_k \to U_k&lt;/math&gt; are linear maps.

Observe specifically that multilinear multiplications in different factors commute,

&lt;math display="block"&gt;M_k \cdot_k \left( M_\ell \cdot_\ell \mathcal{A} \right) 
= M_\ell \cdot_\ell \left( M_k \cdot_k \mathcal{A} \right) 
= M_k \cdot_k M_\ell \cdot_\ell \mathcal{A}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;k \ne \ell.&lt;/math&gt;

== Computation ==
The factor-k multilinear multiplication &lt;math&gt;M_k \cdot_k\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be computed in coordinates as follows. Observe first that

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
M_k \cdot_k \mathcal{A} &amp;= M_k \cdot_k 
\sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \sum_{j_2=2}^{n_2} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d \\
&amp;= \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \cdots \sum_{j_{k-1}=1}^{n_{k-1}} \sum_{j_{k+1}=1}^{n_{k+1}} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_{k-1}}^{k-1} \otimes M_k \left ( \sum_{j_k=1}^{n_k} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_k}^k \right) \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_{k+1}}^{k+1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Next, since

&lt;math display="block"&gt;F^{n_1} \otimes F^{n_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d} 
\simeq F^{n_k} \otimes (F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_{k-1}} \otimes F^{n_{k+1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d}) 
\simeq F^{n_k} \otimes F^{n_1 \cdots n_{k-1} n_{k+1} \cdots n_d},
&lt;/math&gt;

there is a bijective map, called the '''factor-''k'' standard [[Tensor reshaping|flattening]]''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; denoted by &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)_{(k)} &lt;/math&gt;, that identifies &lt;math&gt;M_k \cdot_k \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; with an element from the latter space, namely

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\left( M_k \cdot_k \mathcal{A} \right)_{(k)} :=
\sum_{j_1=1}^{n_1} \cdots \sum_{j_{k-1}=1}^{n_{k-1}} \sum_{j_{k+1}=1}^{n_{k+1}} \cdots \sum_{j_d=1}^{n_d} M_k \left ( \sum_{j_k=1}^{n_k} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_{k}}^{k} \right) \otimes \mathbf{e}_{\mu_k(j_1,\ldots,j_{k-1},j_{k+1},\ldots,j_d)} := M_k \mathcal{A}_{(k)}, 
   &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_j &lt;/math&gt;is the ''j''th standard basis vector of &lt;math&gt;F^{N_k}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_k = n_1 \cdots n_{k-1} n_{k+1} \cdots n_d &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_{(k)} \in F^{n_k} \otimes F^{N_k} \simeq F^{n_k \times N_k} &lt;/math&gt; is the '''factor-''k'' flattening matrix''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; whose columns are the '''factor-''k'' vectors''' &lt;math&gt;[a_{j_1,\ldots,j_{k-1},i,j_{k+1},\ldots,j_d}]_{i=1}^{n_k} &lt;/math&gt; in some order, determined by the particular choice of the bijective map

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mu_k : [1,n_1] \times \cdots \times [1,n_{k-1}] \times [1,n_{k+1}] \times \cdots \times [1,n_d] \to [1,N_k]. 
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the multilinear multiplication &lt;math&gt;(M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_d) \cdot \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be computed as a sequence of ''d'' factor-''k'' multilinear multiplications, which themselves can be implemented efficiently as classic matrix multiplications.

== Applications ==
The [[higher-order singular value decomposition]] (HOSVD) factorizes a tensor given in coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in F^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d} &lt;/math&gt; as the multilinear multiplication &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = (U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_d) \cdot \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_k \in F^{n_k \times n_k} &lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal matrices and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} \in F^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d} &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2380">'''Mutual liberty''' is an idea first coined by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his 1835 work ''[[Democracy in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'' (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, Tocqueville was referring to the general nature of [[United States|American]] [[society]] during the 19th century. It appeared to him, at least on the surface, that every [[citizen]] in the [[United States]] had the [[wikt:opportunity|opportunity]] to participate in the civic activities of the [[country]]. Another way to look at mutual liberty is by accounting for the collective [[free will]]s of every rational being in a [[community]]. Even though the notion of mutual liberty was introduced by Tocqueville, it was [[John Stuart Mill]] who greatly expanded it.&lt;ref name=mill&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''On Liberty and Utilitarianism'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1993), 12–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill believed that the most proper occasion for mutual liberty was in a community governed by the [[consent of the governed]], i.e., a [[republic]].&lt;ref name=mill/&gt; And according to Mill, it is only in a republic where members of all political [[Political faction|factions]] can participate.&lt;ref name=mill/&gt; It has been said that a republic is the form of government that divides people least.&lt;ref&gt;James McMillan, ''Modern France: 1880–2002'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement pertains greatly to mutual liberty. Unlike [[positive liberty|positive]] and [[negative liberty]], mutual liberty encompasses all citizens. It makes no distinction between political preference and social status. Mutual liberty pervades all sectors of society, from the homeless man on the street to the premier of the [[State (polity)|state]]. It is the process through which a general sense of [[morality]] gets exerted on the widest range of people in any given communal setting.

'''New Atheism''' is a term coined in 2006 by the [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] journalist [[Gary Wolf (journalist)|Gary Wolf]] to describe the positions promoted by some [[History of atheism#Twenty-first century|atheists of the twenty-first century]].&lt;ref&gt;Lois Lee &amp; Stephen Bullivant, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XguDDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT48 A Dictionary of Atheism]'' (Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/atheism.html?pg=1&amp;topic=atheism&amp;topic_set= Wolff, Gary, in ''The New Atheism'', The Church of the Non-Believers reprinted in Wired Magazine, November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; This modern-day [[atheism]] is advanced by a group of thinkers and writers who advocate the view that [[superstition]], [[religion]] and [[irrationalism]] should not simply be tolerated but should be [[Antireligion|countered]], [[Criticism of religion|criticized]], and exposed by rational argument wherever their influence arises in government, education, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n-atheis/|title=New Atheists|website=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=14 April 2016|quote=The New Atheists are authors of early twenty-first century books promoting atheism.

New Atheism lends itself to and often overlaps with [[secular humanism]] and [[antitheism]], particularly in its criticism of what many New Atheists regard as the [[indoctrination]] of children and the perpetuation of [[ideologies]] founded on belief in the supernatural. Some critics of the movement characterise it pejoratively as "militant atheism" or "fundamentalist atheism".{{efn|The term is sometimes used benignly, for example by atheists such as Frans de Waal.&lt;ref name=DeWaal/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=DeWaal&gt;{{cite web |last1=De Waal |first1=Frans |authorlink1=Frans de Waal|title=Has militant atheism become a religion? |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/03/25/militant_atheism_has_become_a_religion/ |publisher=Salon.com |accessdate=9 March 2017 |date=25 March 2013 |quote=Why are the 'neo-atheists' of today so obsessed with God's nonexistence that they go on media rampages, wear T-shirts proclaiming their absence of belief, or call for a militant atheism?

==History==
===Early history===

The Harvard botanist [[Asa Gray]], a believing Christian and one of the first supporters of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], commented in 1868 that the more worldly Darwinists in England had "the English-materialistic-positivistic line of thought".&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Janet The ''Power of Place'', Volume 2 of the Biography of Charles Darwin (Alfred Knopf, 2002), page 310&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's supporter [[Thomas Huxley]] was openly skeptical, as the biographer Janet Browne describes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Huxley was rampaging on miracles and the existence of the soul. A few months later, he was to coin the word "agnostic" to describe his own position as neither a believer nor a disbeliever, but one who considered himself free to inquire rationally into the basis of knowledge, a philosopher of pure reason [...] The term fitted him well [...] and it caught the attention of the other free thinking, rational doubters in Huxley's ambit, and came to signify a particularly active form of scientific rationalism during the final decades of the 19th century. [...] In his hands, agnosticism became as doctrinaire as anything else--a religion of skepticism. Huxley used it as a creed that would place him on a higher moral plane than even bishops and archbishops. All the evidence would nevertheless suggest that Huxley was sincere in his rejection of the charge of outright atheism against himself. He refused to be "a liar". To inquire rigorously into the spiritual domain, he asserted, was a more elevated undertaking than slavishly to believe or disbelieve. "A deep sense of religion is compatible with the entire absence of theology," he had told [Anglican clergyman] Charles Kingsley back in 1860. "Pope Huxley", the [magazine] ''Spectator'' dubbed him. The label stuck." —Janet Browne&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Janet ''The Power of Place'', Volume 2 of the Biography of Charles Darwin (Alfred Knopf, 2002), pages 309-310&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recent history===

The 2004 publication of ''[[The End of Faith|The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason]]'' by [[Sam Harris]], a bestseller in the United States, was joined over the next couple years by a series of popular best-sellers by atheist authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/09/hitchens200709|title=God Bless Me, It's a Best-Seller!|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|website=Vanity Fair|access-date=14 April 2016|quote=...in the last two years there have been five atheist best-sellers, one each from Professors Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett and two from the neuroscientist Sam Harris.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris was motivated by the events of [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], which he laid directly at the feet of Islam, while also directly criticizing [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Sam |authorlink=Sam Harris |date=11 August 2004 |title=The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason |publisher=[[W.

In a 2010 column entitled "Why I Don't Believe in the New Atheism", [[Tom Flynn (author)|Tom Flynn]] contends that what has been called "New Atheism" is neither a movement nor new, and that what was new was the publication of atheist material by big-name publishers, read by millions, and appearing on bestseller lists.&lt;ref name="Flynn2010"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Flynn | first = Tom | authorlink = Thomas W.

On 6 November 2015, the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' published an article entitled, ''Is the New Atheism dead?''&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/123349/new-atheism-dead ''Is the New Atheism dead?] by Elizabeth Bruenig, New Republic, 6 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The atheist and evolutionary biologist [[David Sloan Wilson]] wrote, "The world appears to be tiring of the New Atheism movement.."&lt;ref&gt;[https://evolution-institute.org/article/the-new-atheism-as-a-stealth-religion-five-years-later/ The New Atheism as a Stealth Religion: Five Years Later] by David Sloan Wilson, Evolution Institute website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[PZ Myers]] who formerly considered himself a new atheist, publicly renounced the New Atheism movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2017/07/31/the-new-atheism-is-dead-long-live-atheism/ The New Atheism is dead.

[[Sam Harris]] is the author of the bestselling non-fiction books ''[[The End of Faith]]'', ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', and ''[[Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion]]'', as well as two shorter works, initially published as e-books, ''Free Will''&lt;ref name="Free Will"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris |first=Sam|authorlink=Sam Harris (author)|year=2012|title=Free Will|publisher=The Free Press |isbn=978-1451683400|page=96 |id= {{ASIN|1451683405|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Lying''.&lt;ref name=Lying&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris |first=Sam|title=Lying|year=2013|publisher=Four Elephants Press|isbn=978-1940051000|page=108|id= {{ASIN|1940051002|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris is a co-founder of the Reason Project.

[[Richard Dawkins]] is the author of ''[[The God Delusion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=The God Delusion|year=2007|publisher=Black Swan|isbn=978-0-552-77429-1|title-link=The God Delusion }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was preceded by a [[Channel 4]] television documentary titled ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]''. He is the founder of the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]]. He wrote: "I don't object to the horseman label, by the way. I'm less keen on 'new atheist': it isn't clear to me how we differ from old atheists."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[The God Delusion]]'', 10th anniversary edition, Black Swan, 2016, page I15 (new introduction for the 10th anniversary edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] was the author of ''[[God Is Not Great]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Hitchens |title=God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything |year=2007 |publisher=Atlantic Books |edition=First trade |isbn=978-1-843-54574-3 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named among the "Top 100 Public Intellectuals" by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' and ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazines. In addition, Hitchens served on the advisory board of the [[Secular Coalition for America]]. In 2010 Hitchens published his memoir ''[[Hitch-22]]'' (a nickname provided by close personal friend [[Salman Rushdie]], whom Hitchens always supported during and following [[The Satanic Verses controversy|''The Satanic Verses'' controversy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Hitch22 |year=2010 |publisher=Atlantic Books |isbn=978-1-843-54922-2 |page=448 |id= {{ASIN|1843549220|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after its publication, Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which led to his death in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christopher Hitchens dies at 62 after suffering cancer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16212418 |publisher=BBC News|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, Hitchens published a collection of essays and articles in his book ''Arguably'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=Arguably|year=2011|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-0857892584|id= {{ASIN|0857892584|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; a short edition ''Mortality''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher |title=Mortality |year=2012 |publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1848879218|id= {{ASIN|1848879210|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published posthumously in 2012. These publications and numerous public appearances provided Hitchens with a platform to remain an astute atheist during his illness, even speaking specifically on the culture of [[deathbed conversion]]s and condemning attempts to convert the [[terminally ill]], which he opposed as "bad taste".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Is there an afterlife? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbzd6ZbCowY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Hitchens and Paxman interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-s9AyNQyCw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Plus one horse-woman"====
After the death of Hitchens, [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] (who attended the 2012 [[Global Atheist Convention]], which Hitchens was scheduled to attend) was referred to as the "plus one horse-woman", since she was originally invited to the 2007 meeting of the "Horsemen" atheists but had to cancel at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=sOMjEJ3JO5Q|title=Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris &amp; Ayaan Hirsi Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali was born in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]], fleeing in 1992 to the [[Netherlands]] in order to escape an [[arranged marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali|url=http://www.project-reason.org/about/individual_member/2663/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became involved in Dutch politics, rejected faith, and became vocal in opposing Islamic ideology, especially concerning women, as exemplified by her books ''Infidel'' and ''The Caged Virgin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan |authorlink=Ayaan Hirsi Ali|title=The Caged Virgin|year=2008 |isbn=978-0743288347 |id= {{ASIN|0743288343|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali was later involved in the production of the film ''[[Submission (2004 film)|Submission]]'', for which her friend [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo Van Gogh]] was murdered with a death threat to Hirsi Ali pinned to his chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversial film maker killed|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/controversial-filmmaker-shot-dead-531777.html | location=London | work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event resulted in Hirsi Ali's hiding and later immigration to the United States, where she now resides and remains a prolific critic of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan|title=Christians in the Muslim world |url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2012/02/05/ayaan-hirsi-ali-the-global-war-on-christians-in-the-muslim-world.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She regularly speaks out against the treatment of women in Islamic doctrine and society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirsi Ali |first=Ayaan|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali on Protecting Women From Militant Islam |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali-on-Protecting-Women-From-Militant-Islam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a proponent of free speech and the freedom to offend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan|title=The Right to Offend|url=http://www.project-reason.org/archive/item/the_right_to_offend_a_speech_by_ayaan_hirsi_ali/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan|title=Muslim Rage and the Last Gasp of Islamic Hate|url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2012/09/16/ayaan-hirsi-ali-on-the-islamists-final-stand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspective==
Many contemporary atheists write from a scientific perspective. Unlike previous writers, many of whom thought that science was indifferent or even incapable of dealing with the "[[God]]" concept, Dawkins argues to the contrary, claiming the "God Hypothesis" is a valid [[hypothesis|scientific hypothesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Richard | last = Dawkins | title = The God Delusion | location = Boston | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; having effects in the physical universe, and like any other hypothesis can be tested and [[falsifiability|falsified]]. The late [[Victor Stenger]] proposed that the personal [[Abrahamic religions#The Supreme Deity|Abrahamic God]] is a scientific hypothesis that can be tested by standard methods of science. Both Dawkins and Stenger conclude that the hypothesis fails any such tests,&lt;ref&gt;Stenger, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and argue that [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] is sufficient to explain everything we observe in the universe, from the most distant galaxies to the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]], the existence of different species, and the inner workings of the brain and [[consciousness]]. Nowhere, they argue, is it necessary to introduce God or the [[supernatural]] to understand reality. New Atheists reject [[Jesus]]' divinity.&lt;ref name=Jr.2008&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Albert Mohler Jr.|title=Atheism Remix: A Christian Confronts the New Atheists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaaM4GEDD0MC&amp;pg=PA56|date=25 July 2008|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-4335-2262-8|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific testing of religion===
Non-believers assert that many religious or supernatural claims (such as the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] and the [[afterlife]]) are scientific claims in nature. They argue, as do [[deists]] and [[Progressive Christianity|Progressive Christians]], for instance, that the issue of Jesus' supposed parentage is not a question of "values" or "morals" but a question of scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name=freeinquiry&gt;{{cite journal| first = Richard | last = Dawkins | url = http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=dawkins_18_2 | title = When Religion Steps on Science's Turf : The Alleged Separation Between the Two Is Not So Tidy | journal = Free Inquiry Magazine | volume = 18 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rational thinkers believe science is capable of investigating at least some, if not all, supernatural claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Yonatan | last = Fishman | url = http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/Yon/test_supernatural2007.pdf | title = Can Science Test Supernatural Worldviews? }}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions such as the [[Mayo Clinic]] and [[Duke University]] are attempting to find [[empiricism|empirical]] support for the [[Studies on intercessory prayer|healing power of intercessory prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mukto-mona.com/Special_Event_/Darwin_day/supernatural_science300106.htm | title = Supernatural Science | first = Victor J. | last = Stenger | authorlink=Victor J Stenger | publisher = mukto-mona }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stenger, these experiments have thus far found no evidence that intercessory [[prayer]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|title=The new atheism : taking a stand for science and reason|date=2009|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=[[Amherst, New York]]|isbn=978-1-59102-751-5|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical arguments===
Stenger also argues in his book, ''[[God: The Failed Hypothesis]]'', that a God having [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] and [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] attributes, which he termed a ''3O God'', cannot [[logic]]ally exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|title=God : the failed hypothesis : how science shows that God does not exist|date=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst (New York)|isbn=978-1-59102-481-1|edition=[Nachdr.]|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar series of logical disproofs of the existence of a God with various attributes can be found in [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] and Ricki Monnier's ''[[The Impossibility of God]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Michael Martin (philosopher) | first1 = Michael | last1 = Martin | authorlink2 = Ricki Monnier | first2 = Ricki | last2 = Monnier | title = The Impossibility of God | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Theodore M. Drange's article, "Incompatible-Properties Arguments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Incompatible-Properties Arguments | url = http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/incompatible.html | journal = Philo | year = 1998 | issue = 2 | pages = 49–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on non-overlapping magisteria===
Richard Dawkins has been particularly critical of the conciliatory view that science and religion are not in conflict, noting, for example, that the Abrahamic religions constantly deal in scientific matters.  In a 1998 article published in ''Free Inquiry'' magazine&lt;ref name=freeinquiry /&gt; and later in his 2006 book ''The God Delusion'', Dawkins expresses disagreement with the view advocated by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] that science and religion are two [[non-overlapping magisteria]] (NOMA), each existing in a "domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution". In Gould's proposal, science and religion should be confined to distinct non-overlapping domains: science would be limited to the empirical realm, including theories developed to describe observations, while religion would deal with questions of ultimate meaning and [[morality|moral value]]. Dawkins contends that NOMA does not describe empirical facts about the intersection of science and religion: "It is completely unrealistic to claim, as Gould and many others do, that religion keeps itself away from science's turf, restricting itself to morals and values. A universe with a supernatural presence would be a fundamentally and qualitatively different kind of universe from one without. The difference is, inescapably, a scientific difference. Religions make existence claims, and this means scientific claims."

===Science and morality===
{{main|Science of morality}}
Popularized by Sam Harris is the view that science and thereby currently unknown objective facts may instruct human morality in a globally comparable way. Harris' book ''The Moral Landscape''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Sam|title=The Moral Landscape|year=2012|publisher=Black Swan|isbn=978-0552776387|id= {{ASIN|0552776386|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanying TED Talk ''How Science can Determine Moral Values''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Sam|title=How Science can Determine Moral Values|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose that human well-being and conversely suffering may be thought of as a landscape with peaks and valleys representing numerous ways to achieve extremes in human experience, and that there are objective states of well-being.

===Politics===
New Atheism is politically engaged in a variety of ways. These include campaigns to draw attention to the biased privileged position religion has and to reduce the influence of religion in the public sphere, attempts to promote cultural change (centering, in the United States, on the mainstream acceptance of atheism), and efforts to promote the idea of an "atheist identity". Internal strategic divisions over these issues have also been notable, as are questions about the diversity of the movement in terms of its gender and racial balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kettell | first = Steven | url = http://www.secularismandnonreligion.org/article/view/snr.al/12 | title = Faithless: The Politics of New Atheism | journal = [[Secularism and Non Religion]] | volume = 2 | pages = 61–78 | year = 2013|doi=10.5334/snr.al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
===Accusations of Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism===
The theologians Jeffrey Robbins and Christopher Rodkey take issue with what they regard as "the [[Evangelism|evangelical]] nature of the New Atheism, which assumes that it has a Good News to share, at all cost, for the ultimate future of humanity by the conversion of as many people as possible." They believe they have found similarities between New Atheism and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christianity]] and conclude that the all-consuming nature of both "encourages endless conflict without progress" between both extremities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffrey Robbins and Christopher Rodkey|title=Religion and the New Atheism A Critical Appraisal.|year=2010|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=9781608462032|page=35|editor=Amarnath Amarasingam|chapter=Beating 'God' to Death: Radical Theology and the New Atheism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist William Stahl said, "What is striking about the current debate is the frequency with which the New Atheists are portrayed as mirror images of religious [[fundamentalist]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=William Stahl|title=Religion and the New Atheism A Critical Appraisal.|year=2010|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=9781608462032|pages=97–108|editor=Amarnath Amarasingam|chapter=One-Dimensional Rage: The Social Epistemology of the New Atheism and Fundamentalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atheist [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Michael Ruse]] has made the claim that Richard Dawkins would fail "introductory" courses on the study of "[[philosophy]] or [[religion]]" (such as courses on the [[philosophy of religion]]), courses which are offered, for example, at many educational institutions such as colleges and universities around the world.&lt;ref name=DoughertyGage&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dougherty, T|author2=Gage, LP|editor1-last=Oppy|editor1-first=Graham|title=The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon and New York|isbn=9781844658312|pages=52–53|chapter=4/ New Atheist Approaches to Religion, pp. 51-62|quote=Michael Ruse (2009) claimed that Dawkins would fail 'any philosophy or religion course'; and for this reason Ruse says The God Delusion made him 'ashamed to be an atheist'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RuseBiologosBeliefnet&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruse|first1=Michael|title=Why I Think the New Atheists are a Bloody Disaster|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/scienceandthesacred/2009/08/why-i-think-the-new-atheists-are-a-bloody-disaster.html|website=Beliefnet|publisher=The BioLogos Foundation as a columnist of Beliefnet|accessdate=19 August 2015|date=August 2009|quote=… the new atheists do the side of science a grave disservice … these people do a disservice to scholarship ...

Americans are religious people ... They want to be science-friendly, although it is certainly true that many have been seduced by the Creationists. We evolutionists have got to speak to these people. We have got to show them that Darwinism is their friend not their enemy We have got to get them onside when it comes to science in the classroom. And criticizing good men like Francis Collins, accusing them of fanaticism, is just not going to do the job. Nor is criticizing everyone, like me, who wants to build a bridge to believers – not accepting the beliefs, but willing to respect someone who does have them … The God Delusion makes me ashamed to be an atheist …  They are a bloody disaster …}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruse also claims that the movement of New Atheism—which is perceived, by him, to be a "bloody disaster"—makes him ashamed, as a professional philosopher of science, to be among those holding to an atheist position, particularly as New Atheism does science a "grave disservice" and does a "disservice to scholarship" at more general level.&lt;ref name=DoughertyGage /&gt;&lt;ref name=RuseBiologosBeliefnet /&gt;

[[Paul Kurtz]], editor in chief of [[Free Inquiry]], founder of [[Prometheus Books]], was critical of many of the new atheists.&lt;ref name="Kurtz kurtz_27_2"/&gt; He said, "I consider them atheist fundamentalists... They're anti-religious, and they're mean-spirited, unfortunately. Now, they're very good atheists and very dedicated people who do not believe in God. But you have this aggressive and militant phase of atheism, and that does more damage than good".&lt;ref name="A Bitter Rift Divides Atheists"/&gt;

[[Jonathan Sacks]], author of ''The Great Partnership: Science, Religion, and the Search for Meaning'', feels the new atheists miss the target by believing the "cure for bad religion is no religion, as opposed to good religion". He wrote: 
{{quote|Atheism deserves better than the new atheists whose methodology consists of criticizing religion without understanding it, quoting texts without contexts, taking exceptions as the rule, confusing folk belief with reflective theology, abusing, mocking, ridiculing, caricaturing, and demonizing religious faith and holding it responsible for the great crimes against humanity. Religion has done harm; I acknowledge that. But the cure for bad religion is good religion, not no religion, just as the cure for bad science is good science, not the abandonment of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jonathan |title=The Great Partnership: Science, Religion, and the Search for Meaning |date=2011 |publisher=Schocken |location=New York |isbn=978-0-805-24301-7 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Political biases===
The philosopher [[Massimo Pigliucci]] contends that the new atheist movement overlaps with [[scientism]], which he finds to be philosophically unsound. He writes: "What I do object to is the tendency, found among many New Atheists, to expand the definition of science to pretty much encompassing anything that deals with 'facts', loosely conceived..., it seems clear to me that most of the New Atheists (except for the professional philosophers among them) pontificate about philosophy very likely without having read a single professional paper in that field.... I would actually go so far as to charge many of the leaders of the New Atheism movement (and, by implication, a good number of their followers) with anti-intellectualism, one mark of which is a lack of respect for the proper significance, value, and methods of another field of intellectual endeavor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pigliucci|first1=Massimo|title=New Atheism and the Scientistic Turn in the Atheism Movement|date=2013|publisher=Midwest Studies in Philosophy|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist professor [[Jacques Berlinerblau]] has criticised the New Atheists' mocking of religion as being inimical to their goals and claims that they haven't achieved anything politically.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/professor-jacques-berlinerblau-tells-atheists-stop-whining/2012/09/14/0fdaf7f4-feab-11e1-98c6-ec0a0a93f8eb_story.html Professor Jacques Berlinerblau tells atheists: Stop whining!

'''Normative social influence''' is a type of [[social influence]] that leads to [[Conformity (psychology)|conformity]]. It is defined in [[social psychology]] as "...the influence of other people that leads us to conform in order to be liked and accepted by them."&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., &amp; Akert, A.M. (2005). Social Psychology (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. {{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of normative social influence stems from the human identity as a social being, with a need for companionship and association.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych&gt;{{cite web|last=Aronson|first=Eliot|title=Conformity: Influencing Behavior|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/hss_aronson_socpsych_6/64/16428/4205685.cw/-/4205769/index.html|work=Social Psychology|publisher=Pearson|accessdate=15 November 2013 |author2=Timothy Wilson |author3=Robin Akert}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normative social influence involves a change in behaviour that is deemed necessary in order to fit in a particular group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiss|first=Steven|date=2012-04-01|title=Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0098628312437704|journal=Teaching of Psychology|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=152–156|doi=10.1177/0098628312437704|issn=0098-6283}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for a positive relationship with the people around leads us to conformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeWall|first=C.

Social norms refers to the unwritten rules that govern social behavior.&lt;ref name="SchacterDaniel"&gt;Schacter, Daniel L. (2012). Psychology (2nd ed.) {{Publisher missing}} {{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are customary standards for behavior that are widely shared by members of a culture.&lt;ref name="SchacterDaniel" /&gt;

==Research==

=== Classic research ===
In 1955, [[Solomon Asch]] conducted his classic [[Asch conformity experiments|conformity experiments]] in an attempt to discover if people still conform when the right answer is obvious.&lt;ref name="Asch Conformity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=Solomon|title=Opinions and Social Pressure|journal=Scientific American|date=November 1955|volume=193|issue=5|pages=31–35|url=http://www.edmondschools.net/Portals/3/docs/Terri_McGill/READ-AschStudy.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2013|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he asked participants in his experiment to judge the similarity of lines, an easy task by objective standards. Using  accomplices to the plot, also known as confederates, Asch created the illusion that an entire group of participants believed something that was clearly false (i.e., that dissimilar lines were actually similar). When in this situation, participants conformed over a third of the time on trials where the confederates gave blatantly false answers. When asked to make the judgments in private, participants gave the right answer more than 98% of the time. Asch's results cannot be explained by [[informational social influence]], because in this case, the task was easy and the correct answer was obvious. Thus, participants were not necessarily looking to others to figure out the right answer, as informational social influence predicts. Instead, they were seeking acceptance and avoiding disapproval. Follow-up interviews with participants of the original Asch studies confirmed this. When participants were asked why they conformed, many provided reasons other than a need for accuracy.&lt;ref name="Asch Conformity" /&gt;

=== Current research ===
In more current research, Schultz (1999) found that households that received more normative messages describing the frequency and amount of weekly recycling, began to have a direct impact on both the households frequency and amount of their curbside recycling. The sudden change was due to the fact that "the other neighbors'" recycling habits had a direct normative effect on the household to change their recycling behaviors. Similar results were apparent in another study in which researchers were able to increase household energy conservation through the use of normative messages.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, J., Schultz, P., Cialdini, R., Goldstein, N., &amp; Griskevicius, V. (2008). Normative social influence is underdetected. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 34(7), 913-923.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in this conservation study did not believe that such normative messages could influence their behavior; they attributed their conservation efforts to environmental concerns or social responsibility needs. Thus, normative social influence can be a very powerful, yet unconscious, motivator of behavior.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Consequences ===
Lastly, different studies have illustrated the consequences of deviation from a group's influence. In a study by Schachter (1951), participants were placed in groups and asked to discuss what to do with a juvenile delinquent they had read about.&lt;ref name=SchachterDeviation&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=Stanley|title=Deviation, Rejection, and Communication|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|date=December 1951|volume=46|issue=2|pages=190–207|doi=10.1037/h0062326}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A "deviant" was instructed by the experimenter to take a stand strongly opposing that of the rest of the group and to hold this position in the midst of any arguments from other members. After the conclusion of the discussions, participants chose to reject this deviant the most, considering him the least desirable of the members, and relegating him to the least important tasks. Recent work by Berns et al. (2005) examined the physiological effects of deviation by using fMRI to scan participants' brains as they completed an object rotation task with other "participants", who were really confederates. The researchers were interested in examining participants' brain activity when they were under the pressure to conform to an incorrect group majority. The amygdala region (which is associated with negative emotions) was activated when participants sought to break off from the influence of the majority; providing evidence for the fact that resisting normative social influence can often lead to negative emotional consequences for individuals.&lt;ref name=BioPsych&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berns|first=Gregory|author2=Jonathan Chappelow |author3=Caroline F. Zink |author4=Giuseppe Pagnoni |author5=Megan E. Martin-Skurski |author6=Jim Richards |title=Neurobiological Correlates of Social Conformity and Independence During Mental Rotation|journal=Biological Psychiatry|date=August 2005|volume=58|issue=3|pages=245–253|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.04.012|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322305004634#|accessdate=15 November 2013|pmid=15978553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affecting factors ==

=== Social impact theory ===
{{Main article|Social impact theory}}
Latane's social impact theory posits that three factors influence the extent to which we conform to group norms: personal importance, immediacy, and size.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych /&gt; As the group becomes more important to a person, physically closer to him/her, and larger in number, Social Impact Theory predicts that conformity to group norms will increase. However, the size of the group only affects conformity to an extent—as a group expands past 3–5 members, the effect levels off.&lt;ref name=FranzoiPsych&gt;{{cite web|last=Franzoi|first=Stephen|title=Social Influence|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072489049/student_view0/chapter9/chapter_outline.html|work=Social Psychology|publisher=McGraw-Hill|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unanimity ===
{{Main article|Unanimity}}
When a group is unanimous in its support of a norm, an individual feels greater pressure to follow suit.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych /&gt; However, even a small break in unanimity can lead to decrease in the power of such normative influence. In Asch's study, when even one other confederate dissented from the majority and provided the correct answer, the participant answered incorrectly on fewer trials (about a fourth less).&lt;ref name="Asch Conformity" /&gt; In addition, participants experienced positive emotions towards such dissenters. A similar reduction in conformity even occurred when the dissenting confederate provided an answer that was false (but still different from that of the majority).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In some versions of the experiment, Asch had dissenting confederates eventually rejoin the majority opinion after several trials; when this occurred, participants experienced greater pressure from normative influence and conformed as if they had never had the dissenter on their side.&lt;ref name="Asch Conformity" /&gt; However, when the conditions were altered and the dissenting confederate left the room after several trials, the participants did not experience a similar pressure to conform as they had when the confederate rejoined the majority—they made less mistakes than they had in the condition where the confederate rejoined the others.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Private vs. public ===
The pressure to bend to normative influence increases for actions performed in public, whereas this pressure decreases for actions done in private.&lt;ref name=McLeodPsych&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=Saul|date=2008|title=Asch Experiment|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html|publisher=SimplyPsychology|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another variation of the Asch study, the researchers allowed the participant to privately write down his answer after all of the confederates had publicly stated their answers; this variation reduced the level of conformity among participants.&lt;ref name="AschConformity#2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=Solomon|title=Studies of Independence and Conformity:  I. A Minority of One Against a Unanimous Majority|journal=Psychological Monographs: General and Applied|year=1956|volume=70|issue=9|pages=1–70|doi=10.1037/h0093718}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the control condition of the Asch study revealed that participants were almost perfectly accurate when answering independently.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Minority influence ===
{{Main article|Minority influence}}
It is possible for a vocal minority to stem the normative influence of a larger majority.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych /&gt;&lt;ref name=FranzoiPsych /&gt; In the versions of the Asch study where a dissenter was inserted into the group (see Unanimity section), his presence as a minority member gave the participant the confidence to exert his independence to a greater extent.&lt;ref name="Asch Conformity" /&gt; However, as soon as the dissenter waffled on his opinions and rejoined the majority, participant conformity increased. Thus, a minority must consistently stand by its beliefs to be effective.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In addition, there are other factors that increase the power of the minority: when the majority is forced to think about the beliefs and perspective of the minority, when the majority and minority are similar to one another, and when the minority exhibits some willingness to compromise and be flexible, although there is debate over the degree to which consistency and compromise should be balanced.&lt;ref name=MinorityInfluence&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=Moscovici and Minority Influence|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/minority-influence.html|publisher=SimplyPsychology|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often the case that whereas a majority influences public compliance with a norm, a minority can engender private acceptance of a new norm, with the end result often being conversion (public and private acceptance of a norm).&lt;ref name=MinorityInfluence /&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
There is a distinction between [[individualistic culture|individualistic]] (e.g., United States) and collectivistic (e.g., Japan) cultures.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych /&gt;&lt;ref name=FranzoiPsych /&gt; While some predict that collectivistic cultures would exhibit stronger conformity under normative social influence, this is not necessarily the case—the identity of the group acts as a potential moderator. Because collectivists emphasize the importance of in-group members (e.g., family and friends), normative pressure from in-groups can lead to higher conformity than pressures from strangers.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Gender differences ===
Many have long wondered whether there is a gender gap in conformity under normative influence, with women possibly conforming more than men. A meta-analysis by Eagly and Carli (1981) shows that this gap is small, and driven by public vs. private situations.&lt;ref name=EaglyCarli&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=Alice|author2=Linda Carli |title=Sex of researchers and sex-typed communications as determinants of sex differences in influenceability: A meta-analysis of social influence studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=July 1981|volume=90|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.90.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women do conform (slightly) more under normative influence than do men when in public situations as opposed to private ones. Eagly and Carli found that male researchers reported higher levels of conformity among female participants than did female researchers; the authors speculate that each gender could be implicitly biased towards portraying itself in a positive light, thus leading to actions (e.g., setting up experimental conditions under which males or females may be more comfortable) that might favor one gender over the other.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Functions==
In many cases, normative social influence serves to promote [[social cohesion]]. When a majority of group members conform to social norms, the group generally becomes more stable. This stability translates into social cohesion, which allows group members to work together toward a common understanding, or "good," but also has the unintended impact of making the group members less individualistic.&lt;ref&gt;Heuser, L., Brian. (2005). Social Cohesion and Voluntary Associations. ''Peabody Journal of Education'', 80, 16–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Fashion choices are often impacted by normative social influence. To feel accepted by a particular crowd, men and women often dress similarly to individuals in that group. Fashion conformity promotes social cohesion within the group, and can be a result of both conscious and unconscious motivations. Similar to fashion conformity, both the male and female view of the ideal body image is often affected by normative social influence.&lt;ref name=AronsonPsych /&gt; Social media and marketing helps to portray what is commonly considered the current view of physical attractiveness by the masses. As each generation defines the ideal female figure, women feel the pressure to conform to avoid disapproval of others. Likewise, as society continues to define the ideal male body type as muscular and fit, men also come under pressure to conform, as well, often leading to changes in eating habits to reach that ideal.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41188">{{For|related uses|Internet identity (disambiguation)}}
'''Internet identity''' ('''IID'''), also '''online identity''' or '''internet persona''', is a [[social identity]] that an Internet user establishes in online communities and websites. It can also be considered as an actively constructed presentation of oneself. Although some people choose to use their real names online, some Internet users prefer to be anonymous, identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of [[personally identifiable information]]. An online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online. Some can even be deceptive about their identity.

In some online contexts, including [[Internet forum]]s, [[online chat]]s, and [[massively multiplayer online role-playing games]] (MMORPGs), users can represent themselves visually by choosing an avatar, an icon-sized graphic image. Avatars are one way users express their online identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Adams |first=Suellen |year=2005 |conference=DiGRA: Changing Views - Worlds in Play |title=Information Behavior and the Formation and Maintenance of Peer Cultures in Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games: a Case Study of City of Heroes |publisher=Authors &amp; Digital Games research Association (DiGRA) |format=PDF |url=http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/06278.15067.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through interaction with other users, an established online identity acquires a [[reputation]], which enables other users to decide whether the identity is worthy of [[Trust (sociology)|trust]].&lt;ref name="Nabeth20060526"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabeth |first=Thierry |date=26 May 2006 |title=D2.2: Set of use cases and scenarios |journal=FIDIS Deliverables |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=74–91 |chapter=Understanding the Identity Concept in the Context of Digital Social Environments |publisher=FIDIS |format=PDF |url=http://www.fidis.net/fileadmin/fidis/deliverables/fidis-wp2-del2.2_Cases__stories_and_Scenario.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online identities are associated with users through [[authentication]], which typically requires [[Registered user|registration]] and [[Login|logging in]]. Some websites also use the user's [[IP address]] or [[tracking cookies]] to identify users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/115483/htg-explains-learn-how-websites-are-tracking-you-online/|title=The Many Ways Websites Track You Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the [[self]], and how this is influenced by emerging technologies, are a subject of research in fields such as [[education]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. The [[online disinhibition effect]] is a notable example, referring to a concept of unwise and uninhibited behavior on the Internet, arising as a result of anonymity and audience gratification.&lt;ref name="Suler20040728"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suler |first=John |title=The Online Disinhibition Effect |journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior |year=2004 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=321–326 |doi=10.1089/1094931041291295 |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/1094931041291295|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online social identity==

===Identity expression and identity exposure===
{{See also|Online identity management|Impression management}}

The [[social web]], i.e. the usage of the web to support the social process, represents a space in which people have the possibility to [[online identity management|express]] and expose their identity&lt;ref name="PMID16784349"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marcus |first=Bernd |last2=Machilek |first2=Franz |last3=Schütz |first3=Astrid |title=Personality in cyberspace: Personal web sites as media for personality expressions and impressions |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2006 |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=1014–1031 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.6.1014 |pmid=16784349}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a social context.
For example, people define their identity explicitly by creating [[user profile]]s in [[social network services]] such as [[Facebook]] or [[LinkedIn]] and [[online dating service]]s.&lt;ref name="Siibak2007"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47502962_Casanova_s_of_the_Virtual_World._How_Boys_Present_Themselves_on_Dating_Websites |title=Casanovas of the Virtual World.

The disclosure of a person's identity may present certain issues&lt;ref name="Nabeth20060526"/&gt; related to [[privacy]]. Many people adopt strategies that help them control the disclosure of their personal information online.&lt;ref name="Tufekci2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tufekci |first=Zeynep |title=Can You See Me Now? Audience and Disclosure Regulation in Online Social Network Sites |journal=Bulletin of Science Technology &amp; Society |date=February 2008 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=20–36 |doi=10.1177/0270467607311484 |url=http://bst.sagepub.com/content/28/1/20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some strategies require users to invest considerable effort.

The emergence of the concept of online identity has raised many questions among academics. [[Social networking service]]s and online [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s have complicated the concept of identity. Academia has responded to these emerging trends by establishing domains of scholarly research such as [[technoself]] studies, which focuses on all aspects of human identity in technological societies.

Online activities may affect our offline personal identity, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Personal Identity Online.|last = Rodogno|first = R|date = 2012|journal = Philosophy &amp; Technology|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concept of the mask===
Dorian Wiszniewski and [[Richard Coyne]] in their contribution to the book ''Building Virtual Communities'' explore online identity, with emphasis on the concept of "masking" identity.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} They point out that whenever an individual interacts in a social sphere they portray a mask of their identity. This is no different online and in fact becomes even more pronounced due to the decisions an online contributor must make concerning his or her online profile. He or she must answer specific questions about age, [[gender]], address, [[username]] and so forth. Furthermore, with the accrual of one's online activity, his or her mask is increasingly defined by his or her style of writing, vocabulary and topics.

The kind of mask one chooses reveals at least something of the subject behind the mask. One might call this the "[[metaphor]]" of the mask. The online mask does not reveal the actual identity of a person. It, however, does reveal an example of what lies behind the mask. For instance, if a person chooses to act like a [[Celebrity|rock star]] online, this metaphor reveals an interest in rock music. Even if a person chooses to hide behind a totally [[false identity]], this says something about the fear and lack of self-esteem behind the false mask.

Because of many emotional and psychological dynamics, people can be reluctant to interact online. By evoking a mask of identity a person can create a safety net. One of the great fears of online identity is having one's identity stolen or abused. This fear keeps people from sharing who they are. Some are so fearful of identity theft or abuse that they will not even reveal information already known about them in public listings. By making the mask available, people can interact with some degree of confidence without fear.

Wiszniewski and Coyne state "Education can be seen as the change process by which identity is realized, how one finds one's place. Education implicates the transformation of identity. Education, among other things, is a process of building up a sense of identity, generalized as a process of edification." Students interacting in an [[online community]] must reveal something about themselves and have others respond to this contribution. In this manner, the mask is constantly being formulated in dialogue with others and thereby students will gain a richer and deeper sense of who they are. There will be a process of edification that will help students come to understand their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiszniewski |first=Dorian |last2=Coyne |first2=Richard |title=Building Virtual Communities |edition=1st |date=November 2009 |origyear=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780511606373 |pages=191–214 |chapter=Mask and Identity: The Hermeneutics of Self-Construction in the Information Age |chapterurl=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511606373&amp;cid=CBO9780511606373A021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blended identity====

This mask perspective is likened to the concept of 'blended identity',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=Andrea J. |date=December 2009 |title=Mick or Keith: blended identity of online rock fans |journal=Identity in the Information Society |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=7–21 |publisher=Springer |publication-date=2009 |doi=10.1007/s12394-009-0015-5 |format=pdf |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12394-009-0015-5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the offline-self informs the creation of a new online-self, which in turn informs the offline-self through further interaction with those the individual first met online.

==In different contexts==

===Blogging===
As [[blogs]] allow an individual to express his or her views in individual essays or as part of a wider discussion, it creates a public forum for expressing ideas. Bloggers often choose to use pseudonyms, whether in platforms such as [[WordPress]] or in interest-centered sites like [[Blogster]], to protect personal information and allow them more editorial freedom to express ideas that might be unpopular with their family, employers, etc. Use of a pseudonym (and a judicious approach to revealing personal information) can allow a person to protect their "real" identities, but still build a reputation online using the assumed name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dennen |first=Vanessa Paz |date=December 2009 |title=Constructing academic alter-egos: identity issues in a blog-based community |journal=Identity in the Information Society |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=23–38 |publisher=Springer |publication-date=2009 |doi=10.1007/s12394-009-0020-8 |format=pdf |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12394-009-0020-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human resources ===
Digital identity management is becoming something that individuals need to consider when applying for jobs of while working for a company. Social media has been a tool for human resources for years. A KPMG report on social media in human resources say that 76 percent of American companies used LinkedIn for recruiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kpmg.com/US/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/human-resources-and-social-media.pdf|title=Human Resources and Social Media|last=Isaacson|first=Karen|date=May 2012|website=www.kpmg.com|publisher=KPMG|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ease of search means that reputation management will become more vital especially in professional services such as lawyers, doctors and accountants.

===Social networks===
Online social networks like [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]] allow people to maintain an online identity with some overlap between online and real world context. These identities are often created to reflect a specific aspect or ideal version of themselves. Representations include pictures, communications with other 'friends' and membership in network groups. Privacy control settings on social networks are also part of social networking identity.&lt;ref name="Grohol20060404"/&gt;

Some users may use their online identity as an extension of their physical selves, and center their profiles around realistic details. These users value continuity in their identity, and would prefer being honest with the portrayal of themselves. However, there is also a group of social network users that would argue against using a real identity online. These users have experimented with online identity, and ultimately what they have found is that it is possible to create an alternate identity through the usage of such social networks. For example, a popular blogger on medium.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Kelcie/pseudonyms-and-true-names-the-sacred-power-of-identity-9ca17e0f89da|title=Pseudonyms and True Names: The Sacred Power of Identity|date=24 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes under the name of Kel Campbell – a name that was chosen by her, not given to her. She states that when she was verbally attacked online by another user, she was able to protect herself from the sting of the insult by taking it as Kel, rather than her true self. Kel became a shield of sorts, and acted as a mask that freed the real user beneath it.

Such are the benefits of forming an alternate identity in online spaces. The "I" becomes subject to the "Me", and individuals are given the power to shape themselves into whoever (or whatever) they desire to become. Stories of people learning about their "hidden extroversion" or "unknown creativity" or becoming "someone else" are still at large. Research from scientists such as Danah Boyd and Knut Lundby has even found that in some cultures, the ability to form an identity online is considered a sacred privilege. This is because having an online identity allows the user to accomplish things that otherwise are impossible to do in real life. These cultures believe that the self has become a subjective concept on the online spaces; by logging onto their profiles, users are essentially freed from the prison of a physical body and can "create a narrative of the self in virtual space that may be entirely new".

The possibilities are endless – which is a feasible explanation for the explosive popularity of social networking sites in the past decade. Users are captivated by the opportunity to express themselves in an endless number of ways. Perhaps social networks will always remain popular, as long as the incentive to join is always present.

===Online business===
As the development of social networks, there appears a new economic phenomenon: doing business via social networks. For example, there are many users of [[WeChat]] called wei-businessmen sell products on WeChat. Doing business via social networks is not that easy. The identities of users in social networks are not the same as that in real world. For the sake of security, people do not tend to trust someone in social networks, in particular when it is related with money. So for wei-businessmen, reputations are very important for wei-business. They need invest enormous efforts to gain reputations among the users of WeChat, then these wei-businessmen could probably sell something to users.

===Online learning===
{{Main article|E-learning}}

====Communication====
Online identity in classrooms forces people to reevaluate their concepts of classroom environments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} With the invention of online classes, classrooms have changed and no longer have the traditional face-to-face communications. These communications have been replaced by computer screen. Students are no longer defined by visual characteristics unless they make them known. There are pros and cons to each side. In a traditional classroom, students are able to visually connect with a teacher who was standing in the same room. During the class, if questions arise, clarification can be provided immediately. Students can create face-to-face connections with other students, and these connections can easily be extended beyond the classroom.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} For timid or socially awkward students, this ability to form and extend relationships through personal contact may hold little appeal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} For these students, the appeal may reside in online courses, where computer communications allow them a greater degree of separation and anonymity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

With the prevalence of remote Internet communications, students do not form preconceptions of their classmates based on the classmate's appearance or speech characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Rather, impressions are formed based only on the information presented by the classmate. Some students are more comfortable with this paradigm as it avoids the discomfort of public speaking. Students who do not feel comfortable stating their ideas in class can take time to sit down and think through exactly what they wish to say.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Communication via written media may lead students to take more time to think through their ideas since their words are in a more permanent setting (online) than most conversations carried on during class (Smith).

====Perception of professor====
Online learning situations also cause a shift in perception of the professor. Whereas anonymity may help some students achieve a greater level of comfort, professors must maintain an active identity with which students may interact. The students should feel that their professor is ready to help whenever they may need it. Although students and professors may not be able to meet in person, emails and correspondence between them should occur in a timely manner. Without this students tend to drop online classes since it seems that they are wandering through a course without anyone to guide them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chamberlin |first=W. Sean |date=December 2001 |title=Face-to-Face vs. Cyberspace: Finding the Middle Ground |journal=Campus Technology |url=http://campustechnology.com/articles/2001/12/facetoface-vs-cyberspace-finding-the-middle-ground.aspx |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deanesmay.com/2006/01/30/online-education-is-not-a-fad/ |title=Online Education Is Not A Fad |last=Eteraz |first=Ali |date=30 January 2006 |website=Dean's World |publisher=Dean Esmay |accessdate=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Glenn Gordon |last2=Ferguson |first2=David |last3=Caris |first3=Mieke |year=2002 |title=Teaching over the Web versus in the classroom: differences in instructor experience |journal=International Journal of Instructional Media |volume=29 |issue=1 |page= |pages=61–67 |publisher= |format=PDF |accessdate=10 October 2013 |url=http://www.umsl.edu/technology/frc/pdfs/teaching_over_the_web_versus_in_the_classroom.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual world===
{{Main|Virtual world}}
In [[Virtual world]], the users create a personal avatar and communicate with others through the virtual identity. The virtual personal figure and voice may draw from the real figure or fantasy worlds. The virtual figure to some degree reflects the personal expectation, and users may play a totally different personality in virtual world than in reality.

===Internet forum===
{{Main|Internet forum}}
An [[Internet forum]], or message board, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages.
There are many types of Internet forums based on certain themes or groups. The properties of online identities also differ from different type of forums. For example, the users in a university BBS usually know some of the others in reality since the users can only be the students or professors in this university. However the freedom of expression is limited since some university BBSs are under control of the school administration and the identities are related to student IDs. On another hand, in some question-and-answer website like "ZhiHu" in China, is open to the public and users can create accounts only with e-mail address. But they can describe their specialties or personal experiences to show reliability in certain questions, and other users can also invite them to answer questions based on their profiles. The answers and profiles can be either real-name or anonymous.

==Benefits and concerns==

===Benefits===

A discussed positive aspect of [[virtual communities]] is that people can now present themselves without fear of persecution, whether it is personality traits, behaviors that they are curious about, or the announcement of a real world identity component that has never before been announced.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

This freedom results in new opportunities for society as a whole, especially the ability for people to explore the roles of gender and sexuality in a manner that can be harmless, yet interesting and helpful to those undertaking the change. Online identity has given people the opportunity to feel comfortable in wide-ranging roles, some of which may be underlying aspects of the user's life that the user is unable to portray in the real world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Online identity has a beneficial effect for [[minority group]]s, including ethnic minority populations, people with disabilities, etc. Online identities may help remove prejudices created by stereotypes found in real life, and thus provide a greater sense of [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]].

A prime example of these opportunities is the establishment of many communities welcoming gay and lesbian teens who are dealing with their sexuality. These communities allow teens to share their experiences with one another and older gay and lesbian people, and may they provide a community that is both non-threatening and non-judgmental. In a review of such a community, Silberman quotes an information technology worker, Tom Reilly, as stating: "The wonderful thing about online services is that they are an intrinsically decentralized resource. Kids can challenge what adults have to say and make the news".&lt;ref name="Holeton1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holeton|first=Richard|title=Composing cyberspace: identity, community, and knowledge in the electronic age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jasQAQAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-029548-3|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; If teen organizers are successful anywhere, news of it is readily available. The Internet is arguably the most powerful tool that young people with alternative sexualities have ever had.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The online world provides users with a choice to determine which sex, sexuality preference and sexual characteristics they would like to embody. In each online encounter, a user essentially has the opportunity to interchange which identity they would like to portray.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As McRae argues in Surkan (2000), "The lack of physical presence and the infinite malleability of bodies complicates sexual interaction in a singular way: because the choice of gender is an "option" rather than a strictly defined biological characteristic, the entire concept of gender as a primary marker of identity becomes partially subverted."

Online identity can offer potential social benefits to those with physical and sensory disabilities. The flexibility of online media provides control over their disclosure of impairment, an opportunity not typically available in real world social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stendal|first1=Karen|title=How do People with Disability Use and Experience Virtual Worlds and ICT: A Literature Review|journal=Journal For Virtual Worlds Research|date=2012|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.4101/jvwr.v5i1.6173|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4101/jvwr.v5i1.6173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers highlight its value in improving inclusion. However, it is notable that the affordance of "normalization" offers the possibility of experiencing non-stigmatized identities while also offering the capacity to create harmful and dangerous outcomes, which may jeopardize participants' safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowker|first1=Natilene|last2=Tuffin|first2=Keith|title=Dicing with Deception: People with Disabilities' Strategies for Managing Safety and Identity Online|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=January 2003|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2003.tb00209.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns===
Primarily, concerns regarding virtual identity revolve around the areas of misrepresentation and the contrasting effects of on and offline existence. Sexuality and sexual behavior online provide some of the most controversial debate with many concerned about the predatory nature of some users. This is particularly in reference to concerns about [[child pornography]] and the ability of [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]] to obscure their identity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Finally, the concerns regarding the connection between on and offline lives are challenging the notions of what constitutes real experience. In reference to gender, sexuality and sexual behavior, the ability to play with these ideas has resulted in a questioning of how virtual experience may affect one's offline emotions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As McRae states, at its best, virtual sex not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body, and self that has become a comfortable truism in Western metaphysics. When projected into virtuality, mind, body and self all become consciously-manufactured constructs through which individuals interact with each other.&lt;ref name="McRae1997" /&gt;

====Reliability====

The identities that people define in the social web are not necessarily facets of their offline self. Studies have shown that people lie in online dating services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Epstein |first=Robert |date=February 2007 |title=The Truth about Online Dating: The hype is huge, and the findings are somewhat disturbing--but the future of online dating looks good |journal=Scientific American Mind |format=PDF |url=http://drrobertepstein.com/pdf/Epstein-TheTruthAboutOnlineDating-2-07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Hancock |first=Jeffrey T. |last2=Toma |first2=Catalina |last3=Ellison |first3=Nicole |year=2007 |conference=CHI 2007 |contribution=The truth about lying in online dating profiles |title=Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |publisher=ACM |pages=449–452 |format=PDF |url=http://nguyendangbinh.org/Proceedings/CHI/2007/docs/p449.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of social network services such as Facebook, companies are even proposing to sell 'friends' as a way to increase a user's visibility, calling into question even more the reliability of a person's 'social identity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Learmonth |first=Michael |date=2 September 2009 |title=Want 5,000 More Facebook Friends? That'll Be $654.30 |journal=AdvertisingAge |location=New York |publisher=Crain Communications |url=http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=138770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gelder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Gelder|first1=Lindsy|title=Computerization and controversy|date=1995|isbn=0-12-415040-3|pages=533–546|edition=2nd|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=233415}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported a famous incident occurring on a computer conferencing system during the early 80s where a male psychiatrist posed as Julie, a female psychologist with multiple disabilities including deafness, blindness, and serious facial disfigurement. Julie endeared herself to the computer conferencing community, finding psychological and emotional support from many members. The psychiatrist's choice to present differently was sustained by drawing upon the unbearable stigma attached to Julie's multiple disabilities as justification for not meeting face-to-face. Lack of visual cues allowed the identity transformation to continue, with the psychiatrist also assuming the identity of Julie's husband, who adamantly refused to allow anyone to visit Julie when she claimed to be seriously ill. This example highlights the ease with which identity may be constructed, transformed, and sustained by the textual nature of online interaction and the visual anonymity it affords.

====Catfishing online====

[[Catfishing]] is a way for a user to create a fake online profile, sometimes with fake photos and information, in order to enter into a relationship, intimate or platonic, with another user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slade|first1=Alison F.|last2=Narro|first2=Amber J.|last3=Buchanan|first3=Burton P.|title=Reality Television: Oddities of Culture|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-8564-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catfishing became popular in mainstream culture through the MTV reality show ''[[Catfish: The TV Show|Catfish]]''.

==Identity management infrastructures==
A problem facing anyone who hopes to build a positive online reputation is that reputations are site-specific; for example, one's reputation on [[eBay]] cannot be transferred to [[Slashdot]].

Multiple proposals have been made{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} to build an [[identity management]] infrastructure into the Web [[Communications protocol|protocols]]. All of them require an effective [[public key infrastructure]] so that the identity of two separate manifestations of an online identity (say, one on [[Wikipedia]] and another on [[Twitter]]) are probably one and the same.

[[OpenID]], an open, decentralized standard for authenticating users is used for access control, allowing users to log on to different services with the same digital identity. These services must allow and implement OpenID.

===Reputation management===
{{Main article|Reputation management}}
Given the malleability of online identities, some economists have expressed surprise that flourishing trading sites (such as eBay) have developed on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} When two pseudonymous identities propose to enter into an online transaction, they are faced with the [[prisoner's dilemma]]: the deal can succeed only if the parties are willing to trust each other, but they have no rational basis for doing so. But successful Internet trading sites have developed [[reputation management]] systems, such as eBay's [[feedback]] system, which record transactions and provide the technical means by which users can rate each other's trustworthiness. However, users with malicious intent can still cause serious problems on such websites.&lt;ref name="Grohol20060404"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alistapart.com/articles/identitymatters |title=Anonymity and Online Community: Identity Matters |last=Grohol |first=John M. |date=4 April 2006 |website=A List Apart |publisher= |issn=1534-0295 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Falistapart.com%2Farticles%2Fidentitymatters&amp;date=2008-09-28 |archivedate=28 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online reputation is the perception that one generates on the Internet based on their [[digital footprint]]. Digital footprints accumulate through all of the content shared, feedback provided and information that created online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Banger|first1=Marnie|title=Young ones: your online reputation is, like, forever|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/young-ones-your-online-reputation-is-like-forever-20130905-2t4md.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|agency=Fairfax Media|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that if someone has a bad online reputation, he can easily change his pseudonym, new accounts on sites such as eBay or Amazon are usually distrusted. If an individual or company wants to manage their online reputation, they will face many more difficulties. This is why a merchant on the web having a [[brick and mortar]] shop is usually more trusted.

===Relation to real-world social constraints===
Ultimately, online identity cannot be completely free from the social constraints that are imposed in the real world. As Westfall (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;160) discusses, "the idea of truly departing from social hierarchy and restriction does not occur on the Internet (as perhaps suggested by earlier research into the possibilities presented by the Internet) with identity construction still shaped by others. Westfall raises the important, yet rarely discussed, issue of the effects of literacy and communication skills of the online user." Indeed, these skills or the lack thereof have the capacity to shape one's online perception as they shape one's perception through a physical body in the "real world."

==Disembodiment and implications==

This issue of gender and sexual reassignment raises the notion of disembodiment and its associated implications. "Disembodiment" is the idea that once the user is online, the need for the body is no longer required, and the user can participate separately from it. This ultimately relates to a sense of detachment from the identity defined by the physical body. In cyberspace, many aspects of sexual identity become blurred and are only defined by the user. Questions of truth will therefore be raised, particularly in reference to online dating and [[virtual sex]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As McRae states, "Virtual sex allows for a certain freedom of expression, of physical presentation and of experimentation beyond one's own real-life limits".&lt;ref name="McRae1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=McRae |first=Shannon |editor-first=David |editor-last=Porter |title=Internet Culture |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=75 |chapter=Flesh Made Word: Sex, Text, and the Virtual Body |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At its best, it not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body and self in a manner only possible through the construction of an online identity.

==Legal and security issues==

===Online identity and user's rights===
The future of online [[anonymity]] depends on how an identity management infrastructure is developed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Law enforcement officials often express their opposition to online anonymity and [[pseudonymity]], which they view as an open invitation to criminals who wish to disguise their identities.{{Original research inline|date=September 2010}} Therefore, they call for an identity management infrastructure that would irrevocably tie online identity to a person's [[natural person|legal identity]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}]; in most such proposals, the system would be developed in tandem with a secure national [[identity document]]. [[Eric Schmidt]], CEO of [[Google]], has stated that the [[Google+]] social network is intended to be exactly such an identity system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google+ Isn't Just A Social Network, It's An 'Identity Service' |first=Matt |last=Rosoff |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Google-Isn-t-Just-A-Social-Network-It-s-An-2329518.php |agency= |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Corp. |date=28 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy resulting from Google+'s policy of requiring users to sign in using legal names has been dubbed the "[[nymwars]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2011/08/12/google-nymwars-rage-on-while-pseudonymous-celebrity-users-mostly-immune.html |title=Google+ nymwars rage on, pseudonymous celebrity users are immune |last=Jardin |first=Xeni |date=12 August 2011 |publisher=Boing Boing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online civil rights advocates, in contrast, argue that there is no need for a privacy-invasive system because technological solutions, such as reputation management systems, are already sufficient and are expected to grow in their sophistication and utility.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Online predators===
{{Main article|Online predator}}
An online predator is an Internet user who exploits other users' vulnerability, often for sexual or financial purposes. It is relatively easy to create an online identity which is attractive to people that would not normally become involved with the predator, but fortunately there are a few means by which you can make sure that a person whom you haven't met is actually who they say they are. Many people will trust things such as the style in which someone writes, or the photographs someone has on their web page as a way to identify that person, but these can easily be forged. Long-term Internet relationships may sometimes be difficult to sufficiently understand knowing what someone's identity is actually like.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The most vulnerable age group to online predators is often considered to be young teenagers or older children.{{Original research inline|date=September 2010}} "Over time - perhaps weeks or even months - the stranger, having obtained as much personal information as possible, grooms the child, gaining his or her trust through compliments, positive statements, and other forms of flattery to build an emotional bond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pp_sp.html |title=Sexual Predators: Know the Enemy |year=2003 |website=NetSafeKids |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |quote=Over time—perhaps weeks or even months—the stranger, having obtained as much personal information as possible, grooms the child, gaining his or her trust through compliments, positive statements, and other forms of flattery to build an emotional bond. |accessdate=28 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims often do not suspect anything until it is too late, as the other party usually misleads them to believe that they are of similar age.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The show [[Dateline NBC|Dateline]] on NBC has, overall, conducted three investigations on online predators. They had adults, posing online as teenage juveniles, engage in sexually explicit conversations with other adults (the predators) and arrange to meet them in person. But instead of meeting a teenager, the unsuspecting adult was confronted by [[Chris Hansen]], an NBC News correspondent, arrested, and shown on nationwide television. ''Dateline'' held investigations in five different locations apprehending a total of 129 men in all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=To Catch a Predator III |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11152602/ |series=To Catch a Predator |last=Hansen |first=Chris |network=NBC |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal laws have been passed in the U.S. to assist the government when trying to catch online predators. Some of these include wiretapping, so online offenders can be caught in advance, before a child becomes a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/netsafekids/pp_li_il.html |title=Internet Laws |year=2003 |website=NetSafeKids |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In California, where one ''Dateline'' investigation took place, it is a misdemeanor for someone to have sexually-tinged conversations with a child online. The men who came to the house were charged with a felony because their intent was obvious.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==The market==
An online identity that has acquired an excellent reputation is valuable for two reasons: first, one or more persons invested a great deal of time and effort to build the identity's reputation; and second, other users look to the identity's reputation as they try to decide whether it is sufficiently trustworthy. It is therefore unsurprising that online identities have been put up for sale at online auction sites. However, conflicts arise over the ownership of online identities. Recently, a user of a massively multiplayer online game called [[EverQuest]], which is owned by [[Sony|Sony Online Entertainment, Inc.]], attempted to sell his EverQuest identity on eBay. Sony objected, asserting that the character is Sony's [[intellectual property]], and demanded the removal of the auction; under the terms of the U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), eBay could have become a party to a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit if it failed to comply. Left unresolved is a fundamental question: Who owns an online identity created at a commercial Web site? Does an online identity belong to the person who created it, or to the company that owns the software used to create the identity?{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

 [[File:Patent of Tolerance 13.10.1781 p1.jpg|thumb|Front page of the edict.]]
The '''Patent of Toleration''' ({{lang-de|Toleranzpatent}}) was an [[edict of toleration]] issued on 13 October 1781 by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Intolerance and discrimination | author=Jürgen Habermas | publisher=Oxford University Press and New York University School of Law | journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law | volume=1 | issue=1 | year=2003 | pages=2–12 | doi=10.1093/icon/1.1.2 | url=http://icon.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/2}} Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the [[Josephinism|Josephinist]] reforms, the Patent extended [[religious freedom]] to non-Catholic Christians living in the crown lands of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], including [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Macartney, C.

Burant, ed. | publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress | year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, these members of minority faiths were now legally permitted to hold "private religious exercises" in [[clandestine church]]es.&lt;ref name=Kaplan&gt;Kaplan, Benjamin J., ''Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe,'' Harvard University Press, 2007, Chapter 8, pp. 192-4. ff..&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the first time after the [[Counter-Reformation]], the Patent guaranteed the practice of religion by the Evangelical Lutheran and the [[Reformed Church in Austria]]. Nevertheless, worship was heavily regulated, wedding ceremonies remained reserved for the Catholic Church, and the [[Unity of the Brethren]] was still suppressed. Similar to the [[articular church]]es admitted 100 years before, Protestants were only allowed to erect 'houses of prayer' (''Bethäuser'') which should not in any way resemble church buildings. In many Habsburg areas, especially in the 'hereditary lands' of [[Upper Austria]], [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], Protestant parishes quickly developed, strongly relying on [[Crypto-protestantism|crypto-protestant]] traditions.

The Patent was followed by the [[1782 Edict of Tolerance|Edict of Tolerance]] for [[History of the Jews in Austria|Jews]] in 1782. The edict extended to Jews the freedom to pursue all branches of commerce, but also imposed new requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marsha Rozenblit]], Reconstructing National Identity, Oxford, 2001, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Jews were required to create German-language primary schools or send their children to Christian schools (Jewish schools had previously taught children to read and write Hebrew in addition to mathematics.) The Patent also permitted Jews to attend state secondary schools. A series of laws issued soon after the Edict of Toleration abolished the autonomy of the Jewish communities, which had previously run their own court, charity, internal taxation and school systems; required Jews to acquire family names; made Jews subject to military conscription; and required candidates for the rabbinate to have secular education.

The 1781 Patent was originally called the "Divine Send of Equal Liberties" but was further put down by the monarch's advisor. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Constraints on the construction of churches were abolished after the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutions of 1848]]. The Protestant Church did not receive an equivalent legal status until Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] issued the ''Protestantenpatent'' in 1861.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''problem of religious language''' considers whether it is possible to talk about [[God]] meaningfully if the traditional conceptions of God as being incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, are accepted. Because these traditional conceptions of God make it difficult to describe God, religious language has the potential to be meaningless. Theories of religious language either attempt to demonstrate that such language is meaningless, or attempt to show how religious language can still be meaningful.

Traditionally, religious language has been explained as [[Apophatic theology|via negativa]], analogy, symbolism, or myth, each of which describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The ''via negativa'' is a way of referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise [[ineffability|ineffable]] experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.

Empiricist [[David Hume|David Hume's]] requirement that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] movement, particularly the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. The movement proposed that, for a statement to hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically&amp;nbsp;– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued that he could not have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher [[Antony Flew]] proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.

The analogy of [[language-games|games]]&amp;nbsp;– most commonly associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein&amp;nbsp;– has been proposed as a way of establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed to solve the problem of meaning in religious language. [[R. M. Hare]] used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of "bliks"&amp;nbsp;– unfalsifiable [[belief-in|belief]]s according to which a worldview is established&amp;nbsp;– which are not necessarily meaningless. [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. [[John Hick]] used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of [[eschatological verification]], the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.

==Problem of religious language==
Religious language is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises the problem of how (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all,{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=139–140}} which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life.{{sfn|White|2010|p=1}} The French philosopher [[Simone Weil]] expressed this problem in her work ''Waiting for God'', in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.{{sfn|McFague|1982|p=1}}

The medieval doctrine of [[divine simplicity]] also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental properties]]&amp;nbsp;– these are properties that a being can have which do not contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the [[Bible]] regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the doctrine of divine simplicity.{{sfn|White|2010|p=1–2}}

The theologian [[Sallie McFague]] believes that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased [[secularism|secularisation]] of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both [[idolatry|idolatrous]] because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.{{sfn|McFague|1982|p=1–2}}

==Classical understanding of religious language==

===Via negativa===
[[File:Rambam-portrait.jpg|thumb|18th-century depiction of Maimonides, who developed the ''via negativa'']]

[[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]] [[Maimonides]] believed that God can only be ascribed negative attributes, a view based on two fundamental Jewish beliefs: that the existence of God must be accepted, and that it is forbidden to describe God.{{sfn|Levin|Schweid|2008|p=237}} Maimonides believed that God is [[divine simplicity|simple]] and so cannot be ascribed any essential attributes.{{sfn|Hyman|2008|p=400}} He therefore argued that statements about God must be taken negatively, for example, "God lives" should be taken as "God does not lack vitality".{{sfn|Seeskin|2005|p=88}} Maimonides did not believe that God holds all of his attributes perfectly and without impairment; rather, he proposed that God lies outside of any human measures. To say that God is powerful, for example, would mean that God's power is beyond worldly power, and incomparable to any other power. In doing so, Maimonides attempted to illustrate God's indescribable nature and draw attention to the linguistic limits of describing God.{{sfn|Seeskin|2005|p=89}}

===Analogy===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that statements about God are analogous to human experience.{{sfn|Weed|2007}} An analogous term is partly [[univocity|univocal]] (has only one meaning) and partly [[Equivocation|equivocal]] (has more than one potential meaning) because an analogy is in some ways the same and in some ways different from the subject.{{sfn|Cahalan|1985|p=438}} He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, it does not mean that God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.{{sfn|Weed|2007}}

Philosopher [[Taede A. Smedes|Taede Smedes]] argued that religious language is symbolic.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=44}} Denying any conflict between science and religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, in the context of Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=41}} Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world that there can be no common standard to which both God and the world can be compared.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=43}} He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently).{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=45-46}} Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God ''pro nobis'' (for us) and not ''in se'' (as such) or ''sine nobis'' (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.{{sfn|Depoortere|van Erp|Boeve|2010|p=44}}

In the twentieth century, [[Ian Ramsey]] developed the theory of analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by [[Alister McGrath]]. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation and the nature of God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God.{{sfn|McGrath|2011|loc=ch. 13}} The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.{{sfn|McGrath|1998|p=183}}

===Symbolism===
[[File:Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan.jpg|thumb|Sikh religious text, the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Nishan, in which religious language is used symbolically]]
Philosopher [[Paul Tillich]] argued that religious faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol points to a meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in the meaning of a concept.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=134}} Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality.{{sfn|Dourley|1975|p=85–6}} Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.{{sfn|Rees|2001|p=80}}

[[Louis Dupré (philosopher)|Louis Dupré]] differentiates between signs and symbols, proposing that a sign points to something while a symbol represents it. A symbol holds its own meaning: rather than merely pointing someone towards another object, it takes the place of and represents that object. He believes that a symbol has some ambiguity which does not exist with a sign.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=1}} Dupré believes that a symbol may deserve respect because it contains what is signified within itself.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=1–2}} A symbol reveals a reality beyond what is already perceived and transforms the ways the current reality is perceived.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=2}} Dupré differentiates between religious and [[aesthetic]] symbols, suggesting that a religious symbol points towards something which "remains forever beyond our reach". He proposed that a religious symbol does not reveal the nature of what it signifies, but conceals it.{{sfn|Dupré|2000|p=6}}

[[Langdon Brown Gilkey]] explained religious language and experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.{{sfn|Pasewark|Pool|1999|p=103}}

In the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religious text the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], religious language is used symbolically and metaphorically. In the text, Sikh Gurus repeat that the [[religious experience|experiences]] they have while [[meditation|meditating]] are [[ineffability|ineffable]], incognizable, incomprehensible, and transensuous&amp;nbsp;– this means that there is no object of their experience that can be conceptualised.{{sfn|Singh|1990|p=185}} To overcome this, the Sikh Gurus used symbolic and metaphorical language, assuming that there is a resemblance between the mystical experience of the divine (the sabad) and those experiencing it. For example, light is used to refer to the spiritual reality.{{sfn|Singh|1990|p=186}}

===Myth===
William Paden argued that religious language uses myth to present truths through stories. He argued that to those who practice a religion, myths are not mere fiction, but provide religious truths. Paden believed that a myth must explain something in the world with reference to a sacred being or force, and dismissed any myths which did not as "[[Folklore|folktale]]s".{{sfn|Paden|1994|p=73–74}} Using the example of [[creation myth]]s, he differentiated myths from scientific hypotheses, the latter of which can be scientifically verified and do not reveal a greater truth; a myth cannot be analysed in the same way as a scientific theory.{{sfn|Paden|1994|p=73–74}}

[[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] proposed that the Bible contains [[existentialism|existential]] content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'.{{sfn|Sherratt|2006|p=81}} Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding.{{sfn|Sherratt|2006|p=82}} Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.{{sfn|Dray|2002|p=259}}

Christian philosopher John Hick believed that the language of the Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He offered a demythologised [[Christology]], arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the [[Son of God]] was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented.{{sfn|Mbogu|2008|p=117}} Hick believed that demythologising the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1987|p=7}}

==Alternative explanations of religious language==

===Political===
Islamic philosopher [[Carl Ernst]] has argued that religious language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists.{{sfn|Ernst|2004|p=8}} Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.{{sfn|Ernst|2004|p=9}}

===Performative===
Peter Donovan argues that most religious language is not about making [[Truth claim|truth-claim]]s; instead, it is used to achieve certain goals.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=78}} He notes that language can be used in alternative ways beyond making statements of fact, such as expressing feelings or asking questions. Donovan calls many of these uses ''performative'', as they serve to perform a certain function within religious life. For example, the words "I promise" perform the action of promising themselves&amp;nbsp;– Donovan argues that most religious language fulfils this function.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=79–80}} Ludwig Wittgenstein also proposed that language could be performative and presented a list of the different uses of language. Wittgenstein argued that "the meaning of the language is in the use", taking the use of language to be performative.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=29}} The philosopher [[J. L. Austin]] argued that religious language is not just cognitive but can perform social acts, including vows, blessings, and the naming of children.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=26}} He distinguished performative statements as those that do not simply describe a state of affairs, but bring them about.{{sfn|Lawson|McCauley|1993|p=51}} Historian of religion Benjamin Ray uses the performance of rituals within religions as evidence for a performative interpretation of language. He argues that the language of rituals can perform social tasks: when a priest announces that a spiritual event has occurred, those present believe it because of the spiritual authority of the priest. He believed that the meaning of a ritual is defined by the language used by the speaker, who is defined culturally as a superhuman agent.{{sfn|Lawson|McCauley|1993|p=51–2}}

===Imperative===
British philosopher [[R. B. Braithwaite]] attempted to approach religious language [[empiricism|empirically]] and adopted Wittgenstein's idea of "meaning as use".{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=49}} He likened religious statements to moral statements because they are both non-descriptive yet still have a use and a meaning; they do not describe the world, but the believer's attitudes towards it. Braithwaite believed that the main difference between a religious and a moral statement was that religious statements are part of a linguistic system of stories, metaphors, and [[parable]]s.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=121}}

Professor [[Nathan Katz (professor)|Nathan Katz]] writes of the analogy of a burning building, used by the [[Buddha]] in the [[Lotus Sutra]], which casts religious language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children at the top of a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.{{sfn|Katz|1982|p=232}}

==Challenges to religious language==

===David Hume===
In the conclusion of his ''[[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that statements that make claims about reality must be verified by experience, and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|2008|p=98}}
{{Quote|Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact of existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.|David Hume|''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''{{sfn|Clack|Clack|2008|p=98}}}}
Hume criticised the view that we cannot speak about God, and proposed that this view is no different from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=171–2}}

===Logical positivism===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Alfred Jules Ayer.jpg|thumb|A. J. Ayer argued that religious language is meaningless because it is unverifiable.]] --&gt;
The [[logical positivism]] movement originated in the [[Vienna Circle]] and was continued by British philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]. The Vienna Circle adopted the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|distinction between analytic and synthetic statements]]: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}} To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a [[verifiability theory of meaning]], which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable.{{sfn|Weinberg|2001|p=1}} Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}}

In 1936, Ayer wrote ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'', in which he claimed that religious language is meaningless.{{sfn|Attfield|2006|p=11}} He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be [[logical truth|necessarily true]], like mathematical statements.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=120}} In doing so, he rejected [[metaphysics]], which considers the reality of a world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless.{{sfn|Oppy|Scott|2010|p=8}} Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God&amp;nbsp;– theistic, atheistic and agnostic&amp;nbsp;– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.{{sfn|Evans|1985|p=142}}

Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein finished his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' with the proposition that "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." Beverly and Brian Clack have suggested that because of this statement, Wittgenstein was taken for a positivist by many of his disciples because he made a distinction between what can and cannot be spoken about. They argue that this interpretation is inaccurate because Wittgenstein held the ''mystical'', which cannot be described, as important.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|1998|p=110}} Rather than dismissing the mystical as meaningless, as the logical positivists did, Wittgenstein believed that while the facts of the world remain the same, the perspective from which they are viewed will vary.{{sfn|Clack|Clack|1998|p=111}}

===Falsification===
The falsification principle has been developed as an alternative theory by which it may be possible to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is [[unfalsifiable]] because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Antony Flew]] argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement "God loves us" both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.{{sfn|Tracy|1996|p=120}}

Using [[John Wisdom]]'s [[Parable of the Invisible Gardener|parable of the invisible gardener]], Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable. The parable tells the story of two people who discover a garden on a deserted island; one believes it is tended to by a gardener, the other believes that it formed naturally, without the existence of a gardener. The two watch out for the gardener but never find him; the non-believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener, whereas the believer rationalises the non-appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected.{{sfn|Lumsden|2009|p=44}} Flew contended that if the believer's interpretation is accepted, nothing is left of the original gardener. He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence; and these beliefs consequently suffer a "death by a thousand qualifications" as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=172}} Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God's love for humans, arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs. He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God, such as the terminal illness of a child, theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence; for example they may suggest that God's love is different from human love. Such qualifications, Flew argued, make the original proposition meaningless; he questioned what God's love actually promises and what it guarantees against, and proposed that God's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless.{{sfn|Allen|1992|p=283–284}}

Flew continued in many subsequent publications to maintain the falsifiability criterion for meaning; but in later life retracted the specific assertion in his 1945 paper that all religious language is unfalsifiable, and so meaningless.  Drawing specifically on the emerging science of [[molecular genetics]] (which had not existed at the time of his original paper), Flew eventually became convinced that the complexity this revealed in the mechanisms of biological reproduction might not be consistent with the time known to have been available for evolution on Earth to have happened; and that this potentially suggested a valid empirical test by which the assertion "that there is no creator God" might be falsified;  "the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done."{{sfn|Flew|2007|p=124}}

==Analogies of games==
The analogy of a game was first proposed by [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] in an attempt to demonstrate the [[epistemology|epistemic]] unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being.{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=111}} Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; [[Christianity]] teaches this to be the [[logos (Christianity)|divine word]] which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Cooper|2006|p=217–218}}

Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed a calculus theory of language, which maintained that all language should be analysable in a uniform way. Later in his life he rejected this theory, and instead proposed an alternative [[language-game]] analogy.{{sfn|Labron|2006|p=28}} He likened the differences in languages to the differences in games, arguing that just as there are many different games, each with different rules, so there are many different kinds of language.{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=112}} Wittgenstein argued that different forms of language have different rules which determine what makes a proposition meaningful; outside of its language-game, a proposition is meaningless. He believed that the meaning of a proposition depends on its context and the rules of that context.{{sfn|Glock|1996|p=192–193}} Wittgenstein presented a language game as a situation in which certain kinds of language are used. He provided some examples of language games: "Asking, thanking, greeting, cursing, praying".{{sfn|Brenner|1999|p=16}}
{{quote|It is as if someone were to say: 'A game consists of moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules...'&amp;nbsp;– and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others.|Ludwig Wittgenstein|''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''{{sfn|Horn|2005|p=112}}}}
Wittgenstein believed that religion is significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore believed that religious language is confessional&amp;nbsp;– a confession of what someone feels and believes&amp;nbsp;– rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.{{sfn|Clack|1999|p=79}}

[[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips]] defended Wittgenstein's theory by arguing that although religious language games are autonomous, they should not be treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.{{sfn|Lacewing|Pascal|2007|p=173–4}}

Peter Donovan criticises the language-games approach for failing to recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=93}} Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the [[apologetics]] of some, demonstrates that they interact with each other and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.{{sfn|Donovan|1982|p=94–95}}

==Parables==

===R. M. Hare===
In response to Flew's falsification principle, British philosopher [[R. M. Hare]] told a parable in an attempt to demonstrate that religious language is meaningful. Hare described a lunatic who believes that all university professors want to kill him; no amount of evidence of kindly professors will dissuade him from this view. Hare called this kind of unfalsifiable conviction a "blik", and argued that it formed an unfalsifiable, yet still meaningful, worldview. He proposed that all people&amp;nbsp;– religious and non-religious&amp;nbsp;– hold bliks, and that they cannot be unseated by [[empirical evidence]]. Nevertheless, he maintained that a blik is meaningful because it forms the basis of a person's understanding of the world.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=173}} Hare believed that some bliks are correct and others are not, though he did not propose a method of distinguishing between the two.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=37–38}}

===Basil Mitchell===
Basil Mitchell responded to Flew's falsification principle with his own parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, even if he is seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=148}} Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views.{{sfn|Griffiths|Taliaferro|2003|p=108–109}} He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=64}}

===John Hick===
{{See also|Eschatological verification}}
Responding to the verification principle, [[John Hick]] used his parable of the Celestial City to describe his theory of [[eschatological verificationism]]. His parable is of two travellers, a theist and an atheist, together on a road. The theist believes that there is a Celestial City at the end of the road; the atheist believes that there is no such city. Hick's parable is an allegory of the Christian belief in an afterlife, which he argued can be verified upon death.{{sfn|Polkinghorne|2003|p=145–146}} Hick believed that eschatological verification is "unsymmetrical" because while it could be verified if it is true, it cannot be falsified if not. This is in contrast to ordinary "symmetrical" statements, which can be verified or falsified.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=39}}

In his biography of Hick, David Cheetham notes a criticism of Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=30}} Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.{{sfn|Cheetham|2003|p=30}}

James Morris notes that Hick's eschatological verification theory has been criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in [[religious pluralism]]. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in [[bodily resurrection]] can still be verified.{{sfn|Harris|2002|p=64}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7135">Rna22 is a pattern-based algorithm for the discovery of [[microRNA]] target sites and the corresponding heteroduplexes.&lt;ref name="pmid16990141"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miranda KC, Huynh T, Tay Y, Ang YS, Tam WL, Thomson AM, Lim B, Rigoutsos I |title=A pattern-based method for the identification of MicroRNA binding sites and their corresponding heteroduplexes. |journal=Cell |volume=126 |issue=6 |pages=1203–17 |year=2006 |pmid=16990141 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm is conceptually distinct from other methods for predicting [[List of RNA structure prediction software#Inter molecular interactions: MicroRNA:UTR|microRNA:mRNA heteroduplexes]] in that it does ''not'' use experimentally validated heteroduplexes for training, instead relying only on the sequences of
known mature miRNAs that are found in the public databases. The key idea of rna22 is that the reverse complement of any salient sequence features that one can identify in mature microRNA sequences (using pattern discovery techniques) should allow one to identify candidate microRNA target sites in a sequence of interest: rna22 makes use of the [[Teiresias algorithm]] to discover such salient features. Once a candidate microRNA target site has been located, the targeting microRNA can be identified with the help of any of several algorithms able to compute RNA:RNA heteroduplexes. A new version (v2.0) of the algorithm is now available: v2.0-beta adds probability estimates to each prediction, gives users the ability to choose the sensitivity/specificity settings on-the-fly, is significantly faster than the original, and can be accessed through http://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22/Interactive/.

Rna22 neither relies on nor imposes any cross-organism conservation constraints to filter out unlikely candidates; this gives it the ability to discover microRNA binding sites that may not be conserved in phylogenetically proximal organisms. Also, as mentioned above, rna22 can identify putative microRNA binding sites without needing to know the identity of the targeting microRNA. A notable property of rna22 is that it does ''not'' require the presence of the exact reverse complement of a microRNA's seed in a putative target permitting bulges and G:U wobbles in the seed region of the heteroduplex. Lastly, the algorithm has been shown to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;ref name="pmid19478799"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ritchie W, Flamant S, Rasko JE |title=Predicting microRNA targets and functions: traps for the unwary. |journal=Nature Methods |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=397–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19478799 |doi=10.1038/nmeth0609-397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of rna22 led to the discovery of "non-canonical" microRNA targets in the coding regions of the mouse ''Nanog'', ''Oct4'' and ''Sox2''.&lt;ref name="pmid18806776"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tay Y, Zhang J, Thomson AM, Lim B, Rigoutsos I |title=MicroRNAs to ''Nanog'', ''Oct4'' and ''Sox2'' coding regions modulate embryonic stem cell differentiation. |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7126 |pages=1124–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18806776 | doi=10.1038/nature07299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these targets are not conserved in the human orthologues of these three transcription factors even though they reside in the coding region of the corresponding mRNAs. Moreover, most of these targets contain G:U wobbles, one or more bulges, or both, in the seed region of the heteroduplex. In addition to coding regions, rna22 has helped discover non-canonical targets in 3'UTRs.&lt;ref name="pmid19748357"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lal A, Navarro F, Maher CA, Maliszewski LE, Yan N, O'Day E, Chowdhury D, Dykxhoorn DM, Tsai P, Hofmann O, Becker KG, Gorospe M, Hide W, Lieberman J |title=miR-24 inhibits cell proliferation by targeting E2F2, MYC, and other cell-cycle genes via binding to "seedless" 3'UTR microRNA recognition elements. |journal=Mol Cell |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=610–25 |year=2009 |pmid=19748357 | doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2009.08.020 |pmc=2757794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study&lt;ref name="srep00569"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xia Z, Clark P, Huynh T, Loher P, Zhao Y, Chen HW, Rigoutsos I, Zhou R |title=Molecular dynamics simulations of Ago silencing complexes reveal a large repertoire of admissible 'seed-less' targets. |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=2 |year=2012 |doi=10.1038/srep00569 |pmid=22888400 |pmc=3415692}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the problem of non-canonical miRNA targets using molecular dynamics simulations of the crystal structure of the Argonaute-miRNA:mRNA ternary complex. The study found that several kinds of modifications, including combinations of multiple G:U wobbles and mismatches in the seed region, are admissible and result in only minor structural fluctuations that do not affect the stability of the ternary complex. The study also showed that the findings of the molecular dynamics simulation are supported by [[HITS-CLIP]] (CLIP-seq) data. These results suggest that ''bona fide'' miRNA targets transcend the canonical seed-model in turn making target prediction tools like rna22 an ideal choice for exploring the newly augmented spectrum of miRNA targets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10512">'''Racial formation theory''' is an analytical tool in [[sociology]], developed by [[Michael Omi]] and [[Howard Winant]], which is used to look at [[race (classification of humans)|race]] as a socially constructed [[identity formation|identity]], where the content and importance of racial categories are determined by social, economic, and political forces.{{sfn|Omi|Winant|2015|pp=105–36}}  Unlike other traditional race theories, "In [Omi and Winant's] view, racial meanings pervade US society, extending from the shaping of individual racial identities to the structuring of collective political action on the terrain of the state".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=66}}

== Race concept ==
In order to delve further into the topic of racial formation, it is important to explore the question of what "race" is.  Racial formation theory is a framework that has the objective of deconstructing race as it exists today in the United States. To do this, the authors first explore the historical development of race as a dynamic and fluid [[social construct]]. This goes against the dominant discourses on race, which see race as a static and unchanging concept based purely on physical and genetic criteria.

Instead of claiming race as something that is concrete, where the person's biology and upbringing are what shape racial identity, Omi and Winant suggest that race is something that is fluid, where "the racial order is organized and enforced by the continuity and reciprocity between micro-level and macro-level of social relations".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=67}}

In the above definition, the "micro-level" [[social relation]]s refer to "the ways in which we understand ourselves and interact with others, the structuring of our practical activity in work and family, as citizens and as thinkers",{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|pp=66–67}}  basically, a person's individual interactions with other people.

The "macro-level" social relations refer to the [[social structure]]s and common [[ideologies]] of a society. Relevant social structures include collective organizations like businesses, the media, and the government, and the common ideologies include cultural and [[stereotypical]] beliefs on race, [[class (social)|class]], sexuality, and gender.

Omi and Winant also believe that "race [is] an unstable and 'de-centered' complex of social meanings constantly being transformed by political struggle".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=68}}  Because of this, people are able to constantly contest the definition of race both in the micro- and the macro-level.

== Functions and origin of racial discrimination ==
Throughout modern history, people have assigned identity based on race, both as a means of distinguishing one group from another, but more importantly as a means of control. The dominant culture assigns identity to [[minority group]]s as a means of separating them, diminishing their status, and maintaining control over them. Often, this distinction is made simply on the basis of skin color. Through this mechanism of assigning identity, race becomes a political weapon of the majority that has several limiting effects on the oppressed group: 
* determines freedom of movement within the society
* limits upward mobility from class to class
* prohibits or minimizes economic gain
* has a psychological impact on how the oppressed individual perceives themselves and exists within the confines of the limiting social expectations that have been imposed upon them.

=== Origin of racism as a justification for ethnocentrism ===
Omi and Winant argue that the concept of race developed gradually and was created to justify and explain inequality and [[genocide]] that is characteristic of European colonization. The expropriation of property, the denial of political rights, the introduction of [[slavery]] and other forms of coercive labor, well as outright extermination, all presupposed a worldview which distinguished European – children of God, human beings, etc. – from "others".  Such a worldview was needed to explain why some should be "free" and others enslaved, why some had rights to land while others did not. Race and the interpretation of racial differences were central factors in that worldview.
 
The need for a justification for institutionalized [[racial discrimination]] led to the "biological essentialist" framework.  In this framework, White European Americans were viewed as being born inherently superior.  Religious debates also flared over the role of race in definitions of humanity: "Arguments took place over creation itself, as theories of polygenesis questioned whether God had made only one species of humanity ('monogenesis')."{{sfn|Rothenberg|2006|pp=13–14}}

In their book ''Racial Formation'', Omi and Winant present race as a relatively recent phenomenon in the United States.{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1994|p=58}}  They describe how race becomes established in social consciousness, even without anyone having an explicit intention to perpetuate it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everybody learns some combination, some version, of the rules of racial classification, and of their own racial identity, often without obvious teaching or conscious inculcation. Race becomes 'common sense' – a way of comprehending, explaining, and acting in the world.{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1994|p=106}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Race was legitimated through science ===
There was also a scientific preoccupation with the idea of race. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries in particular, some of the most respected scientists of the time took up the question of [[racial superiority]]. Many of them concluded that White Europeans were, in fact, superior based on studies on everything from [[cranial capacity]] to [[social Darwinism]].

This scientific debate was not, however, a purely academic one. It was a central icon of public fascination, often in the popular magazines of the time. Even today, scientists are still working on finding a genetic basis for racial categorization. None of these efforts has been successful in defining race in an empirical and objective way.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Racial formation theory examines race as a dynamic social construct with inherent structural barriers, ideologies and individual actions, whereas the biological essentialist understands individual deficiency as the basis for racial marginalization and oppression.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

== Calling for a "racial formation perspective" ==
According to Omi and Winant, a "racial formation perspective" is needed to explain race as "an autonomous field of social conflict, political organizations, and cultural/ideological meaning".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1994|p=52}} The second part of their book is an elaboration of this racial formation perspective.

Omi and Winant define "racial formation" as "the process by which social, economic and political forces determine the content and importance of racial categories, and by which they are in turn shaped by racial meanings".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1994|p=61}} The racial formation perspective emphasizes the extent to which race is a social and political construction that operates at two levels, the micro (individual identity) and the macro (collective social structure). The two levels interact to form a racial social movement when individuals at the micro level are mobilized in response to political racial injustice at the macro level.

=== Race as seen through the racial formation perspective ===
Becoming a citizen of this society is the process of learning to see race – that is, to ascribe social meanings and qualities to otherwise meaningless biological features. And in turn, race consciousness figures centrally in the building of a collective body of knowledge without which we could not make sense of the world around us – a body of knowledge that Omi and Winant call "racial common sense". That describes the associations we make between individual characteristics, preferences, behaviors, and attitudes and a particular physical appearance or perceived group membership.{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=60}}

=== Racial formation guides our expectations ===

Those expectations will guide all our daily interactions.{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=59}}  Individuals that do not perform according to our racial expectations disrupt this micro-level process. Omi and Winant provide several illustrative examples of this disruption of expectations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The black banker harassed by police while walking in casual clothes through his own well-off neighborhood, the Latino or white kid rapping in perfect Afro patois, the unending faux pas committed by whites who assume that the non-whites they encounter are servants or tradespeople, the belief that non-white colleagues are less qualified persons hired to fulfill affirmative action guidelines...{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=59}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When our racial expectations are violated, our reactions can betray our "preconceived notions of a racialized social structure".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=59}} There are many racial projects dispersed throughout society that "mediate between discursive or representational means in which race is identified and signified on the one hand, and the institutional and organizational forms in which is it routinized and standardized on the other".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=60}}

'''Shaping''' is a [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]] paradigm used primarily in the [[experimental analysis of behavior]]. The method used is [[differential reinforcement]] of '''successive approximations'''. It was introduced by [[B. F. Skinner]]&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, G.B. (2004) [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1285014 A day of great illumination: B.F. Skinner's discovery of shaping.] ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 82: 317–28&lt;/ref&gt; with pigeons and extended to dogs, dolphins, humans and other species. In shaping, the form of an existing response is gradually changed across successive trials towards a desired target behavior by rewarding exact segments of behavior. Skinner's explanation of shaping was this:
{{quote|We first give the bird food when it turns slightly in the direction of the spot from any part of the cage. This increases the frequency of such behavior. We then withhold reinforcement until a slight movement is made toward the spot. This again alters the general distribution of behavior without producing a new unit. We continue by reinforcing positions successively closer to the spot, then by reinforcing only when the head is moved slightly forward, and finally only when the beak actually makes contact with the spot. ... The original probability of the response in its final form is very low; in some cases it may even be zero. In this way we can build complicated operants which would never appear in the repertoire of the organism otherwise. By reinforcing a series of successive approximations, we bring a rare response to a very high probability in a short time. ... The total act of turning toward the spot from any point in the box, walking toward it, raising the head, and striking the spot may seem to be a functionally coherent unit of behavior; but it is constructed by a continual process of differential reinforcement from undifferentiated behavior, just as the sculptor shapes his figure from a lump of clay.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1953). ''Science and human behavior''. pp. 92–3. Oxford, England: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Successive approximations==
The successive approximations reinforced are increasingly accurate approximations of a response desired by a trainer, the "target" response. As training progresses the trainer stops reinforcing the less accurate approximations. For example, in training a rat to press a lever, the following successive approximations might be reinforced:
# simply turning toward the lever will be reinforced
# only moving toward the lever will be reinforced
# only moving to within a specified distance from the lever will be reinforced
# only touching the lever with any part of the body, such as the nose, will be reinforced
# only touching the lever with a specified paw will be reinforced
# only depressing the lever partially with the specified paw will be reinforced
# only depressing the lever completely with the specified paw will be reinforced

The trainer starts by reinforcing all behaviors in the first category, here turning toward the lever. When the animal regularly performs that response (turning), the trainer restricts reinforcement to responses in the second category (moving toward), then the third, and so on, progressing to each more accurate approximation as the animal learns the one currently reinforced. Thus, the response gradually approximates the desired behavior until finally the target response (lever pressing) is established. At first the rat is not likely to press the lever; in the end it presses rapidly. 

Shaping sometimes fails. An oft-cited example is an attempt by Marian and Keller Breland (students of B.F. Skinner) to shape a pig and a raccoon to deposit a coin in a piggy bank, using food as the reinforcer.  Instead of learning to deposit the coin, the pig began to root it into the ground, and the raccoon "washed" and rubbed the coins together.  That is, the animals treated the coin the same way that they treated food items that they were preparing to eat, referred to as “food-getting” behaviors. In the case of the raccoon, it was able to learn to deposit one coin into the box to gain a food reward, but when the contingencies were changed such that two coins were required to gain the reward, the raccoon could not learn the new, more complex rule. After what could be characterized as expressions of frustration, the raccoon resorts to basic “food-getting” behaviors common to its species. These results show a limitation in the raccoon’s cognitive capacity to even conceive of the possibility that two coins could be exchanged for food, irrespective of existing auto-shaping contingencies. Since the Breland's observations were reported many other examples of untrained responses to natural stimuli have been reported; in many contexts, the stimuli are called "sign stimuli", and the related behaviors are called "sign tracking". &lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, Sara J. (2010)  "Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior" (2nd Ed) Oxford: New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Learning and Behavior|author1=Powell, R.|author2=Symbaluk, D.|author3=Honey, P.|date=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495595281|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WkF8B-Ovl50C&amp;pg=PA430|page=430|accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical applications==
Shaping is used in  training [[operant conditioning|operant responses]] in lab animals, and in [[applied behavior analysis]] to change human or animal behaviors considered to be maladaptive or dysfunctional. It also plays an important role in commercial animal training. Shaping assists in "discrimination", which is the ability to tell the difference between stimuli that are and are not reinforced, and in "generalization", which is the application of a response learned in one situation to a different but similar situation.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Engler: ''Personality Theories''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaping can also be used in a [[physical therapy|rehabilitation]] center. For example, training on parallel bars can approximate walking with a [[walker (mobility)|walker]].&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. (2012). ''Behavior modification, principles and procedures''. (5th ed.). Wadsworth Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Or shaping can teach patients how to increase the time between bathroom visits.

==Autoshaping==
'''Autoshaping''' (sometimes called '''sign tracking''') is any of a variety of experimental procedures used to study [[classical conditioning]]. In autoshaping, in contrast to shaping, the reward comes irrespective of the behavior of the animal. In its simplest form, autoshaping is very similar to [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s salivary conditioning procedure using dogs. In Pavlov's best-known procedure, a short audible tone reliably preceded the presentation of food to dogs. The dogs naturally, unconditionally, salivated ([[classical conditioning|unconditioned response]]) to the food ([[unconditioned stimulus]]) given to them, but through learning, conditionally, came to salivate ([[conditioned response]]) to the tone ([[conditioned stimulus]]) that predicted food. In auto-shaping, a light is reliably turned on shortly before animals are given food. The animals naturally, unconditionally, display consummatory reactions to the food given them, but through learning, conditionally, came to perform those same consummatory actions directed at the conditioned stimulus that predicts food.

Autoshaping provides an interesting conundrum for [[B.F. Skinner]]'s assertion that one must employ shaping as a method for teaching a pigeon to peck a key. After all, if an animal can shape itself, why use the laborious process of shaping? Autoshaping also contradicts Skinner's principle of reinforcement. During autoshaping, food comes irrespective of the behavior of the animal. If reinforcement were occurring, random behaviors should increase in frequency because they should have been rewarded by random food. Nonetheless, key-pecking reliably develops in pigeons,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, P. &amp; Jenkins, H.M. (1968). Auto-shaping of the pigeon's key peck. ''J. Exper. Analys. Behav.'' 11: 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; even if this behavior had never been rewarded.

But, the clearest evidence that auto-shaping is under Pavlovian and not Skinnerian control was found using the omission procedure. In that procedure,&lt;ref&gt;see Sheffield, 1965; Williams &amp; Williams, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; food is normally scheduled for delivery following each presentation of a stimulus (often a flash of light), except in cases in which the animal actually performs a consummatory response to the stimulus, in which case food is withheld. Here, if the behavior were under instrumental control, the animal would stop attempting to consume the stimulus, as that behaviour is followed by the withholding of food. But, animals persist in attempting to consume the conditioned stimulus for thousands of trials&lt;ref&gt;Killeen, Peter R. (2003). Complex dynamic processes in sign tracking with an omission contingency (negative automaintenance). ''Journal of Experimental Psychology.'' 29(1): 49-61&lt;/ref&gt; (a phenomenon known as '''negative automaintenance'''), unable to cease their behavioural response to the conditioned stimulus even when it prevents them from obtaining a reward.

In a [[religion|religious]] context, '''sin''' is an act of transgression against [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sin|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sin|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin can also be viewed as any thought or action that endangers the ideal relationship between an individual and [[God]]; or as any diversion from the perceived ideal order for human [[Life|living]]. In [[Jainism]], sin refers to anything that harms the possibility of the ''[[Jiva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (being) to attain ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (supreme emancipation). In [[Islamic ethics]], [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]). [[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] as a sin.

== Etymology ==
The word derives from "[[Old English]] ''syn(n)'', for original *''sunjō''. The stem may be related to that of Latin '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''sons'', ''sont-is''' guilty. In Old English there are examples of the original general sense, ‘offence, wrong-doing, misdeed'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oed.com/view/Entry/180030?isAdvanced=false&amp;result=1&amp;rskey=9Bb3P3&amp; |title=sin |work=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate= 16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English Biblical terms translated as "sin" or "syn" from the Biblical Greek and Jewish terms sometimes originate from words in the latter languages denoting the act or state of missing the mark; the original sense of [[New Testament Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁμαρτία}} ''hamartia'' "sin", is failure, being in error, missing the mark, especially in spear throwing;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(marti/a|ἁμαρτία}}, {{LSJ|a(marta/nw|ἁμαρτάνω|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish views on sin|Hebrew ''hata'' "sin"]] originates in [[archery]] and literally refers to missing the "gold" at the centre of a target, but hitting the target, i.e. error.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; "To sin" has been defined from a Greek [[Bible concordance|concordance]] as "to miss the mark".&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/hamartia.html "Hamartia,"] ''The NAS New Testament Greek Lexicon''.&lt;br/&gt;
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] eventually (after the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian controversy]]) defined sin as a hardened heart, a loss of love for God, a disposition of the heart to depart from God because of inordinate self-love (see Augustine ''On Grace and Free Will'' in ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', trans. P. Holmes, vol. 5, 30-31 [14-15]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bahá'í ===
{{Anchor| Bahá'í faith }}
{{Main|Bahá'í views on sin}}

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], humans are considered naturally good (perfect), fundamentally spiritual beings. Human beings were created because of God's immeasurable love. However, the Bahá'í teachings compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if turned away from the light of the sun (i.e. God), is incapable of receiving God's love.

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Buddhist views on sin}}

[[Buddhism]] believes in the principle of ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'', whereby [[Dukkha|suffering]] is the inevitable consequence of greed, anger, and delusion (known as the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|Three poisons]]).&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, "Three Poisons": "Greed, anger, and foolishness. The fundamental evils inherent in life that give rise to human suffering."&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no direct Buddhist equivalent of the Abrahamic concept of sin, wrongdoing is recognized in Buddhism. The concept of [[Buddhist ethics]] is [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] in nature and is not based upon duty towards any deity.
Karma means action, and in Buddhist context, motivation is the most important aspect of an action. Whether karma done with mind, body and/or speech is called 'good' or 'bad', depends on whether it would bring pleasant or unpleasant results to the person who does the action. 
One needs to purify negative karma [[Satipatthana Sutta|Four Satipatthanas]] to free oneself from obstacles to liberation from the vicious circle of rebirth. The purification reduces suffering and in the end one reaches [[Nirvana]], the ultimate purification by realizing selflessness or emptiness. An enlightened being is free of all the suffering and karmas, and will not be automatically born again.

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Forbidden fruit.jpg|thumb|A [[Sistine Chapel]] [[fresco]] depicts the [[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden|expulsion]] of [[Adam and Eve]] for [[Original sin|transgressing God's command]] not to eat [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].]]
{{Main|Hamartiology|Christian views on sin}}
{{See also|Christian views on the Old Covenant|Seven deadly sins}}
In the [[Old Testament]], some sins were [[Religion and capital punishment#Christianity|punishable by death]] in different forms, while most sins are forgiven by burnt offerings. [[Christians]] consider the [[Mosaic covenant|Old Covenant]] to be fulfilled by the [[The gospel|Gospel]].

In the [[New Testament]] the [[Atonement in Christianity|forgiveness of sin]] is effected through [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] and [[Repentance (Christianity)|repentance]] ([[Mark 1]]:15).&lt;ref&gt;Mark 1:15&lt;/ref&gt; Sin is [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiven]] when the sinner acknowledges, [[Confession (religion)#Christianity|confesses]], and repents for their sin as a part of believing in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmaus|first1=Michael|title=Dogma: The Church as Sacrament|date=1975|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-7425-3203-8|page=220,222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5oTziWXEKgC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sinner is expected to confess his sins to [[God in Christianity|God]] as a part of an ongoing relationship, which also includes [[Gratitude#Christian conceptions|giving thanks]] to God. The sinful person has never before been in a favorable relationship with God. When, as a part of the process of salvation, a person is forgiven, they enter into a [[Union with Christ|union with God]] which abides forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willmington|first1=H.L.|title=Willmington's Guide to the Bible|date=1981|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-8423-8804-4|page=725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeCN2cVnONYC&amp;pg=PA725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Epistle to the Romans]] [[Romans 6:23|6:23]], it is mentioned that "the wages of sin is death", which is commonly interpreted as, if one repents for his sins, such person will inherit [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romans 6:23|url=https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm|website=Biblehub|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish Christianity]], sin is believed to alienate the sinner from God even though He has extreme [[Agape|love for mankind]]. It has damaged and completely severed the relationship of humanity to God. That relationship can only be restored through acceptance of Jesus Christ and his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death on the cross]] as a [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfactory sacrifice]] for the sins of humanity. Humanity was [[Destiny#Religion|destined]] for life with God when [[Adam]] disobeyed God. The Bible in [[John 3:16]] says "For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting."

In [[Eastern Christianity]], sin is viewed in terms of its effects on relationships, both among people and likewise between people and God. Also as in Jewish Christianity, Sin is likewise seen as [[Fall of man|the refusal]] to follow [[Will of God|God's plan]] and the desire to be "like God" (as stated in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:5) and thus in direct opposition to God's will (see the account of [[Adam and Eve]] in Genesis).

{{Anchor|Original sin}}
[[Original sin]] is a Western concept that states that sin entered the human world through [[Adam and Eve]]'s sin in the [[Garden of Eden]] and that human beings have since lived with the consequences of this first sin.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11312a.htm|title=Original Sin|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1 February 1911 |accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|The serpent]] who beguiled [[Eve]] to eat of [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] was punished by having it and its kind being made to crawl on the ground and God set an enmity between them and [[Genealogies of Genesis|Eve's descendants]] (Genesis 3:14-15). Eve was punished by the pains of childbirth and the sorrow of bringing about life that would eventually age, sicken and die (Genesis 3:16). The second part of the curse about being [[Fall of man#Subordination|subordinate to Adam]] originates from her creation from one of Adam's ribs to be his helper ([[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis 2:18-25]]); the curse now clarifies that she must now obey her [[Christian views on marriage|husband]] and desire only him. Adam was punished by having to work endlessly to feed himself and his family. The land would bring forth both thistles and thorns to be cleared and herbs and grain [[Religion and agriculture|to be planted, nurtured, and harvested]]. The second part of the curse about his mortality is from his origin as red clay - he is from the land and he and his descendants would return to it when [[Christian burial|buried]] after death. When Adam's son [[Cain and Abel|Cain slew his brother Abel]], he introduced murder into the world (Genesis 4:8-10). For his punishment, God banished him as a fugitive, but first [[Curse and mark of Cain|marked him]] with a sign that would protect him and his descendants from harm (Genesis 4:11-16).

One concept of sin deals with things that exist on Earth, but not in [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]]. Food, for example, while a necessary good for the (health of the [[Temporality|temporal]]) body, is not of ([[eternity|eternal]]) transcendental living and therefore its ''excessive'' [[Gluttony|savoring]] is considered a sin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;Hanegraaff, Hank. ''The Bible Answer Book'' pp. 18-21. {{ISBN|0-8499-9544-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unforgivable sin (or [[eternal sin]]) is a sin that can never be forgiven;
Matthew 12:30-32 :
" &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; And Therefore I say to you: Every sin and [[Blasphemy#Christianity|blasphemy]] shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven. &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; And whosoever shall speak a word against the [[Son of man]], it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the [[Holy Ghost]], it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come."

In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christianity sins are classified into grave sins called [[mortal sin]]s and less serious sins called [[venial sin]]. Mortal sins cause one to lose salvation unless the sinner repents and venial sins require some sort of penance either on Earth or in [[Purgatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 1472|location=The Vatican|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1472.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus was said to have paid for the complete mass of sins past, present, and to come in future. Even inevitable sin is said to have already been cleansed.

The [[Lamb of God]] was and is God himself and is therefore sinless. In the Old Testament, [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 16:21 states that ‘the laying on of hands’ was the action that the High Priest [[Aaron]] was ordered to do yearly by God to take sins of Israel's nation onto a [[sacrificial lamb|spotless young lamb]].

=== Hinduism ===
&lt;!--Section was previously blanked by an IP: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sin&amp;diff=391608941&amp;oldid=391538998 --&gt;
In [[Hinduism]], the term ''sin'' (''{{IAST|pāpa}}'' in [[Sanskrit]]) is often used to describe actions that create negative [[Karma]] by violating moral and ethical codes, which automatically brings negative consequences. This is somewhat  similar to Abrahamic sin in the sense that pāpa is considered a crime against the laws of God, which is known as (1) [[Dharma]], or moral order, and (2) one's own self, but another term ''aparadha'' is used for grave offences. The term papa cannot be taken however, in literal sense as that of a sin. This is because there is no consensus regarding the nature of ultimate reality or God in Hinduism. Only, the vedanta school being unambiguously theistic, whereas no anthropomorphic God exists in the rest five schools namely Samkhya, Nyaya Yoga, Vaishashikha, and  Purva-Mimansa . The term  ''papa'' however in the strictest sense refers to actions which bring about wrong/unfavourable consequences, not relating to a specific divine will in the absolute sense. To conclude, considering a  lack of consensus  regarding the nature of ultimate reality in Hinduism, it can be considered that ''papa'' has lesser insistence on God for it be translated as Sin, and that there is no exact equivalent to Sin in Hinduism.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Islamic views on sin}}

In [[Islamic ethics]], [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2211|work=Sin|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic terms for sin include ''dhanb'' and ''khaṭīʾa'', which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; ''khiṭʾ'', which means simply a sin; and ''ithm'', which is used for grave sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Wensinck, A. J. | year= 2012 | title=K̲h̲aṭīʾa |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2214-871X_ei1_SIM_4141|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the word for sin is the Sanskrit word पाप (''paap''), which is the antithesis of पुण्य (''punya'') meaning merit. A ''[[Jiva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (a being) acquires sin based on its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], if it hurts anyone, causes someone to hurt anyone, or commends hurting anyone by thought, speech or action. Anyone, here, refers to literally any living organism, but not limited to human beings.

No ''jiva'' can achieve ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (ultimate emancipation) without ceasing to accumulate karma and shedding off the already accumulated karma entirely. A ''jiva'' accumulates karma if it resorts to violence, non-chastity, falsehood, stealing, and possessiveness. A ''jiva'' ceases to accumulate karma if he resorts to the golden trio of ''samyak gyan'' (right knowledge), ''samyak darshan'' (right sight) and ''samyak charitra'' (right character). A ''jiva'' begins to shed off the accumulated karma by resorting to penance, repentance, vows and by exterminating foes of lust, anger, attachment, aversion, ignorance and fallacy.

If a ''jiva'' does not give up sin, his karma will keep accumulating and no sin can be absolved without getting its fruit or repenting for it. Thus such a ''jiva'' is bound to remain in the worldly cycle of constant [[reincarnation]], wherein it will keep taking rebirths, into any of the four broad types of living organisms, depending on the magnitude and nature of karma accumulated in previous birth(s). The four types are ''dev'' (beings of heaven, including deities), ''manushya'' (human), ''tiryanch'' (plants, animals, insects, etc.) and ''naarki'' (beings of hell). 

During this cycle of getting born and dying for infinity, the ''jiva'' will have to then live the life of the organism he is and while living it, the ''jiva'' will again perform more karma. This will again lead to rebirth and again performing more karma. Thus, the cycle continues.

It is important to note that Jains believe that for complete liberation, not only the "sinful karma" but even the "meritorious karma" needs to be shed off. This means that a jiva can truly attain moksha, only if the soul is completely and absolutely pure and devoid of any accumulation. For instance, sins may cause the ''jiva'' to be reborn, inter alia, in hell and merits may cause it to be reborn in heaven. But heaven, like hell is a part of worldly cycle of reincarnation and not supreme moksha of the soul. Thus, if a person hypothetically keeps performing only and exclusively good deeds in his life, he may still not attain ''moksha'', because he has not yet shed off previously accumulated sins through repentance and knowledge.

Jains believe that only a human ''jiva'' has the capacity and the will to attain ''moksha''. Hence the ''jiva'' should use this extremely rare opportunity of being born as a human to walk on the path that brings him closer to ''moksha''. In fact, Jains take the concept of avoiding sin so seriously that not only are they completely [[vegetarian]] but some devout Jains also abstain from eating underground grown food like potatoes, onions, etc. to avoid killing small organisms. Most of the Jains are also nonalcoholics and eat before sunset each day.

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jewish views on sin|Golden mean (philosophy)#Judaism}}
Mainstream [[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] of the [[Mosaic law]] for [[Jews]], or the seven [[Noahide laws]] for [[Gentiles]] as a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Seven_Noahide_Laws.html|title= The Seven Noachide Laws - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher= Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate= 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism teaches that all humans are inclined to sin from birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Rosenberg|first1= A. J.|last2= [[Rashi]]|title= The Book of Genesis (Genesis 8:21 with [[Rashi]]'s commentary)|date= 1969|publisher= The Judaica Press|location= New York|isbn= 1880582082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins with willful intent go without consequence. Unwillful violations of the [[613 commandments|mitzvot]] (without negligence) do not count as sins. "Sins by error" are considered as less severe sins. When the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer [[Karbanot|sacrifices]] for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of ''[[korbanot]]'' is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, ''korbanot'' only expiate such "sins by error", that is, sins committed because a person forgot or did not know that this thing was a sin. In some circumstances, lack of knowledge is considered close to deliberate intent. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress, and for the most part, ''korbanot'' cannot atone for a deliberate sin. In addition, ''korbanot'' have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who suffered harm through the violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html|title= Sacrifices and Offerings (Karbanot)|publisher= Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate= 1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rabbimichaelskobac"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/answers/jewish-polemics/texts/scriptural-studies/leviticus-1711/|title= Leviticus 17:11|author= Rabbi Michael Skobac|publisher= Jews for Judaism|accessdate= 1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism teaches that all willful sin has consequences. The completely righteous suffer for their sins (by humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them) in this world and receive their reward in the world to come. The in-between (not completely righteous or completely wicked), suffer for and repent their sins after death and thereafter join the righteous. The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave ''[[Gehenna|gehinnom]]'', because they do not or cannot repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this.&lt;ref name="rabbimichaelskobac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''Soil production function''' refers to the rate of [[bedrock]] [[weathering]] into [[soil]] as a function of soil thickness. 

A general model suggested that the rate of physical [[weathering]] of bedrock (de/dt) can be represented as an exponential decline with soil thickness:

&lt;math&gt; de/dt = P_0 \exp{[-k h]}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is soil thickness [m], ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' [mm/year] is the potential (or maximum) weathering rate of bedrock and ''k'' [m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;] is an empirical constant.&lt;ref&gt;Heimsath, A.M., Dietrich, W.E., Nishiizumi, K., Finkel, R.C., 1997. The soil production function and landscape equilibrium. Nature 388 (6640), 358–361&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reduction of weathering rate with thickening of soil is related to the exponential decrease of [[temperature]] amplitude with increasing depth below the soil surface, and also the exponential decrease in average water penetration (for freely-drained soils). Parameters ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k'' are related to the [[climate]] and type of parent materials. {{Harvtxt|Heimsath|Dietrich|Nishiizumi|Finkel|1997}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heimsath |first=A. M. |last2=Dietrich |first2=W. E. |last3=Nishiizumi |first3=K. |last4=Finkel |first4=R. C. |author-link2=William E. Dietrich|year=1997 |title=The soil production function and landscape equilibrium |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=388 |issue=6640 |pages=358–361 |doi=10.1038/41056 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;found the value of ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ranges from 0.08 to 2.0 mm/yr for sites in [[Northern California]], and 0.05–0.14 mm/yr for sites in Southeastern [[Australia]]. Meanwhile values of ''k'' do not vary significantly, ranging from 2 to 4 m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

A number of [[landscape evolution model]]s have adopted the so-called ''humped'' model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serc.carleton.edu/42696 The humped soil production function] Arjun Heimsath. Arizona State University, Earth and Space Exploration  &lt;/ref&gt; This model dates back to [[Grove Karl Gilbert|G.K. Gilbert's]] ''Report on the Geology of the Henry Mountains'' (1877). Gilbert reasoned that the [[weathering]] of bedrock was fastest under an intermediate thickness of soil and slower under exposed bedrock or under thick mantled soil. This is because chemical [[weathering]] requires the presence of water. Under thin soil or exposed bedrock water tends to run off, reducing the chance of the decomposition of bedrock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3749">'''Sonochromatism''' or '''sonochromatopsia''' ([[Latin]]: {{nowrap|''sono-'', (sound) +}} [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{nowrap|''chromat-'' (colour) +}} Greek: ''-opsia'' (seeing)) is a neurological phenomenon in which colours are perceived as sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, F.C [http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20110301/54121537968/nace-una-fundacion-dedicada-a-convertir-humanos-en-ciborgs.html "Nace una fundacion dedicada a convertir humanos en ciborgs"], ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', 1 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is created by the union between a brain and a colour-to-sound software or chip. People who report such experiences are known as sonochromats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ar.neuro.fchampalimaud.org/speaker/neil-harbisson "Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323224518/http://ar.neuro.fchampalimaud.org/speaker/neil-harbisson |date=2014-03-23 }}, ''[[Champalimaud Foundation]] Magazine'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Neil Harbisson to differentiate his experience of colour from people with chromesthesia or colour-to-sound synesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Acheson, Clare. [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/clare-acheson/technological-body-modification_b_2772212.html "Technological Body Modification: In Pursuit of Singularity"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 27 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between chromesthesia and sonochromatism==

The main difference between [[chromesthesia]] and sonochromatism is that sonochromatism is not the union between two existing senses, instead, it is the creation of a new sense.&lt;ref&gt;Editor, [http://www.firstpost.com/topic/place/barcelona-the-sonochromatism-of-neil-harbisson-the-cyborg-artist-b-a-video-8c4kKySDUBk-1142-35.html "The Sonochromatism of Neil Harbisson"], [[First Post (India)]], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Sonochromats do not necessarily sense colour as a visual experience and are able to perceive colours outside the limits of human vision such as infrareds and ultraviolets. Their experience of colour is not involuntary, instead, it is caused by voluntary action such as a colour-to-sound chip implant or constant use of an [[eyeborg]]. The sounds perceived for each colour are not subjective, they are objective and they are related to the light frequencies of colour.&lt;ref&gt;Cáceres, Marta. [http://www.rtve.es/mediateca/videos/20091021/repor---yo-robot/609619.shtml?s1=programas&amp;s2=informativos&amp;s3=repor&amp;s4= "Yo Robot"], Report ''[[Televisión Española]]'', 21 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harbisson's Sonochromatic Scales==

Implantable colour-to-sound chips, software, mobile apps and [[cyborg antenna]]s use Harbisson's Sonochromatic Scales as a standard transposition of colour frequencies to sound frequencies.

The '''Sonochromatic Music Scale''' is a microtonal and [[logarithm]]ic scale with 360 notes in an octave. Each note corresponds to a specific degree of the [[color wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/27743/june-2008-table-of-contents/] ''Modern Painters, The International Contemporary Art Magazine'' pp 70–73 ([[New York City]], June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbisson's '''Pure Sonochromatic Scale''' is a non-logarithmic scale based on the [[:wikt:transpose|transposition]] of light frequencies to sound frequencies. The scale includes infrareds and ultraviolets, discards colour as being part of a colour wheel and ignores musical/logarithmic perception so it can overstep the limits of human perception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/27743/june-2008-table-of-contents/] ''Modern Painters, The International Contemporary Art Magazine'' pp 70–73 ([[New York City]], June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34786">'''Stimulus modality''', also called '''sensory modality''', is one aspect of a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] or what is perceived after a stimulus. For example, the temperature modality  is registered after heat or cold stimulate a receptor. Some sensory modalities include: [[light]], [[sound]], [[temperature]], [[taste]], [[pressure]], and [[Olfaction|smell]]. The type and location of the [[sensory receptor]] activated by the stimulus plays the primary role in coding the sensation. All sensory modalities work together to heighten stimuli sensation when necessary.&lt;ref name = "small"/&gt;

== Multimodal perception ==
Multimodal perception is the ability of the mammalian nervous system to combine all of the different inputs of the [[sensory nervous system]] to result in an enhanced detection or identification of a particular stimulus. Combinations of all sensory modalities are done in cases where a single sensory modality results in ambiguous and incomplete result.&lt;ref name = "small"/&gt;

[[File:Multisensory.jpg|thumb|Location of visual, auditory and somatosensory perception in the superior colliculus of the brain. Overlapping of these systems creates multisensory space.]]

Integration of all sensory modalities occurs when multimodal neurons receive sensory information which overlaps with different modalities. Multimodal neurons are found in the superior colliculus;&lt;ref name = "small"/&gt; they respond to the versatility of various sensory inputs. The multimodal neurons lead to change of behavior and assist in analyzing behavior responses to certain stimulus.&lt;ref name = "small"/&gt; Information from two or more [[sense]]s is encountered. Multimodal perception is not limited to one area of the brain: many brain regions are activated when sensory information is perceived from the environment.&lt;ref name = "ivry"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ivry|first=Richard|title=Cognitive Neuroscience:  The biology of the mind|year=2009|publisher=W.W. Norton and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-92795-5|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the hypothesis of having a centralized multisensory region is receiving continually more speculation, as several regions previously uninvestigated are now considered multimodal. The reasons behind this are currently being investigated by several research groups, but it is now understood to approach these issues from a decentralized theoretical perspective. Moreover, several labs using invertebrate model organisms will provide invaluable information to the community as these are more easily studied and are considered to have decentralized nervous systems.

===Lip reading===
[[Lip reading]] is a multimodal process for humans.&lt;ref name = "ivry"/&gt; By watching movements of lips and face, humans get conditioned and practice lip reading.&lt;ref name = "ivry"/&gt; Silent lip reading activates the [[auditory cortex]].  When sounds are matched or mismatched with the movements of the lips, temporal sulcus of the left hemisphere becomes more active.&lt;ref name = "ivry"/&gt;

===Integration effect===
Multimodal [[perception]] comes into effect when a unimodal stimulus fails to produce a response. Integration effect is applied when the brain detects weak unimodal signals and combines them to create a multimodal perception for the [[mammal]].  Integration effect is plausible when different stimuli are coincidental. This integration is depressed when multisensory information are not coincidentally presented.&lt;ref name = "ivry"/&gt;

===Polymodality===
''Polymodality'' is the feature of a single receptor of responding to multiple modalities, such as [[free nerve endings]] which can respond to temperature, mechanical stimuli (touch, pressure, stretch) or pain ([[nociception]]).

==Light modality==

[[File:Schematic diagram of the human eye en.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of the human eye.]]

===Description===
The stimulus modality for vision is light; the human eye is able to access only a limited section of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], between 380 and 760 [[nanometre]]s.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=J.P|author2=Wolfe, S.L. |author3=Hertz, P.E. |author4=Starr, C. |author5=Fenton, M. B. |author6=Addy, H. |author7=Denis, M. |author8=Haffie, T. |author9=Davey, K.   |title=Biology: Exploring the Diversity of Life, First Canadian Edition, Volume Three|year=2010|publisher=Nelson Education|isbn=0-17-650231-9|pages=833–840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific inhibitory responses that take place in the visual cortex help create a visual focus on a specific point rather than the entire surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yarbrough|first=Cathy|title=Brains response to visual stimuli helps us to focus on what we should see, rather than all there is to see|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-10/si-brt102105.php|work=EurekAlert!|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception===
To perceive a light stimulus, the [[eye]] must first refract the light so that it directly hits the [[retina]]. Refraction in the eye is completed through the combined efforts of the [[cornea]], [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]. The transduction of light into neural activity occurs via the [[photoreceptor cell]]s in the retina. When there is no light, [[Vitamin A]] in the body attaches itself to another molecule and becomes a protein. The entire structure consisting of the two molecules becomes a [[photopigment]]. When a particle of light hits the photoreceptors of the eye, the two molecules come apart from each other and a chain of chemical reactions occurs. The chemical reaction begins with the photoreceptor sending a message to a neuron called the [[bipolar cell]] through the use of an [[action potential]], or nerve impulse. Finally, a message is sent to the ganglion cell and then finally the brain.&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=N. R.|title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptation===
The eye is able to detect a visual stimulus when the [[photons]] (light packets) cause a photopigment molecule, primarily [[rhodopsin]], to come apart. Rhodopsin, which is usually pink, becomes bleached in the process. At high levels of light, photopigments are broken apart faster than can be regenerated. Because a low number of photopigments have been regenerated, the eyes are not sensitive to light. When entering a dark room after being in a well lit area, the eyes require time for a good quantity of rhodopsin to regenerate. As more time passes, there is a higher chance that the photons will split an unbleached photopigment because the rate of regeneration will have surpassed the rate of bleaching. This is called [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]].&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Colour stimuli===
Humans are able to see an array of colours because light in the visible spectrum is made up of different wavelengths (from 380 to 760&amp;nbsp;nm). Our ability to see in colour is due to three different [[cone cells]] in the retina, containing three different photopigments. The three cones are each specialized to best pick up a certain wavelength (420, 530 and 560&amp;nbsp;nm or roughly the colours blue, green and red). The brain is able to distinguish the wavelength and colour in the field of vision by figuring out which cone has been stimulated. The physical dimensions of colour include [[wavelength]], [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] and purity while the related perceptual dimensions include [[hue]], [[brightness]] and saturation.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

Primates are the only mammals with colour vision.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

The [[Trichromatic theory]] was proposed in 1802 by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]. According to Young, the human visual system is able to create any colour through the collection of information from the three cones. The system will put together the information and systematize a new colour based on the amount of each hue that has been detected.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Subliminal visual stimuli===
Some studies show that subliminal stimuli can affect attitude. In a 1992 study Krosnick, Betz, Jussim and Lynn conducted a study where participants were shown a series of slides in which different people were going through normal every day activities (i.e. going to the car, sitting in a restaurant). These slides were preceded by slides that caused either positive emotional arousal (i.e. bridal couple, a child with a Mickey Mouse doll) or negative emotional arousal (i.e. a bucket of snakes, a face on fire) for a period 13 [[milliseconds]] that participants consciously perceived as a sudden flash of light. None of the individuals were told of the subliminal images. The experiment found that during the questionnaire round, participants were more likely to assign positive personality traits to those in the pictures that were preceded by the positive subliminal images and negative personality traits to those in the pictures that were preceded by the negative subliminal images.&lt;ref name="KrosnickAndOthers"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = J. A.| last3 = Jussim | first2 = A. L.| last1 = Krosnick | first3 = L. J.| last2 = Betz | first4 = A.

===Tests===
Some common tests that measure visual health include [[visual acuity]] tests, refraction tests, [[visual field test]]s and colour vision tests. Visual acuity tests are the most common tests and they measure the ability to bring details into focus at different distances. Usually this test is conducted by having participants read a map of letters or symbols while one eye is covered. Refraction tests measure the eye's need for glasses or [[corrective lenses]]. This test is able to detect whether a person may be [[nearsighted]] or [[farsighted]]. These conditions occur when the light rays entering the eye are unable to converge on a single spot on the [[retina]]. Both [[refractive errors]] require corrective lenses in order to cure blurriness of vision. Visual field tests detect any gaps in peripheral vision. In healthy normal vision, an individual should be able to partially perceive objects to the left or right of their field of view using both eyes at one time. The center field of vision is seen in most detail. Colour vision tests are used to measure one's ability to distinguish colours. It is used to diagnose colour blindness. This test is also used as an important step in some job screening processes as the ability to see colour in such jobs may be crucial. Examples include military work or law enforcement.&lt;ref name="vision test"&gt;{{cite web|author=Healthwise Staff|title=Vision Tests|url=http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/vision-tests|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sound modality==

[[File:HumanEar.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the human ear.]]

===Description===
The stimulus modality for [[hearing]] is sound. Sound is created through changes in the pressure of the air. As an object vibrates, it compresses the surrounding molecules of air as it moves towards a given point and expands the molecules as it moves away from the point. Periodicity in sound waves is measured in [[hertz]]. Humans, on average, are able to detect sounds as pitched when they contain periodic or quasi-periodic variations that fall between the range of 30 to 20000 hertz.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Perception===
When there are vibrations in the air, the [[eardrum]] is stimulated. The eardrum collects these vibrations and sends them to receptor cells. The [[ossicles]] which are connected to the eardrum pass the vibrations to the fluid-filled [[cochlea]]. Once the vibrations reach the cochlea, the [[stirrup]] (part of the ossicles) puts pressure on the [[oval window]]. This opening allows the vibrations to move through the liquid in the cochlea where the receptive organ is able to sense it.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Pitch, loudness and timbre===
There are many different qualities in sound stimuli including [[loudness]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[timbre]].&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

The human ear is able to detect differences in pitch through the movement of auditory hair cells found on the [[basilar membrane]]. High frequency sounds will stimulate the auditory hair cells at the base of the basilar membrane while medium frequency sounds cause vibrations of auditory hair cells located at the middle of the basilar membrane. For frequencies that are lower than 200&amp;nbsp;Hz, the tip of the basilar membrane vibrates in sync with the sound waves. In turn, neurons are fired at the same rate as the vibrations. The brain is able to measure the vibrations and is then aware of any low frequency pitches.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

When a louder sound is heard, more hair cells are stimulated and the intensity of firing of [[axons]] in the [[cochlear nerve]] is increased. However, because the rate of firing also defines low pitch the brain has an alternate way of encoding for loudness of low frequency sounds. The number of hair cells that are stimulated is thought to communicate loudness in low pitch frequencies.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

Aside from pitch and loudness, another quality that distinguishes sound stimuli is timbre. Timbre allows us to hear the difference between two instruments that are playing at the same frequency and loudness, for example. When two simple tones are put together they create a complex tone. The simple tones of an instrument are called [[harmonics]] or [[overtones]]. Timbre is created by putting the harmonics together with the [[fundamental frequency]] (a sound's basic pitch). When a complex sound is heard, it causes different parts in the basilar membrane to become simultaneously stimulated and flex. In this way, different timbres can be distinguished.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

===Sound stimuli and human fetuses===
A number of studies have shown that a human fetus will respond to sound stimuli coming from the outside world.&lt;ref name=Sontang&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sontag | first1 = L. W. | title = Changes in the Rate of the Human Fetal Heart in Response to Vibratory Stimuli | doi = 10.1001/archpedi.1936.01970150087006 | journal = Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 583–589 | year = 1936 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Forbes | first1 = H. S. | last2 = Forbes | first2 = H. B. | doi = 10.1037/h0071872 | title = Fetal sense reaction: Hearing | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 353–355 | year = 1927 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of 214 tests conducted on 7 pregnant women, a reliable increase in fetal movement was detected in the minute directly following the application of a sound stimulus to the abdomen of the mother with a frequency of 120 per second.&lt;ref name=Sontang /&gt;

===Tests===
[[Hearing tests]] are administered to ensure optimal function of the ear and to observe whether or not sound stimuli is entering the ear drum and reaching the brain as should be. The most common hearing tests require the spoken response to words or [[Pitch (music)|tones]]. Some hearing tests include the whispered speech test, [[pure tone audiometry]], the tuning fork test, speech reception and word recognition tests, [[otoacoustic emission]]s (OAE) test and [[auditory brainstem response]] (ABR) test.&lt;ref name="hearing test"&gt;{{cite web|author=Healthwise Staff|title=Hearing Tests|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hearing-tests?|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a whispered speech test, the participant is asked to cover the opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind the participant and say a series of words in a soft whisper. The participant is then asked to repeat what is heard. If the participant is unable to distinguish the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until the participant is able to understand what is being said. The other ear is then tested.&lt;ref name="hearing test" /&gt;

In [[pure tone audiometry]], an [[audiometer]] is used to play a series of tones using headphones. The participants listen to the tones which will vary in pitch and loudness. The test will play with the volume controls and the participant is asked to signal when he or she can no longer hear the tone being played. The testing is completed after listening to a range of pitches. Each ear is tested individually.&lt;ref name="hearing test" /&gt;

During the tuning fork test, the tester will have the [[tuning fork]] vibrate so that it makes a sound. The tuning fork is placed in a specific place around the participant and hearing is observed. In some instances, individuals will show trouble hearing in places such as behind the ear.&lt;ref name="hearing test" /&gt;

Speech recognition and word recognition tests measure how well an individual can hear normal day-to-day conversation. The participant is told to repeat conversation being spoken at different volumes. The spondee threshold test is a related test that detects the loudness at which the participant is able to repeat half of a list of two syllable words or [[spondee (grammar)|spondees]].&lt;ref name="hearing test" /&gt;

[[Otoacoustic emission]]s test (OAE) and [[auditory brainstem response]] (ABR) testing measures the brain's response to sounds. The OAE measures hearing of newborns by placing an emitting sound into the baby's ear through a probe. A microphone placed in the baby's [[ear canal]] will pick up the inner ear's response to sound stimulation and allows for observation. The ABR, also known as the [[Brainstem auditory evoked potentials|brainstem auditory evoked response]] (BAER) test or auditory brainstem evoked potential (ABEP) test measure the brain's response to clicking sounds sent through headphones. [[Electrodes]] on the scalp and earlobes record a graph of the response.&lt;ref name="hearing test" /&gt;

==Taste modality==

===Description===

==== Taste modality in mammals ====
In mammals, taste stimuli are encountered by axonless receptor cells located in [[taste bud]]s on the tongue and
[[pharynx]]. Receptor cells disseminate onto different [[neuron]]s and convey the message of a particular taste in a single medullar nucleus. This [[pheromone]] detection system deals with taste stimuli.  The pheromone detection system is distinct from the normal taste system, and is designed like the [[olfactory system]].&lt;ref name = "stocker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stocker|first=Reinhard F|title=Taste Perception: Drosophila – A Model of Good Taste|journal=Current Biology|date=1 July 2004|volume=14|issue=14|pages=R560–R561|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.07.011|pmid=15268874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taste modality in flies and mammals ====
In insect and mammalian taste, receptor cells changes into attractive or aversive stimulus.  The number of taste receptors in a mammalian [[tongue]] and on the tongue of the fly ([[Labellum (insect anatomy)|labellum]]) is same in amount.  Most of the receptors are dedicated to detect repulsive [[ligand]].&lt;ref name = "stocker"/&gt;

=== Perception ===
Perceptions of taste is generated by the following sensory afferents: [[gustatory]], [[olfactory]], and [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]] fibers.  Taste perception is created by combining multiple sensory inputs. Different modalities help determine perception of taste especially when attention is drawn to particular sensory characteristics which is different from taste.&lt;ref name = "small"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=Dana M.|author2=Prescott, John |title=Odor/taste integration and the perception of flavor|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=19 July 2005|volume=166|issue=3–4|pages=345–357|doi=10.1007/s00221-005-2376-9 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n348v0386g164un6/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration of taste and smell modality===
Impression of both taste and smell occurs in heteromodal regions of the [[limbic system|limbic]] and paralimbic brain. Taste–odor
integration occurs at earlier stages of processing. By life experience, factors such as the physiological significance of a given stimulus is perceived. Learning and affective processing are the primary functions of limbic and paralimbic brain. Taste perception is a combination of oral [[somatosensation]] and retronasal olfaction.&lt;ref name = "small"/&gt;

===Pleasure of food===
The sensation of taste come from oral somatosensory stimulation and with retronasal olfaction. The perceived pleasure encountered when eating and drinking is influenced by:
# sensory features, such as taste quality
# experience, such as prior exposure to taste-odor mixtures
# internal state
# cognitive context, such as information about brand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=SMALL|first=D. M.|author2=BENDER, G. |author3=VELDHUIZEN, M. G. |author4=RUDENGA, K. |author5=NACHTIGAL, D. |author6= FELSTED, J. |title=The Role of the Human Orbitofrontal Cortex in Taste and Flavor Processing|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=10 September 2007|volume=1121|issue=1|pages=136–151|doi=10.1196/annals.1401.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature modality==

===Description===

Temperature modality excites or elicits a symptom through cold or hot temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temperature modality|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/temperature+modality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different mammalian species have different temperature modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bodenheimer|first=F. S|title=Observations on Rodents in Herter's Temperature Gradient|journal=Physiological Zoology|jstor=30161738|volume=14|pages=186–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception===

The [[cutaneous]] somatosensory system detects changes in temperature.  The perception begins when thermal stimuli from a [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] set-point excite temperature specific sensory nerves in the skin. Then with the help of sensing range, specific thermosensory fibers respond to warmth and to cold. Then specific cutaneous cold and warm receptors conduct units that exhibit a discharge at constant skin temperature.&lt;ref name = "mcglone"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGlone|first=Francis|author2=Reilly, David |title=The cutaneous sensory system|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=34|issue=2|pages=148–159|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nerve fibers for temperature===

Warm and cold sensitive nerve fibers differ in structure and function.  The cold-sensitive and warm-sensitive nerve fibers are underneath the skin surface.  Terminals of each temperature-sensitive fiber do not branch away to different organs in the body. They form a small sensitive point which are unique from neighboring fibers. Skin used by the single receptor ending of a temperature-sensitive nerve fiber is small.  There are 20 cold points per square centimeter in the lips, 4 in the finger, and less than 1 cold point per square centimeter in trunk areas.  There are 5 times as many cold sensitive points as warm sensitive points.&lt;ref name = "mcglone"/&gt;

==Pressure modality==

===Description===
The sense of touch, or tactile perception, is what allows organisms to feel the world around them.  The environment acts as an external stimulus, and tactile perception is the act of passively exploring the world to simply sense it.  To make sense of the stimuli, an organism will undergo active exploration, or [[haptic perception]], by moving their hands or other areas with environment-skin contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reuter E. |author2=Voelcker-Rehage C. |author3=Vieluf S. |author4=Godde B. | year = 2012 | title = Touch perception throughout working life: Effects of age and expertise | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 216 | issue = 2| pages = 287–297 | doi = 10.1007/s00221-011-2931-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This will give a sense of what is being perceived, and give information about size, shape, weight, temperature, and material.  Tactile stimulation can be direct in the form of bodily contact, or indirect through the use of a tool or probe.  Direct and indirect send different types messages to the brain, but both provide information regarding roughness, hardness, stickiness, and warmth.  The use of a probe elicits a response based on the vibrations in the instrument rather than direct environmental information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yoshioka T. |author2=Bensmaïa S. |author3=Craig J. |author4=Hsiao S. | year = 2007 | title = Texture perception through direct and indirect touch: An analysis of perceptual space for tactile textures in two modes of exploration | url = | journal = Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research | volume = 24 | issue = 1-2| pages = 53–70 | doi = 10.1080/08990220701318163 |pmc=2635116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tactual perception gives information regarding [[cutaneous]] stimuli (pressure, vibration, and temperature), [[kinaesthetic]] stimuli (limb movement), and [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] stimuli (position of the body).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bergmann Tiest W | year = 2010 | title = Tactual perception of material properties | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 50 | issue = 24| pages = 2775–2782 | doi = 10.1016/j.visres.2010.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   There are varying degrees of tactual sensitivity and thresholds, both between individuals and between different time periods in an individual's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Angier R | year = 1912 | title = Tactual and kinæsthetic space | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 9 | issue = 7| pages = 255–257 | doi = 10.1037/h0073444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been observed that individuals have differing levels of tactile sensitivity between each hand.  This may be due to callouses forming on the skin of the most used hand, creating a buffer between the stimulus and the receptor.  Alternately, the difference in sensitivity may be due to a difference in the cerebral functions or ability of the [[left hemisphere|left]] and [[right hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weinstein S. |author2=Sersen E. | year = 1961 | title = Tactual sensitivity as a function of handedness and laterality | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume = 54 | issue = 6| pages = 665–669 | doi = 10.1037/h0044145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tests have also shown that deaf children have a greater degree of tactile sensitivity than that of children with normal hearing ability, and that girls generally have a greater degree of sensitivity than that of boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chakravarty A | year = 1968 | title = Influence of tactual sensitivity on tactual localization, particularly of deaf children | url = | journal = Journal of General Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 219–221 | doi = 10.1080/00221309.1968.9710435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tactile information is often used as additional stimuli to resolve a sensory ambiguity.  For example, a surface can be seen as rough, but this inference can only be proven through touching the material.  When sensory information from each modality involved corresponds, the ambiguity is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelace, C. (2000). Feature binding across sense modalities: Visual and tactual interactions. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 61(4-B), 2251. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/619577012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somatosensory information===
Touch messages, in comparison to other sensory stimuli, have a large distance to travel to get to the brain.  Tactual perception is achieved through the response of [[mechanoreceptor]]s in the skin that detect physical stimuli.  The response from a mechanoreceptor detecting pressure can be experienced as a touch, discomfort, or pain, and the force of pressure is measured by a pressure algometer and a dolorimeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xiong S. |author2=Goonetilleke R. |author3=Jiang Z. | year = 2011 | title = Pressure thresholds of the human foot: Measurement reliability and effects of stimulus characteristics | url = | journal = Ergonomics | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 282–293 | doi = 10.1080/00140139.2011.552736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mechanoreceptors are situated in highly vascularized skin, and appear in both glabrous and hairy skin.  Each mechanoreceptor is tuned to a different sensitivity, and will fire its action potential only when there is enough energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pawson L. |author2=Pack A. |author3=Checkosky C. |author4=Bolanowski S. | year = 2008 | title = Mesenteric and tactile pacinian corpuscles are anatomically and physiologically comparable | url = | journal = Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 194–206 | doi = 10.1080/08990220802377571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The axons of these single tactile receptors will converge into a single nerve trunk, and the signal is then sent to the spinal cord where the message makes its way to the somatosensory systems in the brain.

====Mechanoreceptors====

There are four types of mechanoreceptors: Meissner corpuscles and merkel cell neurite complexes, located between the epidermis and dermis, and [[Pacinian]] corpuscles and [[Ruffini ending]]s, located deep within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.  Mechanoreceptors are classified in terms of their adaptation rate and the size of their receptive field.  Specific mechanoreceptors and their functions include:&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;Wolfe, J., Kluender, K., &amp; Levi, D. (2009). Sensation and perception. (2 ed.). Sunderland: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Thermoreceptors that detect changes in skin temperature.
* Kinesthetic receptors detect our movements and the position of our limbs.
* Nociceptors that have bare nerve endings that detect tissue damage and give the sensation of pain.

===Tests===
A common test used to measure the sensitivity of a person to tactile stimuli is measuring their two-point touch threshold.  This is the smallest separation of two points at which two distinct points of contact can be sensed rather than one.  Different parts of the body have different degrees of tactile acuity, with extremities such as the fingers, face, and toes being the most sensitive.  When two distinct points are perceived, it means that your brain receives two different signals.  The differences of acuity for different parts of the body are the result of differences in the concentration of receptors.&lt;ref name="Wolfe" /&gt;

===Use in clinical psychology===
Tactile stimulation is used in clinical psychology through the method of prompting.  Prompting is the use of a set of instructions designed to guide a participant through learning a behavior.  A physical prompt involves stimulation in the form of physically guided behavior in the appropriate situation and environment.  The physical stimulus perceived through prompting is similar to the physical stimulus that would be experienced in a real-world situation, and is makes the target behavior more likely in a real situation.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. (2012). Behavior modification: principles and procedures. (5 ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smell modality==

===Sensation===

The sense of smell is called [[olfaction]].  All materials constantly shed molecules, which float into the nose or are sucked in through breathing.  Inside the nasal chambers is the [[neuroepithelium]], a lining deep within the nostrils that contains the receptors responsible for detecting molecules that are small enough to smell.  These receptor neurons then synapse at the olfactory cranial nerve (CN I), which sends the information to the olfactory bulbs in the brain for initial processing.  The signal is then sent to the remaining olfactory cortex for more complex processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Doty R | year = 2001 | title = Olfaction | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 423–452 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Odors===
An olfactory sensation is called an [[odor]].  For a molecule to trigger olfactory receptor neurons, it must have specific properties.  The molecule must be:
# volatile (able to float through the air)
# small (less than 5.8 x 10-22&amp;nbsp;grams)
# [[hydrophobic]] (repellant to water)

However, humans do not process the smell of various common molecules such as those present in the air.

Our olfactory ability can vary due to different conditions.  For example, our olfactory detection thresholds can change due to molecules with differing lengths of carbon chains.  A molecule with a longer carbon chain is easier to detect, and has a lower detection threshold.  Additionally, women generally have lower olfactory thresholds than men, and this effect is magnified during a woman's [[ovulatory period]].&lt;ref name="Wolfe" /&gt; People can sometimes experience a hallucination of smell, as in the case of [[phantosmia]].

===Interaction with other modalities===
Olfaction interacts with other sensory modalities in significant ways.  The strongest interaction is that of olfaction with taste.  Studies have shown that an odor coupled with a taste increases the perceived intensity of the taste, and that an absence of a corresponding smell decreases the perceived intensity of a taste.  The olfactory stimulation can occur before or during the episode of taste stimulation.  The dual perception of the stimulus produces an interaction that facilitates association of the experience through an additive neural response and memorization of the stimulus.  This association can also be made between olfactory and tactile stimuli during the act of swallowing.  In each case, temporal synchrony is important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Labbe D. |author2=Gilbert F. |author3=Martin N. | year = 2008 | title = Impact of olfaction on taste, trigeminal, and texture perceptions | url = | journal = Chemosensory Perception | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 217–226 | doi = 10.1007/s12078-008-9029-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests===
A common [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] test of olfactory ability is the triangle test.  In this test, the participant is given three odors to smell.  Of these three odors, two are the same and one is different, and the participant must choose which odor is the unique one.  To test the sensitivity of olfaction, the staircase method is often used.  In this method, the odor's concentration is increased until the participant is able to sense it, and subsequently decreased until the participant reports no sensation.&lt;ref name="Wolfe" /&gt;

In [[philosophy]], a '''supertask''' is a [[countable set|countably infinite]] sequence of operations that occur sequentially within a finite interval of time.&lt;ref&gt;This concept relates to [[cardinal number]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; Supertasks are called "hypertasks" when the number of operations becomes [[uncountable set|uncountably infinite]]. A hypertask that includes one operation for each ordinal number is called an "ultratask".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Al-Dhalimy, Haidar |author2=Geyer, Charles |journal=The Review of Symbolic Logic |title=Surreal Time and Ultratasks |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-symbolic-logic/ |doi=10.1017/S1755020316000289 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=836–847 |date=December 2016 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=25 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''supertask'' was coined by the philosopher [[James F. Thomson (philosopher)|James F. Thomson]], who devised [[Thomson's lamp]]. The term ''hypertask'' derives from Clark and Read in their paper of that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Clark, Peter |author2=Read, Stephen |journal=Synthese |title=Hypertasks |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l632938j47u80732/ |doi=10.1007/BF00485061 |issn=1573-0964 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=387–390 |date=December 1984 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |accessdate=12 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Zeno===
====Motion====
The origin of the interest in supertasks is normally attributed to [[Zeno of Elea]]. Zeno claimed that [[Zeno's paradoxes|motion was impossible]]. He argued as follows: suppose our burgeoning "mover", Achilles say, wishes to move from A to B. To achieve this he must traverse half the distance from A to B. To get from the midpoint of AB to B Achilles must traverse half ''this'' distance, and so on and so forth. However many times he performs one of these "traversing" tasks there is another one left for him to do before he arrives at B. Thus it follows, according to Zeno, that motion (travelling a non-zero distance in finite time) is a supertask. Zeno further argues that supertasks are not possible (how can this sequence be completed if for each traversing there is another one to come?). It follows that motion is impossible.

Zeno's argument takes the following form:

# Motion is a supertask, because the completion of motion over any set distance involves an infinite number of steps
# Supertasks are impossible
# Therefore, motion is impossible

Most subsequent philosophers reject Zeno's bold conclusion in favor of common sense. Instead they turn his argument on its head (assuming it's valid) and take it as a [[Reductio ad absurdum|proof by contradiction]] where the possibility of motion is taken for granted. They accept the possibility of motion and apply [[modus tollens]] ([[contrapositive]]) to Zeno's argument to reach the conclusion that either motion is not a supertask or not all supertasks are impossible.

====Achilles and the tortoise====

Zeno himself also discusses the notion of what he calls "[[Achilles]] and the tortoise". Suppose that Achilles is the fastest runner, and moves at a speed of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. Achilles chases a tortoise, an animal renowned for being slow, that moves at 0.1&amp;nbsp;m/s. However, the tortoise starts 0.9 metres ahead. Common sense seems to decree that Achilles will catch up with the tortoise after exactly 1 second, but Zeno argues that this is not the case. He instead suggests that Achilles must inevitably come up to the point where the tortoise has started from, but by the time he has accomplished this, the tortoise will already have moved on to another point. This continues, and every time Achilles reaches the mark where the tortoise was, the tortoise will have reached a new point that Achilles will have to catch up with; while it begins with 0.9 metres, it becomes an additional 0.09 metres, then 0.009 metres, and so on, infinitely. While these distances will grow very small, they will remain finite, while Achilles' chasing of the tortoise will become an unending supertask. Much commentary has been made on this particular paradox; many assert that it finds a loophole in common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Logic|first=Chhanda|last=Chakraborti|year=2006|page=477|publisher=Prentice Hall of India|isbn=81-203-2855-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomson===
[[James F. Thomson (philosopher)|James F. Thomson]] believed that motion was not a supertask, and he emphatically denied that supertasks are possible. The proof Thomson offered to the latter claim involves what has probably become the most famous example of a supertask since Zeno. [[Thomson's lamp]] may either be on or off. At time t = 0 the lamp is off, at time t = 1/2 it is on, at time t = 3/4 (= 1/2 + 1/4) it is off, t = 7/8 (= 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8) it is on,  etc. The natural question arises: at t = 1 is the lamp on or off? There does not seem to be any non-arbitrary way to decide this question. Thomson goes further and claims this is a contradiction. He says that the lamp cannot be on for there was never a point when it was on where it was not immediately switched off again. And similarly he claims it cannot be off for there was never a point when it was off where it was not immediately switched on again. By Thomson's reasoning the lamp is neither on nor off, yet by stipulation it must be either on or off{{snd}} this is a contradiction. Thomson thus believes that supertasks are impossible.

===Benacerraf===
[[Paul Benacerraf]] believes that supertasks are at least logically possible despite Thomson's apparent contradiction. Benacerraf agrees with Thomson insofar as that the experiment he outlined does not determine the state of the lamp at t = 1. However he disagrees with Thomson that he can derive a contradiction from this, since the state of the lamp at t = 1 need not be logically determined by the preceding states. [[Logical consequence|Logical implication]] does not bar the lamp from being on, off, or vanishing completely to be replaced by a horse-drawn pumpkin. There are possible worlds in which Thomson's lamp finishes on, and worlds in which it finishes off not to mention countless others where weird and wonderful things happen at t = 1. The seeming arbitrariness arises from the fact that Thomson's experiment does not contain enough information to determine the state of the lamp at t = 1, rather like the way nothing can be found in Shakespeare's play to determine whether [[Hamlet]] was right- or left-handed.
So what about the contradiction? Benacerraf showed that Thomson had committed a mistake. When he claimed that the lamp could not be on because it was never on without being turned off again{{snd}} this applied only to instants of time ''strictly less than 1''. It does not apply to 1 because 1 does not appear in the sequence {0, 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, …} whereas Thomson's experiment only specified the state of the lamp for times in this sequence.

===Modern literature===
Most of the modern literature comes from the descendants of Benacerraf, those who tacitly accept the possibility of supertasks. Philosophers who reject their possibility tend not to reject them on grounds such as Thomson's but because they have qualms with the notion of infinity itself. Of course there are exceptions. For example, McLaughlin claims that Thomson's lamp is inconsistent if it is analyzed with [[internal set theory]], a variant of [[real analysis]].

====Philosophy of mathematics====
If supertasks are possible, then the truth or falsehood of unknown propositions of number theory, such as [[Goldbach's conjecture]], or even [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] propositions could be determined in a finite amount of time by a brute-force search of the set of all natural numbers. This would, however, be in contradiction with the [[Church-Turing thesis]]. Some have argued this poses a problem for [[intuitionism]], since the intuitionist must distinguish between things that cannot in fact be proven (because they are too long or complicated; for example [[George Boolos|Boolos]]'s "Curious Inference"&lt;ref&gt;[[George Boolos]]. "A curious inference." ''[[Journal of Philosophical Logic]]'' 16: 1–12. ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/30226368 JSTOR])&lt;/ref&gt;) but nonetheless are considered "provable", and those which ''are'' provable by infinite brute force in the above sense.

====Physical possibility====
Some have claimed Thomson's lamp is physically impossible since it must have parts moving at speeds faster than the [[speed of light]] (e.g., the lamp switch). [[Adolf Grünbaum]] suggests that the lamp could have a strip of wire which, when lifted, disrupts the circuit and turns off the lamp; this strip could then be lifted by a smaller distance each time the lamp is to be turned off, maintaining a constant velocity. However, such a design would ultimately fail, as eventually the distance between the contacts would be so small as to allow electrons to jump the gap, preventing the circuit from being broken at all.

Other physically possible supertasks have been suggested. In one proposal, one person (or entity) counts upward from 1, taking an infinite amount of time, while another person observes this from a frame of reference where this occurs in a finite space of time. For the counter, this is not a supertask, but for the observer, it is. (This could theoretically occur due to [[time dilation]], for example if the observer were falling into a [[black hole]] while observing a counter whose position is fixed relative to the singularity.)

Davies in his paper "Building Infinite Machines" concocted a device which he claims is physically possible up to infinite divisibility. It involves a machine which creates an exact replica of itself but has half its size and twice its speed. Still, for either a human or any device, to perceive or act upon the state of the lamp some measurement has to be done, for example the light from the lamp would have to reach an eye or a sensor. Any such measurement will take a fixed frame of time, no matter how small and, therefore, at some point measurement of the state will be impossible. Since the state at t=1 can not be determined even in principle, it is not meaningful to speak of the lamp being either on or off.

Gustavo E. Romero in the paper 'The collapse of supertasks'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1309.0144 |last1=Romero |first1=Gustavo E. |title=The collapse of supertasks |class=physics.hist-ph |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains that any attempt to carry out a supertask will result in the formation of a [[black hole]], making supertasks physically impossible.

====Super Turing machines====

The impact of supertasks on theoretical computer science has triggered some new and interesting work, for example Hamkins and Lewis{{snd}} "Infinite Time Turing Machine".

==Prominent supertasks==
===Ross-Littlewood paradox===
{{Main|Ross–Littlewood paradox}}
Suppose there is a jar capable of containing infinitely many marbles and an infinite collection of marbles labelled 1, 2, 3, and so on. At time ''t'' = 0, marbles 1 through 10 are placed in the jar and marble 1 is taken out. At ''t'' = 0.5, marbles 11 through 20 are placed in the jar and marble 2 is taken out; at ''t'' = 0.75, marbles 21 through 30 are put in the jar and marble 3 is taken out; and in general at time ''t'' = 1 − 0.5&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, marbles 10''n'' + 1 through 10''n'' + 10 are placed in the jar and marble ''n'' + 1 is taken out. How many marbles are in the jar at time ''t'' = 1?

One argument states that there should be infinitely many marbles in the jar, because at each step before ''t'' = 1 the number of marbles increases from the previous step and does so unboundedly. A second argument, however, shows that the jar is empty. Consider the following argument: if the jar is non-empty, then there must be a marble in the jar. Let us say that that marble is labeled with the number ''n''. But at time ''t'' = 1 − 0.5&lt;sup&gt;''n'' - 1&lt;/sup&gt;, the ''n''th marble has been taken out, so marble ''n'' cannot be in the jar. This is a contradiction, so the jar must be empty. The Ross-Littlewood paradox is that here we have two seemingly perfectly good arguments with completely opposite conclusions.

Further complications are introduced by the following variant. Suppose that we follow the same process as above, but instead of taking out marble 1 at ''t'' = 0, one takes out marble 2. And, at ''t'' = 0.5 one takes out marble 3, at ''t'' = 0.75 marble 4, etc. Then, one can use the same logic from above to show that while at ''t'' = 1, marble 1 is still in the jar, no other marbles can be left in the jar. Similarly, one can construct scenarios where in the end, 2 marbles are left, or 17 or, of course, infinitely many. But again this is paradoxical: given that in all these variations the same number of marbles are added or taken out at each step of the way, how can the end result differ?

Some people decide to simply bite the bullet and say that apparently, the end result does depend on which marbles are taken out at each instant. However, one immediate problem with that view is that one can think of the thought experiment as one where none of the marbles are actually labeled, and thus all the above variations are simply different ways of describing the same process; it seems unreasonable to say that the end result of the one actual process depends on the way we describe what happens.

Moreover, Allis and Koetsier offer the following variation on this thought experiment: at ''t'' = 0, marbles 1 to 9 are placed in the jar, but instead of taking a marble out they scribble a 0 after the 1 on the label of the first marble so that it is now labeled "10". At ''t'' = 0.5, marbles 11 to 19 are placed in the jar, and instead of taking out marble 2, a 0 is written on it, marking it as 20. The process is repeated ad infinitum. Now, notice that the end result at each step along the way of this process is the same as in the original experiment, and indeed the paradox remains: Since at every step along the way, more marbles were added, there must be infinitely marbles left at the end, yet at the same time, since every marble with number ''n'' was taken out at ''t'' = 1 − 0.5&lt;sup&gt;''n'' - 1&lt;/sup&gt;, no marbles can be left at the end. However, in this experiment, no marbles are ever taken out, and so any talk about the end result 'depending' on which marbles are taken out along the way is made impossible.

A bare-naked variation that really goes straight to the heart of all of this goes as follows: at ''t'' = 0, there is one marble in the jar with the number 0 scribbled on it. At ''t'' = 0.5, the number 0 on the marble gets replaced with the number 1, at ''t'' = 0.75, the number gets changed to 2, etc. Now, no marbles are ever added to or removed from the jar, so at t = ''1'', there should still be exactly that one marble in the jar. However, since we always replaced the number on that marble with some other number, it should have some number ''n'' on it, and that is impossible because we know precisely when that number was replaced, and never repeated again later. In other words, we can also reason that no marble can be left at the end of this process, which is quite a paradox.

Of course, it would be wise to heed Benacerraf’s words that the states of the jars before ''t'' = 1 do not logically determine the state at ''t'' = 1. Thus, neither Ross’s or Allis’s and Koetsier’s argument for the state of the jar at ''t'' = 1 proceeds by logical means only. Therefore, some extra premise must be introduced in order to say anything about the state of the jar at ''t'' = 1. Allis and Koetsier believe such an extra premise can be provided by the physical law that the marbles have continuous space-time paths, and therefore  from the fact that for each ''n'', marble ''n'' is out of the jar for ''t'' &lt; 1, it must follow that it must still be outside the jar at ''t'' = 1 by continuity. Thus, the contradiction, and the paradox, remains.

One obvious solution to all these conundrums and paradoxes is to say that supertasks are impossible. If supertasks are impossible, then the very assumption that all of these scenarios had some kind of 'end result' to them is mistaken, preventing all of the further reasoning (leading to the contradictions) to go through.

===Benardete’s paradox===
There has been considerable interest in [[J. A. Benardete]]’s “Paradox of the Gods”:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=G.R. |last=Oppy |year=2006 |title=Philosophical Perspectives on Infinity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86067-3 |lccn=2005021715 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPU9tzW-2HAC&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;pg=PA63 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|A man walks a mile from a point α. But there is an infinity of gods each of whom, unknown to the others, intends to obstruct him. One of them will raise a barrier to stop his further advance if he reaches the half-mile point, a second if he reaches the quarter-mile point, a third if he goes one-eighth of a mile, and so on ad infinitum. So he cannot even get started, because however short a distance he travels he will already have been stopped by a barrier. But in that case no barrier will rise, so that there is nothing to stop him setting off. He has been forced to stay where he is by the mere unfulfilled intentions of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Clark |year=2007 |title=Paradoxes from A to Z |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-42082-2 |lccn=2007015371 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iicvgj1N2_gC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;pg=PA75 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;|M.

===Laraudogoitia’s supertask===
This supertask, proposed by [[J. P. Laraudogoitia]], is an example of [[indeterminism]] in [[Newtonian mechanics]]. The supertask consists of an infinite collection of stationary point masses. The point masses are all of mass ''m'' and are placed along a line ''AB'' that is ''a'' meters in length at positions ''B'', ''AB'' / 2, ''AB'' / 4, ''AB'' / 8, and so on. The first particle at ''B'' is accelerated to a velocity of one meter per second towards ''A''. According to the laws of Newtonian mechanics, when the first particle collides with the second, it will come to rest and the second particle will inherit its velocity of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. This process will continue as an infinite amount of collisions, and after 1 second, all the collisions will have finished since all the particles were moving at 1 meter per second. However no particle will emerge from ''A'', since there is no last particle in the sequence. It follows that all the particles are now at rest, contradicting conservation of energy. Now the laws of Newtonian mechanics are time-reversal-invariant; that is, if we reverse the direction of time, all the laws will remain the same. If time is reversed in this supertask, we have a system of stationary point masses along ''A'' to ''AB'' / 2 that will, at random, spontaneously start colliding with each other, resulting in a particle moving away from ''B'' at a velocity of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. Alper and Bridger have questioned the reasoning in this supertask invoking the distinction between actual and potential infinity.

===Davies' super-machine===
Proposed by [[E. B. Davies]],&lt;ref name="Davies2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = E. Brian | authorlink = E. B.

This replica will in turn create an even faster version of itself with the same specifications, resulting in a supertask that finishes after an hour. If, additionally, the machines create a communication link between parent and child machine that yields successively faster bandwidth and the machines are capable of simple arithmetic, the machines can be used to perform brute-force proofs of unknown conjectures. However, Davies also points out that{{snd}} due to fundamental properties of the real universe such as [[quantum mechanics]], [[thermal noise]] and [[information theory]]{{snd}} his machine can't actually be built.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7456">The '''Texas sharpshooter fallacy''' is an [[informal fallacy]] which is committed when differences in data are ignored, but similarities are stressed. From this reasoning, a false conclusion is inferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |entry=Texas sharpshooter fallacy |last=Bennett |first=Bo |title=Logically Fallacious |accessdate=21 October 2014 |ref=harv |url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/176-texas-sharpshooter-fallacy| quote = description: ignoring the difference while focusing on the similarities, thus coming to an inaccurate conclusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fallacy is the philosophical or rhetorical application of the [[multiple comparisons]] problem (in statistics) and [[apophenia]] (in cognitive psychology). It is related to the [[clustering illusion]], which is the tendency in human [[cognition]] to interpret patterns where none actually exist.

The name comes from a joke about a [[Texas|Texan]] who fires some gunshots at the side of a barn, then paints a target centered on the tightest cluster of hits and claims to be a [[sharpshooter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/texas/entry/texas_sharpshooter_fallacy/|title=Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy|author=Barry Popik|publisher=barrypopik.com|date=2013-03-09|accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crab.rutgers.edu/~mbravo/cluster.pdf|title=The cancer-cluster myth|author=Atul Gawande|publisher=The New Yorker|date=1999-08-02|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carroll | first1 = Robert Todd | authorlink1 = Robert Todd Carroll | title = The Skeptic's Dictionary: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year = 2003 | page = 375 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;lpg=PA375&amp;vq=texas%20sharpshooter&amp;dq=%22texas%20sharpshooter%20fallacy%22%20logical%20fallacies&amp;pg=PA375#v=snippet&amp;q=texas%20sharpshooter&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2012-03-25 | isbn = 0-471-27242-6 | quote = The term refers to the story of the Texan who shoots holes in the side of a barn and then draws a bull's-eye around the bullet holes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy illustration.png|thumb|A set of 100 randomly generated coordinates displayed on a scatter graph. Examining the points it is easy to identify apparent patterns. In particular, random data points do not spread out but cluster, giving the impression of "hot spots" created by some underlying cause.]]
The Texas sharpshooter fallacy often arises when a person has a large amount of data at his or her disposal, but only focuses on a small subset of that data. Some factor other than the one attributed may give all the elements in that subset some kind of common property (or pair of common properties, when arguing for correlation). If the person attempts to account for the likelihood of finding ''some'' subset in the large data with ''some'' common property by a factor other than its actual cause, then that person is likely committing a Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

The fallacy is characterized by a lack of a specific hypothesis prior to the gathering of data, or the formulation of a hypothesis only after data have already been gathered and examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Painting the target around the matching profile: the Texas sharpshooter fallacy in forensic DNA interpretation | journal = Law, Probability, &amp; Risk | date = July 18, 2009 | first = William C. | last = Thompson | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–258| url = http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/3/257.full.pdf+html | accessdate = 2012-03-25 | quote = Texas sharpshooter fallacy...this article demonstrates how post hoc target shifting occurs and how it can distort the frequency and likelihood ratio statistics used to characterize DNA matches, making matches appear more probative than they actually are. | doi=10.1093/lpr/mgp013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it typically does not apply if one had an ''[[ex ante]]'', or prior, expectation of the particular relationship in question before examining the data. For example one might, prior to examining the information, have in mind a specific physical mechanism implying the particular relationship. One could then use the information to give support or cast doubt on the presence of that mechanism. Alternatively, if additional information can be generated using the same process as the original information, one can use the original information to construct a hypothesis, and then test the hypothesis on the new data. (See [[hypothesis testing]].) What one ''cannot'' do is use ''the same'' information to construct ''and'' test the same hypothesis (see [[hypotheses suggested by the data]])—to do so would be to commit the Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

== Examples ==
* A Swedish study in 1992 tried to determine whether [[Electromagnetic radiation and health|power lines caused some kind of poor health effects]]. The researchers surveyed everyone living within 300 meters of high-voltage power lines over a 25-year period and looked for statistically significant increases in rates of over 800 ailments. The study found that the incidence of childhood leukemia was four times higher among those who lived closest to the power lines, and it spurred calls to action by the Swedish government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13618450-300-swedish-studies-pinpoint-power-line-cancer-link/&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with the conclusion, however, was that the number of potential ailments, i.e. over 800, was so large that it created a high probability that at least one ailment would exhibit the appearance of a statistically significant difference by chance alone; i.e. the [[multiple comparisons problem]]. Subsequent studies failed to show any association between power lines and childhood leukemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1319.html |title=Frontline: previous reports: transcripts: currents of fear |publisher=PBS |date=1995-06-13 |accessdate=2012-07-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203040412/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1319.html|archivedate=2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation and interpretation===
* This fallacy is often found in modern-day interpretations of the [[quatrain]]s of [[Nostradamus]]. Nostradamus's quatrains are often liberally translated from the original (archaic) French, stripped of their historical context, and then applied to support the conclusion that Nostradamus predicted a given modern-day event, after the event actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/rumors/nostradamus.asp |title=Nostradamus Predicted 9/11? |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Arab Emirates]] is a middle-eastern country, located at the end of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] on the Persian Gulf, consisting of seven emirates known as [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]], [[Ajman]], [[Umm al-Quwain]], [[Ras al-Khaimah]] and [[Fujairah]]. Each emirate is governed by an emir who jointly forms the Federal Supreme Council (FSC). The Federal System of government includes the Supreme Council, Cabinet, Council of Ministers, parliamentary body, Federal National Council and independent judiciary. The Federal Supreme Council is the highest constitutional authority that has legislative and executive powers with the ability to ratify federal laws, decrees, and plans general policies. Its jurisdictions are derived from French, Roman, Egyptian and Islamic law.

==Judicial branch of the government==
There are three main branches of the court structure: civil, criminal, and sharia or Islamic (1) (the precepts are set forth in the Quranic verses and example set by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Sunnah). (2) Sharia or Islamic courts work alongside the civil and criminal courts. The responsibilities include civil matters between Muslims. Non-Muslims will not appear before a Sharia court in any matter due to the differences in religious beliefs. (3) Sharia or Islamic courts have the exclusive jurisdiction over family disputes divorce, inheritance, child custody, child abuse, and guardianship of minors. (3) However, at the federal level the Sharia court may hear appeals of criminal cases including rape, robbery, and driving under the influence of alcohol. (3)
Dubai is its own sovereign nation with its own federal judicial system with separate court systems that are not subjected to the federal Supreme Court. Dubai's court structure consists of:

# Court of First Instances- hears all claims ranging from commercial matters, debt recovery to maritime disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al Hanaee|title=Commitment of the maritime carrier|url=http://www.alhanaee.com/our-team/|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Court of Appeal- parties have the right to appeal on factual or legal grounds within thirty days from the judgment date.
# Court of Cessations- (highest court in Dubai) composed of five judges and all judgments are finals and not subject to appeal; only hear disputes on matters of the law and can act as an appellate court with respect to decisions made from lower courts. Also, can supervise lower courts ensuring the law is interpreted accurately. (3)

==Legal process==
Criminal actions commence with a police investigation which is transferred to the prosecutor's office within 48 hours of filing a complaint. The prosecutor will then hear and document statements from witnesses to determine if charges will be pressed or dropped, which must be completed 14 days from receiving the case from the police. Once the prosecutor has decided if charges will be pressed, the parties can proceed in hiring an attorney. All attorneys must be licensed to practice law and must be approved by an official deed notarized by a notary public to try the case. (3)

===Trial procedures===
Under the United Arab Emirates constitution all defendants are innocent until proven guilty. All trials are public except for national security cases trials that the honoring judge can rule to be conducted in privates if any evidence, testimonies or results are detrimental to societal morality. (4) Being that majority of the trials are public the emirs decided on having no juries in place in the courtroom. Also, all proceedings are delivered in the native language. Except the sentencing portion, translators are available for those who are not fluent in Arabic. For all indignant persons who are charged with felonies punishable by 3–15 years with no attorney, may have counsel provided for them upon the governments discretion. (4) Unlike the United States court system, the UAE prosecutors and defense lawyers have the ability to withhold any investigation from each other involving the case. (4) After, deliberations have been made of indictments, detainees may be released on bail informally. Authorities will accept a cash deposit, passport or an unsecured personal guarantee statement signed by a third party as a form of payment. Diya or blood money also qualifies as debt to a crime committed.

==Diya or blood money==
If one causes the death or injury of another person accidentally or intentionally he or she must pay the victim's family, what is known as [[diyya|diya]] or "blood money".  It is a means of compensation to the loss or harm for the loved ones. The payment of diya protects the rights of the family in the event of further threats from any accomplices or known associates of the defendant.  Diya is only payable if the defendant is found guilty under the criminal procedure or legally responsible for committing the crime. (5) However, if the defendant is found defending themselves, family, or property, diya will not be paid. Males rate of diya is Dh 200,000 (approx. US$54,450) and Dh 100,000 (approx. US$27,225) for females regardless of religion or nationality. (5)

==Free trial and free press==
Section 2 A of the United Arab Emirates constitution provides freedom of speech and press. However, the law prohibits criticism and slander of public officials that may create or encourage social uproar. (4) Journalists undergo strict boundaries implemented from the government. A variety of information can be published and distributed without the content being harmful or insulting to others. All sources must be reliable and will not be published until a full investigation has been performed to phish out any fabricated information. (6) Writers have the full right to document and publish info gathered from the courtroom due to trials being open to the public (judges can ask for privacy). Writers are prohibited from publishing the names of the accused, victims, or witnesses. (6)

==Women and the law==
Women in the UAE have progressed through the years with rights that they haven’t had prior to the declaration. However, many are concerned with how women are treated in this country. In marriage, the women are bound by a marital contract that clearly states that she is to abide by her husband, take care of home and the children. If the women disobeys or neglect her duties as a wife, by law the husband has the right to use physical means including violence to correct her disdaining acts. (4) Nevertheless, some domestic abuse cases can be filed as an assault without the intent to kill that is punishable by 10 years in prison of death results, 7 years for permanent disability, or 1 year for temporary injury. (4) Rape in the UAE is not tolerated and is punishable by immediate death. However, many women do not report being raped because they could be accused of adultery which results in flogging or death by stoning and brings shame to the family. (7) Divorce is rare in the UAE due to the stipulations that derive from it. Article 110 of the Personal Status Code states, women can request to be divorced with the exception that she surrenders all of her finances; otherwise known as the "khul" divorce procedure. (7) If the divorce is processed, the custody of the children is determined. Women are considered to be physical guardians and only have the right to custody up to the age of 13 for girls and 10 for boys. Once that age has been reached the Sharia courts can reassess for further custody. If the woman decides to remarry she automatically forfeits her rights of custody for her children from the previous marriage. (7)

==Juveniles and the law==
Like the women if minors disobey or act out, the male has the right to utilize corporal punishment. Criminal responsibility begins at age seven. (8) Sharia principles permit corporal punishment of young children including flogging, amputation, and retaliation similar to the pain reflected on the victim. Article 8 of the Juvenile Delinquent and Vagrant Act states, that if a juvenile is over the age of 16 and commits an offence, under the Penal Code at the judge's discretion they may sentence them to the measures provided in crime, instead of the prescribed penalty. (9) Article 9 states, "a juvenile may not be condemned to capital punishment". Juveniles who reach 16 are to be punished under the penal code substituting a sentence of detention not to exceed 10 years. (10)

==Customs and culture==
It is apparent that the UAE has applied firm penalties in accordance with maintaining the country's respect. Its vast success from new contemporary ideas has inspired other countries to engage in the innovations. With respect to UAE's religion, any showing of body parts such as buttocks, leg breast is deemed indecent and is strictly prohibited. Punishment for indecent exposure if jail or deportation. The body and romantic relationship is sacred and affection should be kept behind closed doors. Public affection is not allowed regardless of relationship status. Kissing and embracing of significant others is offensive and will be reported; holding hands is only affection acceptable.

==Crimes punishable by death==
The death penalty's purpose is to not only punish, but to rehabilitate criminals{{Clarify|date=June 2014}} and if possible prevent others from committing the same crime. (13) The main goal of the United Arab Emirates is to protect the lives, religion, parentage, intellect, and property of its citizens through rules and regulations that are strictly enforced with no tolerance. There are five crimes that the death penalty is automatically administered for: adultery, rape, armed highway robbery, murder, and apostasy.

In the Middle East, men are lawfully allowed to marry up to four women provided that he equally divides his time and money to take care of the family needs. (13) If the wives believe they haven’t received their share of his time or expenses than they have the right to ask for a divorce, due to the lack of marital support. The concept of having multiple spouses is to discourage men from committing adultery, having any sexual intercourse outside of marriage. Basically to avoid any bastard children, this in turn can create confusion within the family. The child will not be considered to have a father because his mother was not legally married to him and places the child in a difficult position, psychologically. Adultery is forbidden in order to uphold is mission to protect the livelihood of its citizens.

Rape, is extremely unacceptable in this country. The age of sexual maturity is fourteen. (13) Both women and men can be considered the culprit. To be sentenced to the death penalty full intercourse must have occurred. (13) In contrast, it is difficult to prove based on the circumstances of how women are treated in the law. If a women confesses that she has been attack without consent she must immediately alert local authorities in order to assess the crime, if not she will be deemed as agreeing and being full fledge on in non-marital sex and sentenced to death. In addition, if a women is pregnant at the time of her sentencing she is allowed to give birth and suckle the child for two years before her death is complete. (13)
Armed highway robbery is the impression of taking money from another under the threat of force of arms, thus imposing physical or financial assault. (13) Theft (Al Haraboh) occurs when an individual or group of people prey on others in attempt to take their valuables or property. Citizens have the natural right to obtain anything they have without the threat of someone without authority revoking it from them. The perpetrator who breaks that natural right is going against the ideologies of the country, which no pardon can be given.

Under Book 1, Article 1 of the Penal Code retributive penalties can apply under the Sharia law. The United Arab Emirates courts follow the Maliki School of Sunni Islam for the use of authority and interpretation from other schools to pronounce the sentences for murder cases. Islamic law defines any sane person who intentionally kills another with a weapon, is a sinner deserving perdition according to the Quran and the murderer is subject to retaliation. (11) Aggravated Murder, in the case of "deliberate design" or premeditated purpose is also punishable by death. (11) Unlawful killing such as: killing by fire, drowning in water, throwing from a high place, crushing by pushing down a wall, strangling, prevention of food and water, or exposing to a predatory animal are all likely to cause death, in the event death will be the punishment. (13) Homicides of public employees including ministries, government authorities, and members of the armed forces are considered an attack on the country itself and will be immediately prosecuted.

Apostasy or Al Reda is one who turns away from the Islamic religion, whether he or she embraces another religion or says they disbelieve after once believing. This crime is characterized and an intentional act unless under the individual is not at their sound capacity. (13) Any Muslim that denies one of the holy books, the prophets, or rejects any methods of the Islamic worship including prayer, paying Zakat (obligatory payment made annually under Islamic law on certain kinds of property and used for charitable and religious purpose), or fasting will be condemned to life for not abiding by the ordinances set in place for the country. (13) Moreover, if the person proclaims that they are in disbelief but is unaware of their statements they will be questioned once they regain their normal state of mind. Once they have gain clarity of themselves and deny any statements made in that stage than they will not be held liable for their action or comments. (13)

Other crimes that can be accountable for readmission for the death penalty are perjury/calumny, inciting suicide, drinking (the use of drug-induced state of mind to incite a person to commit an offense; drinking and driving results in jail, fines, and deportation, (12) arson, kidnapping, drug trafficking (severe crime with a zero tolerance policy toward illegal drug use) (12), and human trafficking.

All of these crimes have been committed but are infrequent due to the punishment of death. During the process of execution a deputy of the ministry, doctor, convict's lawyer and one of the member of the public prosecution are present. Relatives of the criminal are able to visit that day prior to the implementation of the sentence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16903">'''Urban metabolism''' is a [[scientific modelling|model]] to facilitate the description and analysis of the [[material flow|flows of the materials]] and [[energy transfer|energy]] within [[cities]], such as undertaken in a [[material flow analysis]] of a city. It provides researchers with a metaphorical framework to study the interactions of natural and human systems in specific regions.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"&gt;Pincetl, S., Bunje, P., &amp; Holmes, T. (2012). An expanded urban metabolism method: Toward a systems approach for assessing urban energy processes and causes. Landscape and Urban Planning, 193-202.&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, researchers have tweaked and altered the parameters of the urban metabolism model. C. Kennedy and fellow researchers have produced a clear definition in the 2007 paper ''The Changing Metabolism of Cities'' claiming that urban metabolism is "the sum total of the technical and socio-economic process that occur in cities, resulting in growth, production of energy and elimination of waste."&lt;ref name= "kennedy1"&gt;Kennedy, C., Cuddihy, J., &amp; Engel-Yan, J. (2007). The changing metabolism of cities. Journal of Industrial Ecology, 11(2), 43-59.&lt;/ref&gt; With the growing concern of [[climate change]] and [[atmospheric degradation]], the use of the urban metabolism model has become a key element in determining and maintaining levels of [[sustainability]]  and health in cities around the world. Urban metabolism provides a unified or [[holistic]] viewpoint to encompass all of the activities of a city in a single model.

==History==

With deep roots in [[sociology]], [[Karl Marx]] and fellow researcher [[Friedrich Engels]] may have been the first to raise concerns around issues which we would now call urban metabolism.  Marx and Engels concentrated on the social organization of the harvesting of the Earth's materials by “ analysing the dynamic internal relationships between humans and nature.”&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; Marx used the metaphor of metabolism to refer to the actual metabolic interactions that take place through humans’ exertion of physical labour to cultivate the Earth for sustenance and shelter (M. Fischer-Kowalski, 1998). In short, Marx and Engels found that when humans exerted such physical labour they ultimately altered the biophysical processes as well. This acknowledgement of altering the biophysical landscape is the first stepping stone for the creation of urban metabolism within [[social geography]]. They also used metabolism to describe the material and energy exchange between nature and society in as a critique of industrialization (1883)which created an interdependent set of societal needs brought into play through the concrete organization of human labour. Marx advocated that urban metabolism becomes a power in itself (like capitalism), and will control society unless society is able to control it.

Later, in reaction against industrialization and coal use, [[Patrick Geddes|Sir Patrick Geddes]], a Scottish biologist, undertook an ecological critique of urbanization in 1885, making him the first scientist to attempt an [[empirical]] description of societal metabolism on a macroeconomic scale.&lt;ref name= "mcdonald"&gt;McDonald, G. W., &amp; Patterson, M. G. (2007). Bridging the divide in urban sustainability: From human exemptionalism to the new ecological paradigm.Urban Ecosyst, 10, 169-192&lt;/ref&gt; Through his experimental study of [[urbanization]] he established a physical budget for urban energy and material throughput by way of an input output table.&lt;ref name= "fischer"&gt;Fischer-Kowalski, M. (1998). Society’s metabolism the intellectual history of materials flow analysis, part I, I 860- I 970. Journal of Industrial Ecology, 2(1), 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

:“Geddes’ table consisted of the sources of energy and materials transformed into products in three stages: (1) extraction of fuels and raw materials; (2) the manufacture and transport; and (3) exchange. The table also included intermediary products used for manufacture or transport of the final products; calculation of energy losses between each of the three stages; and the resultant final product; which was often surprisingly small, in material terms, compared with its overall material inputs.”&lt;ref name= "mcdonald"/&gt;

It wasn't until 1965 when [[Abel Wolman]] fully developed and used the term urban metabolism in his work, “The Metabolism of Cities” which he developed in response to deteriorating air and water qualities in American cities.&lt;ref name= "kennedy1"/&gt; In this study Wolman developed a model which allowed him to determine the inflow and outflow rates of a hypothetical American City with a population of 1 million people. &lt;ref =name “deck”&gt;Decker, E., Elliot, S., Smith, F., Blake, D., &amp; Rowland, F. S. (2000). Energy and material flow through the urban ecosystem. Energy Environment, 25, 685-740.&lt;/ref&gt; The model allows the monitoring and documentation of natural resources used (mainly water) and the consequential creation and out-put of waste.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"&gt;Kennedy, C., Pincetl, S., &amp; Bunje, P. (2011). The study of urban metabolism and its applications to urban planning and design. Environmental Pollution,159, 1965-1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolman’s study highlighted the fact that there are physical limitations to the natural resources we use on a day-to-day basis and with frequent use, the compilation of waste can and will create problems. It also helped focus researchers and professionals of their time to focus their attention on the system wide impacts of consumption of goods and sequential production of waste within the urban environment.&lt;ref name= "d"&gt;Wachsmuth, D. (2012). Three ecologies: Urban metabolism and the society-nature opposition. The Sociological Quarterly, (53), 506-523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working off of Wolman’s pioneering work in the 60’s, environmentalist [[Herbert Girardet]] (1996) began to see and document his findings in the connection between urban metabolism and sustainable cities.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; Girardet laid the foundation for the [[industrial ecology]] approach to urban metabolism in which it is seen as the “conversion of nature into society.”&lt;ref name= "d"/&gt; Aside from being a great advocate and populariser for urban metabolism, Girardet significantly coined and drew the difference between a ‘circular’ and ‘linear’ metabolism.&lt;ref name= "d"/&gt;  In a circular cycle, there is nearly no waste and almost everything is re-used. Girardet characterizes this as a natural world process.  On the other hand, a ‘linear’ metabolism which is characterized as an urban world process has a clear resource in-put and waste out-put. Girardet emphasizes that the accelerated use of linear metabolisms in urban environments is creating an impending global crisis as cities grow.

More recently the metabolism frame of reference has been used in the reporting of environmental information in Australia where researchers such as Newman have begun to link urban metabolic measures to and it has been suggested that it can be used to define the sustainability of a city within the ecosystems capacity that can support it.&lt;ref name= "newman"&gt;Newman, P. (1999). Sustainability and cities: Extending the metabolism model. Landscape and Urban Planning, (44), 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt;  This research has stayed mainly at a descriptive level and did not reach into the political or social forces of urban form and stages of flow.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; From this research there has been a strong theme in present literature on urban sustainability is that of the need to view the urban system as a whole if we are to best understand and solve the complex problems.&lt;ref name= "deck"&gt;Decker, E., Elliot, S., Smith, F., Blake, D., &amp; Rowland, F. S. (2000). Energy and material flow through the urban ecosystem. Energy Environment, 25, 685-740.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two main schools of approach==

===The energy method===
[[File:Energy Systems Symbols H.gif|thumbnail]]
{{Main article|Emergy}}

Developed in 1970’s [[Howard T. Odum]], a [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]], wanted to emphasize the dependence on the source of almost all energy on the planet: the sun.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; Odum believed that previous research and development on urban metabolism was missing and did not account for qualitative differences of [[mass]] or [[energy transfer|energy flows]]. Odum’s study took this into count and he coined the term "energy" to track and account for the metabolic flows by measuring the [[solar energy]] used directly or indirectly to make a product or deliver a service. This method also emphasizes the use of a standard unit of measurement to calculate energy, nutrient and waste movement in the biophysical system; the unit chosen was "solar energy joules". At first glance, the notion to use standard units seems like a beneficial idea for calculating and comparing figures; in reality the ability to convert all urban processes into solar energy joules has proven to be a difficult feat, and difficult to understand.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt;

=== Material flow analysis ===
[[File:MFASystem 1.png|thumbnail]]
{{Main article|Material flow analysis}}

Currently, the Urban Metabolism (UM) approach, as deducted from international literature, has been applied several times to assess and describe urban flows and impacts related to them, using different tools such as Material Flow Analysis (MFA) (Ioppolo et al., 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo, Giuseppe; Reinout Heijungs, Stefano Cucurachi, Roberta Salomone, and René Kleijn, 2014. Urban Metabolism: Many Open Questions for Future Answers. Pp 23-32 in ''Pathways to Environmental Sustainability'', eds. Roberta Salomone and Giuseppe Saija. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The MFA, researched by Baccinni and Brunner in the 1990s, "measures the materials flowing into a system, the stocks and flows within it, and the resulting outputs from the system to other systems in the form of pollution, waste, or exports."&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; Much like Wolmans case model for a hypothetical American City, this method  is based on the concept that the mass of the resources used will equal the mass "plus" stock changes out.&lt;ref name= "pincetl"/&gt; The MFA technique has become the mainstream school of urban metabolism because it uses more practical units that the public, workers, government officials and researchers can understand.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt;

== Applications ==
There are four main uses of urban metabolism that are used today by urban planners and designers; sustainability reporting, urban [[greenhouse gas accounting]], mathematical modelling for policy analysis and urban design.

===Sustainability indicators===
[[File:Sustainable development.svg|thumbnail]]

With the issue of sustainability at the core of many environmental issues today, one of the main uses of Urban Metabolism in the modern era is to track and record levels of sustainability in cities and regions around the world. Urban metabolism collects important and very useful information about [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[material cycling]], [[waste management]] and [[urban infrastructure|infrastructure]] in urban environments. The urban metabolism model records and analyzes environmental conditions and trends which are easily understood for policy makers and consequently comparable over time&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; making it easier to find unhealthy patterns and develop a plan of action to better the level of sustainability.

===Greenhouse gas accounting===
[[File:Greenhouse Effect.svg|thumbnail]]

Staying in line with the notion of sustainability, urban metabolism is also a helpful tool for tracking [[greenhouse gas]] emissions on a city or regional level. As mentioned above, with the proliferation of linear metabolisms such as cars, the production of greenhouse gases has increased exponentially since the birth and mass production of the automobile causing a problem for our atmosphere.&lt;ref name= "d"/&gt; Urban metabolism has been proven to be a necessary tool for measuring levels of greenhouse gas because it is an out-put or waste product that is produced through human consumption. The model provides quantifiable parameters which allow officials to mark unhealthy levels of GHG emissions and again, develop a plan of action to lower them.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt;

===Mathematical models===

Aside from the two accounting applications above, urban metabolism has begun to develop mathematical models to quantify and predict levels of particles and nutrients within the urban metabolism model. Such models have mostly been created and used by MFA scholars and are helpful in determining present and future sub-processes and material stocks and flows within the urban environment &lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; With the ability to predict future levels, these mathematical models allow progress to be made and possible pollution prevention programs to be instated rather than end-of-the-pipe solutions which have been favoured in the past.&lt;ref name= "ep"&gt;Cleaner production versus end-of-pipe. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.centric.at/services/cleaner-production/cleaner-production-versus-end-of-pipe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design tools===

Through utilization of the 3 applications above, scholars and professionals are able to use urban metabolism as a design tool to create greener and more sustainable infrastructure from the beginning. By tracing flows of energy, materials and waste through urban systems as a whole, changes and alterations can be made to close the loops to create circular metabolisms where resources are recycled and almost no waste is produced.&lt;ref name= "kennedy2"/&gt; Such initiatives are being made around the world with technology and inventions which make building green that much easier and accessible.

:Uses of the model are however not restricted to strictly functional analysis, as the model has been adapted to examine the relational aspects of urban relationships between infrastructure and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Gandy, M. (2004). ''Rethinking urban metabolism: Water, space and the modern city. City'', http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/about-the-department/people/academics/matthew-gandy/files/pdf2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3697">{{for|the Megadeth album|Warchest}}
A '''war chest''' is a metaphor for any collection of [[tool]]s or [[money]] intended to be used in a challenging or dangerous situation.  Historically, it referred to the chest located in the homes or barracks of [[soldier]]s, in which the soldier kept [[Armaments|arms]] and [[armor]].  In the modern era, it more often refers to a collection of [[funding|funds]] (or less occasionally special tools or equipment) intended to allow a person or organization to get through a situation that requires much more readiness or money than usual.

==Etymology==

In arms and armor, a '''war chest''' is a [[Chest (furniture)|container]] for the [[personal weapon]]s and [[Personal armor|protective gear]] of a [[Militia|citizen-soldier]], kept in the household, and is the origin of the term. The term's modern meaning originates with the [[medieval]] practice of having a [[chest (furniture)|chest]], literally, filled with money to open in time of [[war]].

==In politics==
In [[politics]], a war chest is funding obtained from donors well in advance of a campaign, usually accumulated by an incumbent for either re-election or to contest a more advanced office, or provided by a wealthy candidate to their own campaign. The possession of such excess funds may discourage otherwise viable candidates from a primary or general election challenge.

==In business==
In [[business]] a war chest, or '''cash mountain''' is a stash of money set aside to deal with unexpected changes in the business environment, or to use when expansion possibilities arise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ici-eyes-buyups-with-1631bn-war-chest-435693.html ICI eyes buy-ups with £1bn war chest] ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'', 9 February 2007, accessed 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Today companies can use accumulated cash or rely on quickly raised [[debt]] which costs less to carry when you don't need it. This is not always a reasonable substitute, as the credit available to a company typically drops as a result of the same actions that require the war chest to be opened.

Companies can redistribute their war chests to [[shareholder]]s by issuing larger or special [[dividend]]s, or more commonly through share [[Share repurchase|buyback]] operations.  Companies do this because if actually held in cash, the companies will be earning a low rate of return in the [[money market]]s, whereas they could be using the funds to invest in more profitable projects.  If they continue not to invest the funds, shareholders may sell the company's shares and make it vulnerable to a takeover.  This would place the current management's jobs at risk.

==In professional sports==
In [[Association football]] it refers to the amount of money a manager has been given by a club's chairman, owner or investors to acquire new players, as in the newspaper headline, "[[Jermain Defoe|Defoe]] and [[Wes Brown|Brown]] top [[Kevin Keegan|Keegan]] wishlist as [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Ashley]] grants £25m war chest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-508769/Defoe-Brown-Keegan-wishlist-Ashley-grants-25m-war-chest.html Defoe and Brown top Keegan wishlist as Ashley grants £25m war chest] ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 17 January 2008, accessed 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==
Similar terms are also referred to as surplus cash, cash reserves, emergency reserves, acquisition funds, [[rainy day fund]]s, or undistributed earnings within different contexts.
