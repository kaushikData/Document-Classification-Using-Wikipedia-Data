The '''Alps''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|p|s}};  {{lang-fr|Alpes}} {{IPA-fr|alp|}}; {{lang-de|Alpen}} {{IPA-de|ˈalpn̩|}}; {{lang-it|Alpi}} {{IPA-it|ˈalpi|}}; {{lang-rm|Alps}}; {{lang-sl|Alpe}} {{IPA-sl|ˈáːlpɛ|}}) are the highest and most extensive [[mountain range]] system that lies entirely in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Alps |encyclopedia=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide |date=2014 |publisher=Helicon |place=Abington, United Kingdom |url= http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/heliconhe/alps/0 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[Caucasus Mountains]] are higher, and the [[Urals]] longer, but both lie partly in Asia.&lt;/ref&gt; stretching approximately {{convert|1,200|km}} across eight [[Alpine countries]] (from west to east): [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Monaco]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], and [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpconv.org/index_en "Alpine Convention"]. ''Alpine Conferences''. Retrieved August 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian [[tectonic plate]]s collided. Extreme shortening &lt;!-- why shortening? --&gt; caused by the event resulted in marine [[sedimentary rock]]s rising by [[thrust fault|thrusting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] into high mountain peaks such as [[Mont Blanc]] and the [[Matterhorn]]. Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at {{convert|4810|m|abbr=on|0}} is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than [[List of Alpine four-thousanders|{{convert|4000|m|ft}}]].

The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as [[ibex]] live in the higher peaks to elevations of {{convert|3400|m|abbr=on|0}}, and plants such as [[Edelweiss]] grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations. Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] era. A [[Ötzi the Iceman|mummified man]], determined to be 5,000 years old, was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian–Italian border in 1991.

By the 6th century BC, the Celtic [[La Tène culture]] was well established. [[Hannibal]] famously crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants, and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had settlements in the region. In 1800, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000. The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]], followed by the [[golden age of alpinism]] as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks.

The Alpine region has a strong cultural identity. The traditional culture of farming, cheesemaking, and woodworking still exists in Alpine villages, although the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded greatly after World War II to become the dominant industry by the end of the century. The [[Winter Olympic Games]] have been hosted in the Swiss, French, Italian, Austrian and German Alps. At present, the region is home to 14 million people and has 120 million annual visitors.&lt;ref name = "Chatré8"&gt;Chatré, Baptiste, et al. (2010), 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and toponymy ==
{{See also|Albion#Etymology}}

[[File:Calanca Alp de Cascinarsa.jpg|thumb|left|An "Alp" refers to a high mountain pasture, often with a structure, such as this one on the south side of the Alps, where cows are taken for grazing.]]

The English word ''Alps'' derives from the Latin ''Alpes'' (through French). [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], an ancient commentator of [[Virgil]], says in his commentary (''A.'' X 13) that all high mountains are called ''Alpes'' by Celts. The term may be common to [[Italo-Celtic]], because the [[Celtic languages]] have terms for high mountains derived from ''alp''.

This may be consistent with the theory that in Greek ''Alpes'' is a name of non-Indo-European origin (which is common for prominent mountains and mountain ranges in the Mediterranean region). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Latin ''Alpes'' might possibly derive from a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European]] word *''alb'' "hill"; "Albania" is a related derivation. Albania, a name not native to the region known as the country of [[Albania]], has been used as a name for a number of mountainous areas across Europe. In [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], "Albania" was a name for the eastern [[Caucasus]], while in the English languages "Albania" (or "Albany") was occasionally used as a name for [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=Albania&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=May 14, 1955 |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many scholars{{Who|date=April 2017}} point out this is more likely derived from the Latin ''albus'', the color white.

In modern languages the term ''alp'', ''alm'', ''albe'' or ''alpe'' refers to a [[Transhumance in the Alps|grazing pastures]] in the alpine regions below the glaciers, not the peaks.&lt;ref name=Schmid93&gt;Schmid et al. (2004), 93&lt;/ref&gt; An ''alp'' refers to a high mountain pasture where cows are taken to be grazed during the summer months and where hay barns can be found, and the term "the Alps", referring to the mountains, is a misnomer.&lt;ref name="Reynolds43ff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleming 4"&gt;Fleming (2000), 4&lt;/ref&gt; The term for the mountain peaks varies by nation and language: words such as ''Horn'', ''Kogel'', ''Kopf'', ''Gipfel'', ''Spitze'', ''Stock'', and ''Berg'' are used in German speaking regions; ''Mont'', ''Pic'', ''Tête'', ''Pointe'', ''Dent'', ''Roche'', and ''Aiguille'' in French speaking regions; and ''Monte'', ''Picco'', ''Corno'', ''Punta'', ''Pizzo'', or ''Cima'' in Italian speaking regions.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 117–119&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of the Alps}}
[[File:Alps with borders.jpg|thumb|The Alps extend in an arc from France in the south and west to Slovenia in the east, and from Monaco in the south to Germany in the north.]]

The Alps are a crescent shaped geographic feature of central Europe that ranges in a {{convert|800|km|abbr=on|-1}} arc from east to west and is {{convert|200|km|abbr=on|-1}} in width. The mean height of the mountain peaks is {{convert|2.5|km|abbr=on|1}}.&lt;ref name="Ceben 22–24"/&gt; The range stretches from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] north above the [[Po (river)|Po]] basin, extending through France from [[Grenoble]], and stretching eastward through mid and southern Switzerland. The range continues onward toward [[Vienna]], Austria, and east to the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref name = "Chatré9"&gt;Chatré, Baptiste, et al. (2010), 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beattie xii–xiii"/&gt; To the south it dips into northern Italy and to the north extends to the southern border of [[Bavaria]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Beattie xii–xiii"&gt;Beattie (2006), xii–xiii&lt;/ref&gt; In areas like [[Chiasso]], Switzerland, and [[Allgäu]], Bavaria, the demarcation between the mountain range and the flatlands are clear; in other places such as [[Geneva]], the demarcation is less clear. The countries with the greatest alpine territory are Switzerland, France (21.4%), Austria (28.7% of the total area) and Italy (27.2%).

The highest portion of the range is divided by the glacial trough of the [[Rhône]] valley, from [[Mont Blanc]] to the [[Matterhorn]] and [[Monte Rosa]] on the southern side, and the [[Bernese Alps]] on the northern. The peaks in the easterly portion of the range, in Austria and Slovenia, are smaller than those in the central and western portions.&lt;ref name="Beattie xii–xiii" /&gt;
[[File:Aémaurienne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Aerial view of a typical intra alpine valley ([[Maurienne]], France)]]
The variances in nomenclature in the region spanned by the Alps makes classification of the mountains and subregions difficult, but a general classification is that of the [[Eastern Alps]] and [[Western Alps]] with the divide between the two occurring in eastern Switzerland according to geologist Stefan Schmid,&lt;ref name=Schmid93/&gt; near the [[Splügen Pass]].

The highest peaks of the Western Alps and Eastern Alps, respectively, are Mont Blanc, at {{convert|4810|m|ft|abbr=on|-1}}&lt;ref&gt;Shoumtoff (2001), 23&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Piz Bernina]] at {{convert|4049|m|0}}. The second-highest major peaks are [[Monte Rosa]] at {{convert|4634|m|abbr=on|-1}} and [[Ortler]]&lt;ref&gt;Excluding the [[Piz Zupò]] and [[Piz Roseg]] located in the Bernina range, close to Piz Bernina.&lt;/ref&gt; at {{convert|3905|m|abbr=on|-1}}, respectively

Series of lower mountain ranges run parallel to the main chain of the Alps, including the [[French Prealps]] in France and the [[Jura Mountains]] in Switzerland and France. The secondary chain of the Alps follows the [[drainage divide|watershed]] from the Mediterranean Sea to the [[Vienna Woods|Wienerwald]], passing over many of the highest and most well-known peaks in the Alps. From the Colle di Cadibona to [[Col de Tende]] it runs westwards, before turning to the northwest and then, near the [[Maddalena Pass|Colle della Maddalena]], to the north. Upon reaching the Swiss border, the line of the main chain heads approximately east-northeast, a heading it follows until its end near Vienna.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Passes ==

{{see also|Principal passes of the Alps}}

The Alps have been crossed for war and commerce, and by pilgrims, students and tourists. Crossing routes by road, train or foot are known as ''passes'', and usually consist of depressions in the mountains in which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre-mountainous zones.{{sfn|Knox|1911|p=740}} In the medieval period [[hospices]] were established by religious orders at the summits of many of the main passes.&lt;ref name="Fleming 4" /&gt; The most important passes are the [[Col de l'Iseran]] (the highest), the [[Brenner Pass]], the [[Mont-Cenis]], the [[Great St. Bernard Pass]], the [[Col de Tende]], the [[Gotthard Pass]], the [[Semmering Pass]], the [[Simplon Pass]], and the [[Stelvio Pass]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''. ''Encyclopedia Online Academic Edition''. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved August 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
Crossing the Italian-Austrian border, the Brenner Pass separates the [[Ötztal Alps]] and [[Zillertal Alps]] and has been in use as a trading route since the 14th century. The lowest of the Alpine passes at {{convert|985|m|abbr=on|0}}, the Semmering crosses from [[Lower Austria]] to [[Styria]]; since the 12th century when a hospice was built there, it has seen continuous use. A railroad with a tunnel {{convert|1|mi}} long was built along the route of the pass in the mid-19th century. With a summit of {{convert|2,469|m|abbr=on|0}}, the Great St. Bernard Pass is one of the highest in the Alps, crossing the Italian-Swiss border east of the Pennine Alps along the flanks of Mont Blanc. The pass was used by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] to cross 40,000 troops in 1800. 
[[File:Versant sud val cenis.jpg|thumb|upright=2.6|The col du Mont-Cenis (2081m) at the centre left of the picture gives access to a large alpine lake, and further away to the Italian peninsula 12 kilometres beyond the pass.]]
The [[Mont Cenis]] pass has been a major commercial and military road between Western Europe and Italy. The pass was crossed by many troops on their way to the Italian peninsula. From [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], [[Pepin the Short]] and [[Charlemagne]] to [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], Napoléon and more recently the German [[Gebirgsjäger]]s during [[World War II]].
Now the pass has been supplanted by the [[Fréjus Road Tunnel|Fréjus Highway Tunnel]] (opened 1980) and [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel|Rail Tunnel]] (opened 1871).

The Saint Gotthard Pass crosses from [[Central Switzerland]] to [[Ticino]]; in 1882 the {{convert|15|km|abbr=on|0}} long [[Gotthard Tunnel|Saint Gotthard Railway Tunnel]] was opened connecting [[Lucerne]] in Switzerland, with [[Milan]] in Italy. 98 years later followed [[Gotthard Road Tunnel]] ({{convert|16.9|km|abbr=on|0}} long) connecting the [[A2 motorway (Switzerland)|A2 motorway]] in [[Göschenen]] on the German-Swiss side with [[Airolo]] on the Italian-Swiss side, exactly like the railway tunnel. On June 1, 2016 the world's longest railway tunnel, the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] was opened, which connects [[Erstfeld]] in [[canton of Uri]] with [[Bodio]] in [[canton of Ticino]] by two single tubes of {{convert|57.1|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wissen/technik/wer-hat-die-groesste-roehre/story/14922381 |title=Wer hat die grösste Röhre? |trans-title=Who has the longest tube? |type=graphical animation |newspaper=[[Tages-Anzeiger]] |location=Zurich, Switzerland |date=April 14, 2016 |language=German |accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first tunnel, which traverses the Alps on a flat route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wissen/natur/was-die-tunnelbauer-im-gotthard-antrafen/story/11796993 |title=Was die Tunnelbauer im Gotthard antrafen |trans-title= |type=graphical animation |newspaper=[[Tages-Anzeiger]] |location=Zurich, Switzerland |date=April 1, 2016 |language=German |accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 11, 2016 it is part of the regular railway timetable and be used hourly as standard way to ride between [[Basel]]/[[Lucerne]]/[[Zurich]] and [[Bellinzona]]/[[Lugano]]/[[Milano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/en/welcome.html |title=Official Timetable |publisher=Swiss Federal Office for Transport |location=Bern, Switzerland |language=English, German, French, Italian, Rumantsch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest pass in the alps is the [[col de l'Iseran]] in [[Savoy]] (France) at {{convert|2,770|m|abbr=on|0}}, followed by the Stelvio Pass in northern Italy at {{convert|2,756|m|abbr=on|0}}; the road was built in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

== Orogeny and geology ==
{{main|Alpine orogeny|Geology of the Alps}}

Important geological concepts were established as naturalists began studying the rock formations of the Alps in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century the now defunct theory of [[geosyncline]]s was used to explain the presence of "folded" mountain chains but by the mid-20th century the theory of [[plate tectonics]] became widely accepted.&lt;ref name="Graciansky1ff" /&gt;

[[File:Nante d'arpanaz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The geologic [[Fold (geology)|folding]] seen at the Arpanaz waterfall, shown here in a mid-18th-century drawing, was noted by 18th-century geologists.&lt;ref name="Graciansky5"&gt;Graciansky (2011), 5&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The formation of the Alps (the [[Alpine orogeny]]) was an episodic process that began about 300 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 35&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Paleozoic]] Era the [[Pangaea]]n [[supercontinent]] consisted of a single [[tectonic plate]]; it broke into separate plates during the [[Mesozoic]] Era and the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] sea developed between [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] during the [[Jurassic]] Period.&lt;ref name="Graciansky1ff"&gt;Graciansky (2011), 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the [[Alpide belt]], from [[Gibraltar]] through the [[Himalayas]] to [[Indonesia]]—a process that began at the end of the [[Mesozoic]] and continues into the present. The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process,&lt;ref name="Graciansky1ff" /&gt; caused by the collision between the [[African Plate|African]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] plates&lt;ref name="Gerrard9" /&gt; that began in the late [[Cretaceous]] Period.&lt;ref name="Gerrard16"&gt;Gerrard, (1990), 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Under extreme [[compressive stress]]es and pressure, marine [[sedimentary rock]]s were uplifted, creating characteristic recumbent [[Fold (geology)|folds]], or ''[[nappe]]s'', and [[thrust fault]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth'' (2008), 142&lt;/ref&gt;  As the rising peaks underwent erosion, a layer of marine [[flysch]] sediments was deposited in the [[foreland basin]], and the sediments became involved in younger nappes (folds) as the orogeny progressed. Coarse sediments from the continual uplift and erosion were later deposited in foreland areas as [[molasse]].&lt;ref name="Gerrard9"&gt;Gerrard, (1990), 9&lt;/ref&gt; The molasse regions in Switzerland and Bavaria were well-developed and saw further upthrusting of flysch.&lt;ref name=Schmid102&gt;Schmid (2004), 102&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MassifMontBlanc7438.JPG|thumb|left|The crystalline basement of the [[Mont Blanc Massif]]]]

The Alpine orogeny occurred in ongoing cycles through to the Paleogene causing differences in nappe structures, with a late-stage orogeny causing the development of the [[Jura Mountains]].&lt;ref name=Schmid97&gt;Schmid (2004), 97&lt;/ref&gt; A series of tectonic events in the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods caused different [[Palaeogeography|paleogeographic]] regions.&lt;ref name=Schmid97/&gt; The Alps are subdivided by different [[lithology]] (rock composition) and nappe structure according to the orogenic events that affected them.&lt;ref name=Schmid93/&gt; The geological subdivision differentiates the Western, Eastern Alps and Southern Alps: the [[Helvetic nappes|Helveticum]] in the north, the [[Penninic nappes|Penninicum]] and [[Austroalpine nappes|Austroalpine system]] in the centre and, south of the Periadriatic Seam, the [[Southern Alps (geology)|Southern Alpine system]].&lt;ref name=Schmid99/&gt;

[[File:Matterhorn from Domhütte - 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Compressed metamorphosed Tethyan sediments and their oceanic basement are sandwiched between the tip of the [[Matterhorn]] (Italian-Swiss border), which consists of gneisses originally part of the African plate, and the base of the peak, which is part of the Eurasian plate.&lt;ref name="Graciansky5"/&gt;]]

According to geologist Stefan Schmid, because the Western Alps underwent a metamorphic event in the [[Cenozoic]] Era while the Austroalpine peaks underwent an event in the Cretaceous Period, the two areas show distinct differences in nappe formations.&lt;ref name=Schmid97/&gt; [[Flysch]] deposits in the Southern Alps of [[Lombardy]] probably occurred in the Cretaceous or later.&lt;ref name=Schmid97/&gt;

Peaks in France, Italy and Switzerland lie in the "Houillière zone", which consists of [[Basement (geology)|basement]] with sediments from the Mesozoic Era.&lt;ref name=Schmid99&gt;Schmid, 99&lt;/ref&gt; High "massifs" with external sedimentary cover are more common in the Western Alps and were affected by [[Neogene]] Period [[Thin-skinned deformation|thin-skinned]] thrusting whereas the Eastern Alps have comparatively few high peaked massifs.&lt;ref name=Schmid102/&gt; Similarly the peaks in eastern Switzerland extending to western Austria (Helvetic nappes) consist of thin-skinned sedimentary folding that [[decollement|detached]] from former [[basement (geology)|basement]] rock.&lt;ref name=Schmid103&gt;Schmid (2004), 103&lt;/ref&gt;

In simple terms the structure of the Alps consists of layers of rock of European, African and oceanic (Tethyan) origin.&lt;ref name="Graciansky29ff"&gt;Graciansky (2011), 29&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom nappe structure is of continental European origin, above which are stacked marine sediment nappes, topped off by nappes derived from the African plate.&lt;ref name="Graciansky31"&gt;Graciansky (2011), 31&lt;/ref&gt; The Matterhorn is an example of the ongoing orogeny and shows evidence of great folding. The tip of the mountain consists of [[gneiss]]es from the African plate; the base of the peak, below the glaciated area, consists of European basement rock. The sequence of Tethyan marine sediments and their oceanic basement is sandwiched between rock derived from the African and European plates.&lt;ref name="Graciansky5"/&gt;
[[File:Savine.JPG|thumb|upright=3.5|[[Maurienne|Haute Maurienne]] (Ambin and Vanoise massifs) and its exposed crystalline basement made of high-pressure subduction rocks such as [[blueschist]] and [[quartzite|metaquartzite]] (picture taken at 2400 metres)]]
The core regions of the Alpine orogenic belt have been folded and fractured in such a manner that erosion created the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the [[Swiss Alps]] that rise seemingly straight out of the foreland areas.&lt;ref name="Gerrard16"/&gt; Peaks such as Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, and high peaks in the Pennine Alps, the Briançonnais, and [[Hohe Tauern]] consist of layers of rock from the various orogenies including exposures of basement rock.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie (2006), 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]] (UIAA) has defined a list of 82 "official" Alpine summits that reach at least {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 4000ers of the Alps: Official UIAA List|journal=UIAA-Bulletin|issue=145|date=March 1994|format=PDF|url=http://www.club4000.it/Articoli/Boll_uiaa.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307064135/http://www.club4000.it/Articoli/Boll_uiaa.pdf|archivedate=March 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The list includes not only mountains, but also subpeaks with little [[Topographic prominence|prominence]] that are considered important [[mountaineering]] objectives. Below are listed the 22 "four-thousanders" with at least {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} of prominence.

While Mont Blanc was first climbed in 1786, most of the Alpine four-thousanders were climbed during the second half of the 19th century; the ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 marked the end of the [[golden age of alpinism]]. [[Karl Blodig]] (1859–1956) was among the first to successfully climb all the major 4,000&amp;nbsp;m peaks. He completed his series of ascents in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Huxley, ''The Geographical magazine: Volume 59'', Geographical Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

The first British Mont Blanc ascent was in 1788; the first female ascent in 1819. By the mid-1850s Swiss mountaineers had ascended most of the peaks and were eagerly sought as mountain guides. [[Edward Whymper]] reached the top of the Matterhorn in 1865 (after seven attempts), and in 1938 the last of the six [[great north faces of the Alps]] was climbed with the first ascent of the Eiger ''Nordwand'' (north face of the Eiger).&lt;ref name = "Shoumatoff197ff"&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 197–200&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minerals ==
The Alps are a source of minerals that have been mined for thousands of years. In the 8th to 6th centuries BC during the [[Hallstatt culture]], Celtic tribes mined copper; later the Romans mined gold for coins in the [[Bad Gastein]] area. [[Erzberg]] in [[Styria]] furnishes high-quality iron ore for the steel industry. Crystals are found throughout much of the Alpine region such as [[cinnabar]], [[amethyst]], and [[quartz]]. The cinnabar deposits in Slovenia are a notable source of cinnabar pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 49–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpine crystals have been studied and collected for hundreds of years, and began to be classified in the 18th century. [[Leonhard Euler]] studied the shapes of crystals, and by the 19th century crystal hunting was common in Alpine regions. David Friedrich Wiser amassed a collection of 8000 crystals that he studied and documented. In the 20th century Robert Parker wrote a well-known work about the rock crystals of the Swiss Alps; at the same period a commission was established to control and standardize the naming of Alpine minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 10–17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Glaciers ==
{{see also|List of glaciers in Switzerland}}
[[File:Illustration_of_the_Glacier_System_of_the_Alps_by_Alexander_Keith_Johnston_1848.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|This ''Illustration of the Glacier Systems of the Alps'' by [[Alexander Keith Johnston (1804–1871)|Alexander Keith Johnston]] was first published 1848 in ''The Physical Atlas''.]]
In the [[Miocene]] Epoch the mountains underwent severe erosion because of glaciation,&lt;ref name="Gerrard16" /&gt; which was noted in the mid-19th century by naturalist [[Louis Agassiz]] who presented a paper proclaiming the Alps were covered in ice at various intervals—a theory he formed when studying rocks near his [[Neuchâtel]] home which he believed originated to the west in the Bernese Oberland. Because of his work he came to be known as the "father of the ice-age concept" although other naturalists before him put forth similar ideas.&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff63ff"&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 63–68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aletschgebiet aus dem Flugzeug.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis Agassiz]]'s studies of the [[Unteraar Glacier]] in the 1840s showed that it moved at {{convert|100|m|abbr=on|0}} per year.&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff63ff" /&gt;]]

Agassiz studied glacier movement in the 1840s at the [[Unteraar Glacier]] where he found the glacier moved {{convert|100|m|abbr=on|0}} per year, more rapidly in the middle than at the edges. His work was continued by other scientists and now a permanent laboratory exists inside a glacier under the [[Jungfraujoch]], devoted exclusively to the study of Alpine glaciers.&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff63ff" /&gt;

Glaciers pick up rocks and sediment with them as they flow. This causes erosion and the formation of valleys over time. The [[Inn (river)|Inn]] valley is an example of a valley carved by glaciers during the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice ages]] with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion. Eroded rocks from the most recent ice age lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of erosion from earlier ice ages.&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff63ff" /&gt; Glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls (reliefs); valleys with lower reliefs and [[Scree|talus slopes]] are remnants of glacial troughs or previously infilled valleys.&lt;ref name="Gerrard132"&gt;Gerrard, (1990), 132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moraine]]s, piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier, accumulate at edges, centre and the terminus of glaciers.&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff63ff" /&gt;

[[File:Jungfraujoch img 3699.jpg|thumb|Inside a glacier at the top of the train station at the [[Jungfraujoch]]]]

Alpine glaciers can be straight rivers of ice, long sweeping rivers, spread in a fan-like shape (Piedmont glaciers), and curtains of ice that hang from vertical slopes of the mountain peaks.  The stress of the movement causes the ice to break and crack loudly, perhaps explaining why the mountains were believed to be home to dragons in the medieval period. The cracking creates unpredictable and dangerous [[crevasse]]s, often invisible under new snowfall, which cause the greatest danger to mountaineers.&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff71ff"/&gt;

Glaciers end in ice caves (the [[Rhône Glacier]]), by trailing into a lake or river, or by shedding snowmelt on a meadow. Sometimes a piece of glacier will detach or break resulting in flooding, property damage and loss of life.&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff71ff"&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 71–72&lt;/ref&gt;

High levels of precipitation cause the glaciers to descend to [[permafrost]] levels in some areas whereas in other, more arid regions, glaciers remain above about the {{convert|3,500|m|abbr=on|0}} level.&lt;ref name="Gerrard78"&gt;Gerrard, (1990), 78&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|1817|km2}} of the Alps covered by glaciers in 1876 had shrunk to {{convert|1342|km2|abbr=on}} by 1973, resulting in decreased river run-off levels.&lt;ref name="Gerrard108"&gt;Gerrard, (1990), 108&lt;/ref&gt; Forty percent of the glaciation in Austria has disappeared since 1850, and 30% of that in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Ceben (1998), 38&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rivers and lakes ==
[[File:St.Bartholomä.jpg|thumb|left|The [[St. Bartholomew's Church, Berchtesgaden|St. Bartholomew's chapel]] on the [[Königssee]] in Bavaria is a popular tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 31&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Alps provide lowland Europe with drinking water, irrigation, and hydroelectric power.&lt;ref&gt;Chatré, Baptiste, et al. (2010), 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the area is only about 11 percent of the surface area of Europe, the Alps provide up to 90 percent of water to lowland Europe, particularly to arid areas and during the summer months. Cities such as Milan depend on 80 percent of water from Alpine runoff.&lt;ref name = "Chatré9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benniston et al. 2011, 1"&gt;Benniston et al. (2011), 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, Martin. ''Mountains: Globally Important Eco-systems''. University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; Water from the rivers is used in over 500 [[hydroelectricity]] power plants, generating as much as 2900 GWh of electricity.&lt;ref name = "Chatré8"/&gt;

Major European rivers flow from Switzerland, such as the [[Rhine]], the [[Rhône]], the [[Inn (river)|Inn]], the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] and the [[Po (river)|Po]], all of which have headwaters in the Alps and flow into neighbouring countries, finally emptying into the [[North Sea]], the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the [[Black Sea]]. Other rivers such as the [[Danube]] have major tributaries flowing into them that originate in the Alps.&lt;ref name = "Chatré9"/&gt; The Rhône is second to the [[Nile]] as a freshwater source to the Mediterranean Sea; the river begins as glacial meltwater, flows into [[Lake Geneva]], and from there to France where one of its uses is to cool nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name="Benniston et al. 2011, 3"&gt;Benniston et al. (2011), 3&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhine originates in a 30 square kilometre area in Switzerland and represents almost 60 percent of water exported from the country.&lt;ref name="Benniston et al. 2011, 3"/&gt;  Tributary valleys, some of which are complicated, channel water to the main valleys which can experience flooding during the snow melt season when rapid runoff causes debris torrents and swollen rivers.&lt;ref name="Ceben 1998, 31"&gt;Ceben (1998), 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivers form lakes, such as Lake Geneva, a crescent shaped lake crossing the Swiss border with Lausanne on the Swiss side and the town of [[Evian-les-Bains]] on the French side. In Germany, the medieval [[St. Bartholomew's Church, Berchtesgaden|St. Bartholomew's chapel]] was built on the south side of the [[Königssee]], accessible only by boat or by climbing over the abutting peaks.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 24, 31&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Garda Alpine Sunset 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The sun setting over the Italian Alps in the [[Monte Baldo]] region, over [[Lake Garda]]]]

Additionally, the Alps have led to the creation of large lakes in  Italy. For instance, the [[Sarca]], the [[Inflow (hydrology)|primary inflow]] of [[Lake Garda]], originates in the Italian Alps.&lt;ref name="EnBrit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lake-Garda|title=Lake Garda|publisher=Encyclopedia Brittanica|access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have been studying the impact of climate change and water use. For example, each year more water is diverted from rivers for [[snowmaking]] in the ski resorts, the effect of which is yet unknown. Furthermore, the decrease of glaciated areas combined with a succession of winters with lower-than-expected precipitation may have a future impact on the rivers in the Alps as well as an effect on the water availability to the lowlands.&lt;ref name="Benniston et al. 2011, 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chatré, Baptiste, et al. (2010), 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate ==
{{main|Climate of the Alps|High Alps}}

The Alps are a classic example of what happens when a [[Temperateness|temperate]] area at lower altitude gives way to higher-elevation terrain. Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the [[polar region]]s have been called [[Alpine climate|Alpine]]. A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease (see [[adiabatic lapse rate]]). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain.{{sfn|Knox|1911|p=737}} The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aletschgletscher mit Pinus cembra1.jpg|thumb|The [[Aletsch Glacier]] with pine trees growing on the hillside (2007; the surface is {{convert|180|m|abbr=on}} lower than 150 years ago)]]

The severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal [[foehn wind]]. Numerous weather stations were placed in the mountains early in the early 20th century, providing continuous data for climatologists.&lt;ref name="Ceben 22–24"&gt;Ceben (1998), 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the valleys are quite arid such as the [[Aosta]] valley in Italy, the [[Maurienne]] in France, the [[Valais]] in Switzerland, and northern [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]].&lt;ref name="Ceben 22–24" /&gt;

The areas that are not arid and receive high precipitation experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff.&lt;ref name="Ceben 1998, 31"/&gt;  The mean precipitation in the Alps ranges from a low of {{convert|2600|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year to {{convert|3600|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year, with the higher levels occurring at high altitudes. At altitudes between {{convert|1,000|and|3,000|m|abbr=on|0}}, snowfall begins in November and accumulates through to April or May when the melt begins. [[Snow line]]s vary from {{convert|2,400|to|3,000|m|abbr=on|0}}, above which the snow is permanent and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even July and August. High-water levels in streams and rivers peak in June and July when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Ceben (1998), 34–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alps are split into five climatic zones, each with different vegetation. The climate, plant life and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains. The lowest zone is the colline zone, which exists between {{convert|500|and|1000|m|abbr=on|0}}, depending on the location. The [[montane]] zone extends from {{convert|800|to|1,700|m|abbr=on|0}}, followed by the sub-Alpine zone from {{convert|1,600|to|2,400|m|abbr=on|0}}. The Alpine zone, extending from [[tree line]] to snow line, is followed by the glacial zone, which covers the glaciated areas of the mountain. Climatic conditions show variances within the same zones; for example, weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley, extending directly from the peaks, are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall.&lt;ref&gt;Viazzo (1980), 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Various models of [[climate change]] have been projected into the 22nd century for the Alps, with an expectation that a trend toward increased temperatures will have an effect on snowfall, snowpack, glaciation, and river runoff.&lt;ref&gt;Benniston (2011), 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Significant changes, of both natural and anthropogenic origins, have already been diagnosed from observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huss|first=Matthias|last2=Hock|first2=Regine|last3=Bauder|first3=Andreas|last4=Funk|first4=Martin|date=May 1, 2010|title=100-year mass changes in the Swiss Alps linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010GL042616/abstract|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=37|issue=10|pages=L10501|doi=10.1029/2010GL042616|issn=1944-8007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zampieri|first=Matteo|last2=Scoccimarro|first2=Enrico|last3=Gualdi|first3=Silvio|date=January 1, 2013|title=Atlantic influence on spring snowfall over the Alps in the past 150 years|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/8/i=3/a=034026|journal=Environmental Research Letters|language=en|volume=8|issue=3|pages=034026|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034026|issn=1748-9326|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zampieri|first=Matteo|last2=Scoccimarro|first2=Enrico|last3=Gualdi|first3=Silvio|last4=Navarra|first4=Antonio|date=January 15, 2015|title=Observed shift towards earlier spring discharge in the main Alpine rivers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969714008912|journal=Science of the Total Environment|series=Towards a better understanding of the links between stressors, hazard assessment and ecosystem services under water scarcity|volume=503–504|pages=222–232|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.036|hdl=2122/9055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==

=== Flora ===
{{main|Flora of the Alps}}

[[File:Gentiana clusii03.jpg|thumb|Stemless gentian (''[[Gentiana acaulis]]'')]]

Thirteen thousand species of plants have been identified in the Alpine regions.&lt;ref name = "Chatré8"/&gt; Alpine plants are grouped by habitat and soil type which can be [[limestone]] or non-calcareous. The habitats range from meadows, bogs, woodland (deciduous and coniferous) areas to soil-less scree and [[moraine]]s, and rock faces and ridges.&lt;ref name="Reynolds43ff"&gt;Reynolds, (2012), 43–45&lt;/ref&gt; A natural vegetation limit with altitude is given by the presence of the chief [[deciduous]] trees—oak, beech, [[Ash tree|ash]] and [[sycamore maple]]. These do not reach exactly to the same elevation, nor are they often found growing together; but their upper limit corresponds accurately enough to the change from a temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a change in the presence of wild herbaceous vegetation.{{sfn|Knox|1911|p=738}} This limit usually lies about {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on|-1}} above the sea on the north side of the Alps, but on the southern slopes it often rises to {{convert|1500|m|abbr=on|-1}}, sometimes even to {{convert|1700|m|abbr=on|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Above the forestry, there is often a band of short pine trees (''[[Pinus mugo]]''), which is in turn superseded by ''Alpenrosen'', dwarf shrubs, typically ''[[Rhododendron ferrugineum]]'' (on acid soils) or ''[[Rhododendron hirsutum]]'' (on alkaline soils).&lt;ref&gt;Beattie (2006), 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the Alpenrose prefers acidic soil, the plants are found throughout the region.&lt;ref name="Reynolds43ff" /&gt; Above the [[tree line]] is the area defined as "alpine" where in the [[alpine meadow]] plants are found that have adapted well to harsh conditions of cold temperatures, aridity, and [[high-altitude adaptation|high altitudes]]. The alpine area fluctuates greatly because of regional fluctuations in tree lines.&lt;ref&gt;Körner (2003), 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leontopodium alpinum1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Edelweiss (''[[Edelweiss|Leontopodium alpinum]]'')]]

Alpine plants such as the [[Gentiana acaulis|Alpine gentian]] grow in abundance in areas such as the meadows above the [[Lauterbrunnental]]. Gentians are named after the [[Illyria]]n king [[Gentius]], and 40 species of the early-spring blooming flower grow in the Alps, in a range of {{convert|1,500|to|2,400|m|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 85&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the gentians in Switzerland [[D. H. Lawrence]] described them as "darkening the day-time, torch-like with the smoking blueness of Pluto's gloom."&lt;ref&gt;qtd in Beattie (2006), 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Gentians tend to "appear" repeatedly as the spring blooming takes place at progressively later dates, moving from the lower altitude to the higher altitude meadows where the snow melts much later than in the valleys. On the highest rocky ledges the spring flowers bloom in the summer.&lt;ref name="Reynolds43ff" /&gt;

At these higher altitudes, the plants tend to form isolated cushions. In the Alps, several species of flowering plants have been recorded above {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on|-1}}, including ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]'', ''[[Androsace alpina]]'' and ''Saxifraga biflora''. ''[[Eritrichium nanum]]'', commonly known as the King of the Alps, is the most elusive of the alpine flowers, growing on rocky ridges at {{convert|2,600|to|3,750|m|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 87&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best known of the alpine plants is [[Edelweiss]] which grows in rocky areas and can be found at altitudes as low as {{convert|1,200|m|abbr=on|0}} and as high as {{convert|3,400|m|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name="Reynolds43ff" /&gt; The plants that grow at the highest altitudes have adapted to conditions by specialization such as growing in rock screes that give protection from winds.&lt;ref name = "Sharp14ff"&gt;Sharp (2002), 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The extreme and stressful climatic conditions give way to the growth of plant species with [[secondary metabolites]] important for medicinal purposes. Origanum vulgare, Prunella vulgaris, Solanum nigrum and [[Urtica dioica]] are some of the more useful medicinal species found in the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chandra Prakash Kala|Kala, C.P.]] and Ratajc, P. 2012.[https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-012-0246-x "High altitude biodiversity of the Alps and the Himalayas: ethnobotany, plant distribution and conservation perspective".] ''Biodiversity and Conservation'', 21 (4): 1115–1126.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Naturasollieres.jpg|thumb|left|Preserved internal alpine forest and meadow, [[Vanoise National Park]]]]
Human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas, and, except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps, forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrard (1990), 225&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetation has changed since the second half of the 20th century, as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of forest. In some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life cannot recover during the non-skiing months, whereas areas that still practice a natural ''piste'' type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers.&lt;ref name = "Sharp14ff"/&gt;

=== Fauna ===
The Alps are a habitat for 30,000 species of wildlife, ranging from the tiniest [[snow flea]]s to [[brown bear]]s, many of which have made adaptations to the harsh cold conditions and high altitudes to the point that some only survive in specific micro-climates either directly above or below the [[snow line]].&lt;ref name = "Chatré8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 90, 96, 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeune bouquetin de face.jpg|thumb|upright|Young alpine ibex.  When fully grown the horns of this male will be about one metre wide.]]

The largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the [[alpine ibex]], which have been sighted as high as {{convert|3,000|m|abbr=on|0}}. The ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 104&lt;/ref&gt; Classified as [[antelopes]],&lt;ref name="Reynolds43ff" /&gt; [[chamois]] are smaller than ibex and found throughout the Alps, living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range.&lt;ref&gt;Rupicapra rupicapra [Linnaeus, 1758][http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Rupicapra_rupicapra.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of the eastern Alps are still home to brown bears. In Switzerland the [[canton of Bern]] was named for the bears but the last bear is recorded as having been killed in 1792 above [[Kleine Scheidegg]] by three hunters from [[Grindelwald]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Many rodents such as [[voles]] live underground. [[Marmots]] live almost exclusively above the tree line as high as {{convert|2,700|m|abbr=on|0}}. They hibernate in large groups to provide warmth,&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff102ff"&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; and can be found in all areas of the Alps, in large colonies they build beneath the alpine pastures.&lt;ref name="Reynolds43ff" /&gt; [[Golden eagle]]s and [[bearded vulture]]s are the largest birds to be found in the Alps; they nest high on rocky ledges and can be found at altitudes of {{convert|2,400|m|abbr=on|0}}. The most common bird is the [[alpine chough]] which can be found scavenging at climber's huts or at the [[Jungfraujoch]], a high altitude tourist destination.&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff97ff"&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parnassius phoebus.jpg|thumb|left|The alpine [[Apollo butterfly]] has adapted to alpine conditions.]]

Reptiles such as [[Viperidae|adders]] and [[Viperidae|vipers]] live up to the snow line; because they cannot bear the cold temperatures they hibernate underground and soak up the warmth on rocky ledges.&lt;ref name = "Shoumatoff95ff"&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 96&lt;/ref&gt;  The high-altitude [[Alpine salamander]]s have adapted to living above the snow line by giving birth to fully developed young rather than laying eggs. [[Brown trout]] can be found in the streams up to the snow line.&lt;ref name = "Shoumatoff95ff"/&gt; Molluscs such as the [[Helicigona|wood snail]] live up the snow line. Popularly gathered as food, the [[snail]]s are now protected.&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff88ff"&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of species of [[moth]]s live in the Alps, some of which are believed to have evolved in the same habitat up to 120&amp;nbsp;million years ago, long before the Alps were created. [[Small blue|Blue moth]]s can commonly be seen drinking from the snow melt; some species of blue moths fly as high as {{convert|1,800|m|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 93&lt;/ref&gt; The butterflies tend to be large, such as those from the swallowtail [[Parnassius]] family, with a habitat that ranges to {{convert|1,800|m|abbr=on|0}}. Twelve species of beetles have habitats up to the snow line; the most beautiful and formerly collected for its colours but now protected is ''[[Rosalia alpina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 91&lt;/ref&gt; Spiders, such as the large [[wolf spider]], live above the snow line and can be seen as high as {{convert|4,00|m|abbr=on|0}}. [[Scorpion]]s can be found in the Italian Alps.&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff88ff" /&gt;

Some of the species of moths and insects show evidence of having been indigenous to the area from as long ago as the Alpine orogeny. In [[Lac d'Emosson|Emosson]] in Valais, Switzerland, dinosaur tracks were found in the 1970s, dating probably from the [[Triassic]] Period.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (2012), 75&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|History of the Alps}}

=== Prehistory to Christianity ===
[[File:Scena di duello R6 - Foppe - Nadro (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Pre-historic [[petroglyphs]] from [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica|Valcamonica]], Italy]]

About 10,000 years ago, when the ice melted after the [[last glacial period]], late [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] communities were established along the lake shores and in cave systems. Evidence of human habitation has been found in caves near [[Vercors Cave System|Vercors]], close to Grenoble; in Austria the [[Mondsee (lake)|Mondsee]] culture shows evidence of houses built on piles to keep them dry. Standing stones have been found in Alpine areas of France and Italy. The [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica|rock drawings in Valcamonica]] are more than 5000 years old; more than 200,000 drawings and etchings have been identified at the site.&lt;ref name="Beattie25ff"&gt;Beattie, (2006), 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 a mummy of a [[neolithic]] body, known as [[Ötzi the Iceman]], was discovered by hikers on the [[Similaun]] glacier. His clothing and gear indicate that he lived in an alpine farming community, while the location and manner of his death – an arrowhead was discovered in his shoulder – suggests he was travelling from one place to another.&lt;ref name="Beattie21ff"&gt;Beattie, (2006), 21&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the [[mitochondrial DNA]] of Ötzi, has shown that he belongs to the K1 [[subclade]] which cannot be categorized into any of the three modern branches of that subclade. The new subclade has provisionally been named ''K1ö'' for ''Ötzi''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2808%2901254-2 Luca Ermini et al., "Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequence of the Tyrolean Iceman," ''Current Biology'', vol. 18, no. 21 (30 October 2008), pp. 1687–1693].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Celt]]ic tribes settled in Switzerland between 1500 and 1000 BC. The [[Raetia]]ns lived in the eastern regions, while the west was occupied by the [[Helvetii]] and the [[Allobroges|Allobrogi]] settled in the Rhône valley and in [[Savoy]]. Among the many substances Celtic tribes mined was salt in areas such as [[Salzburg]] in Austria where evidence of the [[Hallstatt culture]] was found by a mine manager in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Beattie25ff" /&gt; By the 6th century BC the [[La Tène culture]] was well established in the region,&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 2&lt;/ref&gt; and became known for high quality [[Celtic art#Halstatt gallery|decorated weapons and jewellery]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 131&lt;/ref&gt; The Celts were the most widespread of the mountain tribes—they had warriors that were strong, tall and fair skinned, and skilled with iron weapons, which gave them an advantage in warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 110&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BC, the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] general [[Hannibal]] probably [[Hannibal crossing the Alps|crossed the Alps]] with an army numbering 38,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, and 37 war elephants. This was one of the most celebrated achievements of any military force in ancient warfare,&lt;ref name="Lancel"&gt;Lancel, Serge, (1999), 71&lt;/ref&gt; although no evidence exists of the actual crossing or the place of crossing. The Romans, however, had built roads along the mountain passes, which continued to be used through the medieval period to cross the mountains and Roman road markers can still be found on the mountain passes.&lt;ref&gt;Prevas (2001), 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castle of Chillon N.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Château de Chillon]], an early medieval castle on the north shore of [[Lake Geneva]], is shown here against the backdrop of the [[Dents du Midi]].]]

The Roman expansion brought the defeat of the Allobrogi in 121 BC and during the [[Gallic Wars]] in 58 BC [[Julius Caesar]] overcame the Helvetii. The Rhaetians continued to resist but were eventually conquered when the Romans turned northward to the [[Danube]] valley in Austria and defeated the [[Brigantes]].&lt;ref name="Beattie27ff"&gt;Beattie, (2006), 27&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built settlements in the Alps; towns such as [[Aosta]] (named for Augustus) in Italy, [[Martigny]] and [[Lausanne]] in Switzerland, and [[Partenkirchen]] in Bavaria show remains of Roman baths, villas, arenas and temples.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 28–31&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Alpine region was gradually settled by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], ([[Lombards]], [[Alemanni]], [[Bavarii]], and [[Franks]]) from the 6th to the 13th centuries mixing with the local Celtic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 31, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity, feudalism, and Napoleonic wars ===
Christianity was established in the region by the Romans, and saw the establishment of monasteries and churches in the high regions. The Frankish expansion of the [[Carolingian Empire]] and the Bavarian expansion in the eastern Alps introduced feudalism and the building of castles to support the growing number of dukedoms and kingdoms. Castello del Buonconsiglio in [[Trento]], Italy, still has intricate frescoes, excellent examples of Gothic art, in a tower room. In Switzerland, [[Château de Chillon]] is preserved as an example of medieval architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 32, 34, 37, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the medieval period was a time of power struggles between competing dynasties such as the [[House of Savoy]], the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] in northern Italy and the [[House of Habsburg]] in Austria and Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 41, 46, 48&lt;/ref&gt; In 1291 to protect themselves from incursions by the Habsburgs, four [[cantons]] in the middle of Switzerland drew up a [[Federal Charter of 1291|charter]] that is considered to be a declaration of independence from neighbouring kingdoms. After a series of battles fought in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, more cantons joined the confederacy and by the 16th century Switzerland was well-established as a separate state.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 56, 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PopovAN 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Russian troops under [[Suvorov]] crossing the Alps in 1799]]
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the late 18th century and early 19th century, [[Napoleon]] annexed territory formerly controlled by the Habsburgs and Savoys. In 1798 he established the Helvetic Republic in Switzerland; two years later he led an army across the St. Bernard pass and conquered almost all of the Alpine regions.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aussois - Forts de l'Esseillon - Fort Victor-Emmanuel, fort Charles-Félix et fort Marie-Christine -1.JPG|thumb|left|Built from 1300 to 1500 metres high on a rock of [[quartzite]] and surrounded by deep cliffs, the Forts de l'Esseillon prevented any invasion.]]

After the fall of Napoléon, many alpine countries developed heavy protections to prevent any new invasion. Thus, [[Savoy]] built a series of fortifications in the [[Maurienne]] valley in order to protect the major alpine passes, such as the [[col du Mont-Cenis]] that was even crossed by [[Charlemagne]] and his father to defeat the Lombards. The later indeed became very popular after the construction of a paved road ordered by Napoléon Bonaparte.
The Barrière de l'Esseillon is a serie of forts with heavy batteries, built on a cliff with a perfect view on the valley, a gorge on one side and steep mountains on the other side.

In the 19th century, the monasteries built in the high Alps during the medieval period to shelter travellers and as places of pilgrimage, became tourist destinations. The [[Benedictine]]s had built monasteries in [[Lucerne]], Switzerland, and [[Oberammergau]]; the [[Cistercian]]s in the Tyrol and at [[Lake Constance]]; and the [[Augustinian]]s had abbeys in the [[Savoy]] and one in the centre of [[Interlaken]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great St Bernard Hospice]], built in the 9th or 10th centuries, at the summit of the [[Great Saint Bernard Pass]] was shelter for travellers and place for pilgrims since its inception; by the 19th century it became a tourist attraction with notable visitors such as author [[Charles Dickens]] and mountaineer Edward Whymper.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 73, 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploration ===
{{main|Exploration of the High Alps}}
[[File:Matterhorn ascent Dore.jpg|thumb|''The [[first ascent of the Matterhorn]]'' (1865), lithograph by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

[[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon]]-dated charcoal placed around 50,000 years ago was found in the ''Drachloch'' (Dragon's Hole) cave above the village of Vattis in the [[canton of St. Gallen]], proving that the high peaks were visited by prehistoric people. Seven bear skulls from the cave may have been buried by the same prehistoric people.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 108&lt;/ref&gt; The peaks, however, were mostly ignored except for a few notable examples, and long left to the exclusive attention of the people of the adjoining valleys.{{sfn|Knox|1911|p=748}}&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff188ff"&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 188–191&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain peaks were seen as terrifying, the abode of dragons and demons, to the point that people blindfolded themselves to cross the Alpine passes.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 6&lt;/ref&gt; The glaciers remained a mystery and many still believed the highest areas to be inhabited by dragons.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles VII of France]] ordered his [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] to climb [[Mont Aiguille]] in 1356. The knight reached the summit of [[Rocciamelone]] where he left a bronze triptych of three crosses, a feat which he conducted with the use of ladders to traverse the ice.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The first recorded ascent of a peak was by [[Petrarch]] who in 1336 climbed [[Mont Ventoux]] in France. --&gt; In 1492 Antoine de Ville climbed Mont Aiguille, without reaching the summit, an experience he described as "horrifying and terrifying."&lt;ref name="Shoumatoff188ff" /&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was fascinated by variations of light in the higher altitudes, and climbed a mountain—scholars are uncertain which one; some believe it may have been [[Monte Rosa]]. From his description of a "blue like that of a gentian" sky it is thought that he reached a significantly high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;qtd in Shoumatoff (2001), 193&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century four [[Chamonix]] men almost made the summit of Mont Blanc but were overcome by altitude sickness and snowblindness.&lt;ref&gt;Shoumatoff (2001), 192–194&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conrad Gessner]] was the first naturalist to ascend the mountains in the 16th century, to study them, writing that in the mountains he found the "theatre of the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 8&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century more naturalists began to arrive to explore, study and conquer the high peaks.&lt;ref name="Fleming vii"&gt;Fleming (2000), vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] (1740–1799) in the Pennine Alps,&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 27&lt;/ref&gt; and the Benedictine monk of [[Disentis]] [[Placidus a Spescha]] (1752–1833).&lt;ref name="Fleming vii" /&gt; Born in Geneva, Saussure was enamoured with the mountains from an early age; he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the Bernese Oberland, the Savoy, the Piedmont and Valais, studying the glaciers and the geology, as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2000), 12–13, 30, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure, in 1787, was a member of the third ascent of Mont Blanc—today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed.&lt;ref name = "Shoumatoff197ff"/&gt;

=== The Romantics ===
[[File:Caspar David Friedrich 032.jpg|thumb|''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog]]'', [[Caspar David Friedrich]] (1818)]] 
[[Albrecht von Haller]]'s poem ''Die Alpen'' (1732) described the mountains as an area of mythical purity.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 121–123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was another writer who presented the Alps as a place of allure and beauty, in his novel ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' (1761), Later the first wave of [[Romanticism|Romantics]] such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] came to admire the scenery;{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] visited the area in 1790, writing of his experiences in ''[[The Prelude]]'' (1799). Schiller later wrote the play ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]'' (1804), which tells the  story  the legendary Swiss marksman [[William Tell]] as part of the greater Swiss struggle for independence from the [[Habsburg Empire]] in the early 14th century. At the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the Alpine countries began to see an influx of poets, artists, and musicians,&lt;ref name="Fleming 2000, 83"&gt;Fleming (2000), 83&lt;/ref&gt; as visitors came to experience the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] effects of monumental nature.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816 [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and his wife [[Mary Shelley]] visited Geneva and all three were inspired by the scenery in their writings.&lt;ref name="Fleming 2000, 83"/&gt; During these visits Shelley wrote the poem "[[Mont Blanc (poem)|Mont Blanc]]", Byron wrote "[[The Prisoner of Chillon]]" and the dramatic poem ''[[Manfred]]'', and Mary Shelley, who found the scenery overwhelming, conceived the idea for the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' in her villa on the shores of Lake Geneva in the midst of a thunderstorm. When [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] travelled to [[Chamonix]], he declaimed, in defiance of Shelley, who had signed himself "Atheos" in the guestbook of the Hotel de Londres near Montenvers,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Hartman, [http://litthe.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/1/4.full "Gods, Ghosts, and Shelley's 'Atheos'"], ''Literature and Theology'', Volume 24, Issue 1, pp. 4–18&lt;/ref&gt; "Who would be, who could be an atheist in this valley of wonders".&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 127–133&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-19th century scientists began to arrive en masse to study the geology and ecology of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, (2006), 139&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Nazis ===
[[File:Ghent altarpiece at Altaussee.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|The Nazis hid looted art in salt mines at [[Altaussee]], such as the [[Early Netherlandish art|Early Netherlandish]] ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' which sustained significant damage.]]

Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]] had a lifelong romantic fascination with the Alps and by the 1930s established a home at [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], in the [[Obersalzberg]] region outside of [[Berchtesgaden]]. His first visit to the area was in 1923 and he maintained a strong tie there until the end of his life. At the end of World War II the US Army occupied Obersalzberg, to prevent Hitler from retreating with the [[Wehrmacht]] into the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (2007), 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1940 many of the Alpine countries were under the control of the [[Axis powers]]. Austria underwent a political coup that made it part of the Third Reich; France had been invaded and Italy was a [[fascist]] regime. Switzerland and Liechtenstein were the only countries to avoid Axis takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Halbrook (1998), 1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swiss Confederation]] mobilized its troops—the country follows the doctrine of "armed neutrality" with all males required to have military training—a number that [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] estimated to be about 850,000. The Swiss commanders wired the infrastructure leading into the country with explosives, and threatened to destroy bridges, railway tunnels and roads across passes in the event of a Nazi invasion; and if there was an invasion the Swiss army would then have retreated to the heart of the mountain peaks, where conditions were harsher, and a military invasion would involve difficult and protracted battles.&lt;ref&gt;Halbrook (2006), 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

German [[Ski troops]] were trained for the war, and battles were waged in mountainous areas such as the battle at Riva Ridge in Italy, where the American [[10th Mountain Division]] encountered heavy resistance in February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Feuer (2006), viii&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, a substantial amount of [[Nazi plunder]] was found stored in Austria, where Hitler had hoped to retreat as the war drew to a close. The [[salt mines]] surrounding the [[Altaussee]] area, where American troops found 75 kilos of gold coins stored in a single mine, were used to store looted art, jewels, and currency; vast quantities of looted art were found and returned to the owners.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (2007), 10, 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Largest cities==
The largest city within the Alps is the city of [[Grenoble]] in [[France]]. Other larger and important cities within the Alps with over 100,000 inhabitants are in [[Tyrol]] with [[Bolzano]] ([[Italy]]), [[Trento]] ([[Italy]]) and [[Innsbruck]] ([[Austria]]). Larger cities outside the Alps are [[Milan]], [[Verona]], [[Turin]] (Italy), [[Munich]] (Germany), [[Vienna]], [[Salzburg]] (Austria), [[Zurich]], [[Geneva]] (Switzerland) and [[Lyon]] (France).

== Alpine people and culture ==

{{further|Transhumance in the Alps|Swiss folklore}}
The population of the region is 14 million spread across eight countries.&lt;ref name = "Chatré8"/&gt; On the rim of the mountains, on the plateaus and the plains the economy consists of manufacturing and service jobs whereas in the higher altitudes and in the mountains farming is still essential to the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Chartes et. el. (2010), 14&lt;/ref&gt; Farming and forestry continue to be mainstays of Alpine culture, industries that provide for export to the cities and maintain the mountain ecology.&lt;ref name="Chartes et. el. 2010, 5"&gt;Chartes et. el. (2010), 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hallstatt 300.jpg|thumb|[[Hallstatt]] is known for its production of salt, dating back to prehistoric times.]]
Much of the Alpine culture is unchanged since the medieval period when skills that guaranteed survival in the mountain valleys and in the highest villages became mainstays, leading to strong traditions of carpentry, woodcarving, baking and pastry-making, and cheesemaking.&lt;ref name = "Shoumatoff123ff"&gt;Shoumataff (2001), 123–126&lt;/ref&gt;

Farming had been a traditional occupation for centuries, although it became less dominant in the 20th century with the advent of tourism. Grazing and pasture land are limited because of the steep and rocky topography of the Alps. In mid-June cows are moved to the highest pastures close to the snowline, where they are watched by herdsmen who stay in the high altitudes often living in stone huts or wooden barns during the summers.&lt;ref name = "Shoumatoff123ff"/&gt; Villagers celebrate the day the cows are herded up to the pastures and again when they return in mid-September. The [[Almabtrieb|Almabtrieb, Alpabzug, Alpabfahrt, Désalpes]] («coming down from the alps») is celebrated by decorating the cows with garlands and enormous [[cowbell]]s while the farmers dress in traditional costumes.&lt;ref name = "Shoumatoff123ff"/&gt;

[[File:LeMonal-fontaine-chapelle-Savoie.JPG|thumb|left|In the summers the cows are brought up to the high mountain meadows for grazing. Small summer villages such as this one shown in this photograph taken in [[Savoie]] are used.]]

Cheesemaking is an ancient tradition in most Alpine countries. A wheel of cheese from the [[Emmental]] in Switzerland can weigh up to {{convert|45|kg|abbr=on|-1}}, and the [[Beaufort cheese|Beaufort]] in [[Savoy]] can weigh up to {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on|-1}}. Owners of the cows traditionally receive from the cheesemakers a portion in relation to the proportion of the cows' milk from the summer months in the high alps. Haymaking is an important farming activity in mountain villages which has become somewhat mechanized in recent years, although the slopes are so steep that usually scythes are necessary to cut the grass. Hay is normally brought in twice a year, often also on festival days.&lt;ref name = "Shoumatoff123ff"/&gt; Alpine festivals vary from country to country and often include the display of local costumes such as [[dirndl]] and [[tracht]]en, the playing of [[Alpenhorn]]s, wrestling matches, some pagan traditions such as [[Walpurgis Night]] and, in many areas, [[Carnival]] is celebrated before [[Lent]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoumataff (2001), 129, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In the high villages people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters. The kitchen is separated from the living area (called the ''stube'', the area of the home heated by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat. The typical Swiss [[chalet]] originated in the Bernese Oberland. Chalets often face south or downhill, and are built of solid wood, with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily. Stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside, and balconies are sometimes enclosed.&lt;ref name = "Shoumatoff123ff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoumataff (2001), 134&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Schaufschod 2009 05.JPG|thumb|Herding sheep in Austria]]

Food is passed from the kitchen to the stube, where the dining room table is placed. Some meals are communal, such as [[fondue]], where a pot is set in the middle of the table for each person to dip into. Other meals are still served in a traditional manner on carved wooden plates. Furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved and in many Alpine countries carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation.
[[File:Toit de Lauzes.jpg|thumb|left|Alpine chalet being built in Haute-Maurienne (Savoy), the use of thick pieces of [[orthogneiss]] (4–7&amp;nbsp;cm) is in accordance with the strict architural regulations in the region bordering the national parks of Vanoise-Grand Paradis.]]
Roofs are traditionally constructed from Alpine rocks such as pieces of [[schist]], gneiss or [[slate]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoumataff (2001), 131, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys, as in the [[Maurienne]] valley in [[Savoy]], where the amount of snow during the cold months is important. The inclination of the roof cannot exceed 40%, allowing the snow to stay on top, thereby functioning as insulation from the cold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cauesavoie.org/wp-content/uploads/Fascicule-haute-maurienne.pdf Cahier d'architecture Haute Maurienne/Vanoise]&lt;/ref&gt; In the lower areas where the forests are widespread, wooden tiles are traditionally used. Commonly made of [[Norway spruce]], they are called "tavaillon".
The Alpine regions are multicultural and linguistically diverse. Dialects are common, and vary from valley to valley and region to region. In the Slavic Alps alone 19 dialects have been identified. Some of the French dialects spoken in the French, Swiss and Italian alps of [[Aosta Valley]] derive from [[Arpitan]], while the southern part of the western range is related to [[Occitan language|Old Provençal]]; the German dialects derive from Germanic tribal languages.&lt;ref name="Shoumataff 2001, 114–166"&gt;Shoumataff (2001), 114–166&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romansh language|Romansh]], spoken by two percent of the population in southeast Switzerland, is an ancient [[Rhaeto-Romance languages|Rhaeto-Romanic language]] derived from Latin, remnants of ancient Celtic languages and perhaps [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]].&lt;ref name="Shoumataff 2001, 114–166"/&gt;

The Alps are one of the more popular tourist destinations in the world with many resorts such [[Oberstdorf]], in Bavaria, [[Saalbach-Hinterglemm|Saalbach]] in Austria, [[Davos]] in Switzerland, [[Chamonix]] in France, and [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] in Italy recording more than a million annual visitors. With over 120 million visitors a year, tourism is integral to the Alpine economy with much it coming from winter sports, although summer visitors are also an important component.&lt;ref name="Bart"&gt;Bartaletti, Fabrizio.[http://alpsknowhow.cipra.org/background_topics/alps_and_tourism/alps_and_tourism_chapter_introduction.html "What Role Do the Alps Play within World Tourism?"].

The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps, travelled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery, and stayed at the spa-resorts. Large hotels were built during the [[Belle Époque]]; [[Rack railway|cog-railways]], built early in the 20th century, brought tourists to ever higher elevations, with the [[Jungfraubahn]] terminating at the Jungfraujoch, well above the eternal snow-line, after going through a tunnel in Eiger. During this period winter sports were slowly introduced: in 1882 the first [[figure skating]] championship was held in [[St. Moritz]], and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century,&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt; as the first ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie (2006), 198&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century the Olympic Winter Games were held three times in Alpine venues: the [[1924 Winter Olympics]] in Chamonix, France; the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] in St. Moritz, Switzerland; and the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], Germany. During World War II the winter games were cancelled but after that time the Winter Games have been held in [[1948 Winter Olympics|St. Moritz (1948)]], [[1956 Winter Olympics|Cortina d'Ampezzo (1956)]], [[Innsbruck]], Austria (1964 and 1976), [[Grenoble]], France, (1968), [[Albertville]], France, (1992), and [[2006 Winter Olympics|Torino (2006)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/olympic-games "21 Past Olympic Games"].

During the post-World War I period ski-lifts were built in Swiss and Austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors, but summer tourism continued to be important; by the mid-20th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the 1970s several new villages were built in France devoted almost exclusively to skiing, such as [[Les Menuires]]. Until this point Austria and Switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports, but by the end of the 20th century and into the early 21st century, France, Italy and the Tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt; From 1980 to the present, ski-lifts have been modernized and snow-making machines installed at many resorts, leading to concerns regarding the loss of traditional Alpine culture and questions regarding sustainable development as the winter ski industry continues to develop quickly and the number of summer tourists decline.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;

Some high mountain villages are car free either because of inaccessibility of by choice. [[Wengen]], and [[Zermatt]] (in Switzerland) are accessible only by [[Aerial lift|cable car]] or cog-rail trains. [[Avoriaz]] (in France), is car free, with other Alpine villages considering becoming car free zones or limiting the number of cars for reasons of sustainability of the fragile Alpine terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (2000), 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower regions and larger towns of the Alps are well-served by motorways and main roads, but higher mountain passes and byroads, which are amongst the [[List of highest paved roads in Europe|highest in Europe]], can be treacherous even in summer due to steep slopes. Many passes are closed in winter. A number of airports around the Alps (and some within), as well as long-distance rail links from all neighbouring countries, afford large numbers of travellers easy access.&lt;ref name = "Chatré8"/&gt;

'''[[Amerigo Vespucci|Amerigo Vespucci']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s Letter from Seville''' (18 July 1500), written to his patron [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], describes experiences on [[Alonso de Ojeda]]'s May 1499 voyage. Vespucci's findings during the [[Age of Discovery]] led Europeans to believe that North and [[South America]] were not connected to [[Asia]], which was a common belief at the time and was even held by Vespucci himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/42510-amerigo-vespucci.html|title=Amerigo Vespucci: Facts, Biography &amp; Naming of America|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the surrounding controversy among many historians about which Vespucci letters were real, and which ones were forged, this particular letter of Vespucci's is notable for its detailed description of the [[Brazil]]ian coast and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Amerigo Vespucci: Pilot Major|last=Pohl|first=Frederick J.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1944|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authenticity of the Letter ==
Antonello Gerbi argues that the 1500 "Letter from Seville", the 4 July 1501 "Letter from Cape Verdi," and the 1502 "Letter from Lisbon," all written to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, are the only three authentic Vespucci letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nature in the New World: From Christopher Columbus to Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo|last=Gerbi|first=Antonello|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=Pittsburgh|pages=36|translator-last=Moyle|translator-first=Jeremy|chapter=Amerigo Vespucci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1497, Vespucci sailed with Spain and left Cadiz, Spain on his first journey where he was sailing through the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biography.com/people/amerigo-vespucci-9517978&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Letter from Seville", he wrote that "we sailed for about thirteen hundred leagues to that land from the city of Cadiz" &lt;ref&gt;Amerigo Vespucci, “Vespucci’s Letter From Seville, ” in Amerigo Vespucci, Pilot Major, ed. Fredrick Julinus Pohl (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994),76&lt;/ref&gt; However, the voyage in 1497 was to reach the West Indies instead of Brazil. Vespucci in the letter also wrote "we...discovered a very large country of Asia" &lt;ref&gt;Amerigo Vespucci, “Vespucci’s Letter From Seville, ” in Amerigo Vespucci, Pilot Major, ed. Fredrick Julinus Pohl (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994),87&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian explorer, sailed for [[Spain]] in an effort to explore [[Asia]]. By sailing southwest from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], Vespucci and his crew ended up discovering [[South America]], which he initially thought was connected to [[Asia]]. Vespucci wrote the “Letter from Seville” in [[Seville]], [[Spain]] after finishing his voyage in order to summarize all his discoveries in [[South America]]. Vespucci was satisfied with the voyage because he crossed the equator successfully and explored the tropics, which were called the Torrid Zone at that time, and investigated rivers and different plant and animal species.

	While Vespucci sailed south in the Atlantic Ocean, he and his crew became lost because of a miscalculation of only a few degrees. It was difficult for them to find the directions in the ocean by sunlight, as the equator had days and nights of equal length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vespucci|first1=Amerigo|title=Letter from Seville|date=n.d.|publisher=New York: Colombia University Press|location=New York|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing drawings and the actual locations, they fixed errors on the map. After sailing through the equator, Vespucci was able to disprove the contemporary philosophy that claimed the tropics were inhospitable to life because of the heat. Vespucci learned that the Torrid Zone was more densely populated than the surrounding areas. 
	Vespucci had arrived in Brazil by sailing into the Amazon and Pará rivers, which were connected to the Atlantic Ocean. When Vespucci and his crew sailed into the river, they struggled to find a place to dock because they were surrounded by swamps. They encountered various flora and fauna that amazed them. This huge ecosystem made Vespucci call Brazil a “terrestrial paradise.” &lt;ref name="Amerigo Vespucci 1994"&gt;Amerigo Vespucci, “Vespucci’s Letter From Seville, ” in Amerigo Vespucci, Pilot Major, ed. Fredrick Julinus Pohl (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), 81.&lt;/ref&gt; 
	The voyage for Vespucci and his crew was also full of interactions with the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_South_America|indigenous people]. When they arrived at some locations, they got off the boat with weapons. Vespucci discovered that the indigenous people were naked without shame and stated that they were of  “a different nature.” &lt;ref name="Amerigo Vespucci 1994"/&gt; Across all the places Vespucci and his crew explored, they observed that the indigenous people were cannibals. In his letter, Vespucci showed respect by mentioning the fact that the indigenous people only ate enemies and slaves, and never ate women. Some indigenous tribes reacted to the presence of explorers differently than others. Some tribes showed affection by providing food and giving gifts, whereas others were more fearful and hostile. In some situations, the explorers chose to fight and kill the indigenous people and burn down their villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vespucci|first1=Amerigo|title=Letter from Seville|date=n.d.|publisher=New York: Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vespucci and his crew also gained some new items from trade. However, they could not collect huge numbers of the goods because they were on a long voyage and only stopped temporarily.Vespucci and his crew mainly collected brazilwood for dye and cotton. Besides the encounters with the indigenous people, Vespucci discovered that each tribe they met spoke a different language. This experience had expanded Vespucci’s horizon on his perception of language diversity, which he initially thought that “in the world there [were] not more than seventy-seven languages.” &lt;ref&gt;Amerigo Vespucci, “Vespucci’s Letter From Seville, ” in Amerigo Vespucci, Pilot Major, ed. Fredrick Julinus Pohl (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

Many authors have criticized ''Letter from Seville'' as being falsified information, accusing Vespucci of never truly making the voyage to Brazil or over exaggerating his role. Thomas More describes Europe in ''Utopia: A Revised Translation, Backgrounds, Criticism'' as fundamentally corrupt, creating a culture in which Vespucci would feel encouraged to recreate experiences heard from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/562778629|title=Utopia : a revised translation, backgrounds, criticism|last1=More|first1=Thomas|date=2011|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|last2=Logan|first2=George M.|isbn=9780393932461|edition=3rd|location=New York|oclc=562778629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other's place blame on mapmakers and interpreters of Vespucci's time. Felipe Frenández-Armesto describes Vespucci as a common Italian sailor, whose writings were misinterpreted by contemporaries. Frenádez-Arnestio firmly establishes that only two of the four voyages were factual, of which Vespucci did not command. Fault is moved past him, and unto those who circulated his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/74029449|title=Amerigo : the man who gave his name to America|last=Fernández-Armesto|first=Felipe|date=2007|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781400062812|location=New York|oclc=74029449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Charles Whitney criticizes modern historians for being unable to distinguish between [[Christopher Columbus]] and Vespucci, attempting to credit both with discovering the Americas and creating mass misinformation. He argues misconceptions lie within academia, preventing a true understanding of Vespucci’s accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitney|first=Charles|date=1993|title=The Naming of America as the Meaning of America - Vespucci, Publicity, Festivity, Modernity|url=|journal=CLIO-A Journal of Literature History and the Philosophy of History|volume=22|issue=3|pages=195–219|via=Institute for Scientific Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Age of Exploration ===
The letter and the exploration it represents is part of the era known as The Age of Exploration or The Age of Discovery. It began in the 15th century and continued into the 17th century and is classified as a time when Europe expanded its knowledge of geography for trade routes and riches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/age-of-exploration-1435006|title=Begin Exploring the Age of Exploration|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It chronologically overlaps with the [[Renaissance]] and shares some of the same values such as a search for provable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://0-search.credoreference.com.dewey2.library.denison.edu/content/entry/heliconhe/renaissance/0|title=Renaissance or Revival of Learning|last=Helicon|first=|date=|website=The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather Guide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maritime explorations were often the first contact between many cultures and Europeans.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://0-search.credoreference.com.dewey2.library.denison.edu/content/entry/abccliow/the_age_of_discovery/0|title=Age of Discovery|last=Andrea|first=Alfred|date=|website=World History Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spain]] and Portugal later followed by France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands often funded the voyages&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in hopes of enriching themselves and sometimes for scientific discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://0-search.credoreference.com.dewey2.library.denison.edu/content/entry/sharpesci/discovery_age_of/0|title=Age of Discovery|last=Hamilton|first=Neil|date=|website=Scientific Exploration and Expeditions: From the Age of Discovery to the Twenty-First Century|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One impetus for the curiosity of naval exploration began when the [[Ottoman Empire]] blocked traditional trade routes such as [[Constantinople]], North Africa, and the Red Sea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Henry the Navigator]], a prince of [[Portugal]], began funding voyages for economic benefit and in hopes of a Christian expansion that would contain the spread and growing power of Islam. Notable explorers were [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Bartolomeu Dias]], [[Vasco da Gama]], [[John Cabot]], [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]], [[Jacques Cartier]], and later [[Henry Hudson]], [[Hernán Cortés]], and [[Francisco Pizarro]]. The voyages were possible through certain technological advancements such as astrolabes, magnetic compasses, and triangular sails as well as more reliable maps and mapping systems. Many of the technological knowledge of these advancements were developed elsewhere and borrowed by European crews.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://0-search-credoreference-com.dewey2.library.denison.edu/content/entry/abcintrel/exploration_age_of_c_1400_1600/0?institutionId=4607|title=Age of Exploration|last=Nolan|first=Cathal|date=|website=Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technologies improved and the grasp of geography grew with further explorations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ming China was also expanding its naval knowledge during the 1400s, but in 1436 the emperor outlawed more voyages after reaching [[East Africa]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery|The Age of Exploration] challenged existing world views, improved geographic and naval knowledge, and created a global power structure that altered countless communities and cultures. Contact, as Vespucci's letter outlines, was not always a peaceful encounter. Beyond the often violent clashes of the sailor and native peoples upon arrival, the Age of Exploration gave rise to an even more violent system of colonization with disease, forced restructuring of societies, mass displacement of people from the Transatlantic slave trade, and other drastic changes that created an imbalance of power that last for centuries after the Age of Discovery.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Author ===
Amerigo Vespucci (1451-1512)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amerigo Vespucci|url=https://www.biography.com/people/amerigo-vespucci-9517978|website=Biography|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Italian sailor and accomplished navigator who made multiple voyages to the Americas under either Portuguese or Spanish funding. He eventually became a Spanish citizen. He developed a relationship with the Medici family through going to France to represent the family before the French king in 1479. His voyages were in last decade of the 15th century and first decade of the 16th century. In 1505 his career on ships ended because he began work in Spain as a consultant.His name was immortalized by German cartographer, Martin Waldseemüller, in 1507 who used the word "America" on a map of the new continent. In 1508, he became the chief navigator overseeing voyages and compiling data into maps for Spain. He continued with this well respected job until his death. Vespucci contributed to the Age of Exploration both as an explorer and Spanish official.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/amerigo-vespucci|title=Amerigo Vespucci - Exploration - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Voyages of Vespucci ===
The Voyage of 1499 was sponsored by Spain. This voyage was considered the second voyage for centuries until the 20th century when controversy arose because some historians began to believe many of the documents were forgeries, including the documents about what had been believed to be his first voyage. Due to this dispute in the records, it is unknown how many voyages he undertook. Historians are confident the voyage of 1499 took place while the reports of a previous journey are dubious. On this journey with four ships, Vespucci traveled to present day Guyana then south to the mouth of the Amazon River and continued south, potentially as far as Cape St. Augustine before turning back. On the journey home, he went to Trinidad and Hispaniola. His other verified voyage of 1501 was sponsored by Portugal. This voyage lead Vespucci to the realization that he had not reached Asia, but instead a "New World." He potentially undertook another voyage in 1504.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''As the crow flies''''', similar to ''in a [[wikt:beeline|beeline]]'', is an [[idiom]] for the most direct path between two points. This meaning is attested from the early 19th century,&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowles"/&gt; and appeared in [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'':

{{quote|We cut over the fields at the back with him between us – straight as the crow flies – through hedge and ditch.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;}}

According to [[BBC Focus]], "'As the crow flies' is a pretty common saying but it isn't particularly accurate".&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;Villazon, Luis.  [http://www.sciencefocus.com/article/do-crows-actually-fly-straight-line “Do crows actually fly in a straight line?”], [[BBC Focus]] (August 30, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;  Crows do not swoop in the air like [[swallow]]s or [[starling]]s, but they often circle above their nests.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;  Crows do conspicuously fly alone across open country, but neither crows nor bees (as in “beeline”) fly in particularly straight lines.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; Before modern navigational methods were introduced, Crows were kept upon ships and released when land was sought. Crows instinctively fly towards land.&lt;ref&gt;http://see-the-sea.org/nautical/naut-body.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Autonomous Region of Príncipe''' ({{lang-pt|Região Autónoma do Príncipe}}) is an administrative division of the Republic of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]. Established on 29 April 1995, it covers the island of [[Príncipe]] and a number of small uninhabited islands around it, with an area of {{convert|142|km2|abbr=on}} in total.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.repository.utl.pt/bitstream/10400.5/2392/1/Disserta%C3%A7%C3%A3o_anabarreira_FINAL_Vers%C3%A3o_Definitiva.pdf Cooperação Descentralizada Príncipe – Portugal: Eficiência da Existência de Redes de Cooperação] (2010), Ana Maria Luciano Barreira, [[Universidade Técnica de Lisboa]], p. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; As defined by the constitution of São Tomé and Príncipe, the Autonomous Region of Príncipe has a Regional Assembly and a Regional Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento.st/constituicao.htm#a137 Constituição, Artigo 137.º], Assembleia Nacional de S.

== Islands ==
The main island of the autonomous region is [[Príncipe]]. Others are:

== History ==
{{see also|Príncipe#History}}
In 1995, a few years after the country’s democratic transition, Príncipe became an autonomous region. The island’s first regional government was elected in the same year. The central government’s failure to hold any local election in the years thereafter caused another popular protest in June 2006 that forced Príncipe’s regional government to step down.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9420">[[File:STAPP 120 Cedros.jpg|thumb|right|Cedros]]
The coastal area known as '''Cedros''' lies on a [[peninsula]] at the South-Western end of the island of [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]]. Located at the tip of the peninsula, Cedros or Bonasse as it is more commonly known especially on maps,&lt;ref&gt;Best of Trinidad.Com/ Communities http://www.bestoftrinidad.com/communities/cedros.html&lt;/ref&gt; lies mere miles off the coast of [[Venezuela]], and is the most southern point in the [[Caribbean]]. According to a Trinidad Guardian article, " Cedros is the closest legal point of entry to Venezuelans wishing to enter Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2015-02-27/cedros-always-buzzing-v%E2%80%99zuelan-trade|title=Cedros always buzzing with V’zuelan trade|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic history==
Cedros has historically been a [[fishing|fishing village]] and [[coconut]] grove, producing much of the coconuts for harvest.

Widely considered on the island as a rural area, the proximity of Cedros to the South American mainland has led to many [[drug cartel]]s from [[South America]] trying to bring their cargoes via the [[Gulf of Paria]] into the [[Caribbean]] region or though Cedros. As a countermeasure to suppress the drug trade using [[Venezuela]], the Venezuelan government routinely sends gunships to patrol the waters between Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. Cedros is a key area in that fight. Counter-measures by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in Cedros include a jetty for quickly launching boats for drug interdiction.

==Geography==
Cedros is considered to be one of the final remaining areas that millions of years ago attached the island of [[Trinidad]] geologically to the [[South America]]n continent. Cedros is said to still share resemblance to the adjacent [[Venezuela]]n coastline 11–12&amp;nbsp;km across the passage of water known as [[Boca del Sierpe]] (Serpent's Mouth).

==Places of interest==

===Cedros Bay===
[[File:TnT Cedros Beach 1.jpg|thumb|right|Beach at Cedros]]
Cedros Bay &lt;ref&gt;TT Geo View Cedros Bay http://tt.geoview.info/cedros_bay_trinidad_and_tobago,672299p&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the bays in Cedros. According to an image published by a local photographer in 2007, when the tide was out or low, there was a large stretch of beach which appeared to be excellent for walking. The sand was a light beige and there were coconut trees on the shore of the bay. On weekends and on log weekends persons tend to drive down to coastal areas either to bathe in the sea or purchase fish for consumption or to enjoy the scenery pr to participate in hikes and other nature events.

===Hikes===
Hikes are conducted over various geographical terrain and at different times in the year. One of the hikes which is offered to the public by a public hiking group, for which a fee is paid is from Cedros to Icacos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islandhikers.com/tt-trails/cedros-to-columbus-bay-and-icacos/|title=Cedros to Columbus Bay and Icacos – Island Hikers / Fitness Walkers|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cedros Recreation Ground===
According to the Laws of Trinidad and Tobago Chapter 41:01 "Recreation Grounds and Pastures" in the First Schedule, in the county of St. Patrick, there is a "Granville Recreation Ground, (Granville Village, Ward of Cedros)"FAOLEX.FAO.Org.&lt;ref&gt;http://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/tri106219.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the main Recreation Ground of Cedros.

=== Cedros Public Cemetery===
Cedros Public Cemetery has simple and elaborate tombs and grave spots. On some of the grave spots, the boundaries of which are marked off by bricks, there is indication of recent maintenance in the white paint. However there are one or two which have an elaborate gravestone, along with information which has been carved into the tombstone as per the image in Angelo Bissessarsingh's photo of a tombstone in 2009 (See the Link to the citation).&lt;ref&gt;Flickr Photo Angelo Bissessarsingh https://www.flickr.com/photos/39646565@N05/3682839830&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the practice of holders of grave spots in cemeteries to bury their close relatives one on top of the other with a few feet of dirt between each person after a number of years have passed. Some  grave holders rent spots in different parts of the cemetery either as the spaces become available or as the family grows and the spots are used or as the finances of the family changes, which ever comes first. Given the terrain of most areas, it is practical to select spots in different locations to take account of expansion of the cemetery and or the wishes of parents with respect to burial.

===Cedros Composite Secondary School===
Cedros Composite School is located in "Bonasse Village, Trinidad" &lt;ref&gt;Trini Compass http://www.trinicompass.com/cedros_composite_school&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil fields===
According to a 2015 article in the Trinidad Express Newspapers&lt;ref&gt;Trinidad Expresshttp://www.trinidadexpress.com/20150721/business/what8217s-in-cedros-200-million-barrels-of-oil,&lt;/ref&gt; there are onshore oil deposits located in Cedros. However it is my opinion (Jennifer Bailey's) that given the current price of oil worldwide at 2016, the cost of extraction may involve considerable cash outflows which may not be receovered from the sale of oil in the near future, hence the cash outflows in certain companies may exceed the inflows at a point in time. Given the strategic importance of the extraction of oil, one may examine the needs of the  shareholders in companies and their reserves now and over time.

There are also shallow oil fields which are located in Cedros according to information provided by the Trinidad Express in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Trinidad Express http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20150721/business/what{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 8217s-in-cedros-200-million-barrels-of-oil&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cedros Public Library===
The Cedros Public Library is located in the Cedros Composite School according to the NALIS website. Thus the Public Library falls under the Authority of the National Library Information System even though it is housed in a school compound.&lt;ref&gt;NALIS Public Libraries {{cite web |url=http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Libraries/PublicLibraries/FindaPublicLibrary/tabid/63/Default.aspx?PageContentID=14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420125213/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Libraries/PublicLibraries/FindaPublicLibrary/tabid/63/Default.aspx?PageContentID=14 |archivedate=2016-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As there has been an expansion in the services which the Public Library offers, some of which are: free internet access on computers for an hour per day for a person, access to books online and access to research facilities once a person joins a Library and signs up for the service, there should be an increase in borrowings from the Cedros area with the availability of services in the Library. Also available from most NALIS Public Libraries are DVDs with movies which cater to the needs of children and adults.

==Smelter==

In 2005–06, the [[Government of Trinidad and Tobago]] led by the Prime Minister of T&amp;T – [[Patrick Manning]] announced an initiative to rapidly industrialise the Cedros area. One of the projects devised for Cedros was the establishment of an [[Alumina]] [[smelter]] plant which was backed by [[ALCOA]]. Residents living in the Cedros area opposed the project. The plant was touted as becoming one of the biggest alumina smelter plants in the world once completed; however, residents in Cedros claimed that ash from the plant could contaminate the local area's soil and may lead to possible [[respiratory]]-health issues in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savingiceland.org/node/310?PHPSESSID=ec2a7e79|title=Saving Iceland » Alcoa Facing Growing Protests Over Proposed Trinidad Smelter|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20051228/business/business9.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021744/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20051228/business/business9.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opm.gov.tt/news/index.php?pid=2001&amp;nid=sp060329|title=Office of the Prime Minister|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/index.pl/article_news?id=160973771]&lt;/ref&gt; The Smelter project was cancelled in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9I4JKFO0.htm

'''Chilenia''' was an ancient [[microcontinent]] or [[terrane]] whose history affected many of the older rocks of central [[Chile]] and western [[Argentina]]. It was once separated by [[oceanic crust]] from the [[Cuyania]] terrane to which it accreted at ~420-390 Ma when Cuyania was already amalgamated with [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sp.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/abstract/246/1/305] Rapalini, A.E. 2005.

A '''community of place''' or '''place-based community''' is a [[community]] of people who are bound together because of ''where'' they reside, work, visit or otherwise spend a continuous portion of their time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote="The 'spatial community' is that which is defined by geography (e.g. municipal boundary, health region)".|vauthors=Ramsey D, Beesley KB|url=http://www.rrh.org.au/articles/subviewnew.asp?ArticleID=850|title='Perimeteritis' and rural health in Manitoba, Canada: perspectives from rural healthcare managers|journal=Rural and Remote Health (Internet) |volume=7|issue=4|page=850|year=2007|pmid=18081449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a community can be a [[neighborhood]], [[town]], [[coffeehouse]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], [[gathering place]], [[public space]] or any other geographically specific place that a number of people share, have in common or visit frequently. A community offers many appealing features of a broader social relationship: Safety, familiarity, support and loyalties as well as appreciation. Appreciation that is founded on efforts and contribution to the community, rather than the efforts, rank or status of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDMyfMqgdHEC|title=Community and the Politics of Place|last=Kemmis|first=Daniel|date=1992-01-01|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806124773|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in technology, transportation and communication have evolved the concept of place and the limits society once had in interactions with one another. With these advances, barriers have been lifted and distance is no longer such a great factor in anchoring the flow of people, goods or information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gieryn|first=Thomas F.|date=2000-01-01|title=A Space for Place in Sociology|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=26|pages=463–496|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.463|jstor=223453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variables of a community ==

When identifying what it is that makes a community, it is important to break it down and understand the components that sociologist have found that creates solidarity between the community and its members. German Sociologist and Philosopher Ferdinand Tönnies spoke of these components as evolutionary terms in his theoretical essay ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brint|first=Steven|date=March 2001|title=''Gemeinschaft'' Revisited: A Critique and Reconstruction of the Community Concept|url=http://www.asanet.org/images/members/docs/pdf/featured/soth125.pdf|journal=Sociological Theory|doi=10.1111/0735-2751.00125|pmid=|publisher=American Sociological Association|volume=19|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (translated to Community and Society). ''Gemeinschaft'' would represent the childhood of humanity where as ''Gesellschaft'' would represent the maturity of humanity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'' ===

''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' or community is smaller in number of members; its members usually share a common way of life (occupation/daily activities), common beliefs. Members have frequent interaction with one another as well as a tie of emotional bonds and distance from centers of power.

''[[Gesellschaft]]'' or society is much larger in terms of its members. Contrary to ''Gemeinschaft'', members do not share the same ways of life or beliefs. Members rarely interact with one another and have loose connections to each other. As well as being closer to establishments of power and regulated competitiveness among its members. This type of bond is most often found in urban communities that follow specific systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sharing the Cost and Benefits of Resource Activity|last=Barrera-Hernández|first=Lila|publisher=UOP Oxford|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defining "place" ===
A "place" should be thought of as a geographic location, its material form and the investments of meaning and value; the combination of these concepts make a "place" a place. Geographic location is important because this is used to identify what and where a place is. This concept gives individuals a sense of direction and reference to location. The material form is physicality of the place, whether it be artificially made like a building belonging to an institution or establishment or a natural from, such as a well known land mass. Finally, the meanings and value of place is the shared meaning or psych of a location. For example, the understanding of an area or neighborhood to reflect some historic value, prestigious families, Utopian or a dangerous.

A place is not space; Space can be though of distance, size, direction- usually descriptions of geometric items. Space however can become a place when filled with things spoken of earlier, such as: Cultural practices, things, values and of course people. People of a place are usually influenced or are at least conscious of the strong and unique influential forces a place passes onto its people. Every place will exhibit its own unique and independent force of influence that consequently generates social life.

If one of the three defining features (location, material form and meaningfulness) is analyzed as having greater importance than another defining feature, the identity and definition of place is quash. The focus, favoritism or forgotten of any key feature (when defining place) prevents social construction. A place is more than a variable of social life, it is in fact what molds together social life. Creating solidarity, cohesion to form what is social life. Place often becomes a lens people use to see life through. It impacts an individuals evaluation of others and their identity, political position and practices as well as a tool to measure one's own life.

=== Constructing place ===
The modern globalized world has had impact on the construction of place and the relationship among different places. Politicians, financial establishments, engineers and architects are just a few of the occupations we can look at to break down the construction of place. When looking at the architecture of a place, we are looking at its material form. This material, these structures an architect produces are symbols of the experiences, styles and cultural influence a place had or has on the individual. In fact the architect could as well construct structures to celebrate the history of an area, the achievements of a hero or heroine and compliment the surrounding area the structure will be built in. By doing so, the architect is creating a look or feel that people can associate with the area.

[[Globalization]] as well had impact on the social identity of a community, creating competition among all members of the globalized world. For example, larger "major cities" tend to be proud of its identity it has generated and will continue to pursue this identity. Inspiring smaller cities to pursue this identity as well or one of a new face. In this light, politicians and media play a role in constructing the use of land in a geographic area. Cities are built and develop cultural meaning that conform with economic interests.

People inhabiting a place as well help with validity and creation of place. Individuals assimilate the meaningfulness, functionality, name and identity of a space – especially the more in contact they are with the area. The homogeneity of design and architecture of a given neighborhood allows members to identify the class of people as well as name of the area. Quite similar to how people address personal occupation by uniform, the sameness of a given area works in a similar fashion. This same reasoning occurs with structures that are unique; its individuality stands out so much, people assign meaning and identity to it. As stated before, place is not only conceptualized as a location but by the meanings, functionality and qualities people assign to the social stuff that are there. "Place-Stratification" is a consequence of such identity creation: public or private, rich or poor, black or white, safe or dangerous, etc.

The same conceptualization is used on a larger scale; take nationalism or continents for example. Africa and Europe are not divided by physical features such as bodies of water or "real" borders. Instead they are divided among Geo-political borders that are impacted by cultural beliefs, social practices and overall homogeneity. Although these borders are created through personal whim the consequences of there actions on other place's are very real. For example, the impacts that imperialism and colonization had on the land and life-style of Natives.

== Functions of place ==
A place stabilizes social life and gives durability to social structures, creates [[Social stratification|social hierarchies]] and [[social network|network]]s as well as solidarity among its members through frequent face to face interactions, cultural norms, shared identities, memories and values.

However, there are two arguments made when creating community of place: engagement and estrangement. 
* Engagement: Sophistication, diversity, tolerance, public participation, integration, network formation, freedom and civil negotiation.  
* Estrangement: Anonymity, detachment, privatization, formal social controls, individualism, disconnection, isolation, lack of community or solidarity.

=== Stratification ===
Social arenas that are inviting and successfully make visitors feel comfortable – like, but not limited to, parks, libraries, and plazas – help to reinforce engagement among community members. These social arenas bring together a variety of different people and allow them to communicate, experience and learn differences of one another. Just as structures can be built to reinforce solidarity and engagement, the construction of social arenas can as well develop estrangement. Take neighborhoods that are closed off by gates or are further in distance from city centers, where access is limited by travelling at high speeds to and from in a private vehicle. Invisible barriers such as price of property and proximity to stores, workplaces and civic centers work as well as agents of social stratification – usually based on things such as race, ethnicity and/or gender.

=== Collective action ===
Place can work as a catalyst for [[collective action]] – social movements, protests, formation of labor unions, etc. As stated before, the solidarity that is created among individuals, the shared experiences and loyalty to members help with the formation of these movements. Researchers and their efforts have seen this phenomenon occur across multiple social movements and have dissected it so much so, they have pinpointed how proximity and solidarity has effected the response of collective action. The revolt of peasants in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth century is a good example of proximity and its effects of cohesion. Villages that were further from centers of political power were more likely to rally than elitist or people that were so far they were essentially isolated from political centers.

Loyalty, sentimental and emotional bonds are created between people as place brings them together. The attachment begins through biographical experiences: traumatic, fulfilling, even secret events that happen to individuals personally at that place. Other research explain that attachment is developed through proximity and shared cultural process like living in the same building and emotional meanings of hanging out and having a good time in a local coffee shop. Place attachment creates a sense of security and well-being as well as identifying oneself to a group and memories.

=== Norms ===
Place inscribes [[cultural norm]]s, [[Ethics|ethical]] beliefs and values in its members as well as shapes ideology around what is considered deviant or criminal behavior. There are debates on whether crime rates are affected by environment, demographic or economic variables.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Uses ==
Crowdmapping can be used to track fires, floods, [[pollution]],&lt;ref name=ukgov1/&gt; crime, political violence, the spread of disease and bring a level of transparency to fast-moving events that are difficult for [[traditional media]] to adequately cover, or problem areas&lt;ref name=ukgov1/&gt; and longer-term trends and that may be difficult to identify through the reporting of individual events.&lt;ref name=quaintance1/&gt;

During disasters the timeliness of relevant maps is critical as the needs and locations of victims may change rapidly.&lt;ref name=cnn1/&gt;

The use of crowdmapping by authorities can improve [[situational awareness]] during an incident and be used to support [[incident response]].&lt;ref name=ukgov1/&gt;

Crowdmaps are an efficient way to visually demonstrate the geographical spread of a phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ssrn1/&gt;

{{Administrative division of Poland sidebar}}
In the [[Poland|Polish]] system of local administration, a '''dzielnica''' {{IPAc-pl|dź|e1|l|'|ń|i|c|a|}} (Polish plural ''dzielnice'') is an administrative subdivision or [[quarter (country subdivision)|quarter]] of a city or town. A dzielnica may have its own elected council (''[[rada dzielnicy]]'', or ''dzielnica council''), and those of [[Warsaw]] each have their own [[mayor]] (''burmistrz''). Like the [[osiedle]] and [[sołectwo]], a dzielnica is an auxiliary unit (''jednostka pomocnicza'') of a [[gmina]]. These units are created by decision of the gmina council, and do not have [[legal personality]] in their own right. 

The subsidiary units of many towns and cities are called osiedles rather than dzielnicas, although it is also possible for osiedles to exist within a dzielnica. Numbers and sizes of dzielnicas vary significantly between cities. Warsaw has 18 dzielnicas, as does [[Kraków]]; [[Gdańsk]] has 34, [[Gdynia]] 22, [[Lublin]] 27, [[Katowice]] 22 and [[Szczecin]] 4. Some cities are no longer formally divided into dzielnicas, although formerly existing dzielnicas continue to be referred to as such and serve as areas of jurisdiction for administrative offices. [[Łódź]], [[Wrocław]] and [[Poznań]] are each divided into five districts of this type. 

The word ''dzielnica'' is also used informally in Polish to refer to any distinct part of a town or city. Historically it can also refer to a region of the country, in particular any of the five principalities into which Poland was divided following the death of [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]] in 1138; see [[Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty]].

The '''''Étoile''''' ("''Star''") was originally built between 1759 and 1762 as a [[fluyt]] named ''Placelière'', purchased while still on the stocks for the King's ([[Louis XIV]]'s) Navy on 4 August 1762. She was renamed ''Étoile'' in April 1763, and re-classed as a [[corvette]]. She is famous for being one of [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]'s ships in his [[circumnavigation]] between 1766 and 1769, along with ''[[French frigate La Boudeuse (1766)|La Boudeuse]]''. She was commanded by Francois Chenard de la Giraudais, and was the storeship of the expedition. 
She carried naturalist and physician [[Philibert Commerçon]], astronomer [[Pierre-Antoine Veron]], and [[Jeanne Baré]] who is recognized as the first woman to have completed a voyage of circumnavigation.  During much of the voyage, she was disguised as a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Monsieur Baret: First Woman Around the World |first=John |last=Dunmore |publisher=Heritage Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-908708-54-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Discovery of Jeanne Baret |first=Glynis |last=Ridley |publisher=Crown Publisher New York |year=2010 |isbn=0-307-46352-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Colombia is a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] country largely situated in the northwest of [[South America]], with territories in [[North America]]. Colombia is bordered to the northwest by [[Panama]]; to the east by [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]]; to the south by [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]];&lt;ref name = "Land borders"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/en/politica/fronteras-terrestres|title= The Republic of Colombia shares land borders with five (5) countries |publisher = cancilleria.gov.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it shares maritime limits with [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Jamaica]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Haiti]].&lt;ref name = "Maritime borders"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/en/politica/fronteras-maritimas|title= Maritime borders|publisher = cancilleria.gov.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNAL&gt;[http://www.virtual.unal.edu.co/cursos/humanas/2004878/docs_curso/contenido/c4l1geologica.htm {{es icon}} UNAL:    History of the Colombian current territory]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} UNAL Accessed 23 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Colombia is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|26th largest nation]] in the [[world]] and the fourth-largest country in South America after Brazil, [[Argentina]], and Peru.&lt;ref name=DANE&gt;[http://www.dane.gov.co/dane_censo/mapa/censo2005/Ficha/2004.htm DANE: 2005 Census of Colombia - total area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403225542/http://www.dane.gov.co/dane_censo/mapa/censo2005/Ficha/2004.htm |date=2013-04-03 }} dane.gov.co Accessed 23 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its large territory, Colombia's population is not evenly distributed, with most Colombians living in the mountainous western portion of the country as well as the northern coastline, most living in or near the capital city of [[Bogotá]]. The southern and eastern portions of the country are mostly sparsely inhabited tropical rainforest, and inland tropical plains containing large estates or large livestock farms, oil and gas production facilities, small farming communities and indigenous tribes.

==Main ==

Colombia usually classifies its geography into five [[natural regions]], from the [[Andes|Andes mountain range]], a region shared with [[Ecuador]], [[Venezuela]]; the [[Pacific Ocean]] [[Pacific Coast|coastal]] region shared with [[Panama]] and [[Ecuador]]; the [[Caribbean Sea]] coastal region, shared with Venezuela and Panama; the ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]'' (plains), shared with Venezuela; to the [[Amazon Rainforest]] region shared with Venezuela, [[Brazil]], [[Peru]] and Ecuador. Colombia is the only South American country which borders both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Despite this ''[[The World Factbook]]'' makes no difference between [[Amazon River|Amazon]] region of Colombia (predominantly jungle) and the Orinoquia region of Colombia (predominantly plains). ''The World Factbook'' considers most appropriate to divide the country into four geographic regions: the Andean highlands, consisting of the three Andean ranges and intervening valley lowlands; the Caribbean lowlands coastal region; the Pacific lowlands coastal region, separated from the Caribbean lowlands by swamps at the base of the Isthmus of Panama; and eastern Colombia, the great plain that lies to the east of the [[Andes|Andes Mountains]].

The chief western mountain range, the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Cordillera Occidental]], is a moderately high range with peaks reaching up to about {{convert|15000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} (4,670 m).&lt;ref name="andesmap"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate=2011-01-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cauca River Valley]], an important agricultural region with several large cities on its borders, separates the Cordillera Occidental from the massive [[Cordillera Central, Colombia|Cordillera Central]]. Several snow-clad volcanoes in the Cordillera Central have summits that rise above {{convert|17000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. The valley of the slow-flowing and muddy [[Magdalena River]], a major transportation artery, separates the Cordillera Central from the main eastern range, the Cordillera Oriental. The peaks of the Cordillera Oriental are moderately high. This range differs from Colombia's other mountain ranges in that it contains several large basins. In the east, the sparsely populated, flat to gently rolling eastern lowlands called ''[[plain|llanos]]'' cover almost 60 percent of the country's total land area.

This cross section of the republic does not include two of Colombia's regions: the Caribbean coastal lowlands and the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], both in the northern part of the country. The lowlands in the west are mostly swampy; the reed-filled marshes of the area are called ''ciénagas'' by the people of Colombia. The [[Guajira Peninsula]] in the east is semiarid. The [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] is a spectacular triangular snowcapped block of rock that towers over the eastern part of this lowland. Here can be found the highest peak of the country named [[Pico Cristobal Colon]] (5775 m).&lt;ref name="andesmap" /&gt;

===Andean region===
{{Main|Andean Region of Colombia}}

[[Image:Rabanal.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Páramo of Rabanal]], [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]].]]
[[Image:Usgs-glaciers-colombia.png|thumb|right|250px|Glaciers in Colombia.]]

Near the Ecuadorian frontier, the Andes Mountains divide into three distinct, roughly parallel chains, called cordilleras, that extend northeastward almost to the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Altitudes reach more than {{convert|18700|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and mountain peaks are permanently covered with snow. The elevated basins and plateaus of these ranges have a moderate climate that provides pleasant living conditions and in many places enables farmers to harvest twice a year. Torrential rivers on the slopes of the mountains produce a large [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] potential and add their volume to the navigable rivers in the valleys. In the late 1980s, approximately 78 percent of the country's population lived in the Andean highlands.

The Cordillera Occidental in the west, the Cordillera Central in the center, and the Cordillera Oriental in the east have different characteristics. Geologically, the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Central form the western and eastern sides of a massive crystalline arch that extends from the Caribbean lowlands to the southern border of Ecuador. The Cordillera Oriental, however, is composed of folded stratified rocks overlying a crystalline core.

The Cordillera Occidental is relatively low and is the least populated of the three cordilleras. Summits are only about {{convert|9840|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level and do not have permanent snows. Few passes exist, although one that is about {{convert|4985|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level provides the major city of [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]] with an outlet to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The relatively low elevation of the cordillera permits dense vegetation, which on the western slopes is truly tropical.

The Cordillera Occidental is separated from the Cordillera Central by the deep rift of the Cauca Valley. The Río Cauca rises within {{convert|124|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} of the border with [[Ecuador]] and flows through some of the best farmland in the country. After the two cordilleras converge, the Cauca Valley becomes a deep gorge all the way to the Caribbean lowlands.

The Cordillera Central is the loftiest of the mountain systems. Its crystalline rocks form a towering wall dotted with snow-covered volcanoes that is {{convert|500|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} long. There are no plateaus in this range and no passes under {{convert|10825|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. The highest peak in this range, the [[Nevado del Huila]], reaches {{convert|17602|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. The second highest peak is a volcano, [[Nevado del Ruiz]], which erupted violently on November 13, 1985. Toward its northern end, this cordillera separates into several branches that descend toward the Caribbean coast.

Between the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera Oriental flows the [[Magdalena River]]. This {{convert|1600|km|mi|0|adj=on|sp=us}}-long river rises near a point some {{convert|180|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the border with Ecuador, where the Cordillera Oriental and the Cordillera Central diverge. Its spacious drainage area is fed by numerous mountain torrents originating high in the snowfields. The Magdalena River is generally navigable from the Caribbean Sea as far as the town of [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]], deep in the interior, but is interrupted midway by rapids. The valley floor is very deep; nearly {{convert|800|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the river's mouth the elevation is no more than about {{convert|300|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.

In the Cordillera Oriental at elevations between {{convert|2500|and|2700|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, three large fertile basins and a number of small ones provide suitable areas for settlement and intensive economic production. In the basin of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]], where the Spanish found the Chibcha Indians, the European invaders established the town of Santa Fe de Bogotá (present-day [[Bogotá]]) at an elevation of {{convert|2650|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level.

To the north of Bogotá, in the densely populated basins of [[Chiquinquirá]] and [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], are fertile fields, rich mines, and large industrial establishments that produce much of the national wealth. Still farther north, where the Cordillera Oriental makes an abrupt turn to the northwest near the border with [[Venezuela]], the highest point of this range, the Sierra Nevada de Cocuy, rises to {{convert|5493|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level. In the [[Santander Department|department of Santander]], the valleys on the western slopes are more spacious, and agriculture is intensive in the area around [[Bucaramanga]]. The northernmost region of the range around [[Cúcuta]] is so rugged that historically it has been easier to maintain communications and transportation with Venezuela than with the adjacent parts of Colombia.

===Caribbean region===
{{Main|Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean Natural Region, Colombia}}
[[Image:Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta desde el espacio.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], the highest standing mountain by the sea.]]

The Caribbean lowlands consist of all of Colombia north of an imaginary line extending northeastward from the [[Gulf of Urabá|Golfo de Urabá]] to the Venezuelan frontier at the northern extremity of the Cordillera Oriental. The semiarid [[Guajira Peninsula]] and [[Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub]], in the extreme north, bear little resemblance to the rest of the region. In the southern part rises the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], an isolated mountain system with peaks reaching heights over {{convert|5700|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and slopes generally too steep for cultivation.

The Caribbean lowlands region is in roughly the shape of a triangle, the longest side of which is the coastline. Most of the country's commerce moves through Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, and the other ports located along this important coast. Inland from these cities are swamps, hidden streams, and shallow lakes that support banana and cotton plantations, countless small farms, and, in higher places, cattle ranches.

The city of Cartagena is a petrochemical, seaport(#1 in the country) and tourist city(#1 in the country). Santa Marta is also a seaport and tourist city but is a smaller-scale city by comparison. Barranquilla is located some {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} from the Caribbean coastline but it is a more  developed city with a greater number of industries and commercial places, widely known for its abilities in all forms of metalwork and construction . Its inhabitants have the highest education level of the region and the city is famous for  being the starting point and focus of the region and the country's development as the first city in the country with the use of phones, public lighting, air mail, planes and industrial works.

The Caribbean region merges next to and is connected with the Andean highlands through the two great river valleys. After the Andean highlands, it is the second most important region in economic activity. Approximately 17% of the country's population lived in this region in the late 1980s.

The region also includes the peninsular archipelago of [[San Andres Island]] and the Insular Territories of Colombia, which are disputed in part by Nicaragua. However, the Colombian Navy protects such territories with the use of force when necessary to avoid foreign invasion and the islands are home to 2 important bases for defense and custom controls, formerly used for research of classified projects with civilian assistance as the local universities often research in the area of oceanography and marine biology but also in the fields of biochemistry, genetics, immunology and Colombia is known for its advances in medical fields in experimental surgery, breast implant development or prosthetics and immunology and these facilities serve as containment and secure experimentation labs to complement those in Barranquilla and other undisclosed locations within the coast territories.

The '''Insular Region''' is considered by some as a [[geopolitical]] region of [[Colombia]] which comprises the areas outside the [[continental territories]] of [[Colombia]] and includes the [[San Andrés y Providencia Department]] in the [[Caribbean sea]] and the [[Malpelo Island|Malpelo]] and [[Gorgona, Colombia|Gorgona]] Islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Insular region subregions include other group of [[island]]s;

* [[Archipiélago de San Bernardo]] (in the [[Morrosquillo Gulf]], Caribbean).
* [[Islas del Rosario]] (Caribbean)
* [[Isla Fuerte]] (Caribbean)
* [[Isla Barú]] (Caribbean)
* [[Isla Tortuguilla]] (Caribbean)
* [[Isla Tierra Bomba]] (Caribbean)

===Pacific region===
{{Main|Pacific Region of Colombia}}

The western third of the country is the most geographically complex. Starting at the shore of the Pacific Ocean in the west and moving eastward at a latitude of [[5th parallel north|5 degrees north]], a diverse sequence of features is encountered. In the extreme west are the very narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands, which are backed by the [[Baudó Mountains|Serranía de Baudó]], the lowest and narrowest of Colombia's mountain ranges. Next is the broad region of the [[Atrato River|Río Atrato]]/[[San Juan River (Colombia)|Río San Juan]] lowland, which has been proposed as a possible alternate to the [[Panama Canal]] as a human-made route between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Colombia occupies most of the Andes mountain range northern extremity sharing a bit with Venezuela which splits into three branches between the Colombia-Ecuador border.

In the 1980s, only 3% of all Colombians resided in the Pacific lowlands, a region of jungle and swamp with considerable but little-exploited potential in minerals and other resources. Buenaventura is the only port of any size on the coast. On the east, the Pacific lowlands are bounded by the Cordillera Occidental, from which numerous streams run. Most of the streams flow westward to the Pacific, but the largest, the navigable Río Atrato, flows northward to the Golfo de Urabá, making the river settlements accessible to the major Atlantic ports and commercially related primarily to the Caribbean lowlands hinterland. To the west of the Río Atrato rises the [[Baudó Mountains|Serranía de Baudó]], an isolated chain of low mountains that occupies a large part of the region. Its highest elevation is less than 1,800 meters, and its vegetation resembles that of the surrounding tropical forest.

The [[Darién Gap|Atrato Swamp]]—in Chocó Department adjoining the border with Panama—is a deep muck sixty-five kilometers in width that for years has challenged engineers seeking to complete the [[Pan-American Highway]]. This stretch, near [[Turbo, Colombia|Turbo]], where the highway is interrupted is known as the Tapón del Chocó (Chocon Plug). A second major transportation project involving Chocó Department has been proposed. A second interoceanic canal would be constructed by dredging the Río Atrato and other streams and digging short access canals. Completion of either of these projects would do much to transform this region, although it could have devastating consequences on the fragile environment.

===Orinoquía region===
{{Main|Orinoquía Region of Colombia}}

The area east of the Andes includes about 699,300 square kilometers or three-fifths of the country's total area, but Colombians view it almost as an alien land. The entire area, known as the eastern plains, was home to only 2% of the country's population in the late 1980s. The Spanish term for [[plain]]s (''llanos'') can be applied only to the open plains in the northern part, particularly the Piedmont areas near the Cordillera Oriental, where extensive cattle raising is practiced.

The region is unbroken by highlands except in [[Meta Department]], where the [[Serranía de la Macarena]], an outlier of the Andes has unique vegetation and wildlife believed to be reminiscent of those that once existed throughout the Andes.

===Amazon region===
{{Main|Amazon Region of Colombia}}

Many of the numerous large rivers of eastern Colombia are navigable. The [[Río Guaviare]] and the streams to its north flow eastward and drain into the basin of the [[Río Orinoco]], a river that crosses into Venezuela and flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Those south of the Río Guaviare flows into the [[Amazon Basin]]. The Río Guaviare divides eastern Colombia into the llanos subregion in the north and the tropical rainforest, or selva, subregion in the south.

==Climate==
{{main|Climate of Colombia}}
[[File:Colombia Köppen.svg|thumb|300px|Colombia map of [[Köppen climate classification]].]]
[[Image:Colombia.A2004117.1535.250m.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Flooding in Colombia, April 2004]]

The striking variety in temperature and precipitation results principally from differences in elevation. Temperatures range from very hot at sea level to relatively cold at higher elevations but vary little with the season. At Bogotá, for example, the average annual temperature is {{convert|15|°C}}, and the difference between the average of the coldest and the warmest months is less than 1&amp;nbsp;°C (1.8&amp;nbsp;°F). More significant, however, is the daily variation in temperature, from {{convert|5|°C}} at night to {{convert|17|°C|1}} during the day.

Colombians customarily describe their country in terms of the climatic zones: the area under {{convert|900|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation is called the hot zone (tierra caliente), elevations between {{convert|900|and|1980|m|ft|0|sp=us}} are the temperate zone (tierra templada), and elevations from {{convert|1980|m|ft|0|sp=us}} to about {{convert|3500|m|ft|0|sp=us}} constitute the cold zone (tierra fría). The upper limit of the cold zone marks the tree line and the approximate limit of human habitation. The treeless regions adjacent to the cold zone and extending to approximately {{convert|4500|m|ft|0|sp=us}} are high, bleak areas (usually referred to as the páramos), above which begins the area of permanent snow (nevado).

About 86% of the country's total area lies in the hot zone. Included in the hot zone and interrupting the temperate area of the Andean highlands are the long and narrow extension of the Magdalena Valley and a small extension in the Cauca Valley. Temperatures, depending on elevation, vary between {{convert|24|and|38|°C|°F|1}}, and there are alternating dry and wet seasons corresponding to summer and winter, respectively. Breezes on the Caribbean coast, however, reduce both heat and precipitation.

Rainfall in the hot zone is heaviest in the Pacific lowlands and in parts of eastern Colombia, where rain is almost a daily occurrence and rain forests predominate. Precipitation exceeds {{convert|7600|mm|in|1|sp=us}} annually in most of the Pacific lowlands, making this one of the wettest regions in the world. The highest average annual precipitation in the world is estimated to be in Lloro, Colombia, with {{convert|13299|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020927021958/http://www0.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation]. ''[[National Climatic Data Center]]''.  August 9, 2005.  Last accessed January 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern Colombia, it decreases from {{convert|6350|mm|in|0|sp=us}} in portions of the Andean piedmont to {{convert|2540|mm|in|0|sp=us}} eastward. Extensive areas of the Caribbean interior are permanently flooded, more because of poor drainage than because of the moderately heavy precipitation during the rainy season from May through October.

The temperate zone covers about 8% of the country. This zone includes the lower slopes of the Cordillera Oriental and the Cordillera Central and most of the intermontane valleys. The important cities of Medellín ({{convert|1487|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}) and Cali ({{convert|1030|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}) are located in this zone, where rainfall is moderate and the mean annual temperature varies between {{convert|19|and|24|°C|°F|1}}, depending on the elevation. In the higher elevations of this zone, farmers benefit from two wet and two dry seasons each year; January through March and July through September are the dry seasons.

[[Image:Rio Atrato.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Atrato River]].]]

The cold or cool zone constitutes about 6% of the total area, including some of the most densely populated plateaus and terraces of the Colombian Andes; this zone supports about onefourth of the country's total population. The mean temperature ranges between {{convert|10|and|19|°C|°F|1}}, and the wet seasons occur in April and May and from September to December, as in the high elevations of the temperate zone.

Precipitation is moderate to heavy in most parts of the country; the heavier rainfall occurs in the low-lying hot zone. Considerable variations occur because of local conditions that affect wind currents, however, and areas on the leeward side of the Guajira Peninsula receive generally light rainfall; the annual rainfall of {{convert|350|mm|in|1|sp=us}} recorded at the Uribia station there is the lowest in Colombia. Considerable year-to-year variations have been recorded, and Colombia sometimes experiences droughts.

Colombia's geographic and climatic variations have combined to produce relatively well-defined "ethnocultural" groups among different regions of the country: the Costeño from the Caribbean coast; the Caucano in the Cauca region and the Pacific coast; the Antioqueño in Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, and Valle del Cauca departments; the Tolimense in Tolima and Huila departments; the Cundiboyacense in the interior departments of Cundinamarca and Boyacá in the Cordillera Oriental; the Santandereano in Norte de Santander and Santander departments; and the Llanero in the eastern plains. Each group has distinctive characteristics, accents, customs, social patterns, and forms of cultural adaptation to climate and topography that differentiates it from other groups. Even with rapid urbanization and modernization, regionalism and regional identification continued to be important reference points, although they were somewhat less prominent in the 1980s than in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Colombia's proximity to the equator influences its climates. The lowland areas are continuously hot. Altitude affects temperature greatly. Temperatures decrease about {{convert|3.5|F-change}} for every {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|adj=on}} increase in altitude above sea level. Rainfall varies by location in Colombia, tending to increase as one travels southward. This is especially true in the eastern lowlands. For example, rainfall in parts of the [[Guajira Peninsula]] seldom exceeds {{convert|30|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year. Colombia's rainy southeast, however, is often drenched by more than {{convert|200|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain per year. Rainfall in most of the rest of the country runs between these two extremes.

==Vegetation==
{{See also|Fauna of Colombia|Flora of Colombia}}

Altitude affects not only temperature, but also vegetation. In fact, altitude is one of the most important influences on vegetation patterns in Colombia. The mountainous parts of the country can be divided into several vegetation zones according to altitude, although the altitude limits of each zone may vary somewhat depending on the latitude.

The "tierra caliente" (hot land), below {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}, is the zone of tropical crops such as bananas. The tierra templada (temperate land), extending from an altitude of {{convert|1000|to|2000|m|abbr=on}}, is the zone of coffee and maize. Wheat and potatoes dominate in the "tierra fría" (cold land), at altitudes from {{convert|2000|to|3200|m|abbr=on}}. In the "zona forestada" (forested zone), which is located between {{convert|3200|and|4000|m|abbr=on}}, many of the trees have been cut for firewood. Treeless pastures dominate the páramos, or alpine grasslands, at altitudes of {{convert|4000|to|4500|m|abbr=on}}. Above {{convert|4500|m|abbr=on}}, where temperatures are below freezing, is the "tierra helada", a zone of permanent snow and ice.

Vegetation also responds to rainfall patterns. A scrub woodland of scattered trees and bushes dominates the semiarid northeast. To the south, savannah (tropical grassland) vegetation covers the Colombian portion of the llanos. The rainy areas in the southeast are blanketed by tropical rainforest. In the mountains, the spotty patterns of precipitation in alpine areas complicate vegetation patterns. The rainy side of a mountain may be lush and green, while the other side, in the rain shadow, may be parched.

==Relief==
[[Image:Mapa de Colombia (relieve).svg|thumb|right|250px|Relief map of Colombia]]

The Andean range is located in Colombia from the southwest (Ecuador border) toward the northeast (Venezuela border) and is divided in the [[Colombian Massif]] (''Macizo Colombiano'') in three ranges ([[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|East Andes]], [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Central Andes]] and [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|West Andes]]) that form two long valleys, [[Magdalena River Valley|Magdalena]] and [[Valle del Cauca|Cauca]] follow by the rivers of the same name.

The eastern half of Colombia, comprising more than half its territory, is plain and composed by [[savanna]] and [[rainforest]], crossed by rivers belonging to the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Orinoco]] basins.  The northern part, called "Los [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]" is a savanna region, mostly in the Orinoco basin (therefore called also Orinoquía).  The southern part is covered by the Amazon rain forest and belongs mostly to the Amazon basin.  It is usually called Amazonía.

At the north and west of the Andes range there are some coastal plains.  The Caribbean plains at the north and the Pacific plains at the west.

Colombian Pacific Plains are among the most rainy parts in the world, chiefly at the north ([[Department of Chocó|Chocó]]).

The highest mountain in Colombia is not in the Andes but in the Caribbean plain: [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] with its highest points named Pico Cristobal Colon (5775 m) and Pico Simon Bolivar (same elevation).  Other mountains in the Caribbean plain include the [[Montes de María]] and the [[Serranía de San Lucas]].

In the Pacific Plains there are other mountain formations, chiefly the [[Serranía del Darién]] and the [[Serranía del Baudó]].

In the eastern Region, there is the [[Serranía de la Macarena]] and there are formations belonging to the [[Guyana Shield]].

==Natural resources==
{{main|Natural resources of Colombia}}

The natural resources of Colombia are varied and extensive with most of its territory and oceans still unexplored. Colombia has one of the largest  open pit coal mines in the world in the region of [[Cerrejon]] in the [[Guajira Peninsula]]. It also has oil rigs and natural gas extraction in the eastern plains. Colombia is the main producer of [[emerald]]s and an important participant in gold, silver, iron, salt, platinum, petroleum, nickel, copper, hydropower and uranium extraction.&lt;ref name=ENCARTA&gt;[http://es.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564636_2/Colombia.html Encyclopedia Encarta: Natural Resources of Colombia] Encyclopedia Encarta Accessed 24 August 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpi5Euw?url=http://es.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564636_2/Colombia.html |date=2009-11-01 }} 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental issues==
{{Main|Environmental issues in Colombia}}

[[Image:Colombia econ 1970.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Economic activity map of Colombia, 1970.]]

The main environmental issues affecting Colombia are deforestation; soil and water quality damage from overuse of pesticides; air pollution, especially in Bogota, from vehicle emissions and other main cities. The collateral damaged produced by attacks against oil pipeline infrastructure by rebel guerrillas in the Colombian armed conflict has produced long term damage to the environment. The armed groups also deforest large areas to cultivate illegal crops and open unauthorized highways in protected areas.

==Extreme points==
{{Main|Extreme points of Colombia}}
;Highest points:

Snowfields and glaciers in Colombia are limited to the highest peaks and ranges in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Oriental and above the 4,700-meter elevation on the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The total area of snowfields and glaciers was estimated to be about 104 square kilometers in the early 1970s.

Historical, geographical, and pictorial records point toward a consistent and progressive depletion of ice-and-snow masses in the Colombian Andes since the end of the "Little Ice Age" in the late 1800s. Many glaciers have disappeared during the 20th century, and others are expected to disappear in the coming decades.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386i/colombia/intro.html USGS: Glaciers of Colombia] USGS Accessed 23 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''geography of Russia''' describes the geographic features of [[Russia]], a country extending over much of northern [[Eurasia]]. Comprising much of [[eastern Europe]] and [[North Asia|northern Asia]], it is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|world's largest country in total area]].&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|title=Russia|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its size, Russia displays both monotony and diversity. As with its topography, its climates, vegetation, and soils span vast distances.&lt;ref name=climate&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia::Climate and vegetation|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-207542|accessdate=2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; From north to south the [[East European Plain]] is clad sequentially in [[tundra]], coniferous forest ([[taiga]]), mixed and broadleaf forests, grassland ([[steppe]]), and semi-desert (fringing the [[Caspian Sea]]) as the changes in vegetation reflect the changes in climate. [[Siberia]] supports a similar sequence but is predominantly taiga. The country contains forty UNESCO [[biosphere reserve]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The World Network of Biosphere Reserves&amp;nbsp;— UNESCO |title=Russian Federation |url=http://www.unesco.org/mab/BRs/EurBRlist.shtml |accessdate=December 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222011712/http://www.unesco.org/mab/BRs/EurBRlist.shtml |archivedate=February 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global position and boundaries==
[[File:Russia on the globe (+claims hatched) (Russia centered).svg|thumb|Russia on the globe.]]
Located in the north, west and east latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, most of Russia is much closer to the North Pole than to the equator. Individual country comparisons are of little value in gauging Russia's enormous size and diversity. The country's 17.09 million square kilometers include one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area. Its European portion, which occupies a substantial part of continental Europe, is home to most of Russia's industrial activity and is where, roughly between the Dnieper River and the Ural Mountains, the Russian Empire took shape. Russia includes the entire northern portion of Asia.

From west to east, the country stretches from [[Kaliningrad Oblast|Kaliningrad]] (the exclave separated by the 1990 [[Act of March 11|Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania]] from the then-[[Soviet Union]]) to [[Ratmanov Island]] (one of the [[Diomede Islands]]) in the [[Bering Strait]]. This distance spanning about {{convert|6800|km|mi}}, to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Alaska]]. From north to south, the country ranges from the northern tip of the [[Russian Arctic islands]] at [[Franz Josef Land]] to the southern tip of the [[Dagestan|Republic of Dagestan]] on the [[Caspian Sea]], spanning about {{convert|4500|km|mi}} of extremely varied, often inhospitable terrain.

Extending for {{convert|57,792|km|mi}}, the Russian [[border]] is the world's longest. Along the 20,139-kilometer land frontier, Russia has boundaries with 14 countries: [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]] (via the Kaliningrad Oblast), [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[North Korea]].

Approximately two-thirds of the frontier is bounded by seawater. Virtually all of the lengthy northern coast is well above the [[Arctic Circle]]; except for the port of [[Murmansk]]—which receives currents that are somewhat warmer than would be expected at that latitude, due to the effects of the [[Gulf Stream]]—that coast is locked in ice much of the year. Thirteen seas and parts of three oceans—the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]—wash Russian shores.

Russia shares a [[maritime boundary]] with the [[Russia-United States maritime boundary|United States]] and with [[Japan-Russia border|Japan]].

==Administrative and territorial divisions==
{{Main|Subdivisions of Russia}}
With a few changes of status, most of the Soviet-era administrative and territorial divisions of the Russian Republic were retained in constituting the Russian Federation. As of 2014, there are eighty-five administrative territorial divisions (called [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]]): twenty-two [[republics]], nine [[krai]]s (territories), forty-six [[oblast]]s (provinces), one [[autonomous oblast]], four autonomous [[okrug]]s, and three [[federal cities of Russia|cities with federal status]], namely the cities of [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], and [[Sevastopol]].

The republics include a wide variety of peoples, including northern Europeans, [[Tatars]], [[Caucasus]] peoples, and indigenous Siberians. The [[List of federal subjects of Russia by area|largest federal subjects]] are in Siberia. Located in east-central Siberia, the [[Sakha Republic]] (Yakutia) is the largest federal subject in the country (and the [[List of the largest country subdivisions by area|largest country subdivision]] in the world), twice the size of Alaska. Second in size is [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], located west of Sakha in Siberia. [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], which is a noncontiguous constituent entity of Russia, is the smallest oblast. The [[Republic of Ingushetia]] is both the smallest republic and the smallest federal subject of Russia except for the three federal cities. The two [[List of federal subjects of Russia by population|most populous]] federal subjects, [[Moscow Oblast]] (with Moscow) and [[Krasnodar Krai]], are in European Russia.

== Population geography of Russia ==
{{main|Demography of Russia}}
As of 2018, Russia has a population of 146.9 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/country/russian-federation|title=Russian Federation|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia is ranked as having the 9th largest population of any country in the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

=== Urban ===
Russia's capital, Moscow, has 12.166 million people; Saint Petersburg 4.993 million; Novosibirsk 1.497 million; Yekaterinburg 1.379 million; Nizhniy Novgorod 1.212 million; and Samara 1.164 million.  [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population]].
This makes Moscow the most populated city in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/moscow-population/|title=Moscow Population 2018 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs)|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As of 2017, 74.29 percent of the population is urbanized&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Russia/Percent_urban_population/|title=Russia Percent urban population - data, chart {{!}} TheGlobalEconomy.com|website=TheGlobalEconomy.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fertility Rate ===
The fertility rate in Russia has declined over the last 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Vladimir Putin on Raising Russia's Birth Rate|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00126.x|journal=Population and Development Review|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=385–389|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00126.x|issn=0098-7921|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proves that women are not having enough children recommended for replacement level based on Russia's population growth. The population pyramid provides a visual trend for fertility rate patterns in Russia.  

=== Birth Rate ===
In 2017, The Russian State Statistics Agency recently registered 203,400 fewer births when compared to numbers in 2016.  This shows a rate drop of around 10.7%. Previously in 2007 there were comparatively much higher numbers for this rate when 1.6 million births were recorded. According to social analysis expert Ramilya Kasanova, who works for the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Registration (RANEPA), most women of child bearing age were born in the 1990's, which would help further explain the decline, or the projected decline of the low birth rates for the next 15 years.   &lt;ref&gt;https://themoscowtimes.com/news/birth-rate-hits-10-year-low-russia-60321&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Migration Rate ===
Russia has a migration rate of 1.7 migrants per 1,000 citizens. Russia is ranked 52nd in the world in this regard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ethnicity ===
Russia's distributions of ethnicities are as follows; 77.7% Russian, 3.7% Tatar, 1.4% Ukrainian, 1.1% Bashkir, 1% Chuvash, 1% Chechen, 10.2 % Other, 3.9% Unspecified. 

=== Unemployment rate ===
Considering the total population, the unemployment is 5.5%. For Russian youths aged 15-24, the unemployment rate for males is 15.4%, 17% for females, and a total unemployment rate of 16.1%. These statistics make Russia ranked 85th in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Population distribution ===
Russia's capital, Moscow, has 12.166 million people; Saint Petersburg 4.993 million; Novosibirsk 1.497 million; Yekaterinburg 1.379 million; Nizhniy Novgorod 1.212 million; and Samara 1.164 million.
This makes Moscow not only the most populated city in Russia but also the sixth most populated city in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/moscow-population/|title=Moscow Population 2018 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs)|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population Pyramid ===
[[File:Population pyramid of Russia 2016.png|thumb|This population pyramid provides a visual representation of what the trend on a decreasing population in Russia currently looks like. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most recent population pyramid presents the fertility rate in Russian society. It shows less women are having babies, since the number of children born into society are less than the amount of women in child bearing ages. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationpyramid.net/russian-federation/2017/|title=Population Pyramids of the World from 1950 to 2100|website=PopulationPyramid.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be proven by showing the statistics provided by the population pyramid. The population pyramid provides a visual trend to show how the population is decreasing since women aren't having as much children to replace their generation. The Life expectancy of the population is that for males typically have a life expectancy of 63 years of age and females have a life expectancy of 75 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17839672|title=Russia country profile|date=2018-07-16|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Geography ==
=== LGBTQ Rights ===
While it is not inherently illegal to be in a gay relationship in Russia, same sex marriages are not recognized in Russia. Same sex sexual activities were pronounced no longer a criminal offense in 1993. Homosexuality was considered a mental illness until 1999. In 2013 President Vladimir Putin approved the outlawing of promoting a gay lifestyle to minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6488541/is-homosexuality-illegal-in-russia-how-are-lgbt-people-treated-and-what-laws-has-vladimir-putin-enacted/|title=Is homosexuality illegal in Russia, how are LGBT people treated and what laws has Vladimir Putin enacted?|date=2018-06-28|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
The National Sport of Russia is Bandy, though it is considered the 3rd most popular sport in Russia behind Ice Hockey and Football (American Soccer). &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_in_Russia|title=Sport in Russia|last=|first=|date=2018-11-06|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;Russia was the host of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with a total of 12 stadiums across 11 cities hosting games. These stadiums and cities are as follows; Kalingrad Stadium in Kalingrad,Kazan Arena in Kazan, Luzhniki Stadium and Spartak Stadium in Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod Stadium in Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov Arena in Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg Stadium in Saint Petersburg, Samara Arena in Samara, Mordovia Arena in Saransk, Fisht Stadium in Sochi, Volgograd Arena in Volgograd, and Ekaterinburg in Yekaterinburg.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Language ===
About 81 percent of Russia society speak Russian as their main language, but many of the citizens also speak English as a secondary language&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/44154-russian-culture.html|title=Russian Culture: Facts, Customs &amp; Traditions|last=|first=|date=|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Religion ===
Russia's life has always been centered around religion. There are 5,000 religious associations registered in Russia and more than half follow the Russian Orthodox Church. &lt;ref name="Culture" /&gt; Islam is the second largest religion with Christianity being the third. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sreda.org/arena|title=Главная страница проекта «Арена»|date=2012-10-19|work=Некоммерческая Исследовательская Служба "Среда"|access-date=2018-10-29|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folk Culture ===
The homeland is an important mark on Russian culture. Family is seen as a high value within Russian society since the influence of the soviet union placed a lack of trust on those outside of the family and extended family. Because Russian citizens suffered under the influence of communism, people had to turn to other family members to share resources to survive hardships. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Russia also has a lot of Russian folklore descended from the Slavic myths and traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance there are characters that depicted in a bright image while some also betray some traditional roots. The comparison of the Baba Yaga who is a witch who lives in a house on top of chicken legs and has a surrounded fence of skulls and bones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the other is Fire bird who is seen as an enchanted character and is difficult to catch   catching one of its feathers is seen as a challenge for the hero. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Both of these folklore tales can be seen as a good or bad but according to Bradford "must never be antagonized."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Popular Culture ===
Recent popular culture in Russia includes new music trends which highlight Russian Language hip-hop, an emphasis on digital trends, such as a fervor for social media, which includes but is not limited to Russian based Youtube channels as opposed to state sponsored television channels.  There has also been a movement in which business downshifting has allowed for more Russians to stay closer to home to enjoy things such as camping or hiking in the homeland, and allowing locales to further take pleasure in the currents arts and crafts movement. Political protests are nothing new, yet more and more Russians, especially women, are taking more of an interest in this shift of action to ensure that more voices are heard. Furthermore with regards to the popular culture within the political arena, 2018 also marked the anniversary of the assassination of the Romanovs, and includes the 200th birthday of Karl Marx. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/who-to-watch-what-to-do-and-where-to-go-russia-60437|title=What's Trending in Russia in 2018?|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Anthem ===
The Russian national anthem is called "Gimn Rossiyskoy Federatsii", (National Anthem of the Russian Federation).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Russia's national anthem was created by Alexander Vasilyevich Alexanrov, Sergey Mikhalkov, and Gabriel El-Registan. Alexander Vasilyevich composed the music while Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El-Registan created the lyrics. The anthem is actually an adaption from the Soviet Union's 1944 anthem.

==Topography and drainage==
Geographers traditionally divide the vast territory of Russia into five natural zones: the [[tundra]] zone; the [[Taiga]], or forest, zone; the [[steppe]], or plains, zone; the [[desert|arid zone]]; and the [[mountain]] zone. Most of Russia consists of two [[plain]]s (the [[East European Plain]] and the [[West Siberian Plain]]), two [[lowland]]s (the [[North Siberian Lowland|North Siberian]] and the [[Kolyma Lowland|Kolyma]], in far northeastern Siberia), two [[plateau]]s (the [[Central Siberian Plateau]] and the [[Lena Plateau]] to its east), and a series of mountainous areas mainly concentrated in the extreme northeast or extending intermittently along the southern border.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====East European plain====
The [[East European Plain]] encompasses most of [[European Russia]]. The [[West Siberian Plain]], which is the world's largest, extends east from the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]] to the [[Yenisei River]]. Because the terrain and vegetation are relatively uniform in each of the natural zones, Russia presents an illusion of uniformity. Nevertheless, Russian territory contains all the major vegetation zones of the world except a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical rain forest]].

====Icecaps====
[[Image:800px-Map-Tundra.png|thumb|Map of arctic tundra]]
[[Image:Laptev Sea map.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of the Russian Arctic.]]
{{further|Arctic}}
The Russian Arctic stretches for close to {{convert|7000|km|mi}} west to east, from [[Karelia]] and the [[Kola Peninsula]] to [[Nenetsia]], the [[Gulf of Ob]], the [[Taymyr Peninsula]] and the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] ([[Kolyma]], [[Anadyr River]], [[Cape Dezhnev]]). Russian islands and archipelagos in the [[Arctic Sea]] include [[Novaya Zemlya]], [[Severnaya Zemlya]], and the [[New Siberian Islands]].

About 57 percent of Russia is [[tundra]]—a treeless, marshy plain. The tundra is Russia's northernmost zone, stretching from the Finnish border in the west to the [[Bering Strait]] in the east, then running south along the Pacific coast to the northern [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. The zone is known for its herds of wild [[reindeer]], for so-called [[White night (astronomy)|white nights]] (dusk at midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and for days of total darkness in winter. The long, harsh winters and lack of sunshine allow only [[moss]]es, [[lichen]]s, and [[Dwarf Willow|dwarf willows]] and shrubs to sprout low above the barren [[permafrost]]. Although several powerful Siberian rivers traverse this zone as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean, partial and intermittent thawing hamper drainage of the numerous lakes, ponds, and swamps of the tundra. Frost weathering is the most important physical process here, gradually shaping a landscape that was severely modified by [[glaciation]] in the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]]. Less than one percent of Russia's population lives in this zone. The fishing and port industries of the northwestern Kola Peninsula and the huge [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] fields of northwestern Siberia are the largest employers in the tundra. With a population of 180,000, the industrial frontier city of [[Norilsk]] is second in population to [[Murmansk]] among Russia's settlements above the Arctic Circle. From here you can also see the auroras ([[Aurora (astronomy)|northern lights]]).

====Taiga====
Taiga - the most extensive natural area of Russia - stretches from the western borders of Russia to the Pacific. It occupies the territory of the Eastern Europe and West Siberian plains to the north of 56 ° -58 ° N and most of the territory east of [[Yenisei River]] taiga forests reach the southern borders of Russia in Siberia taiga only accounts for over 60% of Russia. In the north-south direction the eastern taiga is divided (east of the Yenisei River), with a continental climate, and west, with a milder climate, in general, the climate zone is moist, moderately warm (cool in the north) in the summer and harsh winter, there is a steady snow cover in the winter. In the latitudinal direction, the taiga is divided into three subzones - northern, middle and southern taiga. In the western taiga dense spruce and [[fir]] forests on wetlands alternate with [[pine]] forests, shrubs, and meadows on the lighter soils. Such vegetation is typical of the eastern taiga, but it plays an important role not fir and larch. Coniferous forest, however, does not form a continuous array and sparse areas of birch, [[alder]], [[willow]] (mainly in river valleys), the wetlands - marshes. Within the taiga are widespread fur-bearing animals - [[sable]], [[marten]], [[ermine]], [[moose]], [[brown bear]], [[Wolverine]], [[wolf]], and [[muskrat]].&lt;ref name="NRE"&gt;{{rp|84&amp;ndash;109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moose in lake.jpg|thumb|left|Moose]]

In the taiga is dominated by [[podzolic]] and cryogenic taiga soils, characterized by clearly defined horizontal structure (only in the southern taiga there is sod-podzolic soil). Formed in a leaching regime, poor [[humus]] om. Groundwater is normally found in the forest close to the surface, washing [[calcium]] from the upper layers, resulting in the top layer of soil of the taiga discolored and oxidized. Few areas of the taiga, suitable for farming, are located mainly in the European part of Russia. Large areas are occupied by [[sphagnum]] marshes (here is dominated by podzolic-boggy soil). To enrich the soil for agricultural purposes should be making [[Lime (material)|lime]] and other [[fertilizer]].

Russian Taiga has the world's largest reserves of coniferous wood, but from year to year - as a result of intensive logging - they decrease. Development of hunting, farming (mainly in river valleys).

====Mixed and deciduous forests====
[[File:Birches near Novosibirsk in Autumn.jpg|thumb|right|A [[birch]] forest in [[Novosibirsk]]. Birch is a [[national tree]] of Russia.]]
The mixed and [[deciduous forest]] belt is triangular, widest along the western border and narrower towards the [[Ural Mountains]]. The main trees are [[Oak]] and [[Spruce]], but many other growths of vegetation such as [[Ash tree|ash]], [[aspen]], [[birch]], [[hornbeam]], [[maple]], and [[pine]] reside there. Separating the taiga from the wooded steppe is a narrow belt of birch and aspen woodland located east of the Urals as far as the [[Altay Mountains]]. Much of the forested zone has been cleared for [[agriculture]], especially in [[European Russia]]. Wildlife is more scarce as a result of this, but the [[roe deer]], [[wolf]], [[fox]], and [[squirrel]] are very common.

====Steppe====
{{further|Eurasian Steppe|Pontic-Caspian steppe}}
The [[steppe]] has long been depicted as the typical Russian landscape. It is a broad band of treeless, grassy plains, interrupted by mountain ranges, extending from [[Hungary]] across [[Ukraine]], southern Russia, and [[Kazakhstan]] before ending in [[Manchuria]]. Most of the Soviet Union's steppe zone was located in the Ukrainian and Kazakh republics; the much smaller Russian steppe is located mainly between those nations, extending southward between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s before blending into the increasingly desiccated territory of the [[Kalmykia|Republic of Kalmykia]]. In a country of extremes, the steppe zone provides the most favorable conditions for human settlement and agriculture because of its moderate temperatures and normally adequate levels of sunshine and moisture. Even here, however, agricultural yields are sometimes adversely affected by unpredictable levels of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and occasional catastrophic [[drought]]s. The soil is very dry.

===Topography===
Russia's mountain ranges are located principally along its continental dip (the Ural Mountains), along the southwestern border (the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]]), along the border with [[Mongolia]] (the eastern and western [[Sayan Mountains]] and the western extremity of the [[Altay Mountains]]), and in eastern Siberia (a complex system of ranges in the northeastern corner of the country and forming the spine of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], and lesser mountains extending along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and the [[Sea of Japan]]). Russia has nine major mountain ranges. In general, the eastern half of the country is much more mountainous than the western half, the interior of which is dominated by low plains. The traditional dividing line between the east and the west is the [[Yenisei River]] valley. In delineating the western edge of the [[Central Siberian Plateau]] from the West Siberian Plain, the Yenisey runs from near the Mongolian border northward into the Arctic Ocean west of the [[Taymyr Peninsula]].

====Ural Mountains====
{{Main|Ural Mountains}}
[[File:Саблинский хребет.jpg|thumb|[[Yugyd Va National Park]]]]
The [[Ural Mountains]] form the natural boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]; the range extends about {{convert|2100|km|mi}} from the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the northern border of [[Kazakhstan]]. Several low passes provide major transportation routes through the Urals eastward from Europe. The highest 
peak, [[Mount Narodnaya]], is {{convert|1894|m|ft}}. The Urals also contain valuable deposits of minerals.

====West Siberian plain====
{{Main|West Siberian plain}}
[[File:Vasyugan.jpg|thumb|[[Vasyugan River]]]]
To the east of the Urals is the [[West Siberian Plain]], stretching about 6 kilometers from west to east and about 670 kilometers from north to south. With more than half its territory below 200 meters in elevation, the plain contains some of the world's largest [[swamp]]s and [[floodplain]]s. Most of the plain's population lives in the drier section south of 77 north [[latitude]].

====Central Siberian plateau====
{{Main|Central Siberian Plateau}}
The region directly east of the  West Siberian Plain is the [[Central Siberian Plateau]], which extends eastward from the Yenisei River valley to the [[Lena River]] valley. The region is divided into several [[plateaus]], with elevations ranging between 320 and 740 meters; the highest elevation is about 1,800 meters, in the northern [[Putoran Mountains]]. The plain is bounded on the south by the [[Baikal Mountains]] system and on the north by the North Siberian Lowland, an extension of the West Siberian Plain extending into the Taymyr Peninsula on the Arctic Ocean.

====Sayan and Stanovoy Mountains====
[[File:Шавлинские озера.jpg|right|thumb|[[Altay Mountains]]]]
In the mountain system west of [[Lake Baikal]] in south-central Siberia, the highest elevations are 3,300 meters in the Western [[Sayan Mountains|Sayan]], 3,200 meters in the Eastern Sayan, and 4,500 meters at [[Belukha Mountain]] in the [[Altay Mountains]]. The Eastern Sayan reach nearly to the southern shore of [[Lake Baikal]]; at the lake, there is an elevation difference of more than 4,500 meters between the nearest mountain, 2,840 meters high, and the deepest part of the lake, which is 1,700 meters below sea level. The mountain systems east of Lake Baikal are lower, forming a complex of minor ranges and valleys that reaches from the lake to the Pacific coast. The maximum height of the [[Stanovoy Range]], which runs west to east from northern Lake Baikal to the Sea of Okhotsk, is 2,550 meters. To the south of that range is southeastern Siberia, whose mountains reach 800 meters. Across the [[Strait of Tartary]] from that region is [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]], Russia's largest island, where the highest elevation is about 1,700 meters. The small [[Moneron Island]], the site of the shootdown of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]], is found to its west.

====Caucasus Mountains====
[[File:Tsmity2.jpg|thumb|Caucasus Mountains]]
Truly alpine terrain appears in the southern mountain ranges. Between the Black and Caspian seas, the [[Caucasus Mountains]] rise to impressive heights, forming a boundary between Europe and Asia. One of the peaks, [[Mount Elbrus]], is the highest point in Europe, at 5,642 meters. The geological structure of the Caucasus extends to the northwest as the [[Crimea]]n and [[Carpathian Mountains]] and southeastward into [[Central Asia]] as the [[Tian Shan]] and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]]. The Caucasus Mountains create an imposing natural barrier between Russia and its neighbors to the southwest, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

====Northeast Siberia and Kamchatka====
Northeastern Siberia, north of the Stanovoy Range, is an extremely mountainous region. The long [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], which juts southward into the Sea of Okhotsk, includes many [[volcano|volcanic peaks]], some of which are still active. The highest is the 4,750-meter [[Klyuchevskaya Sopka]], the highest point in the [[Russian Far East]]. The volcanic chain continues from the southern tip of Kamchatka southward through the [[Kuril Islands]] chain and into [[Japan]]. Kamchatka also is one of Russia's two centers of seismic activity (the other is the Caucasus). In 1995, a major earthquake largely destroyed the oil-processing town of [[Neftegorsk, Sakhalin Oblast|Neftegorsk]]. Also located in this region is the very large [[Beyenchime-Salaatin crater]].

===Drainage===

[[Image:W W Chusovaya Kama crossing.png|thumb|right|300px|Crossing of the rivers Chusovaya (tributary) and Kama (main river) near the city of Perm. Ural mountains on the right.]]

Russia is a water-rich country, divided into twenty [[Watershed district (Russia)|watershed districts]]. The earliest settlements in the country sprang up along the rivers, where most of the urban population continues to live. The [[Volga River|Volga]], Europe's longest river, is by far Russia's most important commercial waterway. Four of the country's thirteen largest cities are located on its banks: [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], [[Kazan]], and [[Volgograd]]. The [[Kama River]], which flows west from the southern Urals to join the Volga in the [[Tatarstan|Republic of Tatarstan]], is a second key European water system whose banks are densely populated.

Russia has thousands of rivers and inland bodies of water, providing it with one of the world's largest surface-water resources. However, most of Russia's rivers and streams belong to the Arctic drainage basin, which lies mainly in Siberia but also includes part of European Russia. Altogether, 84 percent of Russia's surface water is located east of the Urals in rivers flowing through sparsely populated territory and into the Arctic and Pacific oceans. In contrast, areas with the highest concentrations of population, and therefore the highest demand for water supplies, tend to have the warmest climates and highest rates of [[evaporation]]. As a result, densely populated areas such as the [[Don River, Russia|Don]] and [[Kuban River]] basins north of the Caucasus have barely adequate (or in some cases inadequate) water resources.

Forty of Russia's rivers longer than 1,000 kilometers are east of the Urals, including the three major rivers that drain Siberia as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean: the [[Irtysh]]-[[Ob River|Ob]] system (totaling 5,380 kilometers), the Yenisei (4,000 kilometers), and the [[Lena River|Lena]] (3,630 kilometers). The basins of those river systems cover about eight million square kilometers, discharging nearly 50,000 cubic meters of water per second into the Arctic Ocean. The northward flow of these rivers means that source areas thaw before the areas downstream, creating vast swamps such as the 48,000-square-kilometer [[Vasyugan Swamp]] in the center of the West Siberian Plain. The same is true of other river systems, including the [[Pechora River|Pechora]] and the [[Northern Dvina]] in Europe and the [[Kolyma River|Kolyma]] and the [[Indigirka]] in Siberia. Approximately 10 percent of Russian territory is classified as swampland.

A number of other rivers drain Siberia from eastern mountain ranges into the Pacific Ocean. The [[Amur River]] and its main tributary, the [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]], form a long stretch of the winding boundary between Russia and China. The Amur system drains most of southeastern Siberia. Three basins drain European Russia. The [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], which flows mainly through Belarus and Ukraine, has its headwaters in the hills west of Moscow. The 1,860-kilometer |Don originates in the [[Central Russian Upland]] south of Moscow and then flows into the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Black Sea]] at [[Rostov-on-Don]]. The [[Volga River|Volga]] is the third and by far the largest of the European systems, rising in the [[Valdai Hills]] west of Moscow and meandering southeastward for 3,510 kilometers before emptying into the [[Caspian Sea]]. Altogether, the Volga system drains about 1.4 million square kilometers. Linked by several canals, European Russia's rivers long have been a vital transportation system; the Volga system still carries two-thirds of Russia's inland water traffic.

Russia's inland bodies of water are chiefly a legacy of extensive [[glaciation]]. In European Russia, the largest lakes are [[Lake Ladoga|Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega|Onega]] northeast of [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Lake Peipus]] on the [[Estonia]]n border, and the [[Rybinsk Reservoir]] north of [[Moscow]]. Smaller man-made reservoirs, 160 to 320 kilometers long, are on the Don, the Kama, and the Volga rivers. Many large reservoirs also have been constructed on the Siberian rivers; the [[Bratsk Reservoir]] northwest of [[Lake Baikal]] is one of the world's largest.

The most prominent of Russia's bodies of fresh water is Lake Baikal, the world's deepest and most capacious freshwater lake. Lake Baikal alone holds 85% of the freshwater resources of the lakes in Russia and 20% of the world's total. It extends 632 kilometers in length and 59 kilometers across at its widest point. Its maximum depth is 1,713 meters. Numerous smaller lakes dot the northern regions of the European and Siberian plains. The largest of these are lakes [[Belozero]], [[Topozero]], [[Vygozero]], and [[Lake Ilmen|Ilmen]] in the European northwest and [[Lake Chany]] in southwestern Siberia.

== Agriculture Geography ==
One billion acres of land is arable in Russia but only about 0.1 percent is permanent agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/russia/Economics_Business_Agriculture/sub9_7e/entry-5178.html|title=AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE POLICY IN RUSSIA {{!}} Facts and Details|last=Hays|first=Jeffrey|website=factsanddetails.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landscapes that decorates the region is one of the most varied environments because of the following: 

*Tundra landscapes that cover most of the region, where conditions are harsh because of the cold climates and plant life is not very well supported to grow because of the harsh conditions, this has become a problem with agriculture as the unfavorable condition make agriculture more difficult.
*Mountain Ranges also are spread through the the region such as the Ural Mountains which have become the division line between European Russia Eurasia Russia and if the region were to be divided into two, this is where it would be divided
*In the region of European Russia, it is also has the European plains which extend about 2,000 miles.

When it comes to the number on the workforce that is involved in agriculture workforce it was reported to be about 9.4% of the population in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main export of Russia is grain which is about 6% of the the world trade, other products that are exported include fish and oil with 3%, meals with 2%, and meat which accounts for less that 1%. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blackseagrain.net/novosti/in-2017-the-export-of-agricultural-products-from-russia-will-exceed-20-5-billion|title=In 2017 the export of agricultural products from Russia will exceed $20.5 billion|work=UkrAgroConsult|access-date=2018-11-01|language=ru-UA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-industrial Agriculture ===
Agriculture has always been important for Russia. Russia's land was worked by its peasant class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/russia-1900-to-1939/russia-and-agriculture/|title=Russia and Agriculture - History Learning Site|work=History Learning Site|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Russia}}
[[Image:Baikal-Russia.A2003345.0355.250m.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Lake Baikal]]. Lake ice is beginning to form at the northernmost end of the lake and in a bay at the middle.]]
Russia has a largely continental climate because of its sheer size and compact configuration. Most of its land is more than {{convert|400|km|mi|sp=us}} from the sea, and the centre is {{convert|3840|km|mi|0|sp=us}} from the sea. In addition, Russia's mountain ranges, predominantly to the south and the east, block moderating temperatures from the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but European Russian and northern Siberia lack such topographic protection from the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans.

Because only small parts of Russia are south of 50° north [[latitude]] and more than half of the country is north of 60° north latitude, extensive regions experience six months of snow cover over [[subsoil]] that is [[permafrost|permanently frozen]] to depths as far as several hundred meters. The average yearly temperature of nearly all of Siberia is below freezing, and the average for most of European Russia is between {{convert|5|and|0|C|F}}. Most of Russia has only two seasons, summer and winter, with very short intervals of moderation between them. Transportation routes, including entire railroad lines, are redirected in winter to traverse rock-solid waterways and lakes. Some areas constitute important exceptions to this description, however: the moderate maritime climate of [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] on the [[Baltic Sea]] is similar to that of the [[Pacific Northwest|American Northwest]]; the [[Russian Far East]], under the influence of the Pacific Ocean, has a [[monsoon]]al climate that reverses the direction of wind in summer and winter, sharply differentiating temperatures; and a narrow, [[subtropics|subtropical]] band of territory provides Russia's most popular summer resort area on the [[Black Sea]].

In winter, an intense high-pressure system causes winds to blow from the south and the southwest in all but the Pacific region of the Russian landmass; in summer, a low-pressure system brings winds from the north and the northwest to most of the landmass. Russia is the coldest country of the world (average annual temperature is {{convert|−5.5|°C}}). That meteorological combination reduces the wintertime temperature difference between north and south. Thus, average January temperatures are {{convert|−6|°C}} in Saint Petersburg, {{convert|−27|°C}} in the [[West Siberian Plain]], and {{convert|−43|°C}} at [[Yakutsk]] (in east-central Siberia, at approximately the same latitude as Saint Petersburg), while the winter average on the [[Mongolia]]n border, whose latitude is some 10° farther south, is barely warmer. Summer temperatures are more affected by latitude, however; the Arctic islands average {{convert|4|°C|1}}, and the southernmost regions average {{convert|20|°C}}. Russia's potential for temperature extremes is typified by the national record low of {{convert|−68|°C}}, recorded at [[Verkhoyansk]] in north-central Siberia and the record high of {{convert|45|°C|1}}, recorded at several southern stations (Utta).

The long, cold winter has a profound impact on almost every aspect of life in Russia. It affects where and how long people live and work, what kinds of crops are grown, and where they are grown (no part of the country has a year-round growing season). The length and severity of the winter, together with the sharp fluctuations in the mean summer and winter temperatures, impose special requirements on many branches of the economy. In regions of permafrost, buildings must be constructed on pilings, machinery must be made of specially tempered steel, and transportation systems must be engineered to perform reliably in extremely low and extremely high temperatures. In addition, during extended periods of darkness and cold, there are increased demands for energy, health care, and textiles.

Because Russia has little exposure to ocean influences, most of the country receives low to moderate amounts of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. The highest precipitation falls in the northwest, with amounts decreasing from northwest to southeast across European Russia. The wettest areas are the small, lush subtropical region adjacent to the Caucasus and along the Pacific coast: [[Sochi]] receives {{convert|1500|mm|in|-1}} per year and the [[Kuril Islands]] typically around {{convert|1000|to|1500|mm|in|-1}} - much of which is snow. Along the Baltic coast, average annual precipitation is {{convert|600|mm|in|-1|sp=us}}, and in Moscow it is {{convert|525|mm|in|-1|sp=us}}. An average of only {{convert|20|mm|in|1|sp=us}} falls along the Russian–Kazakh border, and as little as {{convert|15|mm|in|1|sp=us}} may fall along Siberia's Arctic coastline. Average annual days of snow cover, a critical factor for agriculture, depends on both latitude and altitude. Cover varies from forty to 200 days in European Russia, and from 120 to 250 days in Siberia.

== Political Geography ==

=== Border Disputes ===
There was some dispute with its neighboring country Belarus as in early 2017 they introduce free-visa and a few months afterwards Russia put border control along the border between the two countries, which has affected Belarus state-run airlines income, Moscow responded back by saying that this measure was being taken so that it could prevent the growing threat of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://carnegie.ru/commentary/71510|title=The Boundaries of Friendship: Russia’s Border Dispute with Belarus|last=Shraibman|first=Artyom|work=Carnegie Moscow Center|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Government System ===
Russia's government has an Executive Branch, Legislative Branch, and Judicial Branch. Chief of State has been President Vladimir Putin, since May 7th, 2012. The Legislative Branch is made of the Federation Council, 170 seats, 4 year terms. The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation is made of 170 members divided up into The Judicial Panel for Criminal Affair, The Judicial Panel for Civil Affairs, and The Military Panel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Political Parties ===
The list of Russian political parties and their leaders are as follows:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* A Just Russia (Sergey Mironov)
* Civic Platform (Rifat Salakhutdinov)
* Communist Party of the Russian Federation (Gennady Zyuganov)
* Liberal Democratic Party (Vladimir Zhirinovsky)
* Rodina (Aleksei Zhuravlyov)
* United Russia (Dmitry Medvedev)

=== Suffrage ===
Suffrage is given at the age of 18 and is universal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Russian Economy ==
The recent falling in the Russian economy has turned and its momentum is expected to peak at a modest 3.1% in 2018.  Russia has shown further macro-economic security, by continuing its recovery, which has been intensified by non trading sectors. Higher energy prices, which has heightened the trade surplus, has proven to also continue the trend in strengthening the current economy. A Central Bank cleansing, has helped the State controlled banking assets growth, which helped the almost 70%increase with combined assets for the Russian Banking system.  With focus on a new digital infrastructure, new socio-economic benefits can only happen with the implementation of newer policies that can sustain and accelerate this transformation.  Although the outlook is mostly positive, the paradigm shift from the still recovering economy, forecasts show that this may not fully happen until the year 2020. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/russia/publication/rer|title=Russia Economic Report|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Trade ===
Russian foreign trade exports are mainly derived from oil and petroleum (gas and coal), steel, metals and minerals. The emphasis in export is mainly focused on the oil and petroleum industry.  Other important exports include machinery, equipment, fertilizer, timber, and natural gas.  CIS countries heavily rely on the Russian export industry, as it provides most of their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.advantour.com/russia/economy/trade.htm|title=Russia Foreign Trade - Export and Import|website=www.advantour.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia imports machinery and equipment, vehicles, consumer goods, foodstuff, chemical products, and industrial consumer goods. Major trading partners with Russia are Germany, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and Finland.

=== Russia's GDP ===
Russia's GDP was 1.578 trillion USD  in (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en|title=World Development Indicators

==Natural resources and land use==
{{further|Siberian natural resources}}
Russia holds the greatest reserves of mineral resources than any country in the world. Though they are abundant, they are in remote areas with extreme climates, making them expensive to mine. The country is the most abundant in mineral fuels. It may hold as much as half of the world's [[coal]] reserves and even larger reserves of [[petroleum]]. Deposits of coal are scattered throughout the region, but the largest are located in central and eastern [[Siberia]]. The most developed fields lie in western Siberia, in the northeastern European region, in the area around [[Moscow]], and in the [[Ural mountains|Urals]]. The major petroleum deposits are located in western Siberia and in the Volga-Urals. Smaller deposits are found throughout the country. [[Natural gas]], a resource of which Russia holds around forty percent of the world's reserves, can be found along Siberia's [[Arctic]] coast, in the [[North Caucasus]], and in northwestern Russia. Major [[iron-ore]] deposits are located south of Moscow, near the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] border in the [[Kursk Magnetic Anomaly]]; this area contains vast deposits of iron ore that have caused a deviation in the Earth's magnetic field. There are smaller deposits in other parts of the country. The Ural mountains hold small deposits of [[manganese]]. [[Nickel]], [[tungsten]], [[cobalt]], [[molybdenum]] and other iron alloying elements occur in adequate quantities.

Russia also contains most of the nonferrous metals. [[Aluminium]] ores are scarce and are found primarily in the Ural region, northwestern European Russia, and south-central Siberia. [[Copper]] is more abundant and major reserves are located in the Urals, the [[Norilsk]] area near the mouth of the [[Yenisei River|Yenisey]] in eastern Siberia, and the [[Kola Peninsula]]. Another vast deposit located east of [[Lake Baikal]] only became exploited when the [[Baikal-Amur Mainline]] (BAM) railroad was finished in 1989.

The North Caucasus, far eastern Russia, and the western edge of the [[Kuznetsk Basin]] in southern Siberia contain an abundance of [[lead]] and [[zinc]] ores. These are commonly found along with copper, [[gold]], [[silver]], and a large amount of other rare metals. The country has one of the largest gold reserves in the world; mostly in Siberia and the Urals. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] deposits can be found in the central and southern Urals and in south-central Siberia.

Raw materials are abundant as well, including [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] deposits in the [[Kama River]] region of the western Urals. Russia also contains one of the world's largest deposits of [[apatite]] found in the central Kola Peninsula. Rock salt is located in the southwestern Urals and the southwest of Lake Baikal. Surface deposits of salt are found in salt lakes along the lower Volga Valley. [[Sulfur]] can be found in the Urals and the middle Volga Valley.

Eight percent of the land is used for [[agronomy|arable farming]], four percent—for permanent [[pasture]]s, forty-six percent of the land is forests and woodland, and forty-two percent is used for other purposes.

==Natural hazards==
Volcanic activity in the [[Kuril Islands]] and volcanoes and earthquakes on the [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka peninsula]] are other natural hazards.
&lt;!--
===Geography — note===
Russia is the largest country in the world in terms of area but unfavorably located in relation to major sea lanes of the world. Despite its size, much of the country lacks proper soils and climates for agriculture, being either too cold or too dry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7441">"'''Giants of the Prairies'''" is a song by the [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[polka]] band the [[Kubasonics]].

It tells the story of the numerous "world's biggest" [[roadside attraction]]s to be found in Western Canada, especially in small towns populated mostly by [[Ukrainian Canadians]].

Brian Cherwick, the leader of the Kubasonics, has a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies]] at the [[University of Alberta]], titled "Polkas on the Prairies: Ukrainian Music and the Construction of Identity".

'''Henry Mitchell''' (September 16, 1830 – December 1, 1902) was an [[United States|American]] [[oceanographer]] and [[hydrography|hydrographer]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Nantucket]] on September 16, 1830, into a scientifically inclined family, his mother was a cousin of [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] was a friend of his father, William, who taught [[astronomy]] at [[Harvard]].&lt;ref&gt;http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/06/27/how-americas-leading-hydrographer-helped-found-the-national-geographic-society/&lt;/ref&gt; At age 19 he joined the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|US Coastal Survey]], where his first assignment was a map of the waters around his home of Nantucket. From 1856 until 1860 he worked on a map of [[New York Harbor]], which was considered the most accurate of its day. During the [[American Civil War]] he helped map the coasts of [[North Carolina]], and in 1896 he went to a tour through the [[Old World]] to study their watery engineering. There he met [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. In 1888 he helped co-found the [[National Geographic Society]], but shortly thereafter had a health crisis that prevented him from doing any work for the rest of his life. He died in his daughter's house in [[New York City]] on December 1, 1902.

'''[[La Paz]]''' was founded in 1548 by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s at the site of the [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] settlement [[Laja, Bolivia|Laja]]; the full name of the city was originally ''Nuestra Señora de La Paz'' (meaning ''[[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of [[Peace]]''). The name commemorated the restoration of peace following the [[rebellion|insurrection]] of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and fellow conquistadors four years earlier against [[Blasco Núñez Vela]], the first [[viceroy]] of [[Peru]]. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=La Paz|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|year=2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/326435/La-Paz|accessdate=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control over the former [[Inca]] lands had been entrusted to [[Pedro de la Gasca]] by the Spanish king (and Holy Roman Emperor) [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. Gasca commanded [[Alonso de Mendoza]] to found a new city commemorating the end of the civil wars in Peru; the city of La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548.

In 1549, [[Juan Gutierrez Paniagua]] was commanded to design an urban plan that would designate sites for public areas, plazas, official buildings, and a cathedral. La Plaza de los Españoles, which is known today as the [[Plaza Murillo]], was chosen as the location for government buildings as well as the Metropolitan Cathedral.

[[Spain]] controlled La Paz with a firm grip and the Spanish king had the last word in all matters political. In 1781, for a total of six months, a group of Aymara people laid siege to La Paz. Under the leadership of [[Tupac Katari]], they destroyed churches and government property. Thirty years later, Indians laid a two-month siege on La Paz – where and when the legend of the [[Ekeko]] is set. In 1809, the struggle for independence from the Spanish rule brought uprisings against the royalist forces. It was on July 16, 1809 that [[Pedro Domingo Murillo]] famously said that the Bolivian revolution was igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to turn off. This formally marked the beginning of the Liberation of South America from Spain. Pedro Domingo Murillo was hanged at the Plaza de los Españoles that night, but his name would be eternally remembered in the name of the plaza, and he would be remembered as the voice of revolution across South America.

In 1825, after the decisive victory of the [[republicanism|republican]]s at [[Ayacucho]] over the Spanish army in the course of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]], the city's full name was changed to ''La Paz de Ayacucho'' (meaning ''The Peace of Ayacucho'').

In 1898, La Paz was made the ''[[de facto]]'' seat of the national government, with [[Sucre]] remaining the nominal historical as well as judiciary capital. This change reflected the shift of the Bolivian economy away from the largely exhausted [[silver]] [[mining|mine]]s of [[Potosí]] to the exploitation of [[tin]] near [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], and resulting shifts in the distribution of economic and political power among various national [[elite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553809/La_Paz.html La Paz]," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008.

== History  of La Paz ==

! Year
! Event
|-
| 1548
| The city of La Paz was founded by [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers on the pre- existing site of Choqueyapu, an ancient Aymara village. It was founded as Nuestra Senora de La Paz (Our Lady of Peace) by [[Alonso de Mendoza]], commissioned by [[Pedro de la Gasca]], to commemorate the "pacification" of Peru. It was started as a commercial city, lying on the main gold and silver route to the coast. The Spaniards came for the Bolivian gold found in the Choqueapu River that runs through present-day La Paz. The Spaniards took the gold mines away from Aymara people and made them work as slaves. The primarily male Spanish population soon mixed with the indigenous people, creating a largely mestizo, or mixed, population.
|-
| 1549
| In November of this year, Juan Gutierrez was given the task of designing an urban plan, in keeping with the Code of the Indies (regulations on Spanish Colonial Cities from Spain). As such, he was to lay out plazas and public lands and designate sites for public buildings. The Plaza Murillo (pictured below) was later selected as the site for the city Cathedral, elite homes, and government buildings.
|-
| 1600
| As the gold slowly diminished, the city's location between [[Potosí|Potosi]] (the primary silver mining town) and [[Lima]] grew in importance, as La Paz became a main stop on the trade route. Soon La Paz was the most flourishing town in the Altiplano area of the Andes, although it was not as wealthy as Potosi.
|-
| 1800
| La Paz emerges as the largest city of Upper Peru (the early name for Bolivia) in the late 18th century, acting as the center for the population and agricultural production zone. The heavily populated [[Altiplano]] hinterland above La Paz fed its growth. Many large estate land holders, known as hacendados, lived in La Paz throughout most of the year while they maintained a small community of indigenous people to live and work on their haciendas (landed estates).
|-
| 1800
|La Paz emerged as the capital of the Intendencia, the home of a thriving commercial community, and the center of an important network of interregional and international trade routes. The majority of the absentee landed elite resided in La Paz, creating the commerce and royal treasury from which more wealth could be generated for investment in the rural zones of the Intendencia. At that time in history, the capital and its provincial hinterland were one of the wealthiest tax-producing areas in all of the Andes. This early beginning, as the home of the rich land-lords of the haciendas, is still evident in the structure of the city today, as the finest example of old Spanish Colonial Architecture seen in houses is located close to the central plazas and offices of the city.
|-
| 1809
| July 16: One of the first South American libertarian screams against the Spanish Crown is given in La Paz, in a rebellion led by Pedro Domingo Murillo and the others revolutionaries.
|-
| 1825
| Bolivia gained independence, which sparked even more growth in the city. Simón Bolívar was the first president of the Republic. The country was divided in 5 departments: La Paz, [[Cochabamba]], [[Potosí]], [[Charkas]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]].
|-
| 1840
| Bolivia started exporting more than it imported, allowing the government to engage in infrastructural investments with the surplus funds. This led to a growth of La Paz as the financial, commercial, and political capital of the area. "With new urban classes emerging, and new capital to spend, there was both increased demands for foodstuffs production and an aggressive class of urban-based capitalists willing to engage in agricultural production"(Klien 1993 134). However, at this time La Paz was virtually isolated from the rest of the world due to the poor roads and lack of rail lines leading over the harsh Altiplano to ports in [[Peru]] and [[Chile]]. Contact between La Paz and the eastern part of the country, surrounded by rainforest, was even more difficult.
|-
| 1879
| [[The Pacific War]] with Chile. The Chileans entered the country at the coast for the salitre and the guano (Nitrate-rich bird dung). The result of this brutal war was the loss of Bolivia's coast land to [[Chile]].
|-
| 1898
| La Paz becomes de facto Bolivia's new administrative capital and the seat of the government, thus starting the process of development into the large city it is today.
|-
| 1900
| Construction began on the international railroad network linking La Paz to the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, thus solidifying the future role of La Paz as a [[primate city]].  At this period in time the Bolivian government spent an annual spendings of $5,986,384.
|-
| 1921
| The first oil company came to Bolivia. Bolivia was found to have great reservoirs of oil, in addition to all the precious minerals.
|-
| 1952
| The great national revolution when the revolutionaries won the rights for the indigenous people. Their biggest accomplishment was agrarian land reform, which allowed peasants to have freedom from the obligations of working on the elite-owned land, diffusing the long-established hacienda system. This in turn sparked a great growth spurt in the city, as many working-class and poor migrated to urban areas.
|-
| 1963
|  Playing at home, Bolivia wins South American football (soccer) championships.
|-
| 1964
| Military revolution, with the help of the [[United States]], that established the dictatorial rule that would remain until 1980. The last dictator was [[General Hugo Banzer]]. He held elections in 1980, although, suspiciously, Banzer's candidate won and was president until the year 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/GEOG61/amartin/history.html |title=Macalester College Course GEOG61 |publisher=Macalester.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Water resources|Water resource]] ==
Main article: [[Water distribution on Earth]], [[Water resources|Water Resource]].

Out of all the water on [[Earth]], saline water in [[Ocean|oceans]], [[Sea|seas]] and saline [[groundwater]] make up about 97% of it. Only 2.5–2.75% is fresh water, including 1.75–2% frozen in [[Glacier|glaciers]], [[ice]] and [[snow]], 0.5–0.75% as fresh [[groundwater]] and [[soil]] moisture, and less than 0.01% of it as [[surface water]] in [[Lake|lakes]], [[Swamp|swamps]] and [[River|rivers]]. Freshwater lakes contain about 87% of this fresh surface water, including 29% in the [[African Great Lakes]], 22% in [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia, 21% in the [[North American Great Lakes]], and 14% in other lakes. [[Swamp|Swamps]] have most of the balance with only a small amount in rivers, most notably the [[Amazon River]]. The atmosphere contains 0.04% water. In areas with no fresh water on the ground surface, [[fresh water]] derived from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] may, because of its lower density, overlie saline ground water in lenses or layers. Most of the world's fresh water is frozen in [[Ice sheet|ice sheets]]. Many areas suffer from lack of distribution of fresh water, such as deserts.

== Renewable Internal Freshwater Resources per capita ==
According to the [http://www.indexmundi.com/about.html Index Mundi]’s data, [[Greenland]] ranked number 1 and [[Iceland]] number 2 in '''renewable internal freshwater resources per capita''' with 10,662,190.00 [[cubic meters]] and 519,264.70 [[cubic meters]], respectively. Renewable internal freshwater resources per capita are calculated using the [[World Bank]]'s population estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mundi|first1=Index|title=Renewable internal freshwater resources per capita|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/ER.H2O.INTR.PC/rankings|website=IndexMundi|accessdate=2016-11-14|ref=IndexMundi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of countries by traffic-related death rate''' shows the annual number of road fatalities ''per capita per year'', ''per number of motor vehicles'', and ''per vehicle-km'' in some countries in the year the data was collected.

According to the [[World Health Organization]], [[Traffic collision|road traffic injuries]] caused an estimated 1.25 million deaths worldwide in the year 2010. That is, one person is killed every 25 seconds. Only 28 countries, representing 449 million people (seven percent of the world's population), have adequate laws that address all five risk factors (speed, drunk driving, helmets, seat-belts and child restraints). Over a third of road traffic deaths in low- and middle-income countries are among pedestrians and cyclists. However, less than 35 percent of low- and middle-income countries have policies in place to protect these road users.&lt;ref name=WHO2015&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2015/en/ |title=Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015 |publisher=World Health Organisation (WHO) |editor=WHO |pages=vii, 1–14, 75ff (countries), 264–271 (table A2), 316–332 (table A10) |format=PDF |type=official report |location=Geneva|year=2015 |quote=Tables A2 &amp; A10, data from 2013 |isbn=978 92 4 156506 6 |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average rate was 17.4 per 100,000 people. Low-income countries now have the highest annual road traffic fatality rates, at 24.1 per 100,000, while the rate in high-income countries is lowest, at 9.2 per 100,000.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

Seventy-four percent of road traffic deaths occur in middle-income countries, which account for only 53 percent of the world's registered vehicles. In low-income countries it is even worse. Only one percent of the world's registered cars produce 16 percent of world's road traffic deaths. This indicates that these countries bear a disproportionately high burden of road traffic deaths relative to their level of motorization.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

There are large disparities in road traffic death rates between regions. The risk of dying as a result of a road traffic injury is highest in the African Region (increasing 26.6 per 100&amp;nbsp;000 population), and lowest in the European Region (decreasing 9.3 per 100&amp;nbsp;000).&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

Half of the world's road traffic deaths occur among motorcyclists (23 percent), pedestrians (22 percent) and cyclists (5 percent) – i.e., "vulnerable road users" – with 31 percent of deaths among car occupants and the remaining 19 percent among unspecified road users.&lt;ref name=WHO2013&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/78256/1/9789241564564_eng.pdf |title=Global Status Report on Road Safety 2013: supporting a decade of action| publisher=World Health Organisation (WHO)| editor=WHO| pages=vii, 1–8, 53ff (countries), 244–251 (table A2), 296–303 (table A10)| format=PDF| type=official report| location=Geneva, Switzerland| year=2013| quote=Tables A2 &amp; A10, data from 2010| isbn=978 92 4 156456 4| accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults aged between 15 and 44 years account for 59 percent of global road traffic deaths. Seventy-seven percent of road deaths are males.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt;

The total fatalities figures comes from the [[WHO]] report (table A2, column ''point estimate'', pp.&amp;nbsp;264–271) and are often an adjusted number of road traffic fatalities in order to reflect the different reporting and counting methods among the many countries (e.g., ''"a death after how many days since accident event is still counted as a road fatality?"'' (by international standard adjusted to a 30-day period), or "to compensate for under-reporting in some countries".&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=datatables&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2015/GSRRS2015_data/en/ |title=WHO Report 2015: Data tables |publisher=World Health Organisation (WHO) |editor=WHO |format=PDF |type=official report| location=Geneva|date=2015 |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|62-74}}

==List==
The table shows that the highest death tolls tend to be in African countries, and the lowest in European countries. The table first lists geographic regions before alphabetically sorted countries.

Christmas Island was once home to two native bat species, of which only one is extant. The [[Christmas Island pipistrelle]] was endemic to the island until 2009, when the last individual was recorded. In 2016, the species was assessed as extinct by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]].&lt;ref name=IUCNpipistrelle&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Lumsden, L. | author2 = Racey, P.A. | author3 = Hutson, A.M. | last-author-amp = yes | title = ''Pipistrellus murrayi'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 2017 | page = e.T136769A518894 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | date = 2017 | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136769/0 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2017-2.RLTS.T136769A518894.en | access-date = 24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining native bat species, the [[Christmas Island flying fox]], is considered critically endangered.&lt;ref name=ICUNflyingfox&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Hutson, A.M. | author2 = Kingston, T. | author3 = James, D. | author4 = Lumsden, L. | author5 = Molur, S. | author6 = Srinivasulu, C. | last-author-amp = yes | title = ''Pteropus melanotus'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 2008 | page = e.T18740A8525654 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | date = 2008 | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/18740/0 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2008.RLTS.T18740A8525654.en | access-date = 24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rodentia==

At the time of human settlement, Christmas Island hosted two endemic rodents, the [[bulldog rat]] and [[Maclear's rat]]. However, both species were extinct by 1908.&lt;ref name=Maclears&gt;{{IUCN | assessor=Lamoreux, J. |version=2013.2 | year=2009 | title=''Rattus macleari'' | id=19344 | downloaded=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bulldog&gt;{{IUCN2008 | assessor=Lamoreux, J. | year=2008 | title=Rattus nativitatis | id=19351 | downloaded=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that [[black rat]]s, introduced to the island in 1899, carried the infectious parasite ''[[Trypanosoma lewisi]]'', which was fatal to the native rodents.&lt;ref name=rats&gt;Wyatt KB, Campos PF, Gilbert MTP, Kolokotronis S-O, Hynes WH, DeSalle R, et al.

==Canada==
{{main|List of Canadian mobile phone companies}}

The country's telecom regulator is the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC). However, it does not regulate most aspects of mobile phone service; prices and service quality are not regulated at all, while spectrum allocation is handled by [[Industry Canada]].

There are numerous [[mobile virtual network operator]]s, such as [[Virgin Mobile Canada]]. These are not presently listed due to difficulty retrieving data for all such operators, and uncertainty as to whether the figures below include MVNOs operating on the applicable networks.&lt;ref&gt;The Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association only lists these five providers in its [http://www.cwta.ca/CWTASite/english/facts_figures_downloads/SubscribersStats_en_2007_Q3.pdf subscriber statistics].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Maryland Dove''''' is a re-creation/replica of the ''Dove'', an early 17th-century English trading ship, one of two ships which made up the first expedition from [[England]] to the [[Province of Maryland]]. The modern ''Dove'' was designed by the naval architect and naval historian [[William A. Baker]].

==''Maryland Dove''==
Launched in 1978, ''Maryland Dove'' is 56 feet in length on deck, and 76 feet overall with a displacement of 42 tons. She was built by James B. Richardson in a shipyard near [[Cambridge, Maryland]] in [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]]. Her home port is [[St. Mary's City, Maryland]]. The ship is owned by the [[Maryland|State of Maryland]] and operated/maintained by the Historic St. Mary's City Commission. She was commissioned October 8, 1978 with Captain Thomas Doyle of Valley Lee, Maryland as her first licensed Master. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==The original ''Ark'' and ''Dove''==
The first expedition from [[England]] to the planned colony of [[Maryland]] was undertaken by [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]], (1605-1675), and consisted of two ships that had formerly belonged to his father, [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]], (1579-1632): the ''[[The Ark (English ship)|Ark]]'' and the ''Dove''.&lt;ref name="B40"&gt;Browne, Page 40&lt;/ref&gt; The two ships departed [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], in [[Kent, England|Kent]] off the [[English Channel]], with 128 settlers on board and, after being chased down and brought back by the British [[Royal Navy]] so that the departing settlers could take an oath of allegiance to the [[King of England]] as required by law, sailed in October 1633 for the [[Isle of Wight]] (between [[England]] and [[France]]) to pick up more settlers.&lt;ref name=B40/&gt;

At the Isle of Wight the ''Dove'' and her larger sister ship the Ark embarked again with two [[Jesuit]] ([[Society of Jesus]]) priests/chaplains and nearly two hundred more settlers before setting out across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Page 45&lt;/ref&gt; Since he could not lead the expedition himself, Baltimore sent detailed instructions for the governance of the Colony, including commands that his brothers seek any information about those who had earlier tried to thwart the granting of the colony and make contact with [[William Claiborne]] (previously settled from [[Province of Virginia]] on [[Kent Island (Maryland)|Kent Island]] in the middle of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]) to determine his intentions for the trading station on Kent Island.&lt;ref name="Browne4657"&gt;Browne, Pages 46-57&lt;/ref&gt; The instructions also emphasized the importance of religious toleration among the colonists, who were nearly equal parts Catholic and Protestant.&lt;ref name=Browne4657/&gt; With these last instructions, the expedition sailed for the Americas.

[[File:Maryland Tri Cen 1934 Issue-3c.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Ark'' and ''Dove'', 1934 Maryland Tercentenary United States postage stamp.]]
The two ships arrived at [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] at the mouths of the [[James River (Virginia)|James]], [[Nansemond River|Nansemond]], and [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]]s, in [[Virginia]], February 24, 1634. On March 25, they landed at what is now [[St. Mary's City, Maryland|St. Mary's]], then the site of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village, and they began the work of establishing a settlement there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement of St. Mary's was built on land purchased from the native [[Yaocomico]].&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Pages 59-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in England, Baltimore could do little to help the young colony through its tribulations, which included an ongoing feud with Claiborne that led to a series of naval skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Pages 62-64&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Baltimore continued as Maryland's first [[Proprietary Governor]] (1632–1675), and attempted to maintain an active involvement in the governance of the colony, though he never visited it. During this long tenure, he governed through deputies, the last being his only son [[Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore|Charles]].

== In popular culture ==
The '''Maryland Dove''' was used extensively to represent the Mayflower in the 1979 made for TV film [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079539/?ref_=nv_sr_1 'Mayflower: The Pilgrims Adventure]' starring Anthony Hopkins as Captain Jones as well as Richard Crenna and Jenny Aguttar.

(rev.) 2002. ({{ISBN|0-19-860652-4}}) Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; p. 906.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2000): ''Atlas del México Prehispánico. Revista Arqueología mexicana''. Número especial 5. Julio de 2000. Raíces/ Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia. México.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of six areas in the world where ancient [[civilization]] arose independently, and the second in the Americas along with [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]] (Caral-Supe) in present-day [[Peru]], in the northern coastal reigion.

As a cultural area, Mesoamerica is defined by a mosaic of cultural traits developed and shared by its indigenous cultures. Beginning as early as 7000 BC, the domestication of [[chocolate|cacao]], [[maize]], [[phaseolus|beans]], [[tomato]], [[avocado]], [[vanilla]], [[squash (plant)|squash]] and [[Chili pepper|chili]], as well as the [[Meleagris gallopavo|turkey]] and [[Xoloitzcuintle|dog]], caused a transition from [[Paleo-Indians|paleo-Indian]] hunter-gatherer tribal grouping to the organization of sedentary agricultural villages. In the subsequent Formative period, agriculture and cultural traits such as a complex [[Mesoamerican religion|mythological and religious tradition]], a [[vigesimal]] numeric system, a [[Mesoamerican calendars|complex calendric system]], a [[Mesoamerican ballgame|tradition of ball playing]], and a distinct [[Mesoamerican architecture|architectural style]], were diffused through the area. Also in this period, villages began to become socially stratified and develop into [[chiefdom]]s with the development of large ceremonial centers, interconnected by a network of trade routes for the exchange of luxury goods, such as [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], [[jade]], [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[cinnabar]], ''[[Spondylus]]'' shells, [[hematite]], and ceramics. While Mesoamerican civilization did know of the [[wheel]] and basic [[metallurgy]], neither of these technologies became culturally important.{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|p=55}}

Among the earliest complex civilizations was the [[Olmec]] culture, which inhabited the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]] and extended inland and southwards across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Frequent contact and cultural interchange between the early Olmec and other cultures in Chiapas, Guatemala and Oaxaca laid the basis for the Mesoamerican cultural area. All this was facilitated by considerable [[regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica]], especially along the Pacific coast.

This formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes. In the subsequent [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]], complex urban polities began to develop among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], with the rise of centers such as [[El Mirador]], [[Calakmul]] and [[Tikal]], and the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] at [[Monte Albán]]. During this period, the first true [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] were developed in the [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] and the Zapotec cultures, and the Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic script]].

Mesoamerica is one of only three regions of the world where writing is known to have independently developed (the others being ancient [[Sumer]] and China).&lt;ref name="FaganBeck1996"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Brian M. Fagan|others=Charlotte Beck|title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ystMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA762|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507618-9|page=762}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Central Mexico, the height of the Classic period saw the ascendancy of the city of [[Teotihuacan]], which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area and northward. Upon the collapse of Teotihuacán around AD 600, competition between several important political centers in central Mexico, such as [[Xochicalco]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], ensued. At this time during the Epi-Classic period, the [[Nahua people]]s began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]]. During the early post-Classic period, Central Mexico was dominated by the [[Toltec]] culture, Oaxaca by the [[Mixtec]], and the lowland Maya area had important centers at [[Chichén Itzá]] and [[Mayapán]]. Towards the end of the post-Classic period, the [[Aztec]]s of Central Mexico built a [[tributary states|tributary]] empire covering most of central Mesoamerica.{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|pp=40–80}}

The distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition ended with the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] in the 16th century. Over the next centuries, Mesoamerican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to Spanish colonial rule. Aspects of the Mesoamerican cultural heritage still survive among the indigenous peoples who inhabit Mesoamerica, many of whom continue to speak their ancestral languages, and maintain many practices harking back to their Mesoamerican roots.{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996}}

The term ''Mesoamerica'' literally means "middle America" in Greek. [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] often refers to a larger area in the Americas, but it has also previously been used more narrowly to refer to Mesoamerica. An example is the title of the 16 volumes of ''The Handbook of Middle American Indians''.  "Mesoamerica" is broadly defined as the area that is home to the Mesoamerican civilization, which comprises a group of peoples with close cultural and historical ties. The exact geographic extent of Mesoamerica has varied through time, as the civilization extended North and South from its heartland in southern Mexico. The term was first used by the [[Germany|German]] [[ethnologist]] [[Paul Kirchhoff]], who noted that similarities existed among the various [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian cultures]] within the region that included southern [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[El Salvador]], western [[Honduras]], and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] lowlands of [[Nicaragua]] and northwestern [[Costa Rica]]. In the tradition of [[Cultural-history archaeology|cultural history]], the prevalent [[archaeological theory]] of the early to middle 20th century, Kirchhoff defined this zone as a cultural area based on a suite of interrelated cultural similarities brought about by millennia of inter- and intra-regional interaction (i.e., [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion)]].{{sfn|Kirchhoff|1943}}{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|pp=5–8}} Mesoamerica is recognized as a near-prototypical cultural area, and the term is now fully integrated in the standard terminology of pre-Columbian [[cultural anthropology|anthropological]] studies. Conversely, the sister terms [[Aridoamerica]] and [[Oasisamerica]], which refer to northern Mexico and the western [[United States]], respectively, have not entered into widespread usage.

Some of the significant cultural traits defining the Mesoamerican cultural tradition are:
* [[sedentism]] based on [[maize]] [[agriculture]]
* the construction of [[Mesoamerican pyramids|stepped pyramids]]
* the use of two different [[Mesoamerican calendar|calendars]] (a 260-day ritual calendar and a 365-day calendar based on the [[solar year]])
* [[vigesimal]] (base 20) number system
* the use of locally developed [[pictogram|pictographic]] and [[hieroglyph]]ic (logo-syllabic) [[Mesoamerican writing systems|writing systems]]
* the use of [[rubber]] and the practice of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]
* the use of [[Amate|bark paper]] and [[agave]] for ritual purposes and as a medium for writing and the latter also for cooking and clothing
* the practice of various forms of ritualistic [[sacrifice]], including [[Human sacrifice]]
* a [[Mesoamerican religion|religious complex]] based on a combination of [[shamanism]] and natural deities, and a shared system of symbols
* a [[Sprachbund|linguistic area]] defined by a [[Mesoamerican Linguistic Area|number of grammatical traits]] that have spread through the area by diffusion{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|Smith-Stark|1986}}

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Mesoamerica}}
[[File:Flickr - archer10 (Dennis) - Guatemala 1828 - La Danta at the Mayan site of El Mirador.jpg|thumb|[[El Mirador]] flourished from 600 BC to AD 100, and may have had a population of over 100,000.]]
[[File:Puebla farmers.jpg|right|thumb|Landscape of the Mesoamerican highlands]]
Located on the [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle American]] [[isthmus]] joining North and [[South America]] between ''ca.'' 10° and 22° northern [[latitude]], Mesoamerica possesses a complex combination of ecological systems, topographic zones, and environmental contexts. A main distinction groups these different [[ecological niche|niches]] into two broad categories: the lowlands (those areas between [[sea level]] and 1000 meters) and the ''altiplanos'', or highlands (situated between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level).{{sfn|Coe|1994}}{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|pp=9–11}} In the low-lying regions, [[subtropical climate|sub-tropical]] and [[tropical climate]]s are most common, as is true for most of the coastline along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The highlands show much more climatic diversity, ranging from dry tropical to cold [[mountain climate|mountainous climates]]; the dominant climate is [[temperateness|temperate]] with warm temperatures and moderate rainfall. The rainfall varies from the dry [[Oaxaca]] and north [[Yucatán]] to the humid southern Pacific and Caribbean lowlands.

=== Cultural sub-areas ===
Several distinct sub-regions within Mesoamerica are defined by a convergence of geographic and cultural attributes. These sub-regions are more conceptual than culturally meaningful, and the demarcation of their limits is not rigid. The Maya area, for example, can be divided into two general groups: the lowlands and highlands. The lowlands are further divided into the southern and northern Maya lowlands. The southern Maya lowlands are generally regarded as encompassing northern [[Guatemala]], southern [[Campeche]] and [[Quintana Roo]] in [[Mexico]], and [[Belize]]. The northern lowlands cover the remainder of the northern portion of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. Other areas include Central Mexico, West Mexico, the Gulf Coast Lowlands, [[Oaxaca]], the Southern Pacific Lowlands, and Southeast Mesoamerica (including northern [[Honduras]]).

=== Topography ===
There is extensive topographic variation in Mesoamerica, ranging from the high peaks circumscribing the [[Valley of Mexico]] and within the central [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] mountains to the low flatlands of the northern Yucatán Peninsula. The tallest mountain in Mesoamerica is [[Pico de Orizaba]], a [[dormant volcano]] located on the border of [[Puebla]] and [[Veracruz]]. Its peak elevation is 5,636&amp;nbsp;m (18,490&amp;nbsp;ft).

The Sierra Madre mountains, which consist of several smaller ranges, run from northern Mesoamerica south through [[Costa Rica]]. The chain is historically [[Volcano|volcanic]]. In central and southern Mexico, a portion of the Sierra Madre chain is known as the [[Eje Volcánico Transversal]], or the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt. There are 83 inactive and active volcanoes within the Sierra Madre range, including 11 in Mexico, 37 in Guatemala, 23 in El Salvador, 25 in Nicaragua, and 3 in northwestern Costa Rica. According to the Michigan Technological University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/world.html |title=MTU Volcanoes Page – World Reference Map |publisher=Geo.mtu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 of these are still active. The tallest active volcano is [[Popocatépetl]] at 5,452&amp;nbsp;m (17,887&amp;nbsp;ft). This volcano, which retains its [[Nahuatl]] name, is located 70&amp;nbsp;km (43&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Mexico City]]. Other volcanoes of note include Tacana on the Mexico–Guatemala border, [[Volcán Tajumulco|Tajumulco]] and [[Santamaría (volcano)|Santamaría]] in Guatemala, [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]] in El Salvador, [[Momotombo]] in Nicaragua, and [[Arenal Volcano|Arenal]] in Costa Rica.

One important topographic feature is the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], a low plateau that breaks up the Sierra Madre chain between the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] to the north and the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]] to the south. At its highest point, the [[Isthmus]] is 224&amp;nbsp;m (735&amp;nbsp;ft) above mean sea level. This area also represents the shortest distance between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] in Mexico. The distance between the two coasts is roughly 200&amp;nbsp;km (120&amp;nbsp;mi). The northern side of the Isthmus is swampy and covered in dense jungle—but the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, as the lowest and most level point within the Sierra Madre mountain chain, was nonetheless a main transportation, communication, and economic route within Mesoamerica.

=== Bodies of water ===
Outside of the northern Maya lowlands, [[river]]s are common throughout Mesoamerica. Some of the more important ones served as loci of human occupation in the area. The longest river in Mesoamerica is the [[Usumacinta]], which forms in Guatemala at the convergence of the [[Salinas River (Guatemala)|Salinas]] or [[Chixoy River|Chixoy]] and La [[Pasion River]] and runs north for 970&amp;nbsp;km (600&amp;nbsp;mi) – 480&amp;nbsp;km (300&amp;nbsp;mi) of which are navigable – eventually draining into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Other rivers of note include the [[Rio Grande de Santiago]], the [[Grijalva River]], the [[Motagua River]], the [[Ulúa River]], and the [[Hondo River (Belize)|Hondo River]]. The northern Maya lowlands, especially the northern portion of the Yucatán peninsula, are notable for their nearly complete lack of rivers (largely due to the absolute lack of topographic variation). Additionally, no lakes exist in the northern peninsula. The main source of water in this area is [[aquifer]]s that are accessed through natural surface openings called [[cenote]]s.

With an area of 8,264&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3,191&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi), [[Lake Nicaragua]] is the largest lake in Mesoamerica. [[Lake Chapala]] is Mexico’s largest freshwater lake, but [[Lake Texcoco]] is perhaps most well known as the location upon which [[Tenochtitlan]], capital of the [[Aztec]] Empire, was founded. [[Lake Petén Itzá]], in northern Guatemala, is notable as where the last independent Maya city, [[Tayasal]] (or Noh Petén), held out against the Spanish until 1697. Other large lakes include [[Lake Atitlán]], [[Lake Izabal]], [[Geography of El Salvador|Lake Güija]], [[Lemoa]], and [[Lake Managua]].

=== Biodiversity ===
Almost all [[ecosystem]]s are present in Mesoamerica; the more well known are the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]], the second largest in the world, and [[La Mosquitia]] (consisting of the [[Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve]], [[Tawahka Asangni]], [[Patuca National Park]], and [[Bosawas Biosphere Reserve]]) a [[rainforest]] second in size in the Americas only to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2006/1718459.htm |title=Science Show – Bosawas Bioreserve Nicaragua |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2006-08-19 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highlands present [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|mixed]] and [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forest. The biodiversity is among the richest in the world, though the number of species in the red list of the [[IUCN]] grows every year.

== Chronology and culture ==
{{Main|Mesoamerican chronology}}
[[File:Tikal mayan ruins 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Tikal]] is one of the largest archaeological sites, urban centers, and tourist attractions of the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]]. It is located in the archaeological region of the [[Petén Basin]] in what is now northern [[Guatemala]].]]

The history of human occupation in Mesoamerica is divided into stages or periods. These are known, with slight variation depending on region, as the [[Paleo-Indian]], the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Archaic Era|Archaic]], the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic]] (or Formative), the [[Classic Period|Classic]], and the [[Postclassic period|Postclassic]]. The last three periods, representing the core of Mesoamerican cultural fluorescence, are further divided into two or three sub-phases. Most of the time following the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century is classified as the Colonial period.

The differentiation of early periods (i.e., up through the end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Late Preclassic]]) generally reflects [[Sociocultural evolution|different configurations of socio-cultural organization]] that are characterized by [[Urgesellschaft|increasing socio-political complexity]], the adoption of new and different [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence strategies]], and changes in economic organization (including increased interregional interaction). The [[Classic Period|Classic]] period through the [[Postclassic period|Postclassic]] are differentiated by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of the various political entities throughout Mesoamerica.

=== Paleo-Indian ===
The Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian period precedes the advent of agriculture and is characterized by a nomadic [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] subsistence strategy. Big-game hunting, similar to that seen in contemporaneous [[North America]], was a large component of the subsistence strategy of the Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian.  These sites had [[obsidian]] blades and [[Clovis point|Clovis]]-style fluted [[projectile point]]s.

=== Archaic ===
The Archaic period (8000–2000 BC) is characterized by the rise of [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|incipient agriculture]] in Mesoamerica. The initial phases of the Archaic involved the cultivation of wild plants, transitioning into informal domestication and culminating with [[sedentism]] and agricultural production by the close of the period. Transformations of natural environments have been a common feature at least since the mid Holocene &lt;ref name="franco"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franco-Gaviria|first=Felipe |url= http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%284%29Franco.pdf |title= The human impact imprint on modern pollen spectra of the Mayan lands |journal= Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=70, 1 |pages= 61–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Archaic sites include ''[[Sipacate]]'' in [[Escuintla]], Guatemala, where maize [[pollen analysis|pollen samples]] date to c. 3500 BC.&lt;ref name="roush"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roush|first=Wade|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/276/5314/894.summary|title=Archaeobiology: Squash Seeds Yield New View of Early American Farming|journal=Science|date=9 May 1997|volume=276|issue=5314|pages=894–95 |doi=10.1126/science.276.5314.894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preclassic/Formative ===
[[File:San Lorenzo Monument 3.jpg|thumb|[[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec Colossal Head]] No. 3 1200–900 BC]]
{{See also|Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures}}

The first complex civilization to develop in Mesoamerica was that of the [[Olmec]], who inhabited the gulf coast region of [[Veracruz]] throughout the Preclassic period. The main sites of the Olmec include [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]], [[La Venta]], and [[Tres Zapotes]]. Specific dates vary, but these sites were occupied from roughly 1200 to 400 BC. Remains of other early cultures interacting with the Olmec have been found at [[Takalik Abaj]], [[Izapa]], and [[Teopantecuanitlan]], and as far south as in [[Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in the Pacific Lowlands of Chiapas and Guatemala suggest that [[Izapa]] and the [[Monte Alto culture|Monte Alto Culture]] may have preceded the Olmec. [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon samples]] associated with various sculptures found at the Late Preclassic site of [[Izapa]] suggest a date of between 1800 and 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~izapa/M-11.pdf|title=Pre-Columbian Magnetic Sculptures in Western Guatemala|author1=Paul A. Dunn|author2=Vincent H. Malmström}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(10.1&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle and Late Preclassic period, the [[Maya civilization]] developed in the southern Maya highlands and lowlands, and at a few sites in the northern Maya lowlands. The earliest Maya sites coalesced after 1000 BC, and include [[Nakbe]], [[El Mirador]], and [[Cerros]]. Middle to Late [[Preclassic Maya]] sites include [[Kaminaljuyú]], [[Cival]], [[Edzná]], [[Cobá]], [[Lamanai]], [[Komchen]], [[Dzibilchaltun]], and [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], among others.

The Preclassic in the central Mexican highlands is represented by such sites as [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]], [[Tlatilco]], and [[Cuicuilco]]. These sites were eventually superseded by [[Teotihuacán]], an important Classic-era site that eventually dominated economic and interaction spheres throughout Mesoamerica. The settlement of Teotihuacan is dated to the later portion of the Late Preclassic, or roughly AD 50.

In the [[Valley of Oaxaca]], [[San José Mogote]] represents one of the oldest permanent agricultural villages in the area, and one of the first to use pottery. During the Early and Middle Preclassic, the site developed some of the earliest examples of defensive [[palisade]]s, ceremonial structures, the use of [[adobe]], and [[Zapotec writing|hieroglyphic writing]]. Also of importance, the site was one of the first to demonstrate [[ascribed status|inherited status]], signifying a radical shift in socio-cultural and political structure. San José Mogote was eventual overtaken by [[Monte Albán]], the subsequent capital of the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec empire]], during the Late Preclassic.

The Preclassic in western Mexico, in the states of [[Nayarit]], [[Jalisco]], [[Colima]], and [[Michoacán]] also known as the Occidente, is poorly understood. This period is best represented by the thousands of figurines recovered by looters and ascribed to the "[[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition|shaft tomb tradition]]".

=== Classic ===

==== Early Classic ====
[[File:Piramide de la Luna 072006.jpg|thumb|[[Pyramid of the Moon]] viewed from atop of the [[Pyramid of the Sun]].]]
The Classic period is marked by the rise and dominance of several polities. The traditional distinction between the Early and Late Classic are marked by their changing fortune and their ability to maintain regional primacy. Of paramount importance are Teotihuacán in central Mexico and [[Tikal]] in Guatemala; the Early Classic’s temporal limits generally correlate to the main periods of these sites. Monte Alban in Oaxaca is another Classic-period polity that expanded and flourished during this period, but the Zapotec capital exerted less interregional influence than the other two sites.

During the Early Classic, Teotihuacan participated in and perhaps dominated a far-reaching macro-regional interaction network. Architectural and artifact styles (talud-tablero, tripod slab-footed ceramic vessels) epitomized at Teotihuacan were mimicked and adopted at many distant settlements. [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|Pachuca]] obsidian, whose trade and distribution is argued to have been economically controlled by Teotihuacan, is found throughout Mesoamerica.

Tikal came to dominate much of the southern Maya lowlands politically, economically, and militarily during the Early Classic. An exchange network centered at Tikal distributed a variety of goods and commodities throughout southeast Mesoamerica, such as obsidian imported from central Mexico (e.g., Pachuca) and highland Guatemala (e.g., [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|El Chayal]], which was predominantly used by the Maya during the Early Classic), and [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] from the [[Motagua River|Motagua valley]] in Guatemala. Tikal was often in conflict with other polities in the [[Petén Basin]], as well as with others outside of it, including [[Uaxactun]], [[Caracol, Belize|Caracol]], [[Dos Pilas]], [[Naranjo]], and [[Calakmul]]. Towards the end of the Early Classic, this conflict lead to Tikal’s military defeat at the hands of Caracol in 562, and a period commonly known as the [[Tikal#Tikal hiatus|Tikal Hiatus]].

==== Late Classic ====
[[File:Xochicalco Serpiente Emplumada GR.jpg|thumb|[[Xochicalco]], Temple of the Feathered Serpent, AD 650–900]]
The Late Classic period (beginning ca. AD 600 until AD 909 [varies]) is characterized as a period of interregional competition and factionalization among the numerous regional polities in the Maya area. This largely resulted from the decrease in Tikal’s socio-political and economic power at the beginning of the period. It was therefore during this time that other sites rose to regional prominence and were able to exert greater interregional influence, including Caracol, [[Copán]], [[Palenque]], and Calakmul (which was allied with Caracol and may have assisted in the defeat of Tikal), and [[Dos Pilas]] [[Aguateca]] and [[Cancuén]] in the [[Petexbatún]] region of Guatemala. Around 710, Tikal arose again and started to build strong alliances and defeat its worst enemies. In the Maya area, the Late Classic ended with the so-called "[[Maya collapse]]", a transitional period coupling the general depopulation of the southern lowlands and development and florescence of centers in the northern lowlands.

==== Terminal Classic ====
[[File:0077 Uxmal.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Nunnery Quadrangle at [[Uxmal]], 10th century]]
Generally applied to the Maya area, the Terminal Classic roughly spans the time between AD 800/850 and ca. AD 1000. Overall, it generally correlates with the rise to prominence of [[Puuc]] settlements in the northern Maya lowlands, so named after the hills where they are mainly found. Puuc settlements are specifically associated with a unique architectural style (the "Puuc architectural style") that represents a technological departure from previous construction techniques. Major Puuc sites include [[Uxmal]], [[Sayil]], [[Labna]], [[Kabah (Maya site)|Kabah]], and [[Oxkintok]]. While generally concentrated within the area in and around the Puuc hills, the style has been documented as far away as at [[Chichen Itza]] to the east and [[Edzna]] to the south.

Chichén Itzá was originally thought to have been a Postclassic site in the northern Maya lowlands. Research over the past few decades has established that it was first settled during the Early/Late Classic transition but rose to prominence during the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic. During its apogee, this widely known site economically and politically dominated the northern lowlands. Its participation in the circum-peninsular exchange route, possible through its port site of [[Isla Cerritos]], allowed Chichén Itzá to remain highly connected to areas such as central Mexico and [[Central America]]. The apparent "Mexicanization" of architecture at Chichén Itzá led past researchers to believe that Chichén Itzá existed under the control of a Toltec empire. Chronological data refutes this early interpretation, and it is now known that Chichén Itzá predated the Toltec; Mexican architectural styles are now used as an indicator of strong economic and ideological ties between the two regions.

=== Postclassic ===
The Postclassic (beginning AD 900–1000, depending on area) is, like the Late Classic, characterized by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of various polities. The main Maya centers were located in the northern lowlands. Following Chichén Itzá, whose political structure collapsed during the Early Postclassic, [[Mayapán]] rose to prominence during the Middle Postclassic and dominated the north for c. 200 years. After Mayapán’s fragmentation, political structure in the northern lowlands revolved around large towns or city-states, such as [[Oxkutzcab]] and [[Ti’ho]] ([[Mérida, Yucatán]]), that competed with one another.

[[Toniná]], in the Chiapas highlands, and [[Kaminaljuyú]] in the central Guatemala highlands, were important southern highland Maya centers. The latter site, Kaminaljuyú, is one of the longest occupied sites in Mesoamerica and was continuously inhabited from c. 800 BC to around AD 1200. Other important highland Maya groups include the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] of [[Utatlán]], the [[Mam people|Mam]] in [[Zaculeu]], the [[Poqomam language|Poqomam]] in [[Mixco Viejo]], and the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] at [[Iximche]] in the Guatemalan highlands. The [[Pipil people|Pipil]] resided in [[El Salvador]], while the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']] were in eastern Guatemala and northwestern [[Honduras]].

In central Mexico, the early portion of the Postclassic correlates with the rise of the [[Toltec]] and an empire based at their capital, [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]] (also known as [[Tollan]]). [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], initially an important Early Classic center contemporaneous with Teotihuacan, maintained its political structure (it did not collapse) and continued to function as a regionally important center during the Postclassic. The latter portion of the Postclassic is generally associated with the rise of the [[Mexica]] and the [[Aztec Empire]]. One of the more commonly known cultural groups in Mesoamerica, the Aztec politically dominated nearly all of central Mexico, the Gulf Coast, Mexico’s southern Pacific Coast (Chiapas and into Guatemala), Oaxaca, and [[Guerrero]].

The [[Tarascan state|Tarascans]] (also known as the [[Purépecha people|P'urhépecha]]) were located in [[Michoacán]] and Guerrero. With their capital at [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]], the Tarascan state was one of the few to actively and continuously resist Aztec domination during the Late Postclassic. Other important Postclassic cultures in Mesoamerica include the [[Totonac]] along the eastern coast (in the modern-day states of [[Veracruz]], [[Puebla]], and [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]]). The [[Huastec people|Huastec]] resided north of the Totonac, mainly in the modern-day states of [[Tamaulipas]] and northern Veracruz. The [[Mixtec]] and Zapotec cultures, centered at [[Mitla]] and [[Zaachila]] respectively, inhabited Oaxaca.

The Postclassic ends with the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|arrival of the Spanish]] and their subsequent conquest of the Aztec between 1519 and 1521. Many other cultural groups did not acquiesce until later. For example, Maya groups in the Petén area, including the [[Itza]] at [[Tayasal]] and the [[Kowoj]] at [[Zacpeten]], remained independent until 1697.

Some Mesoamerican cultures never achieved dominant status or left impressive archaeological remains but are nevertheless noteworthy. These include the [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Mixe–Zoquean languages|Mixe–Zoque]] groups (which may or may not have been related to the Olmecs), the northern [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] groups, often referred to as the [[Chichimeca]], that include the [[Cora people|Cora]] and [[Huichol people|Huichol]], the Chontales, the Huaves, and the Pipil, Xincan and Lencan peoples of Central America.

== General characteristics ==

=== Subsistence ===
{{further|Agriculture in Mesoamerica|Maya diet and subsistence}}
[[File:Zea mays.jpg|thumb|upright|Examples of the diversity of [[maize]]]]

By roughly 6000 BC, [[hunter-gatherer]]s living in the [[highland (geography)|highlands]] and lowlands of Mesoamerica began to develop agricultural practices with early cultivation of squash and chilli. The earliest example of [[maize]] dates to c. 4000 BC and comes from [[Guilá Naquitz]], a cave in Oaxaca. Earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in [[Panama]], c. 5500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los Ladrones cave site|url=http://www.uacam.mx/.../ee8480fb39dbff8e86256ad3004e1394/$FILE/ATT4M6OX/Campeche%202002%20paper.pdf|publisher=UAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly thereafter, semi-[[agrarian community|agrarian communities]] began to cultivate other crops throughout Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (2005), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Maize was the most common domesticate, but the common bean, tepary bean, scarlet runner bean, [[jicama]], [[tomato]] and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BC. At the same time, these communities exploited [[cotton]], [[yucca]], and [[agave]] for fibers and [[textile]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond (1999), pp. 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000 BC, corn was the staple crop in the region, and remained so through modern times. The Ramón or [[Brosimum alicastrum|Breadnut tree]] (''[[Brosimum alicastrum]]'') was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour. Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures. Some of the main ones consumed include [[avocado]], [[papaya]], [[guava]], [[mamey (disambiguation)|mamey]], [[Sapote|zapote]], and [[annona]].

Mesoamerica lacked animals suitable for domestication, most notably domesticated large [[ungulate]]s. The lack of [[draft animals]] for transportation is one notable difference between Mesoamerica and the cultures of the South American Andes. Other animals, including the [[duck]], [[dog]]s, and [[wild turkey|turkey]], were [[domestication|domesticated]]. Turkey was the first, occurring around 3500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond (1999) p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dog meat|Dogs]] were the primary source of animal protein in ancient Mesoamerica,&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1994), p. 45 ("The only domestic animals were dogs – the principal source of meat for much of Preclassic Mesoamerica – and turkeys – understandably rare because that familiar bird consumes very large quantities of corn and is thus expensive to raise".)&lt;/ref&gt; and dog bones are common in midden deposits throughout the region.

Societies of this region did hunt certain wild species for food. These animals included deer, [[rabbit]], birds, and various types of insects. They also hunted for luxury items, such as feline fur and bird plumage.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican cultures that lived in the lowlands and coastal plains settled down in agrarian communities somewhat later than did highland cultures due to the fact that there was a greater abundance of fruits and animals in these areas, which made a hunter-gatherer lifestyle more attractive.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien (2005), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Fishing also was a major provider of food to lowland and coastal Mesoamericans creating a further disincentive to settle down in permanent communities.

=== Political organization ===
[[File:ChanBahlumCatherwood.jpg|thumb|upright|[[K'inich Kan B'alam II]], the Classic period ruler of [[Palenque]], as depicted on a [[stele]]]]

Ceremonial centers were the nuclei of Mesoamerican settlements. The temples provided spatial orientation, which was imparted to the surrounding town. The cities with their commercial and religious centers were always political entities, somewhat similar to the European [[city-state]], and each person could identify with the city where they lived. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Ceremonial centers were always built to be visible. Pyramids were meant to stand out from the rest of the city, to represent the gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, one on top of the other, to the point that what we now see is usually the last stage of construction. Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of each city, as represented by the veneration of their gods and masters. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} [[Stela]]e were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica, and served to commemorate notable successes, events and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.

=== Economy ===
{{See also|Trade in Maya civilization}}

Given that Mesoamerica was broken into numerous and diverse ecological niches, none of the societies that inhabited the area were self-sufficient.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} For this reason, from the last centuries of the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] period onward, regions compensated for the environmental inadequacies by specializing in the extraction of certain abundant natural resources and then trading them for necessary unavailable resources through established commercial trade networks.

The following is a list of some of the specialized resources traded from the various Mesoamerican sub-regions and environmental contexts:
* Pacific lowlands: [[cotton]] and [[cochineal]]
* Maya lowlands and the Gulf Coast: [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[vanilla]], [[jaguar]] skins, birds and bird feathers (especially [[quetzal]] and [[macaw]])
* Central Mexico: Obsidian ([[Pachuca]])
* Guatemalan highlands: Obsidian ([[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|San Martin Jilotepeque]], [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|El Chayal]], and [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|Ixtepeque]]), [[pyrite]], and [[jade]] from the [[Motagua River]] valley
* Coastal areas: [[salt]], dry [[fish]], [[Animal shell|shell]], and [[dye]]s

== Common characteristics of Mesoamerican culture ==

=== Calendrical systems ===
{{main|Mesoamerican calendars}}
[[File:Maya days.jpg|thumb|"Head Variant" or "Patron Gods" glyphs for Maya days]] 
[[File:Tikalemblem.jpg|thumb|The [[Maya script|emblem glyph]] of Tikal (Mutal)]]

Agriculturally based people historically divide the year into four seasons. These included the two [[solstices]] and the two [[equinoxes]], which could be thought of as the four "directional pillars" that support the year. These four times of the year were, and still are, important as they indicate seasonal changes that directly impact the lives of Mesoamerican agriculturalists.

The Maya closely observed and duly recorded the seasonal markers. They prepared almanacs recording past and recent solar and [[lunar eclipses]], the phases of the [[moon]], the periods of [[Venus]] and [[Mars]], the movements of various other planets, and conjunctions of celestial bodies. These almanacs also made future predictions concerning celestial events. These tables are remarkably accurate, given the technology available, and indicate a significant level of knowledge among Maya [[astronomer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Roxanne V. Pacheco, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030718193206/http://www.unm.edu/~abqteach/ArcheoCUs/99-01-08.pdf Myths of Mesoamerican Cultures Reflect a Knowledge and Practice of Astronomy], University of New Mexico, ''archived'' July 18, 2003 (accessed January 25, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many types of calendars the Maya maintained, the most important include a 260-day cycle, a 360-day cycle or 'year', a 365-day cycle or year, a lunar cycle, and a Venus cycle, which tracked the [[synodic]] period of Venus. Maya of the European contact period said that knowing the past aided in both understanding the present and predicting the future (Diego de Landa). The 260-day cycle was a calendar to govern agriculture, observe religious holidays, mark the movements of celestial bodies and memorialize public officials. The 260-day cycle was also used for divination, and (like the Catholic calendar of saints) to name newborns.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardino de Sahagun, Historia de las cosas de Nueva Espana; Diego Duran, The Book of The Gods and Rites, Oklahoma; The Books of [[Chilam Balam]] of Mani, Kaua, and Chumayel.&lt;/ref&gt;

The names given to the days, months, and years in the Mesoamerican calendar came, for the most part, from animals, flowers, heavenly bodies, and cultural concepts that held symbolic significance in Mesoamerican culture. This calendar was used throughout the history of Mesoamerican by nearly every culture. Even today, several Maya groups in Guatemala, including the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']], [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']], [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]], and the [[Mixe]] people of Oaxaca continue using modernized forms of the Mesoamerican calendar.

=== Writing systems ===
{{Main|Mesoamerican writing systems}}
[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|One of the earliest examples of the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]], the [[Epi-Olmec script]] on the [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] dated to around AD 150. Mesoamerica is one of the five places in the world where [[writing]] has developed independently.]]
The Mesoamerican scripts deciphered to date are [[logosyllabary|logosyllabic]] combining the use of [[logograms]] with a [[syllabary]], and they are often called [[hieroglyph]]ic scripts. Five or six different scripts have been documented in Mesoamerica, but archaeological dating methods, and a certain degree of self-interest, create difficulties in establishing priority and thus the forebear from which the others developed. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and therefore the most widely known, is the classic [[Maya script]]. Others include the [[Olmec hieroglyphs|Olmec]], Zapotec, and [[Epi-Olmec script|Epi-Olmec/Isthmian]] writing systems. An extensive [[Mesoamerican literature]] has been conserved partly in indigenous scripts and partly in the postinvasion transcriptions into [[Latin script]].

The other [[glyph (archaeology)|glyphic]] writing systems of Mesoamerica, and their interpretation, have been subject to much debate. One important ongoing discussion regards whether non-Maya Mesoamerican texts can be considered examples of true writing or whether non-Maya Mesoamerican texts are best understood as [[pictographic]] conventions that express ideas, specifically religious ones, but don't represent the phonetics of spoken language.

Mesoamerican writing is found in several mediums, including large stone monuments such as [[stelae]], carved directly onto architecture, carved or painted over stucco (e.g., [[murals]]), and on [[pottery]]. No Precolumbian Mesoamerican society is known to have had widespread literacy, and literacy was probably restricted to particular social classes, including scribes, painters, merchants, and the nobility.

The Mesoamerican book was typically written with brush and colored inks on a paper prepared from the inner bark of the ficus amacus. The book consisted of a long strip of the prepared bark, which was folded like a screenfold to define individual pages. The pages were often covered and protected by elaborately carved book boards. Some books were composed of square pages while others were composed of rectangular pages.

Following the Spanish conquests in the sixteenth century, Spanish friars taught indigenous scribes to write their languages in alphabetic texts. Many oral histories of the prehispanic period were subsequently recorded in alphabetic texts.  The indigenous in central and southern Mexico continued to produce written texts in the colonial period, many with pictorial elements.  An important scholarly reference work is the ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]], Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources''. [[Mesoamerican codices]] survive from the [[Aztec codices|Aztec]], [[Maya codices|Maya]], [[Mixtec codices|Mixtec]], and [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] regions.

=== Arithmetic ===
{{See also|Maya numerals}}

Mesoamerican [[arithmetic]] treated [[number]]s as having both literal and symbolic value, the result of the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] nature that characterized Mesoamerican ideology.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} As mentioned, the Mesoamerican numbering system was vigesimal (i.e., based on the number 20).

In representing numbers, a series of bars and dots were employed. Dots had a value of one, and bars had a value of five. This type of arithmetic was combined with a symbolic numerology: '2' was related to origins, as all origins can be thought of as doubling; '3' was related to household fire; '4' was linked to the four corners of the universe; '5' expressed instability; '9' pertained to the underworld and the night; '13' was the number for light, '20' for abundance, and '400' for infinity. The [[0 (number)|concept of zero]] was also used, and its representation at the Late Preclassic occupation of [[Tres Zapotes]] is one of the earliest uses of zero in human history.

=== Food, medicine, and science ===
{{cquote|Mesoamerica would deserve its place in the human [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] if its inhabitants had only created [[maize]], in terms of harvest weight the world's most important crop. But the inhabitants of Mexico and northern Central America also developed [[tomato]]es, now basic to [[Italian cuisine]]; [[Bell peppers|peppers]], essential to [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] and [[Indian food]]; all the world's [[Squash (plant)|squashes]] (except for a few domesticated in the United States); and many of the [[beans]] on dinner plates around the world. One writer estimated that Indians developed three-fifths of the crops now grown in cultivation, most of them in Mesoamerica. Having secured their food supply, the Mesoamerican societies turned to intellectual pursuits. In a millennium or less, a comparatively short time, they invented their own [[writing]], [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]], including the [[zero]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Charles C. 1491: Revelations of the Americas before Columbus. Vinton Press. 2005. pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Maize played an important role in [[Mesoamerican feasts]] due to its symbolic meaning and abundance.&lt;ref&gt;Lecount, Lisa J. "Like Water for Chocolate: Feasting and Political Ritual among the Late Classic Maya at Xunantunich, Belize." ''American Anthropologist'' 103.4 (2001): 935–53. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;. Gods were praised and named after. 

Fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] collected extensive information on plants, animals, soil types, among other matters from native informants in Book 11, The Earthly Things, of the twelve-volume ''General History of the Things of New Spain,'' known as the [[Florentine Codex]], compiled in the third quarter of the sixteenth century.  An earlier work, the [[Badianus Manuscript]] or [[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis]] is another Aztec codex with written text and illustrations collected from the indigenous viewpoint.

Evidence shows that wild animals were captured and traded for symbolic and ritual purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Jaguar and puma captivity and trade among the Maya: Stable isotope data from Copan, Honduras |journal = PLOS ONE|volume = 13|issue = 9|pages = e0202958|author1=Nawa Sugiyama |author2=William L.

=== Mythology and worldview ===
[[File:Mexico.Xoloitzcuintle.01.jpg|thumb|The [[Mexican Hairless Dog|xoloitzcuintle]] is one of the [[nagual]]es of the god [[Quetzalcoatl]]. In this form, it helps the dead cross the Chicnahuapan, a river that separates the world of the living from the dead.]]{{further|Mesoamerican religion|Mesoamerican creation myths|Mesoamerican world tree}}
{{See also|Aztec religion|Olmec mythology|Maya religion|Maya mythology}} Shared traits in Mesoamerican mythology are characterized by their common basis as a religion that—though in many Mesoamerican groups developed into complex polytheistic religious systems—retained some shamanistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Ortiz de Montellano ''Aztec Medicine, Health, and Nutrition'' New Brunswick; Rutgers University Press. 1990, pp. 67–71 {{ISBN|0-8135-1563-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mascara Dios Murcielago.jpg|thumb|Zapotec mask of the Bat God.]]
The great breadth of the Mesoamerican [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of [[deities]] is due to the incorporation of ideological and religious elements from the first primitive religion of Fire, Earth, Water and Nature. Astral divinities (the sun, stars, constellations, and Venus) were adopted and represented in anthropomorphic, [[zoomorphic]], and anthropozoomorphic sculptures, and in day-to-day objects.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The qualities of these gods and their attributes changed with the passage of time and with cultural influences from other Mesoamerican groups. The gods are at once three: creator, preserver, and destroyer, and at the same time just one. An important characteristic of Mesoamerican religion was the dualism among the divine entities. The gods represented the confrontation between opposite poles: the positive, exemplified by light, the masculine, force, war, the sun, etc.; and the negative, exemplified by darkness, the feminine, repose, peace, the moon, etc.

The typical Mesoamerican cosmology sees the world as separated into a day world watched by the sun and a night world watched by the moon. More importantly, the three superposed levels of the world are united by a [[Ceiba]] tree (''Yaxche''' in Mayan). The geographic vision is also tied to the cardinal points. Certain geographical features are linked to different parts of this cosmovision. Thus mountains and tall trees connect the middle and upper worlds; caves connect the middle and nether worlds.

==== Sacrifice ====
Generally, sacrifice can be divided into two types: [[Bloodletting rituals in Maya culture|autosacrifice]] and [[human sacrifice]]. The different forms of sacrifice are reflected in the imagery used to evoke ideological structure and sociocultural organization in Mesoamerica. In the Maya area, for example, stele depict bloodletting rituals performed by ruling elites, eagles and jaguars devouring human hearts, jade circles or necklaces that represented hearts, and plants and flowers that symbolized both nature and the blood that provided life.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Imagery also showed pleas for rain or pleas for blood, with the same intention to replenish the divine energy. Ritual sacrfice was done in efforts to appease the gods, and was done with the prupose of protection of the population.

===== Autosacrifice =====
{{Main|Bloodletting in Mesoamerica}}
{{See also|Sacrifice in Maya culture}}[[File:Human sacrifice (Codex Laud, f.8).png|thumb|Ritual human sacrifice portrayed in [[Codex Laud]]]]

Autosacrifice, also called [[bloodletting]], is the ritualized practice of drawing blood from oneself. It is commonly seen or represented through iconography as performed by ruling elites in highly ritualized ceremonies, but it was easily practiced in mundane sociocultural contexts (i.e., non-elites could perform autosacrifice). The act was typically performed with [[obsidian]] [[prismatic blade]]s or [[Stingray injury#Biological structure of the barb|stingray spines]], and blood was drawn from piercing or cutting the [[tongue]], [[earlobe]]s, and/or [[genitals]] (among other locations). Another form of autosacrifice was conducted by pulling a rope with attached thorns through the tongue or earlobes. The blood produced was then collected on paper held in a bowl.

Autosacrifice was not limited to male rulers, as their female counterparts often performed these ritualized activities. They are typically shown performing the rope and thorns technique. A recently discovered queen's tomb in the Classic Maya site of [[El Perú (Maya site)|Waka]] (also known as El Perú) had a ceremonial stingray spine placed in her genital area, suggesting that women also performed bloodletting in their genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/05/040506073833.htm|title=Archaeologists Announce Discoveries At The Ancient Maya Site Of Waka' In Northern Guatemala|date=May 6, 2004|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Human sacrifice =====
{{See also|Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|Human sacrifice in Maya culture}}

Sacrifice had great importance in the social and religious aspects of Mesoamerican culture. First, it showed death transformed into the divine.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Death is the consequence of a human sacrifice, but it is not the end; it is but the continuation of the cosmic cycle. Death creates life – divine energy is liberated through death and returns to the gods, who are then able to create more life. Secondly, it justifies war, since the most valuable sacrifices are obtained through conflict. The death of the warrior is the greatest sacrifice and gives the gods the energy to go about their daily activities, such as the bringing of rain. Warfare and capturing prisoners became a method of social advancement and a religious cause. Finally, it justifies the control of power by the two ruling classes, the priests and the warriors. The priests controlled the religious ideology, and the warriors supplied the sacrifices. Historically it was also in discussion that those sacrificed were chosen by the gods, this idea of being "chosen" was decided by the gods. This was then displayed by acts, such as being struck by lightning. If someone was struck by lightning and a sacrifice was needed they would often be chosen by their population, as thee beilived they were chosen by the gods.

The Mesoamerican ballgame was a sport with ritual associations played for over 3000 years by nearly all pre-Columbian peoples of Mesoamerica. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a modern version of the game, [[ulama (game)|ulama]], is still played in a few places.

Over 1300 [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] have been found throughout Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Taladoire|2001|p=98}} Note that slightly over 200 ballcourts have also been identified in the [[American Southwest]]. This total does not include those, since they are outside Mesoamerica, and there is discussion whether these areas were actually used for ballplaying.&lt;/ref&gt; They vary considerably in size, but they all feature long narrow alleys with side-walls to bounce the balls against.

The rules of the ballgame are not known, but it was probably similar to volleyball, where the object is to keep the ball in play. In the most well-known version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, though some versions used forearms or employed rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber, and weighed up to 4&amp;nbsp;kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played.{{sfn|Filloy Nadal|2001|p=30}}{{sfn|Leyenaar|2001|pp=125–26}}

While the game was played casually for simple recreation, including by children and perhaps even women, the game also had important ritual aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events, often featuring human sacrifice.

==== Astronomy ====
Mesoamerican [[astronomy]] included a broad understanding of the cycles of planets and other celestial bodies. Special importance was given to the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[Venus]] as the morning and evening star.

Observatories were built at some sites, including the round observatory at [[Seibal|Ceibal]] and the “Observatorio” at [[Xochicalco]]. Often, the architectural organization of Mesoamerican sites was based on precise calculations derived from astronomical observations. Well-known examples of these include the [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] pyramid at Chichen Itza and the Observatorio at [[Xochicalco]]. A unique and common architectural complex found among many Mesoamerican sites are [[E-Group]]s, which are aligned so as to serve as astronomical observatories. The name of this complex is based on [[Uaxactun]]’s “Group E,” the first known observatory in the Maya area. Perhaps the earliest observatory documented in Mesoamerica is that of the [[Monte Alto culture]]. This complex consisted of three plain stelae and a temple oriented with respect to the [[Pleiades]].

==== Symbolism of space and time ====
[[File:Mexico0047.jpg|thumb|The [[Teotihuacan#Site layout|Avenue of the Dead]] in [[Teotihuacan]], an example of a Mesoamerican settlement planned according to concepts of directionality]]

It has been argued that among Mesoamerican societies the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]] are associated with the four [[cardinal points|cardinal compass points]] and linked together by the [[calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Duverger 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Dates or events were always tied to a compass direction, and the calendar specified the symbolic geographical characteristic peculiar to that period. Resulting from the significance held by the cardinal directions, many Mesoamerican architectural features, if not entire settlements, were planned and oriented with respect to directionality.

In Maya cosmology, each cardinal point was assigned a specific color and a specific jaguar deity ([[Maya mythology#Bacabs|Bacab]]). They are as follows:
* '''[[Hacha-kyum|Hobnil]]''', Bacab of the [[East]], associated with the color red and the ''Kan'' years
* '''[[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#C|Can Tzicnal]]''', Bacab of the [[North]], assigned the color white and the ''Muluc'' years
* '''[[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#Z|Zac Cimi]]'', Bacab of the [[West]], associated with the color black and the ''Ix'' years
* '''[[Hacha-kyum|Hozanek]]''', Bacab of the [[South]], associated with the color yellow and the ''Cauac'' years.

Later cultures such as the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] and [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] maintain the association of cardinal directions with each color, but utilized different names.

Among the Aztec, the name of each day was associated with a cardinal point (thus conferring symbolic significance), and each cardinal direction was associated with a group of symbols. Below are the symbols and concepts associated with each direction:
* '''East''': [[American crocodile|croco]][[Morelet's crocodile|dile]], the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], [[water]], cane, and movement. The East was linked to the world priests and associated with vegetative fertility, or, in other words, tropical exuberance.
* '''North''': wind, death, the dog, the jaguar, and [[flint]] (or [[chert]]). The north contrasts with the east in that it is conceptualized as dry, cold, and oppressive. It is considered the nocturnal part of the universe and includes the dwellings of the dead. The dog ([[xoloitzcuintle]]) has a very specific meaning, as it accompanies the deceased during the trip to the lands of the dead and helps them cross the river of death that leads into nothingness. (''See also'' [[Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth]]).
* '''West''': the house, the deer, the [[New World monkey|monkey]], the [[eagle]], and rain. The west was associated with the cycles of vegetation, specifically the temperate high plains that experience light rains and the change of seasons.
* '''South''': rabbit, the [[lizard]], dried herbs, the [[New World vulture|buzzard]], and flowers. It is related on the one hand to the luminous Sun and the noon heat, and on the other with rain filled with alcoholic drink. The rabbit, the principal symbol of the west, was associated with farmers and with [[pulque]].

=== Political and religious art ===
{{Category see also|Mesoamerican art}}
[[File:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|thumb|Art with ideological and political meaning: depiction of an [[Aztec]] ''[[tzompantli]]'' (skull-rack) from the [[Ramirez Codex]]]]

Mesoamerican [[art]]istic expression was conditioned by [[ideology]] and generally focused on themes of [[religion]] and/or sociopolitical [[Power (sociology)|power]]. This is largely based on the fact that most works that survived the Spanish conquest were public monuments. These monuments were typically erected by rulers who sought to visually legitimize their sociocultural and political position; by doing so, they intertwined their lineage, personal attributes and achievements, and legacy with religious concepts. As such, these monuments were specifically designed for public display and took many forms, including [[stele]], [[sculpture]], architectural [[relief]]s, and other types of architectural elements (e.g., roofcombs). Other themes expressed include tracking time, glorifying the city, and veneration of the gods – all of which were tied to explicitly aggrandizing the abilities and the reign of the ruler who commissioned the artwork.

The majority are artwork created during this historical time was in relation to these topics, religion and politics. Rulers were drawn and sculpted. Historical tales and events were then translated into pieces of art, and art was used to relay religious and political messages.

'''Mesohabitat simulation model (MesoHABSIM)''', created by Dr. [[Piotr Parasiewicz]] addresses the requirements of [[Drainage basin|watershed]]-based management of running waters and is designed to predict an aquatic community's response to [[habitat]] modification.

== Overview ==

'''MesoHABSIM''' builds upon pre-existing physical habitat simulation models (e.g. PHABSIM) which is an essential component of the United States government's methods for establishing minimum [[stream flow]] requirements. 
MesoHABSIM is an augmentation of this system, designed during a restoration study of the [[Quinebaug River]].&lt;ref&gt;Northeast Instream Habitat Program. Northeast Instream Habitat Program – Quinbaug River 10 November. 2008. {{cite web |url=http://neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725063409/http://www.neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing spatial distributions of physical attributes of a river as a result of variations in flow and the biological responses of aquatic species to these changes, provide the basis for simulating the consequences of [[ecosystem]] alteration, and consequently the justification of restoration measures. MesoHABSIM modifies the data acquisition technique and analytical approach of similar models by changing the scale of resolution from micro- to meso-scales. Due to this increase in scale, the model takes variations in stream morphology along the river into account and allows for application in larger-scale projects.

== Data collection and analysis ==

Mesohabitat types are defined by their hydromorphological units (HMUs), such as pools and [[rapids]], [[geomorphology]], [[land cover]] and other [[hydrological]] characteristics. Mesohabitats are mapped under multiple flow conditions at extensive sites along the river. Fish data is collected in randomly distributed mesohabitats where habitat surveys are also conducted. This allows modeling of available fish habitat at a range of flows. Rating curves represent the changes in relative area of suitable habitat in response to flow and allow for the determination of habitat quantity at any given flow within the range of surveys. These rating curves can be developed for river units of any size allowing conclusions to be drawn about the suitability of channel patterns or habitat structures for various species of fish for specific sections as well as for the entire river. Rating curves can also be used to evaluate the benefits of various restoration measures on the entire fish community. In combination with hydrologic time series, rating curves are used to create Continuous Under Threshold (CUT) curves for the analysis of frequency, magnitude and duration of significant habitat events. The CUT curve technique described by Capra et al. (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Capra, H., B. Pascal, and Y. Souchon. 1995. A new tool to interpret magnitude and duration of fish habitat variations. Regulated Rivers: Research and Management. 10: 281–289.&lt;/ref&gt;  defines critical thresholds and determines what habitat variability and availability is necessary to support the target river [[fauna]]. CUT curves evaluate durations of unsuitable habitat under a specified threshold by comparing continuous durations in days under this threshold to the cumulative durations in the study period. A highly useful product of the CUT curves are reference tables that can be used to determine how long a given species can tolerate unsuitable conditions depending on its life stage.

== Results ==

To use physical habitat models to analyze and predict ecosystem potential, compositions must also be determined of the native fish community and a subset of species must be selected for model development. The development of a Reference Fish Community (RFC) is based on the Target Fish Community approach, described by Bain and Meixler (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Meixler. 2000. Defining a Target Fish Community for Planning and Evaluating Enhancement on the Quinebaug River in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Report for Quinebaug River Study Agencies. [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of species is generated from literature sources and available regional data collected on relatively intact river reaches. The species are ranked on the basis of abundance in long-term fish collection data from multiple rivers of similar character. Securing habitat for naturally occurring [[dominant species (ecology)]] should preserve the most profound characteristics of the ecosystem, providing survival conditions for the majority of the aquatic community and therefore a reference for restoration efforts. The simplest way to create a river habitat model is therefore to select the five to ten highest ranking species for model development. It can then be assumed that community structure reflects habitat structure; therefore, the most common species should indicate the most common habitat. Since habitat availability forms the structure of aquatic fauna, the affinity between the structure of the river habitat and the structure of the fish community can be used as a measure of habitat quality.

The results of MesoHABSIM creates the framework for integrative analysis of many aspects of the ecosystem. It also allows managers to recreate reference conditions and evaluate possible instream and watershed restoration measures or alterations (such as dam removals or changes in water withdrawals). From the perspective of resource managers, it not only allows for quantitative measures of ecological integrity, but also creates a basis for making decisions where trade-offs between resource use and river restoration need to be considered.

'''Muban''' ({{lang-th|หมู่บ้าน}}) is the lowest [[Administrative divisions of Thailand|administrative sub-division of Thailand]]. Usually translated as ''[[village]]'' and sometimes as ''[[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]'', they are a subdivision of a [[tambon]]. As of 2008, there were 74,944 administrative muban in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dopa.go.th/dopanew/doc/dopastat52.pdf |publisher=Department of provincial administration (DOPA) |title=ข้อมูลทางการปกครอง ณ วันที่ 31 ธันวาคม 2552 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813081725/http://www.dopa.go.th/dopanew/doc/dopastat52.pdf |archive-date=13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 1990 census, the average village consisted of 144 households or 746 persons.

== Nomenclature ==
''Muban'' may function as one word, in the sense of a hamlet or village, and as such may be shortened to ''Ban''. ''Mu ban'' may also function as two words, i.e., [[wikt:หมู่|หมู่ ''group'']] (of) [[wikt:บ้าน|บ้าน ''home'']]s.
* ''Mu'', in the sense of group (of homes in a tambon), are assigned numbers in the sequence in which each is entered in a register maintained in the district or branch-district office.
* ''Ban'', in the sense of [[home]] or [[household]] for members of each group, are assigned a number (Thai:บ้านเลขที่, ''ban lek ti'' ) in the sequence in which each is added to the household register also maintained in the district or branch-district office. Each ''ban'' is registered in the name of a householder (Thai: เจ้าบ้าน ''chau ban''). Assigned ''Ban'' and ''Mu'' numbers, together with the names of tambon, district, and province, are used as [[Address (geography)|geographic address]]es by government agencies; [[Thailand Post]] adds a [[postal code]]. Village or ''Ban'' names do not usually form part of such official addresses, as explained below.
* ''Ban'' in the sense of [[Village#Southeast_Asia|Village]] occurs in [[geopolitical]] [[toponym]]s  on maps and [[Thai highway network]] signage, but these are not administrative subdivisions. Such village names may apply to an isolated ''muban'', but typically apply to a group of adjoining ones, which often have been subdivided from the original settlement. Each new ''mu'' is assigned a new number, in the sequence in which it is registered; existing homes or ''ban'' in newly numbered ''mu'' are assigned new numbers starting with one. The village name of the original settlement is usually retained for the larger grouping.

Such village names are not part of a household address, unless ''Ban'' is retained as part of the toponym when such a settlement is upgraded—e.g., a household in Ban Dan would be addressed as Ban No.__ Mu No.__, Ban Dan Sub-district, [[Ban Dan District]], Buriram; or #/# T[''ambon''].Ban Dan A[''mphoe''].Ban Dan, Buriram 31000.
:Note: Usage of the short form ''number/number'' for ''ban/mu'' is both unofficial and unambiguous in a ''tambon'', but in city districts is restricted to subdivision of an original household registration into additional household registrations.

== Administration ==
Each such ''mu'' or group is led by a headman, usually called village headman or village chief ({{lang|th|ผู้ใหญ่บ้าน}} ''Phu Yai Ban''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hawaii.edu/thai/thaisongs/villMain.htm |title=  Village Chief Lee |author= Yudthaphon Vichianin |date=Aug 5, 2003 |format= interactive |work=  Thai Language Program |publisher=  [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] |accessdate=March 20, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66IxmEFmO |archivedate= March 20, 2012|quote=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is [[Elections_in_Thailand#Local_Administration|elected by the population of the village]] and then appointed by the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of the Interior]]. The headman has two assistants, one for governmental affairs and one for security affairs. There also may be a village committee with elected members from the village, serving as an advisory body of a village. Originally the village headman, once elected, was in office until reaching retirement age. They now only serve for a five-year term but can then apply for reelection. The same is true for the office of [[kamnan]] ({{lang|th|กำนัน}}) or "sub-district headman" at the next higher tambon (sub-district) level.

Communities ([[:th:ชุมชน|ชุมชน]]) or [[neighborhood]]s that are part of a town or city (''[[thesaban mueang]]'' and ''[[thesaban nakhon]]'') have no equivalent to village headman, but may be organized into [[community association]]s having advisory committees.

==Other meanings==
''Muban'' (or more fully ''muban chat san'', {{lang|th|หมู่บ้านจัดสรร}}), is also the Thai term for [[housing estate]] or [[gated community]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7926">[[Image:Tidal flat general sketch.png|right|thumb|330px|General sketch-map of a tidal plain, showing the typical tripartition in [[supratidal zone|supratidal]], [[intertidal]] and [[subtidal]] zones. The most apparent character of the area is the development of tidal channels, affecting mainly the [[intertidal zone]]. In this case, the tidal flat is protected seaward by a [[shoal|beach barrier]], but in many cases (low-energy [[water waves|waves]] and [[longshore currents]]) the tidal flats may directly pass into a shallow marine environment.]]

'''Mudflats''' or '''mud flats''', also known as '''tidal flats''', are [[coastal wetland]]s that form when mud is deposited by tides or rivers. They are found in sheltered areas such as [[bay]]s, [[bayou]]s, [[lagoon]]s, and [[Estuary|estuaries]]. Mudflats may be viewed [[geologic]]ally as exposed layers of [[bay mud]], resulting from deposition of [[estuarine]] [[silt]]s, [[clay]]s and marine animal [[detritus]]. Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the [[intertidal zone]], and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily.

In the past tidal flats were considered unhealthy, economically unimportant areas and were often dredged and developed into agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrcirl.org/marker/marker1701/0701.html Dredging Indian River Lagoon Wetlands 1920 - 1950s]&lt;/ref&gt; Several especially shallow mudflat areas, such as the [[Wadden Sea]], are now popular among those practising the sport of [[mudflat hiking]].

On the [[Baltic Sea]] coast of [[Germany]] in places, mudflats are exposed not by tidal action, but by wind-action driving water away from the shallows into the sea. These wind-affected mudflats are called ''[[windwatt]]s'' in German.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Stewart Island Oban Mudflats.jpg|thumb|Mudflats near [[Oban, New Zealand|Oban]] on [[Stewart Island/Rakiura|Stewart Island]], [[New Zealand]]]]

Tidal flats, along with intertidal [[salt marsh]]es and [[mangrove]] forests, are important [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sms.si.edu/IRLSPEC/Tidal_Flats.htm Tidal flat habitats]&lt;/ref&gt; They usually support a large population of wildlife, and are a key habitat that allows tens of millions of migratory [[shorebirds]] to migrate from breeding sites in the northern hemisphere to non-breeding areas in the southern hemisphere. They are often of vital importance to [[migratory bird]]s, as well as certain species of [[crab]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.seafdec.org.ph/handle/10862/454 Mud crab (Scylla serrata) culture in tidal flats with existing mangroves]&lt;/ref&gt; [[mollusk]]s and [[fish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/npr/ramsar_wetland/pamph/manko_34.pdf Manko - Tidal Flat, Mangrove Forest]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]] mudflats have been classified as a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] priority habitat.

The maintenance of mudflats is important in preventing coastal erosion. However, mudflats worldwide are under threat from predicted [[sea level rise]]s, land claims for development, [[Dredge|dredging]] due to shipping purposes, and [[soil contamination|chemical pollution]]. In some parts of the world, such as East and South-East Asia, mudflats have been reclaimed for [[aquaculture]], [[agriculture]], and industrial development. For example, around the [[Yellow Sea]] region of East Asia, more than 65% of mudflats present in the early 1950s had been destroyed by the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | first1 = J. | last1 = MacKinnon | first2 = Y.I. | last2 = Verkuil | first3 = N.J. | last3 = Murray | year = 2012 | title = IUCN situation analysis on East and Southeast Asian intertidal habitats, with particular reference to the Yellow Sea (including the Bohai Sea)| series = Occasional Paper of the IUCN Species Survival Commission No. 47 | pages =   70 | publisher =  IUCN | place =  Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK | ISBN = 9782831712550 | URL = http://www.iucn.org/asiancoastalwetlands/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Mudflat sediment deposits are focused into the [[intertidal zone]] which is composed of a barren zone and marshes. Within these areas are various ratios of sand and mud that make up the sedimentary layers.&lt;ref name=Reineck&gt;Reineck, H.E, and I.B Singh, ''Deposistional Sedimentary Environments,'' 2nd Ed. New York: Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 1980, pp. 418-428&lt;/ref&gt;  The associated growth of coastal sediment deposits can be attributed to rates of subsidence along with rates of deposition (example: silt transported via river) and changes in sea level.&lt;ref name=Reineck/&gt;
 
Barren zones extend from the lowest portion of the intertidal zone to the marsh areas. Beginning in close proximity to the tidal bars, sand dominated layers are prominent and become increasingly muddy throughout the tidal channels. Common bedding types include laminated sand, ripple bedding, and bay mud. [[Bioturbation]] also has a strong presence in barren zones.

[[Marshes]] contain an abundance of [[herbaceous plant]]s while the sediment layers consist of thin sand and mud layers. [[Mudcrack]]s are a common as well as wavy bedding planes.&lt;ref name=Reineck/&gt;  Marshes are also the origins of coal/peat layers because of the abundant decaying plant life.&lt;ref name=Reineck/&gt;

Salt pans can be distinguished in that they contain thinly laminated layers of clayey silt. The main source of the silt comes from rivers. Dried up mud along with wind erosion forms silt dunes. When flooding, rain or tides come in, the dried sediment is then re-distributed.&lt;ref name=Reineck/&gt;

The '''National Geographic Institute''' of [[Guatemala]] (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Instituto Geográfico Nacional "Ingeniero Alfredo Obiols Gómez"'' (IGN)) is a scientific agency of the [[Guatemala]]n government.

== History ==
IGN was created on the 29th of December 1964. In the 1930s, cartographic projects were carried out by ad hoc mapping commissions which were primarily responsible for boundary surveys.&lt;ref name=mugnier&gt;Mugnier 2008:815&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Maps and Cartography (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Departamento de Mapas y Cartografía'') was created in 1945 and followed by the creation of the Instituto Geográfico Nacional in 1964.&lt;ref name=mugnier /&gt;

In 1982 the agency was renamed to Instituto Geográfico Militar (IGM) after a merger with the Military Cartographic Service, and became a dependency of the [[Ministry of Defence (Guatemala)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Servicio Geográfico Militar - Historia |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Guatemala)|Ministerio de la Defensa Nacional]] |date= |url=http://www.mindef.mil.gt/ftierra/emdn/sgm/historia.html |doi= |accessdate=2009-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920001328/http://www.mindef.mil.gt/ftierra/emdn/sgm/historia.html |archivedate=2009-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1998, following the demilitarisation of state institutions stipulated in the Peace Accords, the IGN was reinstated as a dependency of the Ministry of Communications, Infrastructure and Housing, and became a dependency of the Ministry of Agriculture in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=ACUERDO GUBERNATIVO No. 474-2006 |url=http://www.congreso.gob.gt/archivos/decretos/2006/gtdgx04-2006.pdf |publisher=Diario de Centro América, 27 de septiembre de 2006 |issue=22 |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2009-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Northern Sea Route vs Southern Sea Route.svg|thumb|300px| The Northeast passage (blue) and an alternative route through the [[Suez Canal]] (red)]]
The '''Northeast Passage''' (abbreviated as '''NEP''') is, from the European and northern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] point of view, the [[Arctic shipping routes|shipping route]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], along the [[Arctic Ocean]] coasts of [[Norway]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="Østreng 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Oct 2011"/&gt; The western route through the islands of Canada is accordingly called [[Northwest Passage]] (NWP).

The NEP traverses (from East to West) the [[Barents Sea]], [[Kara Sea]], [[Laptev Sea]], [[East Siberian Sea]], and [[Chukchi Sea]], and it includes the [[Northern Sea Route]] (NSR).&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Oct 2011"/&gt; The Northern Sea Route is a portion of the NEP; it is defined in Russian law and does not include the Barents sea and therefore does not reach the Atlantic Ocean. However, since the NSR has a significant overlap over the majority of the NEP, sometimes the NSR term has been used to refer to the entirety of the Northeast Passage.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMSA 2009"/&gt;

The Northeast Passage is one of several Arctic maritime routes, the others being the [[Northwest Passage]] (going along Canada's and Alaska's coasts) and the [[Transpolar Sea Route|Transpolar Route]] (going through the North Pole).&lt;ref name="Østreng 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;

The first confirmed complete passage, from west to east, was made by the [[Finland|Finnish]] explorer [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]], with the ship ''Vega'' in 1878–79 (he was forced to wintering just a few days' sailing distance from Bering Strait, due to pack ice).

==History==

===11th to 17th centuries===
[[File:1570 Ortelius Map of Asia (first edition) - Geographicus - AsiaeNovaDescriptio-ortelius.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|First edition of the important map of Asia by [[Abraham Ortelius]] (1572). Ortelius marks a vast network of waterways across East Asia, advocating his belief that a shipping route existed through China to the [[East Siberian Sea|Northern Sea]] and thence, by way of the Northeast Passage, to Europe.]]
The motivation to navigate the Northeast passage was initially economic. In Russia, the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans was first proposed by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525. However, Russian settlers and traders on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

During a voyage across the [[Barents Sea]] in search of the Northeast Passage in 1553, English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] in the 1590s, and they continued to appear on maps by [[Jan Janssonius]] and [[Willem Blaeu]] into the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hacquebord |first=Louwrens |date=September 1995 |title=In Search of ''Het Behouden Huys'': A Survey of the Remains of the House of Willem Barentsz on Novaya Zemlya |journal=Arctic |volume=48 |issue=3 |page=250 |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic48-3-248.pdf |accessdate=8 March 2009 |doi=10.14430/arctic1246 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327084815/http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic48-3-248.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century, traders had established a continuous sea route from [[Arkhangelsk]] to the [[Yamal Peninsula]], where they portaged to the [[Gulf of Ob]]. This route, known as the ''Mangazeya seaway'', after its eastern terminus, the trade depot of [[Mangazeya]], was an early precursor to the Northern Sea Route.

East of the Yamal, the route north of the [[Taimyr Peninsula]] proved impossible or impractical. East of the Taimyr, from the 1630s, Russians began to sail the Arctic coast from the mouth of the [[Lena River]] to a point beyond the mouth of the [[Kolyma River]]. Both [[Vitus Bering]] (in 1728) and [[James Cook]] (in 1778) entered the Bering Strait from the south and sailed some distance northwest, but from 1648 ([[Semyon Dezhnev]]) to 1879 ([[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]]) no one is recorded as having sailed eastward between the Kolyma and Bering Strait.

[[File:1601 De Bry and de Veer Map of Nova Zembla and the Northeast Passage - Geographicus - NovaZembla-debry-1601.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map drawn in 1601 by [[Theodore de Bry]] to describe the ill–fated third voyage of the Dutch explorer William Barentsz in search of the Northeast Passage]]
The western parts of the passage were explored by northern European countries such as [[England]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], and [[Norway]], looking for an alternative seaway to [[China]] and [[India]]. Although these expeditions failed, new coasts and islands were discovered. The most notable was the 1596 expedition led by Dutch navigator [[Willem Barentsz]], who discovered [[Spitsbergen]] and [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]], and rounded the north end of [[Novaya Zemlya]].

Fearing English and Dutch penetration into Siberia, [[Russia]] closed the Mangazeya seaway in 1619. [[Pomors|Pomor]] activity in Northern Asia declined and most Arctic exploration in the 17th century was carried out by Siberian [[Cossack]]s, sailing from one river mouth to another in their Arctic-worthy ''[[Koch (boat)|kochs]]''. In 1648, the most famous of these expeditions, led by Fedot Alekseev and [[Semyon Dezhnev]], sailed east from the mouth of the [[Kolyma River]] to the Pacific Ocean, and rounded the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], thus proving that no land connection existed between Asia and North America.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Eighty years after [[Semyon Dezhnev|Dezhnev]], in 1728, another Russian explorer, [[Denmark|Danish]]-born [[Vitus Bering]] on ''Svyatoy Gavriil'' (Saint Gabriel) made a similar voyage in reverse, starting in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] and going north to the passage that now bears his name; the [[Bering Strait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Richard|title=The Arctic: A History|publisher=A. Sutton|year=2007|location=Stroud|page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Bering who named the [[Diomede Islands]], which Dezhnev had vaguely mentioned.

Bering's explorations of 1725–30 were part of a larger scheme of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], known as the ''[[Great Northern Expedition]]''.

The ''Second Kamchatka Expedition'' took place in 1735–42, with two ships, ''Svyatoy Pyotr'' and ''Svyatoy Pavel'', the latter commanded by Bering's deputy in the first expedition, Captain [[Aleksey Chirikov]]. During the Second Expedition Bering became the first Westerner to sight the coast of northwestern North America, and Chirikov was the first Westerner to land there (a storm had separated the two ships earlier). On his return leg, Bering discovered the [[Aleutian Islands]] but fell ill, and ''Svyatoy Pyotr'' had to take shelter on an island off Kamchatka, where Bering died ([[Bering Island]]).

Independent of Bering and Chirikov, other Russian Imperial Navy parties took part in the Second Great Northern Expedition. One of these, led by [[Semyon Chelyuskin]], in May 1742 reached [[Cape Chelyuskin]], the northernmost point of both the Northeast Passage and the Eurasian continent.

Later expeditions to explore the North East Passage took place in the 1760s ([[Vasiliy Chichagov]]), 1785–95 ([[Joseph Billings]] and [[Gavril Sarychev]]), the 1820s and 1830s ([[Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel]],  [[Pyotr Fyodorovich Anjou]],  [[Fyodor Petrovich Litke|Count Fyodor Litke]] and others). The possibility of navigating the length of the passage was proved by the mid-19th century.

However, it was only in 1878-79 that [[Finland|Fenno-Swedish]] explorer [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]] (born in Finland but exiled to Sweden many years before the expedition) made the first complete passage of the Northeast Passage, leading the [[Vega expedition]] from west to east. The ship's captain on this expedition was Lieutenant [[Louis Palander]] of the Swedish Royal Navy. 

One year before Nordenskiöld's voyage, commercial exploitation of a section of the route started with the so-called ''Kara expeditions'', exporting Siberian agricultural produce via the [[Kara Sea]]. Of 122 convoys between 1877 and 1919 only 75 succeeded, transporting as little as 55 tons of cargo. From 1911 the [[Kolyma River]] steamboats ran from [[Vladivostok]] to the Kolyma once a year.

In 1912, two Russian expeditions set out; Captain [[Georgy Brusilov]] and the [[Brusilov Expedition]] in the ''Santa Anna'', and Captain [[Alexander Kuchin]] with [[Vladimir Rusanov]] in the ''Gerkules''; each with a woman on board. Both expeditions were hastily arranged, and both disappeared. The German Arctic Expedition of 1912, led by [[Herbert Schröder-Stranz]], ended disastrously with only 7 of 15 crew members surviving the preliminary expedition to [[Nordaustlandet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exploring Polar Frontiers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&amp;pg=PA578|first=William J.|last=Mills|isbn=1-57607-422-6|page=578|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harakiri im Polarmeer |url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/1737/harakiri_im_polarmeer.html |first=Frank |last=Thadeusz |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |year=2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019054244/http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/1737/harakiri_im_polarmeer.html |archivedate=19 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 [[Jonas Lied]] organized a successful expedition through the [[Kara Sea]] to Yenisei. Explorer and scientist [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and Siberian industrialist [[Stephan Vostrotin]] were prominent passengers. Lied had founded The Siberian company with the purpose of exporting and importing goods through the great Siberian rivers and the Kara Sea. The 1913 trip is recorded in Nansen's ''Through Siberia''.&lt;ref&gt;Fridtjof Nansen: ''Through Siberia – the land of the future''. London: Heinemann, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, a Russian expedition led by [[Boris Vilkitskiy]] made the passage from east to west with the [[icebreaker]]s [[Icebreaker Taymyr|''Taymyr'']] and [[Icebreaker Vaygach|''Vaygach'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barr|first=William|year=1975|url=http://epic.awi.de/Publications/Polarforsch1975_1_6.pdf|title=A Tsarist Attempt at Opening the Northern Sea Route: The Arctic Oeean Hydrographie Expedition, 1910–1915|accessdate=23 August 2010|journal=Polarforschung|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016154350/http://epic.awi.de/Publications/Polarforsch1975_1_6.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordenskiöld, [[Fridtjof Nansen|Nansen]], [[Roald Amundsen|Amundsen]], [[George W. DeLong|DeLong]], [[Stepan Makarov|Makarov]] and others also led expeditions, mainly for scientific and cartographic purposes.

===After the Russian Revolution===
The introduction of [[radio]], steamboats, and icebreakers made running the Northern Sea Route viable. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the [[Soviet Union]] was isolated from the western powers, which made it imperative to use this route. Besides being the shortest seaway between the western and far eastern USSR, it was the only one that lay completely inside Soviet internal waters and did not impinge on waters of opposing countries.

In 1932, a Soviet expedition led by Professor [[Otto Yulievich Schmidt]] was the first to sail all the way from Arkhangelsk to the Bering Strait in the same summer without wintering en route. After trial runs in 1933 and 1934, the ''Northern Sea Route'' was officially defined and open and commercial exploitation began in 1935. The next year, part of the [[Baltic Fleet]] made the passage to the Pacific where armed conflict with [[Japan]] was looming.

A special governing body ''Glavsevmorput'' ([[Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route]]) was set up in 1932, with Otto Schmidt as its director. It supervised navigation and built Arctic ports.

During the early part of [[World War II]], the Soviets allowed the [[German auxiliary cruiser Komet|German auxiliary cruiser ''Komet'']] to use the Northern Sea Route in the summer of 1940 to evade the British [[Royal Navy]] and break out into the Pacific Ocean. ''Komet'' was escorted by Soviet icebreakers during her journey. After the start of the Soviet-German War, the Soviets transferred several destroyers from the Pacific Fleet to the Northern Fleet via the Arctic. The Soviets also used the Northern Sea Route to transfer materials from the Soviet Far East to European Russia, and the Germans launched [[Operation Wunderland]] to interdict this traffic.

In July 1965, [[USCGC Northwind (WAGB-282)|USCGC ''Northwind'' (WAGB-282)]], commanded by Captain Kingdrel N. Ayers [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]], conducted an oceanographic survey between [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], and [[Scotland]] and was the first western vessel to operate in the [[Kara Sea]] of the [[Soviet Union]], for which she received the [[Coast Guard Unit Commendation]] with [[Operational Distinguishing Device]]. The real, (then) classified mission of ''Northwind'' was to attempt a transit of the "Northeast Passage". The effort was not successful due to diplomatic reasons and caused an international incident between the U.S.S.R. and U.S.A.&lt;ref&gt;Petrow, Richard (1967) ''Across the Top of Russia, The Cruise of the USCGC Northwind into the Polar Seas North of Siberia''. New York, David McKay Co. Inc. and Van Rees Press. Library of Congress Cataloge Number: 67-19909.&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2013 ''Reuters News'' report on expanding Russian arctic natural gas shipments to Asia, stated that while shipping traffic on the NSR surged in 2012 to around 1 million tons of various kinds of cargoes, "it pales by comparison with the 1987 peak of 6.6 million tons." It also reported that the Finnish crude oil tanker ''Uikku'' was the first non-Russian energy vessel to brave the NSR in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2013/01/28/279017.htm |title=Russia Arctic Natural Gas Shipping Route to Asia 10 Years Away |publisher=Insurancejournal.com |date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=10 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413132258/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2013/01/28/279017.htm |archivedate=13 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the Soviet Union===
After the Soviet Union dissolved in the early 1990s, commercial navigation in the Siberian Arctic went into decline.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt; Regular shipping is found only from [[Murmansk]] to [[Dudinka]] in the west and between [[Vladivostok]] and [[Pevek]] in the east. Ports between Dudinka and Pevek see virtually no shipping. [[Logashkino]] and [[Nordvik (Laptev Sea)|Nordvik]] were abandoned and are now [[ghost towns]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Northern Sea Route==
[[File:Map of the Arctic region showing the Northeast Passage, the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage, and bathymetry.png|thumb|upright=1.7|Map of the Arctic region showing the Northern Sea Route (yellow &amp; white dash line), in the context of the Northeast Passage, and [[Northwest Passage]]&lt;ref name="AMSA 2009"/&gt;]]

{{main article|Northern Sea Route}}
A similar route to the NEP is the [[Northern Sea Route]] (NSR). The NSR is a shipping route defined in Russian legislation as extending from the Novaya Zhelaniya straits (at the [[Novaya Zemlya]] archipelago, connecting the Barents Sea to the West and the Kara Sea to the East), to Cape Dezhnev by the [[Bering Strait]]. Therefore, the NEP encompasses all the East Arctic seas, and the NSR all the seas except the Barents Sea.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solski 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephenson 2013a"/&gt; Since the NSR constitutes the majority of the NEP, sometimes the term NSR has been used to refer to the entirety of the NEP.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica 2013"/&gt;

==Governance==
{{further information|Arctic cooperation and politics}}

The governance of the NEP has developed considerably in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The main sources of governance are the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), the [[Arctic Council]] (AC), the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO), and the domestic legislation of the Russian Federation. In combination, they cover territorial claims, economic exploitation, technical shipping requirements, environmental protection, and [[search and rescue]] responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;

==Pacific-Atlantic distances==
The Northeast Passage is a shorter route to connect Northeast Asia with Western Europe, compared to the existing routes through the [[Suez Canal]], the [[Panama Canal]], or around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The table below shows the sailing distances between the major East Asia sea ports, and Rotterdam in Europe (these distances assume no route diversions owing to ice conditions).&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;

===Commercial value===
A usable Northern Sea Route between northern Europe to North Pacific ports would cut time at sea (and resultant fuel consumption) by more than half. For the corporate players in bulk shipping of relative low-value raw materials, cost savings for fuel may appear as a driver to explore the Northern Sea Route for commercial transits, and not necessarily reduced lead time. The Northern Sea Route allows [[economies of scale]] compared to coastal route alternatives, with vessel draught and beam limitation. Environmental demands faced by the maritime shipping industry may emerge as a driver for developing the Northern Sea Route. Increased awareness of environmental benefits and costs for both the Northern Sea Route and Suez routes will probably be important factors in this respect.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.husdal.com/2011/05/22/the-final-frontier-the-northern-sea-route/ Schøyen, H., &amp; Bråthen, S.

In 2011, four ships sailed the length of the Northern Sea Route and Northeast Passage, from the Atlantic to Pacific Oceans. In 2012, 46 ships sailed the NSR.&lt;ref name="Vidal 2013"/&gt;

In August 2012, Russian media reported that 85% of vessels transiting the Northern Sea Route in 2011 were carrying gas or oil, and 80% were high-capacity tankers.&lt;ref name=anchorage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anchoragepress.com/news/arctic-oil-rush-the-new-global-petroleum-race-will-shape/article_9bb7680e-0390-11e2-b68a-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Arctic oil rush: The new global petroleum race will shape Alaska’s future|publisher=Anchorage Press|date=20 September 2012|accessdate=10 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130118094143/http://www.anchoragepress.com/news/arctic-oil-rush-the-new-global-petroleum-race-will-shape/article_9bb7680e-0390-11e2-b68a-001a4bcf887a.html|archivedate=18 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental concerns===
In September 2012, [[Inuit Circumpolar Conference]] Chair Jimmy Stotts was reported as saying there is concern that increased shipping could adversely affect indigenous hunting of marine mammals. Also concerning is the lack of infrastructure on the Western Alaska coast to deal with a spill or a wrecked vessel.&lt;ref name=anchorage/&gt;

==Ice conditions==
[[File:Arctic sea ice extent in 2013 - maximum and minimum ice extents.png|thumb|upright=1.7|Sea ice extent in March 2013 (left) and September 2013 (right), illustrating the respective monthly averages during the winter maximum and summer minimum extents. The magenta lines indicate the median ice extents in March and September, respectively, during the period 1981–2010.]]
Unlike the similar latitudes in Alaska and Canada (along the [[Northwest Passage]]), parts of the NEP remain ice-free year-round. This is mostly the case of the [[Barents Sea]], by the northern coast of Norway and Northwestern coast of Russia. The Barents sea is affected by the currents of warm water from the Gulf Stream, feeding into the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;

Other parts of the NEP (mostly the NSR part), freeze in winter and partially melt in the summer months, especially along the coasts. Since the early 2000s the summer melting has been stronger, and the winter freezing has been weaker, opening the waters to the possibility of more non-ice breaking ships taking advantage of the route for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephenson 2013a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephenson 2013 January"/&gt;

===Ice-free ports===
[[File:Arctic Ocean Seaports.png|thumb|Arctic Ocean seaports]]
Only one Russian seaport in the Barents Sea along the officially defined Northern Sea Route (which begins at the Kara Gates Strait) is [[ice-free port|ice-free]] year-round, [[Murmansk]] on the [[Kola Peninsula]]. Other Arctic ports are generally usable from July to October, or, such as [[Dudinka]], are served by [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s. Beyond the Bering Strait, the end of the Northern Sea Route, and south along Russia's Pacific seaboard [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy|Petropavlovsk]] in [[Kamchatka Oblast|Kamchatka]], [[Vanino, Khabarovsk Krai|Vanino]], [[Nakhodka]], and [[Vladivostok]] are accessible year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/confirmation-of-open-water-circling-north-pole/ |title=Experts Confirm Open Water Circling Arctic |last=Revkin |first=Andrew |date=6 September 2008 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=3 October 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819014044/http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/confirmation-of-open-water-circling-north-pole/ |archivedate=19 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transit shipping activity==
Due to its harsh climactic conditions and the low population density, the NEP has had relatively little activity. The NSR portion of the NEP experienced its highest levels of activity during the rule of the USSR. The NSR greatly developed as a heavily subsidized domestic route, with traffic peaking in 1987 with 6.58 million tons of cargo carried by 331 ships over 1306 voyages. With the end of the Soviet Union and its subsidies, the NSR traffic collapsed to 1.5–2 M tons of cargo.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;

Since the early 2000s, the thickness and area extent of the Arctic sea ice has experienced significant reduction, compared to the recorded averages.&lt;ref name="Stephenson 2013 January"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kramer 2011"/&gt; This has led to an increase in transit shipping. In 2011, four ships sailed the entire length of the NEP, 46 in 2012, and 19 in 2013.&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal 2013"/&gt; The number of trips is still very small compared to the thousands of ships each year through the Suez Canal. Mainstream container shipping is expected to continue to overwhelmingly use the Suez route, while niche activities like bulk shipping is expected to grow, driven by the mining industries of the Arctic.&lt;ref name="Pettersen 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buixade Farre 2015"/&gt;

===Ice-free navigation===

The term "ice free" generally refers to the absence of [[fast ice]], i.e. continuously frozen surface ice sheet cover. Under common usage "ice free" does not mean that there is no [[Arctic sea ice]]. "Ice free" regions can contain broken ice cover of varying density, often still requiring appropriately strengthened hulls or icebreaker support for safe passage.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

On 28 July 2009, the sailing yacht RX II (36-foot length), with expedition leader Trond Aasvoll and crew Hans Fredrik Haukland and Finn Andreassen left Vardø in Norway on a quest to circumnavigate the North Pole. The northern sea route proved ice free and the three Norwegians sailed into the Bering Strait on 24 September. But Russian bureaucracy managed to do what the arctic waters didn't – to stop their effort to sail around in one season. The boat over-wintered in Nome, and finished the trip through the Northwest passage the following summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcticfrontiers.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=789-round-the-north-pole&amp;amp;catid=1-latest&amp;amp;Itemid=327&amp;amp;lang=en "Arctic expedition round the North Pole, through both the Northeast Passage and the Northwest Passage with RX2"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720075434/http://arcticfrontiers.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=789-round-the-north-pole&amp;catid=1-latest&amp;Itemid=327&amp;lang=en |date=20 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
In 2007, [[Finland]] issued a €10 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2007 coinage|Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld and Northeast Passage commemorative coin]] to celebrate the 175th anniversary of Nordenskiöld's birth and his discovery of the northern sea route. The obverse features an abstract portrait of Nordenskiöld at the helm of his ship. The reverse is dominated by a pattern resembling the labyrinth formed by adjacent ice floes. The coin is one of the [[Europa Coins 2007]] series, which celebrates European achievements in history.

[[File:Northwest passage.jpg|thumb|320px|Northwest Passage routes]]
The '''Northwest Passage'''  ('''NWP''') is, from the European and northern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] point of view, the sea route to the [[Pacific Ocean]] through the [[Arctic Ocean]], along the northern coast of [[North America]] via waterways through the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Northwest%20Passage |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |title=Northwest passage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.carc.org/whatsnew/writings/amitchell.html |title=The Northwest Passage Thawed |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Alanna |last=Mitchell |date=February 5, 2000 |page=A9 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070730035434/http://www.carc.org/whatsnew/writings/amitchell.html |archive-date=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AMSA 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Østreng 2013"/&gt; The eastern route along the Arctic coasts of Norway and Siberia is accordingly called [[Northeast Passage]] (NEP).

The various islands of the [[archipelago]] are separated from one another and from the [[Canada|Canadian]] mainland by a series of [[Arctic]] waterways collectively known as the '''Northwest Passages''' or '''Northwestern Passages'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://ioc.unesco.org/oceanteacher/OceanTeacher2/06_OcDtaMgtProc/01_DataOps/06_OcDtaForm/01_OcDtaFormFunda/01_Codes/PreviousIHOandOther.htm |title=IHO Codes for Oceans &amp; Seas, and Other Code Systems: IHO 23-3rd: Limits of Oceans and Seas, Special Publication 23 |edition=3rd |date=1953 |publisher=International Hydrographic Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, European explorers sought a navigable passage as a possible trade route to Asia. An ice-bound northern route was discovered in 1850 by the Irish explorer [[Robert McClure]]; it was through a more southerly opening in an area explored by the Scotsman [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]] in 1854 that Norwegian [[Roald Amundsen]] made the first complete passage in 1903–1906. Until 2009, the [[Arctic ice pack|Arctic pack ice]] prevented regular [[Ship transport|marine shipping]] throughout most of the year. [[Arctic sea ice decline]] has rendered the waterways more navigable for [[ice navigation]].&lt;ref name="esa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/11/30/the_top_10_stories_you_missed_in_2009 |title=The Top 10 Stories You Missed in 2009: A few ways the world changed while you weren't looking |first=Joshua E. |last=Keating |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contested [[sovereignty]] claims over the waters may complicate future shipping through the region: the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] maintains that the Northwestern Passages are part of [[Canadian Internal Waters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tc.gc.ca/marinesafety%5CTP%5CTP14202%5Cinterpretation.htm |title=TP 14202 E Interpretation |publisher=Transport Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[United States]] and various [[Europe]]an countries claim that they are an international strait and transit passage, allowing free and unencumbered passage.&lt;ref name="paprl1"&gt;{{cite report |first1=Matthew |last1=Carnaghan |first2=Allison |last2=Goody |date=January 26, 2006 |title=Canadian Arctic Sovereignty |publisher=Library of Parliament |url= https://lop.parl.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/prb0561-e.pdf |archive-date=June 7, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170607090818/https://lop.parl.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/prb0561-e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icefreearctic"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/star/documents/2007IceSymp/FinalArcticReport_2001.pdf |title=Naval Operations in an ice-free Arctic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If, as has been claimed, parts of the eastern end of the Passage are barely {{convert|15|m|ft}} deep,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url        =http://www.steelguru.com/international_news/No_to_shipping_ore_through_Northwest_Passage_Baffinland_CEO/327008.html |title=No to shipping ore through Northwest Passage – Baffinland CEO |work=Steel Guru |date=October 20, 2013 |access-date =October 21, 2013 |quote=The head of a Canadian mining company developing a massive mineral deposit within the Arctic Circle said the Northwest Passage won't work as a viable shipping route to Europe and Asia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the route's viability as a Euro-Asian shipping route is reduced.

==Overview==
[[File:Strait of Anian from Novissima totius tarrarum orbis tabula by Hugo Allard.png|thumb|Strait of Anian. Upper left corner. (Hugo Allard, 1685)]]
===Early expeditions===
Before the [[Little Ice Age]] (late Middle Ages to the 19th century), [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[Vikings]] sailed as far north and west as [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Skraeling Island]] and [[Ruin Island]] for hunting expeditions and trading with the [[Inuit]] and people of the [[Dorset culture]] who already inhabited the region.&lt;ref&gt;''Inuit-Norse contact in the Smith Sound region''/Schledermann, P. McCullough, K.M.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the end of the 15th century and the 20th century, [[Colonialism|colonial powers]] from [[Europe]] dispatched explorers in an attempt to discover a commercial sea route north and west around North America. The Northwest Passage represented a new route to the established trading nations of [[Asia]].

England called the hypothetical northern route the "Northwest Passage". The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the continent, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters. There was a lack of scientific knowledge about conditions; for instance, some people believed that [[seawater]] was incapable of freezing. (As late as the mid-18th century, Captain [[James Cook]] had reported that [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[iceberg]]s had yielded fresh water, seemingly confirming the hypothesis.) Explorers thought that an [[Open Polar Sea|open water route]] close to the [[North Pole]] must exist.&lt;ref name="cook" /&gt; The belief that a route lay to the far north persisted for several centuries and led to numerous expeditions into the Arctic. Many ended in disaster, including that by Sir [[John Franklin]] in 1845. While searching for him the [[McClure Arctic Expedition]] discovered the Northwest Passage in 1850.

In 1906, the Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] first successfully completed a passage from [[Greenland]] to [[Alaska]] in the [[sloop]] {{ship||Gjøa}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mills |first=William James |title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=2003 |isbn=1-57607-422-6 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that date, several fortified ships have made the journey.

From east to west, the direction of most early exploration attempts, expeditions entered the passage from the Atlantic Ocean via the [[Davis Strait]] and through [[Baffin Bay]]. Five to seven routes have been taken through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, via the [[McClure Strait]], [[Dease Strait]], and the [[Prince of Wales Strait]], but not all of them are suitable for larger ships.&lt;ref name="paprl1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Charron"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cdfai.org/PDF/Charron,%20Andrea-Paper.pdf |title=Andrea Charron—The Northwest Passage Shipping Channel: Is Canada's Sovereignty Really Floating Away? |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130413234114/http://cdfai.org/PDF/Charron%2C%20Andrea-Paper.pdf |archive-date=April 13, 2013}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(225&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there ships passed through waterways through the [[Beaufort Sea]], [[Chukchi Sea]], and [[Bering Strait]] (separating [[Russia]] and Alaska), into the Pacific Ocean.

===Potential as a ship lane===

In the 21st century, major changes to the ice pack due to [[climate change]] have stirred speculation that the passage may become clear enough of ice to permit safe commercial shipping for at least part of the year. On August 21, 2007, the Northwest Passage became open to ships without the need of an [[icebreaker]]. According to Nalan Koc of the [[Norwegian Polar Institute]], this was the first time the Passage has been clear since they began keeping records in 1972.&lt;ref name="esa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/28/climatechange.internationalnews |title=North-West Passage is now plain sailing |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=August 28, 2007 |access-date=April 10, 2010 |first=Gwladys |last=Fouché}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northwest Passage opened again on August 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2008/082508.html |title=Arctic shortcuts open up; decline pace steady}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually reported in mainstream medias that ocean [[Melting|thawing]] will open up the Northwest Passage (and within it, the [[Northern Sea Route]]) for various kind of ships, making it possible to sail around the [[Polar ice cap|Arctic ice cap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mooney |first1=Chris |title=The Arctic is melting — but shipping through the Northwest Passage is another story |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/09/10/why-the-northwest-passage-probably-wont-be-ready-for-shipping-any-time-soon/ |work=Washington Post |date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly cutting thousands of miles off shipping routes. Warning that the [[NASA]] satellite images indicated the Arctic may have entered a "death spiral" caused by climate change, Professor [[Mark Serreze]], a sea ice specialist at the U.S. [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]] (NSIDC) said: "The passages are open. It's a historic event. We are going to see this more and more as the years go by."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/5CE1A814261121C6652574B7001C9047?OpenDocument ptinews.com, North Pole becomes an 'island']{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/for-the-first-time-in-human-history-the-north-pole-can-be-circumnavigated-913924.html |title=independent.co.uk, For the first time in human history, the North Pole can be circumnavigated |work=[[The Independent]] |date=August 31, 2008 |access-date=February 19, 2011 |location=London |first=Geoffrey |last=Lean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some thick sections of ice will remain hard to melt in the shorter term. Such drifting and large chunks of ice, especially in springtime, can be problematic as they can clog entire [[straits]] or severely damage a ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]. Cargo routes may therefore be slower and uncertain, depending on prevailing conditions and the ability to predict them. Because a plurality of containerized traffic operates in a [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]] mode (which does not tolerate delays well) and the relative isolation of the passage (which impedes shipping companies from optimizing their operations by grouping multiple stopovers on a same itinerary), the Northwest Passage and other Arctic routes are not always seen as promising [[Sea lane|shipping lanes]] by industry insiders, at least for the time being.&lt;ref name="Lasserre"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lasserre |first=Frédéric |last2= |first2= |date=November 2011 |title=The Geopolitics of Arctic Passages and Continental Shelves |url= https://www.ggr.ulaval.ca/sites/default/files/documents/Lasserre/Publications/geopolitics.pdf |journal=Public Sector Digest |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uncertainty related to physical damages to ships is also thought to translate into higher [[insurance]] premiums,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/trade-lanes/arctic-shipping-presents-insurance-challenges_20140827.html |title=Arctic shipping presents insurance challenges |date=2014 |website=JOC |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially because of the technical challenges posed by Arctic navigation (as of 2014, only 12 percent of Canada's Arctic waters have been [[Nautical chart|charted]] to modern standards).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lackenbauer |first=Whitney |date=2014 |title=On Uncertain Ice: The Future of Arctic Shipping and the Northwest Passage |url= https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/uncertain-ice-lackenbauer-lajeunesse.pdf#page=8 |page=4 |journal=Canadian Global Affairs Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Arctic shrinkage, the Beluga group of [[Bremen]], Germany, sent the first Western commercial vessels through the Northern Sea Route (Northeast Passage) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8264345.stm |title=Arctic trail blazers make history |access-date=August 17, 2010 |work=BBC News |date=September 19, 2009 |first=Artyom |last=Liss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] announced that "ships entering the North-West passage should first report to his government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/08/31/eaarctic131.xml |title=telegraph.co.uk, Arctic becomes an island as ice melts |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=August 31, 2008 |access-date=February 19, 2011 |location=London |first=Auslan |last=Cramb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of the route followed by by the SS Manhattan to traverse the Northwest Passage.png|thumb|right|Map of the route followed by the US ship SS ''Manhattan'' in 1969.]]

The first commercial [[cargo ship]] to have sailed through the Northwest Passage was {{SS|Manhattan|1962|6}} in August 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William D. |last=Smith |title=Northwest Passage, The Historic Voyage of the S.S.

The largest passenger ship to navigate the Northwest Passage was the [[cruise liner]] {{ship||Crystal Serenity}} of [[gross tonnage]] 69,000. Starting on 10 August 2016, the ship sailed from [[Vancouver]] to [[New York City]] with 1,500 passengers and crew, taking 28 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-maritime-museum-northwest-passage-1.3709993 |title=Vancouver Maritime Museum joining largest ship to sail Northwest Passage |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, two of the freighters leaving [[Baffinland]]'s port in the [[Milne Inlet]], on [[Baffin Island]]'s north shore, were bound for ports in Asia.&lt;ref name=mining2018-11-08/&gt; Those freighters did not sail west through the remainder of the Northwest Passage, they sailed east, rounded the tip of Greenland, and transitted Russia's Northern Sea Route.

}}The Northwest Passage includes three sections:
*East
**East of Baffin Island: [[Baffin Bay]] between Greenland and [[Baffin Island]] to [[Lancaster Sound]] at the north end of Baffin Island, or
**West of Baffin Island (impractical): Through [[Hudson Strait]] south of Baffin Island, north through the [[Foxe Basin]], west through the [[Fury and Hecla Strait]], north to Lancaster Sound through the [[Gulf of Boothia]] and [[Prince Regent Inlet]]. The Fury and Hecla Strait is usually closed by ice.
*Centre: [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]]
**North: From Lancaster Sound west through the [[Parry Channel]] to the [[Prince of Wales Strait]] on the northwest side of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]]. [[M'Clure Strait]] to the northwest is ice-filled; southwest through the Prince of Wales Strait between Victoria Island and [[Banks Island]] might be passable, or
**South: From Lancaster Sound west past [[Prince Regent Inlet]] (basically a cul-de-sac but it may be possible to exit west through the [[Bellot Strait]]), past [[Somerset Island (Nunavut)|Somerset Island]], south through [[Peel Sound]] between Somerset Island and [[Prince of Wales Island (Nunavut)|Prince of Wales Island]], either southwest through [[Victoria Strait]] (ice-choked), or directly south along the coast through [[Rae Strait]] and [[James Ross Strait]] and west through [[Simpson Strait]] south of [[King William Island]] (shallow) into [[Queen Maud Gulf]], then west along the mainland coast south of Victoria Island.
*West: There being no major islands, follow the coast to the [[Bering Strait]].

Many attempts were made to find a salt water exit west from Hudson Bay, but the Fury and Hecla Strait in the far north is blocked by ice. The eastern entrance and main axis of the northwest passage, the Parry Channel, was found in 1819. The approach from the west through Bering Strait is impractical because of the need to sail around ice near [[Point Barrow]]. East of Point Barrow the coast is fairly clear in summer. This area was mapped in pieces from overland in 1821–1839. This leaves the large rectangle north of the coast, south of Parry Channel and east of Baffin Island. This area was mostly mapped in 1848–1854 by ships looking for Franklin's lost expedition. The first crossing was made by Amundsen in 1903–1905. He used a small ship and hugged the coast.

==Extent==

The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Northwestern Passages as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf |title=Limits of Oceans and Seas |edition=3rd |date=1953 |publisher=International Hydrographic Organization |access-date=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical expeditions==
[[File:Straße von Anian.png|thumb|Assumed route of the Strait of Anián]]
As a result of their westward explorations and their settlement of Greenland, the [[Viking]]s sailed as far north and west as Ellesmere Island, Skraeling Island for hunting expeditions and trading with Inuit groups. The subsequent arrival of the Little Ice Age is thought to have been one of the reasons that European seafaring into the Northwest Passage ceased until the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=Gary Dean |date=2016 |title=Vikings and Goths: A History of Ancient and Medieval Sweden |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |isbn=978-1-4766-6218-3 |pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strait of Anián===
{{Main|Strait of Anián}}
In 1539, [[Hernán Cortés]] commissioned [[Francisco de Ulloa]] to sail along the [[Baja California Peninsula]] on the western coast of North America. Ulloa concluded that the [[Gulf of California]] was the southernmost section of a strait supposedly linking the Pacific with the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. His voyage perpetuated the notion of the [[Island of California]] and saw the beginning of a search for the Strait of Anián.

The strait probably took its name from Ania, a Chinese province mentioned in a 1559 edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s book; it first appears on a map issued by [[Italy|Italian]] [[Cartography |cartographer]] [[Giacomo Gastaldi]] about 1562. Five years later [[Bolognini Zaltieri]] issued a map showing a narrow and crooked Strait of Anian separating Asia from the [[Americas]]. The strait grew in European imagination as an easy sea lane linking Europe with the residence of [[Khagan]] (the Great Khan) in [[Cathay]] (northern [[China]]).

Cartographers and seamen tried to demonstrate its reality. Sir [[Francis Drake]] sought the western entrance in 1579. The [[Greeks|Greek]] pilot [[Juan de Fuca]], sailing from Acapulco (in Mexico) under the flag of the Spanish crown, claimed he had sailed the strait from the Pacific to the [[North Sea]] and back in 1592. The Spaniard [[Bartholomew de Fonte]] claimed to have sailed from [[Hudson Bay]] to the Pacific via the strait in 1640.

===Northern Atlantic===
The first recorded attempt to discover the Northwest Passage was the east-west voyage of [[John Cabot]] in 1497, sent by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in search of a direct route to the [[Orient]].&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite book |title=Captain Cook |first=Vanessa |last=Collingridge |publisher=Ebury Press |date=2002 |isbn=0-09-188898-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1524, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] sent [[Estêvão Gomes]] to find a northern Atlantic passage to the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. An English expedition was launched in 1576 by [[Martin Frobisher]], who took three trips west to what is now the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]] in order to find the passage. [[Frobisher Bay]], which he first charted, is named after him.

As part of another expedition, in July 1583 Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], who had written a treatise on the discovery of the passage and was a backer of Frobisher, claimed the territory of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] for the English crown. On August 8, 1585, the [[English people|English]] explorer [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] entered [[Cumberland Sound]], [[Baffin Island]].&lt;ref name=Morison&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Samuel |title=The European Discovery of America: The Northern Voyages |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=Oxford / New York |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major rivers on the east coast were also explored in case they could lead to a transcontinental passage. [[Jacques Cartier]]'s explorations of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] in 1535 were initiated in hope of finding a way through the continent. Cartier became persuaded that the St. Lawrence was the Passage; when he found the way blocked by rapids at what is now [[Montreal]], he was so certain that these rapids were all that was keeping him from China (in French, ''la Chine''), that he named the rapids for China. [[Samuel de Champlain]] renamed them Sault Saint-Louis in 1611, but the name was changed to [[Lachine Rapids]] in the mid-19th century.

In 1602, [[George Weymouth]] became the first European to explore what would later be called [[Hudson Strait]] when he sailed {{ship||Discovery|1602 ship|2}} {{convert|300|nmi|km}} into the Strait. Weymouth's expedition to find the Northwest Passage was funded jointly by the British [[East India Company]] and the [[Muscovy Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Glyn Williams, "Arctic Labyrinth", Toronto: Penguin, 2009, p 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Hunter, “God's Mercies. Rivalry, Betrayal and the Dream of Discovery”, Anchor/Random House, 2007, pp 13, 41&lt;/ref&gt; ''Discovery'' was the same ship used by [[Henry Hudson]] on his final voyage.

[[John Knight (seafarer)|John Knight]], employed by the British East India Company and the Muscovy Company, set out in 1606 to follow up on Weymouth's discoveries and find the Northwest Passage. After his ship ran aground and was nearly crushed by ice, Knight disappeared while searching for a better anchorage.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, pp 71-73&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609, Henry Hudson sailed up what is now called the [[Hudson River]] in search of the Passage; encouraged by the saltiness of the water in the estuary,&lt;!--[salt water is detectable no further than 50 miles upriver under the lowest rainfall/runoff conditions.life.bio.sunysb.edu/marinebio/fc.1.estuaries.html]--&gt; he reached present-day [[Albany, New York]], before giving up.  On September 14, 1609, the explorer Henry Hudson entered the [[Tappan Zee]] while sailing upstream from [[New York Harbor]]. At first, Hudson believed the widening of the river indicated that he had found the Northwest Passage. He proceeded upstream as far as present-day [[Troy, New York|Troy]] before concluding that no such [[strait]] existed there. He later explored the Arctic and Hudson Bay.

In 1611, while in [[James Bay]], Hudson's crew mutinied. They set Hudson and his teenage son John, along with seven sick, infirm, or loyal crewmen, adrift in a small open boat. He was never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/hell/anthology/travel/Travel1625Pricket.htm |title=Excerpt from A Larger Discourse of the Same Voyage |first=Abacuk |last=Pricket |date=1625 |publisher=Faculty of Arts and Science, University of Toronto |work=Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences |access-date=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=343 |title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online |work=Dicctionnaire biographique |publisher=Université Laval / University of Toronto |date= |access-date=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cree]] oral legend reports that the survivors lived and traveled with the Cree for more than a year.

A mission was sent out in 1612, again in ''Discovery'', commanded by Sir [[Thomas Button]] to find Henry Hudson and continue through the Northwest Passage. After failing to find Hudson, and exploring the west coast of Hudson Bay, Button returned home due to illness in the crew. In 1614, William Gibbons attempted to find the Passage, but was turned back by ice. The next year, 1615, [[Robert Bylot]], a survivor of Hudson's crew, returned to Hudson Strait in ''Discovery'', but was turned back by ice.&lt;ref&gt;Nuttal, Mark, “Encyclopedia of the Arctic”, Routledge: 2004, pp 295–296&lt;/ref&gt; Bylot tried again in 1616 with [[William Baffin]]. They sailed as far as [[Lancaster Sound]] and reached 77°45′ North latitude, a record which stood for 236 years, before being blocked by ice.

On May 9, 1619, under the auspices of [[King Christian IV]] of [[Denmark–Norway]], [[Jens Munk]] set out with 65 men and the king's two ships, ''Einhörningen'' (Unicorn), a small [[frigate]], and ''Lamprenen'' (Lamprey), a sloop, which were outfitted under his own supervision. His mission was to discover the Northwest Passage to the Indies and China. Munk penetrated Davis Strait as far north as 69°, found Frobisher Bay, and then spent almost a month fighting his way through Hudson Strait. In September 1619, he found the entrance to Hudson Bay and spent the winter near the mouth of the Churchill River. Cold, [[famine]], and [[scurvy]] destroyed so many of his men that only he and two other men survived. With these men, he sailed for home with ''Lamprey'' on July 16, 1620, reaching [[Bergen]], Norway, on September 20, 1620.

[[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] built the [[sailing ship]], {{ship||Le Griffon}}, in his quest to find the Northwest Passage via the upper [[Great Lakes]]. ''Le Griffon'' disappeared in 1679 on the return trip of her [[maiden voyage]].&lt;ref name="History of the Great Lakes"&gt;

[[File:Voyage à la baye de Hudson, fait en 1746 et 1747.jpg|thumb|Ellis expedition: Voyage to Hudson Bay, in 1746 and 1747]]
[[Henry Ellis (governor)|Henry Ellis]], born in Ireland, was part of a company aiming to discover the Northwest Passage in May 1746. After the difficult extinction of a fire on board the ship, he sailed to Greenland, where he traded goods with the Inuit peoples on July 8, 1746. He crossed to the town of Fort Nelson and spent the summer on the Hayes River. He renewed his efforts in June 1747, without success, before returning to England.

In 1772, [[Samuel Hearne]] travelled overland northwest from Hudson Bay to the Arctic Ocean, thereby proving that there was no strait connecting Hudson Bay to the Pacific Ocean.

===Northern Pacific===
[[File:North america 1765globe.jpg|1765 de l'Isle globe, showing a fictional Northwest Passage.|left|thumbnail]] Most Northwest Passage expeditions originated in Europe or on the east coast of North America, seeking to traverse the Passage in the westbound direction. Some progress was made in exploring the western reaches of the imagined passage.

In 1728 [[Vitus Bering]], a [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish Navy]] officer in Russian service, used the strait first discovered by [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] in 1648 but later accredited to and named after Bering (the Bering Strait). He concluded that North America and Russia were separate land masses by sailing between them. In 1741 with Lieutenant [[Aleksei Chirikov]], he explored seeking further lands beyond [[Siberia]]. While they were separated, Chirikov discovered several of the [[Aleutian Islands]] while Bering charted the Alaskan region. His ship was wrecked off the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], as many of his crew were disabled by scurvy.

The Spanish made several voyages to the northwest coast of North America during the late 18th century. Determining whether a Northwest Passage existed was one of the motives for their efforts. Among the voyages that involved careful searches for a Passage included the 1775 and 1779 voyages of [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]]. The journal of [[Francisco Antonio Mourelle]], who served as Quadra's second in command in 1775, fell into English hands. It was translated and published in [[London]], stimulating exploration.

Captain James Cook made use of the journal during his explorations of the region. In 1791 [[Alessandro Malaspina]] sailed to [[Yakutat Bay]], Alaska, which was rumoured to be a Passage. In 1790 and 1791 [[Francisco de Eliza]] led several exploring voyages into the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], searching for a possible Northwest Passage and finding the [[Strait of Georgia]]. To fully explore this new inland sea, an expedition under [[Dionisio Alcalá Galiano]] was sent in 1792. He was explicitly ordered to explore all channels that might turn out to be a Northwest Passage.

===Cook and Vancouver===
In 1776 Captain James Cook was dispatched by the [[Admiralty]] in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] on an expedition to explore the Passage. A 1745 act, when extended in 1775, promised a £20,000 prize for whoever discovered the passage. Initially the Admiralty had wanted [[Charles Clerke]] to lead the expedition, with Cook (in retirement following his exploits in the Pacific) acting as a consultant. However, Cook had researched Bering's expeditions, and the Admiralty ultimately placed their faith in the veteran explorer to lead, with Clerke accompanying him.

After journeying through the Pacific, to make an attempt from the west, Cook began at [[Nootka Sound]] in April 1778. He headed north along the coastline, charting the lands and searching for the regions sailed by the Russians 40 years previously. The Admiralty's orders had commanded the expedition to ignore all inlets and rivers until they reached a [[latitude]] of [[65th parallel north|65°N]]. Cook, however, failed to make any progress in sighting a Northwestern Passage.

Various officers on the expedition, including [[William Bligh]], [[George Vancouver]], and [[John Gore (seaman)|John Gore]], thought the existence of a route was 'improbable'. Before reaching 65°N they found the coastline pushing them further south, but Gore convinced Cook to sail on into the [[Cook Inlet]] in the hope of finding the route. They continued to the limits of the Alaskan peninsula and the start of the {{convert|1200|mi|abbr=on}} chain of Aleutian Islands. Despite reaching [[70th parallel north|70°N]], they encountered nothing but icebergs.&lt;ref name="cook" /&gt;

From 1792 to 1794, the [[Vancouver Expedition]] (led by George Vancouver who had previously accompanied Cook ) surveyed in detail all the passages from the [[British Columbia Coast|Northwest Coast]]. He confirmed that there was no such passage south of the Bering Strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mysticseaport.org/library/initiative/ImPage.cfm?PageNum=2&amp;BibId=17506&amp;ChapterId=3 |title=Vancouver's discovery of Puget Sound |last=Meany |first=Edmond Stephen |access-date=April 13, 2007 |work=MysticSeaport.org |publisher=Mystic Seaport Museum of American and the Sea |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070902065117/http://www.mysticseaport.org/library/initiative/ImPage.cfm?PageNum=2&amp;BibId=17506&amp;ChapterId=3 |archive-date=September 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion was supported by the evidence of [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]], who explored the Arctic and Pacific oceans in 1793.

===19th century===
[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Das Eismeer - Hamburger Kunsthalle - 02.jpg|thumb|''Das Eismeer'' (''[[The Sea of Ice]]''), 1823–1824, a painting by [[Caspar David Friedrich]], inspired by [[William Edward Parry]]'s account from the 1819–1820 expedition.]]
In the first half of the 19th century, some parts of the Northwest Passage (north of the Bering Strait) were explored separately by many expeditions, including those by [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|John Ross]], [[Elisha Kent Kane]], [[William Edward Parry]], and [[James Clark Ross]]; overland expeditions were also led by John Franklin, [[George Back]], [[Peter Warren Dease]], [[Thomas Simpson (explorer)|Thomas Simpson]], and [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]]. In 1826 [[Frederick William Beechey]] explored the north coast of Alaska, discovering Point Barrow.&lt;ref name=Beechey&gt;{{cite book |last=Beechey |first=Frederick William |title=Narrative of a voyage to the Pacific and Beering's Strait: to co-operate with the Polar expeditions : performed in His Majesty's Ship Blossom, under the command of Captain F.W.

Sir [[Robert McClure]] was credited with the discovery of the Northwest Passage in 1851 when he looked across McClure Strait from [[Banks Island]] and viewed [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. However, this strait was not navigable to ships at that time. The only usable route linking the entrances of Lancaster Sound and [[Dolphin and Union Strait]] was discovered by John Rae in 1854.

===Franklin expedition===
{{Main|John Franklin|Franklin's lost expedition}}
In 1845 a lavishly equipped two-ship expedition led by Sir John Franklin sailed to the Canadian Arctic to chart the last unknown swaths of the Northwest Passage. Confidence was high, as they estimated there was less than {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} remaining of unexplored Arctic mainland coast. When the ships failed to return, relief expeditions and search parties explored the Canadian Arctic, which resulted in a thorough charting of the region, along with a possible passage. Many artifacts from the expedition were found over the next century and a half, including notes that the ships were ice-locked in 1846 near [[King William Island]], about halfway through the passage, and unable to break free. Records showed Franklin died in 1847 and Captain [[Francis Crozier|Francis Rawdon Moira Crozier]] took over command. In 1848 the expedition abandoned the two ships and its members tried to escape south across the [[tundra]] by [[sled]]ge. Although some of the crew may have survived into the early 1850s, no evidence has ever been found of any survivors. In 1853 explorer John Rae was told by local Inuit about the disastrous fate of Franklin's expedition, but his reports were not welcomed in Britain.

[[Starvation]], exposure and scurvy all contributed to the men's deaths. In 1981 [[Owen Beattie]], an anthropologist from the [[University of Alberta]], examined remains from sites associated with the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;"Arctic paleoradiology: portable radiographic examination of two frozen sailors from the Franklin Expedition (1845–1845)", {{PMID|3300222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to further investigations and the examination of tissue and bone from the frozen bodies of three seamen, [[John Torrington]], [[William Braine]] and [[John Hartnell]], exhumed from the [[permafrost]] of [[Beechey Island]].

===McClure expedition===
[[File:The North-West Passage, by John Everett Millais.jpg|thumb|''[[The North-West Passage]]'' (1874), a painting by [[John Everett Millais]] representing British frustration at the failure to conquer the passage.]]
{{Main|Robert McClure|McClure Arctic Expedition}}
During the search for Franklin, Commander Robert McClure and his crew in [[HMS Investigator (1848)|HMS ''Investigator'']] traversed the Northwest Passage from west to east in the years 1850 to 1854, partly by ship and partly by sledge. McClure started out from England in December 1849, sailed the Atlantic Ocean south to [[Cape Horn]] and entered the Pacific Ocean. He sailed the Pacific north and passed through the Bering Strait, turning east at that point and reaching Banks Island.

McClure's ship was trapped in the ice for three winters near Banks Island, at the western end of [[Viscount Melville Sound]]. Finally McClure and his crew—who were by that time dying of starvation—were found by searchers who had travelled by sledge over the ice from a ship of Sir [[Edward Belcher]]'s expedition. They rescued McClure and his crew, returning with them to Belcher's ships, which had entered the Sound from the east. McClure and his crew returned to England in 1854 on one of Belcher's ships. They were the first people known to circumnavigate the Americas and to discover and transit the Northwest Passage, albeit by ship and by sledge over the ice. (Both McClure and his ship were found by a party from [[HMS Resolute (1850)|HMS ''Resolute'']], one of Belcher's ships, so his sledge journey was relatively short.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/karpoff/Research/McClure.doc Jonathan M. Karpoff, Essay for ''The Encyclopedia of the Arctic'' (DOC format)] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121108095932/http://faculty.washington.edu/karpoff/Research/McClure.doc |date=November 8, 2012}} HMS ''Resolute'' had to be abandoned in the ice on that journey. It was later found again and became quite famous.&lt;/ref&gt;)

This was an astonishing feat for that day and age, and McClure was knighted and promoted in rank. (He was made [[rear-admiral]] in 1867.) Both he and his crew also shared £10,000 awarded them by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. In July 2010 Canadian archaeologists found his ship, HMS ''Investigator,'' fairly intact but sunk about {{convert|8|m|abbr=on}} below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;A.P.

===John Rae===
{{Main|Rae–Richardson Arctic Expedition|John Rae (explorer)}}

The expeditions by Franklin and McClure were in the tradition of British exploration: well-funded ship expeditions using modern technology, and usually including [[Royal Navy|British Naval]] personnel. By contrast, John Rae was an employee of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which operated a far-flung trade network and drove exploration of the Canadian North. They adopted a pragmatic approach and tended to be land-based. While Franklin and McClure tried to explore the passage by sea, Rae explored by land. He used dog sleds and techniques of surviving in the environment which he had learned from the native Inuit. The Franklin and McClure expeditions each employed hundreds of personnel and multiple ships. John Rae's expeditions included fewer than ten people and succeeded. Rae was also the explorer with the best safety record, having lost only one man in years of traversing Arctic lands. In 1854,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |first=R. L. |last=Richards |title=Rae, John (1813-93) |volume=12 |url= http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/rae_john_1813_93_12E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rae returned to the cities with information from the Inuit about the disastrous fate of the Franklin expedition.

===Amundsen expedition===
[[File:Nlc amundsen.jpg|thumb|upright|Norwegian polar explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] was the first to sail through the Northwest Passage in 1903–1906.]]
[[File:Gjøa.jpg|thumb|Amundsen's {{ship||Gjøa}} was the first vessel to transit the passage.]]
{{Main|Roald Amundsen}}
The first explorer to conquer the Northwest Passage solely by ship was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] explorer Roald Amundsen. In a three-year journey between 1903 and 1906, Amundsen explored the passage with a crew of six. Amundsen, who had sailed to escape creditors seeking to stop the expedition, completed the voyage in the converted 45 [[net register tonnage]] ({{convert|4500|cuft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) herring boat ''Gjøa''. ''Gjøa'' was much smaller than vessels used by other Arctic expeditions and had a shallow draft. Amundsen intended to hug the shore, live off the limited resources of the land and sea through which he was to travel, and had determined that he needed to have a tiny crew to make this work. (Trying to support much larger crews had contributed to the catastrophic failure of John Franklin's expedition fifty years previously). The ship's shallow draft was intended to help her traverse the shoals of the Arctic straits.

Amundsen set out from [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (Oslo) in June 1903 and was west of the Boothia Peninsula by late September. ''Gjøa'' was put into a natural harbour on the south shore of King William Island; by October 3 she was iced in. There the expedition remained for nearly two years, with the expedition members learning from the local Inuit people and undertaking measurements to determine the location of the [[North Magnetic Pole]]. The harbour, now known as [[Gjoa Haven]], later developed as the only permanent settlement on the island.

After completing the Northwest Passage portion of this trip and having anchored near [[Herschel Island]], Amundsen skied {{convert|800|km}} to the city of [[Eagle, Alaska]]. He sent a telegram announcing his success and skied the return 800&amp;nbsp;km to rejoin his companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ronald |first=Huntford |title=Two Planks and a Passion: A Dramatic History of Skiing |page=272 |date=2009 |publisher=Continuum Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his chosen east–west route, via the [[Rae Strait]], contained young ice and thus was navigable, some of the waterways were extremely shallow ({{convert|3|ft|abbr=on}} deep), making the route commercially impractical.

===Later expeditions===
The first traversal of the Northwest Passage via [[dog sled]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/rasmussen_knud.html Knud Johan Victor Rasmussen], biography by Sam Alley.

Rasmussen and two [[Kalaallit|Greenland Inuit]] travelled from the Atlantic to the Pacific over the course of 16 months via dog sled.

Canadian [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officer [[Henry Larsen (explorer)|Henry Larsen]] was the second to sail the passage, crossing west to east, leaving Vancouver on June 23, 1940 and arriving at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] on October 11, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larsen |first=Henry |title=The North-West Passage |date=1948 |publisher=Edmond Cloutier, Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery |pages=7–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than once on this trip, he was uncertain whether {{ship||St. Roch|ship|2}}, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police "ice-fortified" [[schooner]], would survive the pressures of the sea ice. At one point, Larsen wondered "if we had come this far only to be crushed like a nut on a shoal and then buried by the ice." The ship and all but one of her crew survived the winter on [[Boothia Peninsula]]. Each of the men on the trip was awarded a medal by Canada's sovereign, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], in recognition of this feat of Arctic navigation.

Later in 1944, Larsen's return trip was far more swift than his first. He made the trip in 86 days to sail back from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Vancouver, British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801448,00.html Canada at War: THE ARCTIC: Northwest Passage, 1944], ''Time'' (magazine) October 30, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; He set a record for traversing the route in a single season. The ship, after extensive upgrades,  followed a more northerly, partially uncharted route.

In 1954, {{HMCS|Labrador}}&lt;ref name="Ship details"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.nauticapedia.ca/dbase/Query/Shiplist4.php?&amp;name=Labrador%20(H.M.C.S.)&amp;id=31694&amp;Page=1&amp;input=labrador |title=Ship details |website=www.nauticapedia.ca |language=en |access-date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; completed the east-to-west transit, under the command of Captain O. C. S. Robertson, conducting hydrographic soundings along the route. She was the first [[warship]] (and the first [[Draft (hull)|deep draft]] ship) to transit the Northwest Passage and the first warship to [[circumnavigate]] North America. In 1956, HMCS ''Labrador'' again completed the east-to-west transit, this time under the command of Captain T.C. Pullen.

On July 1, 1957, the [[United States Coast Guard]] [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]] {{USCGC|Storis|WMEC-38|2}} departed in company with {{USCGC|Bramble|WLB-392|6}} and {{USCGC|Spar|WLB-403|6}} to search for a deep-draft channel through the Arctic Ocean and to collect [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] information. The US Coast Guard Squadron was escorted through Bellot Strait and the Eastern Arctic by HMCS ''Labrador''.&lt;ref name="Ship details"/&gt; Upon her return to Greenland waters, ''Storis'' became the first U.S.-registered vessel to circumnavigate North America. Shortly after her return in late 1957, she was reassigned to her new home port of [[Kodiak, Alaska]].

In 1960, {{USS|Seadragon|SSN-584|6}} completed the first submarine transit of the Northwest Passage, heading east-to-west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steele |first1=George P. |title=Seadragon: Northwest Under the Ice [The story of the nuclear Submarine Seadragon's epic discovery of an underwater Northwest Passage] |date=1962 |publisher=E.P. Dutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, SS ''Manhattan'' made the passage, accompanied by the Canadian icebreakers {{ship|CCGS|John A. Macdonald}} and {{ship|CCGS|Louis S. St-Laurent}}. The U.S. Coast Guard icebreakers {{USCGC|Northwind|WAGB-282|2}} and {{USCGC|Staten Island|WAGB-278|2}} also sailed in support of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Smith.

''Manhattan'' was a [[Ice class|specially reinforced]] [[Oil tanker|supertanker]] sent to test the viability of the passage for the transport of oil. While ''Manhattan'' succeeded, the route was deemed not to be cost-effective. The United States built the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Alaska Pipeline]] instead.

In June 1977, sailor Willy de Roos left [[Belgium]] to attempt the Northwest Passage in his {{convert|13.8|m|abbr=on}} steel [[yacht]] ''Williwaw''. He reached the Bering Strait in September and after a stopover in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], went on to round Cape Horn and sail back to Belgium, thus being the first sailor to circumnavigate the Americas entirely by ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://archives.cbc.ca/IDCC-1-73-2349-13665/politics_economy/northwest_passage/ |title=Willy de Roos' big journey |work=Archives.CBC.ca |date= |access-date=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 as part of the [[Transglobe Expedition]], [[Ranulph Fiennes]] and [[Charles R. Burton]] completed the Northwest Passage. They left [[Tuktoyaktuk]] on July 26, 1981, in the {{convert|18|ft|adj=on}} open [[Boston Whaler]] and reached [[Tanquary Fiord]] on August 31, 1981. Their journey was the first open-boat transit from west to east and covered around {{convert|3000|mi|km nmi}}, taking a route through Dolphin and Union Strait following the south coast of Victoria and King William islands, north to Resolute Bay via Franklin Strait and Peel Sound, around the south and east coasts of Devon Island, through Hell Gate and across Norwegian Bay to Eureka, Greely Bay and the head of Tanquary Fiord. Once they reached Tanquary Fiord, they had to trek {{convert|150|mi}} via Lake Hazen to Alert before setting up their winter base camp.

In 1984, the commercial passenger vessel {{MV|Explorer|1969|6}} (which sank in the [[Southern Ocean|Antarctic Ocean]] in 2007) became the first [[cruise ship]] to navigate the Northwest Passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7108835.stm#graphic |title=Stricken Antarctic ship evacuated |access-date=November 28, 2007 |work=BBC News |date=November 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1986, [[Jeff MacInnis]] and [[Mike Beedell]] set out on an {{convert|18|ft|adj=on}} [[catamaran]] called ''Perception'' on a 100-day sail, west to east, through the Northwest Passage.&lt;ref&gt;CBC, November 2, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives.cbc.ca/sports/exploits/topics/2349-13659/ |title=CBC Archives |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pair was the first to sail the passage, although they had the benefit of doing so over a couple of summers.&lt;ref name="Jeff"&gt;{{cite book |title=Polar Passage: The Historic First Sail through the Northwest Passage |last1=MacInnis |first1=Jeff |last2=Rowland |first2=Wade |author-link2=Wade Rowland |date=1990 |location=New York |publisher=[[Ivy Books]] |isbn=0-8041-0650-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1986, [[David Scott Cowper]] set out from England in a {{convert|12.8|m|adj=on}} [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] named ''Mabel El Holland'', and survived three Arctic winters in the Northwest Passage before reaching the Bering Strait in August 1989. He continued around the world via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to return to England on September 24, 1990. His was the first vessel to circumnavigate the world via the Northwest Passage.&lt;ref&gt;''Cruising,'' London, Summer 1992, p 35&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2000, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police patrol vessel {{ship|RCMP vessel|Nadon||2}}, having assumed the name ''St Roch II'', departed Vancouver on a "Voyage of Rediscovery". ''Nadon''{{'}}s mission was to circumnavigate North America via the Northwest Passage and the Panama Canal, recreating the epic voyage of her predecessor, ''St. Roch.'' The {{convert|22000|mi|adj=on}} Voyage of Rediscovery was intended to raise awareness concerning ''St. Roch'' and kick off the fund-raising efforts necessary to ensure the continued preservation of ''St. Roch''. The voyage was organized by the [[Vancouver Maritime Museum]] and supported by a variety of corporate sponsors and agencies of the Canadian government.

''Nadon'' is an aluminum, catamaran-hulled, high-speed patrol vessel. To make the voyage possible, she was escorted and supported by the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker {{ship|CCGS|Simon Fraser||2}}. The Coast Guard vessel was chartered by the Voyage of Rediscovery and crewed by volunteers. Throughout the voyage, she provided a variety of necessary services, including provisions and spares, fuel and water, helicopter facilities, and ice escort; she also conducted oceanographic research during the voyage. The Voyage of Rediscovery was completed in five and a half months, with ''Nadon'' reaching Vancouver on December 16, 2000.

On September 1, 2001, ''Northabout'', an {{convert|14.3|m|adj=on}} aluminium [[sailboat]] with diesel engine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northabout.com/nwp/theboat.htm |title=The Boat |work=Northabout.com |publisher=Irish Northwest Passage Expedition |first=Jarlath |last=Cunnane |date=2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823024559/http://www.northabout.com/nwp/theboat.htm# |archive-date=August 23, 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=February 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; built and captained by Jarlath Cunnane, completed the Northwest Passage east-to-west from [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] to the Bering Strait. The voyage from the Atlantic to the Pacific was completed in 24 days. Cunnane cruised in ''Northabout'' in Canada for two years before returning to Ireland in 2005 via the Northeast Passage; he completed the first east-to-west circumnavigation of the pole by a single sailboat. The Northeast Passage return along the coast of Russia was slower, starting in 2004, requiring an ice stop and winter over in [[Khatanga (village)|Khatanga]], Siberia. He returned to Ireland via the Norwegian coast in October 2005. On January 18, 2006, the [[Cruising Club of America]] awarded Jarlath Cunnane their Blue Water Medal, an award for "meritorious seamanship and adventure upon the sea displayed by amateur sailors of all nationalities."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On July 18, 2003, a father-and-son team, Richard and Andrew Wood, with Zoe Birchenough, sailed the yacht ''Norwegian Blue'' into the Bering Strait. Two months later she sailed into the Davis Strait to become the first British yacht to transit the Northwest Passage from west to east. She also became the only British vessel to complete the Northwest Passage in one season, as well as the only British sailing yacht to return from there to British waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norwegianblue.co.uk |title=The Northwest Passage |work=Norwegianblue.co.uk |date=2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016103647/http://www.norwegianblue.co.uk/northwest_passage.htm# |archive-date=October 16, 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=February 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a scheduled cruise liner ({{ship|MS|Bremen}}) successfully ran the Northwest Passage,&lt;ref name="hl-cruises1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Behrend |website=Hapag-Lloyd Kreuzfahrten |url= http://www.hl-cruises.com/redwork/do.php?layoutid=100&amp;node=275236&amp;language=2 |title=Logbook of the Northwest Passage |access-date=February 19, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110711172235/http://www.hl-cruises.com/redwork/do.php?layoutid=100&amp;node=275236&amp;language=2 |archive-date=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped by [[satellite image]]s telling the location of sea ice.

On May 19, 2007, a French sailor, Sébastien Roubinet, and one other crew member left [[Anchorage, Alaska]], in ''Babouche'', a {{convert|7.5|m|adj=on}} ice catamaran designed to sail on water and slide over ice. The goal was to navigate west to east through the Northwest Passage by sail only. Following a journey of more than {{convert|7200|km|0|abbr=on}}, Roubinet reached Greenland on September 9, 2007, thereby completing the first Northwest Passage voyage made in one season without engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babouche-expe.eu/home.html |publisher=Sébastien Roubinet |title=The North-West Passage by Sailboat |access-date=September 9, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928075440/http://www.babouche-expe.eu/home.html# |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NWPDX.tif|thumb|''Northwest Passage Drive Expedition'' (NWPDX) (2009–2011)]]
In April 2009, planetary scientist [[Pascal Lee]] and a team of four on the [[Northwest Passage Drive Expedition]] drove the ''HMP Okarian'' [[Humvee]] rover a record-setting {{convert|496|km|abbr=on}} on sea-ice from [[Kugluktuk]] to [[Cambridge Bay]], [[Nunavut]], the longest distance driven on sea-ice in a road vehicle. The ''HMP Okarian'' was being ferried from the North American mainland to the [[Haughton–Mars Project]] (HMP) Research Station on [[Devon Island]], where it would be used as a simulator of future pressurized rovers for astronauts on the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]]. The ''HMP Okarian'' was eventually flown from Cambridge Bay to [[Resolute Bay]] in May 2009, and then driven again on sea-ice by Lee and a team of five from [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]] to the West coast of Devon Island in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, P. 2010. Northwest Passage Drive: Preparing for Mars. ''Above &amp; Beyond – Canada's Arctic Journal''. Sept–Oct 2010, 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''HMP Okarian'' reached the HMP Research Station in July 2011. The Northwest Passage Drive Expedition is captured in the motion picture documentary film ''Passage To Mars'' (2016).

In 2009, sea ice conditions were such that at least nine small vessels and two cruise ships completed the transit of the Northwest Passage. These trips included one by Eric Forsyth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yachtfiona.com |title=- The Adventures of Eric Forsyth |website=www.yachtfiona.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; on board the {{convert|42|ft|adj=on}} Westsail sailboat ''Fiona'', a boat he built in the 1980s. Self-financed, Forsyth, a retired engineer from the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], and winner of the Cruising Club of America's Blue Water Medal, sailed the Canadian Archipelago with sailor Joey Waits, airline captain Russ Roberts and carpenter David Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiona2009northwestpassage.blogspot.com |title=Fiona Sails the Northwest Passage in 2009 |date=2011 |work=fiona2009northwestpassage.blogspot.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825215818/http://fiona2009northwestpassage.blogspot.com/# |archive-date=August 25, 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=November 20, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After successfully sailing the Passage, the 77-year-old Forsyth completed the circumnavigation of North America, returning to his home port on [[Long Island, New York]].

Cameron Dueck and his crew aboard the 40-foot sailing yacht Silent Sound also transited in the summer of 2009. Their voyage began in Victoria, BC on June 6 and they arrived in Halifax on October 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arctic sailor sees melting sea ice first-hand |url= https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/arctic-sailor-sees-melting-sea-ice-first-hand-1.828849 |access-date=October 22, 2018 |work=[[CBC News]] |date=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dueck wrote a book about the voyage called The New Northwest Passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bertulli |first1=Margaret |title=Review: Cameron Dueck, The New Northwest Passage: A Voyage to the Front Line of Climate Change |url= http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/72/newnorthwestpassage.shtml |website=Manitoba History |publisher=[[Manitoba Historical Society]] |access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, 2010, [[Bear Grylls]] and a team of five were the first [[rigid inflatable boat]] (RIB) crew to complete a point-to-point navigation between [[Pond Inlet]] on Baffin Island and Tuktoyaktuk in the [[Northwest Territories]].  A Northwest Passage requires crossing the [[Arctic Circle]] twice, once each in the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

On August 30, 2012 [[Sailing yacht |SY]] {{ship||Billy Budd}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.billybudd.info |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516034114/http://www.billybudd.info/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 16, 2008 |title=BillyBudd – Official Site |website=www.billybudd.info |access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|110|ft}}, an English SY, successfully completed the Northwest Passage in [[Nome, Alaska]], while  sailing  a northern route never  sailed by a sailing pleasure  vessel before. After six cruising seasons in the [[Arctic]] (Greenland, Baffin Bay, Devon Island, [[Kane Basin]], Lancaster Sound, [[Peel Sound]], Regent Sound) and four seasons in the South ([[Antarctic Peninsula]], [[Patagonia]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]]), SY ''Billy Budd'', owned by and under the command of an Italian sporting enthusiast, Mariacristina Rapisardi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2012-08-22/maria-cristina-rapisardi-signora-152152.shtml?uuid=AbOkq4RG |title=Maria Cristina Rapisardi signora dei ghiacci |access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crewed  by Marco Bonzanigo, five Italian friends, one Australian, one Dutch, one South African, and one New Zealander, it sailed  through the Northwest Passage. The northernmost route was chosen. ''Billy Budd'' sailed through the [[Parry Channel]], Viscount Melville Sound and Prince of Wales Strait, a channel {{convert|160|NM}} long and {{convert|15|NM}} wide which flows south into the [[Amundsen Gulf]]. During the passage ''Billy Budd'' – likely a  first for a pleasure vessel – anchored in Winter Harbour in Melville Island, the very same site where almost 200 years ago [[William Parry (explorer)|Sir William Parry]] was blocked by ice and forced to winter.

On August 29, 2012, the Swedish yacht ''Belzebub II,'' a {{convert|31|ft|adj=on}} fibreglass cutter captained by Canadian Nicolas Peissel, Swede Edvin Buregren and Morgan Peissel, became the first sailboat in history to sail through McClure Strait, part of a journey of achieving the most northerly Northwest Passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://belzebub2.com/home?lang=en |title=Home « A Passage through Ice |website=belzebub2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Belzebub II'' departed Newfoundland following the coast of Greenland to [[Qaanaaq]] before tracking the sea ice to [[Grise Fiord]], Canada's most northern community. From there the team continued through Parry Channel into McClure Strait and the Beaufort Sea, tracking the highest latitudes of 2012's record sea ice depletion before completing their Northwest Passage September 14, 2012.

==International waters dispute==
The Canadian government claims that some of the waters of the Northwest Passage, particularly those in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], are [[internal waters]] of Canada, giving Canada the right to bar transit through these waters.&lt;ref name="icefreearctic" /&gt; Most [[maritime nation]]s, including the United States and those of the European Union, classify these waters as an international strait, where foreign vessels have the right of "[[transit passage]]". In such a regime, Canada would have the right to enact fishing and environmental regulation, and fiscal and smuggling laws, as well as laws intended for the safety of shipping, but not the right to close the passage.&lt;ref name="paprl1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNCLOS"&gt;{{cite web |first=Todd P. |last=Kenyon |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/unclospart3.html |title=UNCLOS, Part III: Straits Used for International Navigation |work=Admiralty and Maritime Law Guide: International Conventions |publisher=Betancourt, Van Hemmen, Greco &amp; Kenyon |location=New York |date=2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107010502/http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/unclospart3.html# |archive-date=November 7, 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=November 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the passage's deep waters become completely ice-free in summer months, they will be particularly enticing for [[supertankers]] that are too big to pass through the Panama Canal and must otherwise navigate around the tip of South America.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/05/AR2006110500286.html |title=Dispute Over NW Passage Revived |first=Doug |last=Struck |date=November 6, 2006 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute between Canada and the United States arose in 1969 with the trip of the U.S. oil tanker SS ''Manhattan'' through the [[Arctic Archipelago]]. The prospect of more American traffic headed to the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]] made the Canadian government realize that political action was required should it decide to consider the archipelago as [[Canadian Internal Waters|internal waters]].&lt;ref name="Lasserre" /&gt;

In 1985, the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] icebreaker {{USCGC|Polar Sea|WAGB-11|2}} passed through from Greenland to Alaska; the ship submitted to inspection by the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] before passing through, but the event infuriated the Canadian public and resulted in a [[1985 Polar Sea controversy|diplomatic incident]]. The United States government, when asked by a Canadian reporter, indicated that they did not ask for permission as they were not legally required to. The Canadian government issued a declaration in 1986 reaffirming Canadian rights to the waters. The United States refused to recognize the Canadian claim. In 1988 the governments of Canada and the United States signed an agreement, "Arctic Cooperation", that resolved the practical issue without solving the sovereignty questions. Under the law of the sea, ships engaged in transit passage are not permitted to engage in research. The agreement states that all U.S. Coast Guard vessels are engaged in research, and so would require permission from the Government of Canada to pass through.&lt;ref name="RUS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/prb0561-e.htm#BRelations |title=Relations With the United States from the Library of Parliament—Canadian Arctic Sovereignty |author=Political and Social Affairs Division |publisher=Canada Library of Parliament |work=Parl.GC.ca |date=January 26, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209140412/http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/prb0561-e.htm#BRelations#BRelations |archive-date=February 9, 2010 |dead-url=yes |access-date=February 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, it was reported that U.S. [[nuclear submarine]]s had travelled unannounced through Canadian Arctic waters, sparking outrage in Canada. In his first news conference after the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], Prime Minister-designate Stephen Harper contested an earlier statement made by the U.S. ambassador that Arctic waters were international, stating the Canadian government's intention to enforce its sovereignty there. The allegations arose after the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] released photographs of {{USS|Charlotte|SSN-766|6}} surfaced at the North Pole.&lt;ref name="Charlotte North Pole"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=21223 |work=Navy News Service |id=NNS051201-11 |title=USS Charlotte Achieves Milestone During Under-Ice Transit |access-date=October 25, 2007 |first=Dave |last=Ozeck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most of the activities involving American submarines (including their current and past positions and courses) are [[Classified information|classified]], so therefore under that policy the U.S. Navy has declined to reveal which route(s) the ''Charlotte'' took to reach and return from the Pole.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2006, Canada's [[Joint Task Force (North)]] declared that the [[Canadian Forces]] will no longer refer to the region as the Northwest Passage, but as the Canadian Internal Waters.&lt;ref name="Edmonton Journal"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=6d4815ac-4fdb-4cf3-a8a6-4225a8bd08df&amp;k=73925 |title=Northwest Passage Gets Political Name Change |access-date=February 1, 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070310214749/http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=6d4815ac-4fdb-4cf3-a8a6-4225a8bd08df&amp;k=73925 |archive-date=March 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration came after the successful completion of Operation Nunalivut ([[Inuktitut]] for "the land is ours"), which was an expedition into the region by five military patrols.&lt;ref name="ArcticNet"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arcticnet-ulaval.ca/index.php?fa=News.showNews&amp;home=4&amp;menu=55&amp;sub=1&amp;id=128  |title=Arctic Trek Shows Canada's Sovereignty |access-date=February 1, 2007  |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071007225111/http://www.arcticnet-ulaval.ca/index.php?fa=News.showNews |archive-date=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a report prepared by the staff of the Parliamentary Information and Research Service of Canada suggested that because of the [[September 11 attacks]], the United States might be less interested in pursuing the international waterways claim in the interests of having a more secure North American perimeter.&lt;ref name="RUS" /&gt; This report was based on an earlier paper, ''The Northwest Passage Shipping Channel: Is Canada's Sovereignty Really Floating Away?'' by Andrea Charron, given to the 2004 [[Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute]] Symposium.&lt;ref name="Charron"/&gt; Later in 2006 former [[United States Ambassador to Canada]], [[Paul Cellucci]] agreed with this position; however, the succeeding ambassador, [[David Wilkins]], stated that the Northwest Passage was in international waters.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

On July 9, 2007, Prime Minister Harper announced the establishment of a deep-water port in the far North. In the government press release the Prime Minister is quoted as saying, "Canada has a choice when it comes to defending our sovereignty over the Arctic. We either use it or lose it. And make no mistake, this Government intends to use it. Because Canada's Arctic is central to our national identity as a northern nation. It is part of our history. And it represents the tremendous potential of our future."&lt;ref name="Canadian Government Press Release"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN0929956620070709 |title=Prime Minister Stephen Harper announces new Arctic offshore patrol ships |access-date=July 9, 2007 |work=[[Reuters|Reuters.com]] |date=July 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, 2007, [[Rear Admiral]] [[Timothy McGee (USN)|Timothy McGee]] of the United States Navy, and Rear Admiral [[Brian Salerno]] of the United States Coast Guard announced that the United States would be increasing its ability to patrol the Arctic.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg20070710&gt;{{cite news |date=July 10, 2007 |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg.com]] |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&amp;sid=aK9JSBhBiJMg&amp;refer=canada |title=U.S. Bolsters Arctic Presence to Aid Commercial Ships (Update 1) |first=Hugo |last=Miller |author-link=Hugo Miller |access-date=July 10, 2007

==Thinning ice cover and the Northwest Passage==
[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|[[Arctic shrinkage]] as of 2007 compared to previous years]]
In the summer of 2000, two Canadian ships took advantage of thinning summer ice cover on the Arctic Ocean to make the crossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-12-04/news/17671507_1_northwest-passage-arctic-ocean-king-william-island |title=Amazing Voyage Through Perilous Arctic Ocean / Mounties boat sails Northwest Passage |access-date=December 18, 2010 |first=Carolyn |last=Jones |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |date=December 4, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that climate change is likely to open the passage for increasing periods, making it potentially attractive as a major shipping route. However, the passage through the Arctic Ocean would require significant investment in escort vessels and staging ports, and it would remain seasonal. Therefore, the Canadian commercial marine transport industry does not anticipate the route as a viable alternative to the Panama Canal within the next 10 to 20 years (as of 2004).&lt;ref name="Arctic Marine Transport Workshop"&gt;{{cite web  |url= http://www.arctic.gov/files/AMTW_book.pdf  |format=PDF  |title=Arctic Marine Transport Workshop September 2004  |access-date=July 9, 2007  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070808145951/http://www.arctic.gov/files/AMTW_book.pdf  |archive-date=August 8, 2007  |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikinews|Arctic ice levels at record low opening Northwest Passage}}
On September 14, 2007, the [[European Space Agency]] stated that ice loss that year had opened up the historically impassable passage, setting a new low of ice cover as seen in satellite measurements which went back to 1978. According to the [[Arctic Climate Impact Assessment]], the latter part of the 20th century and the start of the 21st had seen marked shrinkage of ice cover. The extreme loss in 2007 rendered the passage "fully navigable".&lt;ref name="esa"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMYTC13J6F_index_0.html |title=Satellites witness lowest Arctic ice coverage in history |access-date=September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beeb"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6995999.stm |title=Warming 'opens Northwest Passage' |access-date=September 14, 2007 |work=BBC News |date=September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ESA study was based only on analysis of satellite images and could in practice not confirm anything about the actual navigation of the waters of the passage. ESA suggested the passage would be navigable "during reduced ice cover by multi-year ice pack" (namely sea ice surviving one or more summers) where previously any traverse of the route had to be undertaken during favourable seasonable climatic conditions or by specialist vessels or expeditions. The agency's report speculated that the conditions prevalent in 2007 had shown the passage may "open" sooner than expected.&lt;ref name="plain"&gt;{{cite news |last=Westcott |first=Kathryn |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6999078.stm |title=Plain Sailing on the Northwest Passage |work=[[BBC News]] |date=September 19, 2007 |access-date=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expedition in May 2008 reported that the passage was not yet continuously navigable even by an icebreaker and not yet ice-free.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080524.TRIPPING24/TPStory Globe and Mail "Tripping through the Northwest Passage"] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141029085445/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080524.TRIPPING24/TPStory |date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists at a meeting of the [[American Geophysical Union]] on December 13, 2007, revealed that NASA satellites observing the western Arctic{{Clarify|date=November 2008 |reason=Where is the Western Arctic? Is that the same thing that I would mean, anywhere west of the Boothia Peninsula but not including Resolute, or Baker Lake?}} showed a 16% decrease in cloud coverage during the summer of 2007 compared to 2006. This would have the effect of allowing more [[sunlight]] to penetrate Earth's atmosphere and warm the Arctic Ocean waters, thus melting sea ice and contributing to the opening the Northwest Passage.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Thompson, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,316753,00.html Extra Sunshine Blamed for Part of Arctic Meltdown] ''Foxnews'', Friday, December 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the cruise liner MS ''Bremen'' successfully ran the Northwest Passage,&lt;ref name="hl-cruises1"/&gt; helped by satellite images telling where sea ice was.

On November 28, 2008, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] reported that the Canadian Coast Guard confirmed the first commercial ship sailed through the Northwest Passage. In September 2008, {{MV|Camilla Desgagnés}}, owned by Desgagnés Transarctik Inc. and, along with the [[Arctic Cooperative]], is part of Nunavut Sealift and Supply Incorporated (NSSI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arcticsealift.com/en/medias/MEET%20THE%20CARRIER%20%20Revised%20March%202013_0.pdf |title=Meet your Nunavut Carrier |publisher= |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131003031843/http://www.arcticsealift.com/en/medias/MEET%20THE%20CARRIER%20%20Revised%20March%202013_0.pdf |archive-date=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; transported cargo from Montreal to the hamlets of [[Cambridge Bay, Nunavut|Cambridge Bay]], [[Kugluktuk, Nunavut|Kugluktuk]], [[Gjoa Haven, Nunavut|Gjoa Haven]], and [[Taloyoak, Nunavut|Taloyoak]]. A member of the crew is reported to have claimed that "there was no ice whatsoever". Shipping from the east was to resume in the fall of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/1st-commercial-ship-sails-through-northwest-passage-1.715493 |title=1st commercial ship sails through Northwest Passage |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=November 28, 2008 |access-date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[sealift]] is an annual feature of the Canadian Arctic this is the first time that the western communities have been serviced from the east. The western portion of the Canadian Arctic is normally supplied by [[Northern Transportation Company Limited]] (NTCL) from [[Hay River, Northwest Territories|Hay River]]. The eastern portion by NNSI and NTCL from [[Churchill, Manitoba|Churchill]] and Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ntcl.com/ |title=NTCL  |work=NCTL.com |publisher=[[Northern Transportation Company Ltd.]] |date= |access-date=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.groupedesgagnes.com/en/cartevirtuelle/index.cfm?filiale=t |title=Ports Served |work=GroupeDesgagnes.com |publisher=Groupe Desgagnés |date= |access-date=February 19, 2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221001837/http://www.groupedesgagnes.com/en/cartevirtuelle/index.cfm?filiale=t |archive-date=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the ongoing reduction in the Arctic sea ice led telecoms cable specialist Kodiak-Kenai Cable to propose the laying of a [[Optical fiber cable|fiberoptic cable]] connecting London and [[Tokyo]], by way of the Northwest Passage, saying the proposed system would nearly cut in half the time it takes to send messages from the United Kingdom to Japan.

In September 2013 the first large ice strengthened sea freighter, ''Nordic Orion'', used the passage.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

In 2016 a new record was set when the cruise ship ''Crystal Serenity'' transited with 1,700 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/09/09/first-came-an-arctic-luxury-cruise-next-comes-arctic-shipping/ |title=That pricey Arctic luxury cruise was just the beginning.

===Transfer of Pacific species to North Atlantic===
Scientists believe that reduced sea ice in the Northwest Passage has permitted some new species to migrate across the Arctic Ocean.&lt;ref name=ibt&gt;{{cite news |title=Global warming reintroduces gray whale, algae species to Northern Atlantic |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/169740/20110626/gray-whale-algae-atlantic-northwest-passage.htm |access-date=July 5, 2011 |newspaper=International Business Times |date=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gray whale]] ''Eschrichtius robustus'' has not been seen in the Atlantic since it was hunted to extinction there in the 18th century, but in May 2010, one such whale turned up in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Scientists speculated the whale had followed its food sources through the Northwest Passage and simply kept on going.&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheinin |first1=Aviad P |last2=Aviad |first2=P. |last3=Kerem |first3=Dan |title=Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) in the Mediterranean Sea: anomalous event or early sign of climate-driven distribution change? |journal=Marine Biodiversity Records |date=2011 |volume=2 |page=e28 |url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8258736&amp;fileId=S1755267211000042 |doi=10.1017/s1755267211000042}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mulvaney&gt;{{cite web |last=Mulvaney |first=Kieran |title=Prodigal Plankton Returns to the Atlantic |url= http://news.discovery.com/earth/prodigal-plankton-returns-to-the-atlantic-110626.html |work=[[Discovery News]] |access-date=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[plankton]] species ''[[Neodenticula]] seminae'' had not been seen in the Atlantic for 800,000 years. Over the past few years, however, it has become increasingly prevalent there. Again, scientists believe that it got there through the reopened Northwest Passage.&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;&lt;ref name=mulvaney/&gt;

In August 2010, two [[bowhead whale]]s from West Greenland and Alaska respectively, entered the Northwest Passage from opposite directions and spent approximately 10 days in the same area.&lt;ref name="nwWhale"&gt;Heide-Jørgensen et al.

[[File:Lake Oku Cameroon.jpg|thumb|Lake Oku, Northwest Province, Cameroon]]
[[File:Provinces of Cameroon EN.svg|thumb|Provinces of Cameroon EN]]
'''Oku''' is a subdivision in North West Region, (formerly North West Province), [[Cameroon]]. The term Oku also refers to the people who live in this region and the primary language that they speak (although [[English language|English]] is also widely spoken). Oku is a rural area containing about 36 villages. The nearest really large city is [[Bamenda, Cameroon|Bamenda]], but [[Kumbo]], which is closer (about {{convert|23|km|order=flip}} from the village of Keyon, or about 70 minutes by car, as the road network is not good and not paved), is large enough to have [[telephone]] lines and a [[Baptist]]-run [[hospital]]. Oku also has a Sub-divisional hospital. However, three mobile telephone networks (MTN, ORANGE, CAMTEL) are available in Oku. As such, mobile internet facilities are available.

==Geography and climate==
Oku is a very mountainous region, around {{convert|1200|m}} above [[sea level]], and thus rather cool considering its latitude. It is not cold enough for snow, but at night during the dry season temperatures drop below human comfort range. [[Mount Oku]], a [[stratovolcano]], reaches a height of 3011&amp;nbsp;metres (9880&amp;nbsp;feet) and is the second highest mountain of Cameroon after Mount Fako (better known as [[Mount Cameroon]]).

The broader [[Oku Volcanic Field|Oku]] or Foumbot volcanic field also includes many [[scoria cone]]s and [[maar]]s, several of which are filled by [[crater lake]]s. Lake Oku is a crater lake. Two of the crater lakes, [[Lake Nyos]] and [[Lake Monoun]], have been the subject of extensive research. Quantities of [[gas]] build up in the lakes and are occasionally released; being [[density|heavier]] than air, they pour down the mountainside and can [[suffocation|suffocate]] entire villages. Some of the locals believe that a god lives in the lake and must be appeased.

The region is an important one for [[biodiversity]], especially the [[Kelum mountain Forest]].

Oku has many well graded earth road linking its various villages and neighbouring subdivisions like Noni, Babessi and Kumbo central, although none of them would be called good by most [[Westerners]].
Oku has recently got a road link through Babungo from Bamenda. One can now take two hours from Bamenda through Ibal Oku, Mbockevuh, Mawes*lake oku* through Tolon, Chiar, Ikal to Elak and to Banso.

==Economy==
Oku is characterized by [[subsistence farming]]. There is a shortage of [[arable land]], and the people farm even the steep hillsides. A typical practice is to plant beans, [[maize|corn]], and potatoes together in the same furrows.There is also a lot of bee farming in OKU and Oku is the only area in the whole of Cameroon that produces the natural white honey and has an Oku Honey Cooperative to manage and sell what bee farmers harvest."One of the first three products is Oku white honey from the Republic of Cameroon (Cameroon), which is produced in the nationally protected forest of Kilum Ijim near Mount Oku (French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD), 2013). As one of Cameroon’s first registered GIs, producers and cooperatives involved in the production of Oku white honey are hoping that their product can eventually compete on an international level with the likes of other well-known GIs and spur economic development."

==Religion==
The religion of the region is predominantly a mixture of assorted local traditional beliefs (chiefly [[ancestor worship]], also [[animism]] and [[paganism]]) with diluted forms of [[Christianity]] (mostly Baptist and [[Catholic]], but also [[Lutheran]] and [[Charismatic (movement)|Charismatic]]; the [[Church of the Brethren]] are also represented).

As of 2004, the former [[Fon (title)|Fon]] (i.e., the traditional king of the people, but with no formal political power), who has a [[Baptist]] background, was attempting some religious reforms, to move the people away from some of the more un-Christian traditional practices; these reforms have met with considerable resistance given that the present fon (Fon Sentieh II) {{Clarify|date=March 2018}}.

The shrines in Oku are Lumetu, Yicham, Wuchia. Lumetu is Famous for its in this shrine the houses the second grave of Mnkong Moteh.
The palaces example is the Mboggekwei palace (ntockemboggekwei)

The '''Open Source Geospatial Foundation''' ('''OSGeo'''), is a [[non-profit]] [[non-governmental organization]] whose mission is to support and promote the collaborative development of open [[geospatial]] [[technology|technologies]] and data. The foundation was formed in February 2006 to provide financial, organizational and legal support to the broader [[Free Software|Free]] and [[Open-source-software movement|open-source]] geospatial community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2006|title=Open Source Geospatial Foundation Created to Strengthen Collaborative Development of Open Geospatial Technologies|url=http://www.osgeo.org/content/news/news_archive/open_source_geospatial_foundation_initial_press_release.html.html|publisher=OSGeo|agency=|access-date=2017-01-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225151219/http://www.osgeo.org/content/news/news_archive/open_source_geospatial_foundation_initial_press_release.html.html|archivedate=December 25, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also serves as an independent legal entity to which community members can contribute code, funding and other resources, secure in the knowledge that their contributions will be maintained for public benefit.

OSGeo draws governance inspiration from several aspects of the [[Apache Foundation]], including a membership composed of individuals drawn from foundation projects who are selected for membership status based on their active contribution to foundation projects and governance.

The foundation pursues goals beyond [[software]] development, such as promoting more [[Open data|open access]] to [[government]] produced geospatial data and completely free geodata, such as that created and maintained by the [[OpenStreetMap]] project. [[Education]] and training are also addressed. Various committees within the foundation work on implementing strategies.

==Governance==

The OSGeo Foundation is community driven and has an organizational structure consisting of elected members and nine directors, including the president. Software projects have their own governance structure, by requirement. ''see [https://www.osgeo.org/about/faq/#Projects_Joining_the_Foundation FAQ]''.  The OSGeo community [[Collaboration|collaborates]] via a [[Wiki]], [[Mailing List]]s and [[IRC]].

==Events==
[[Image:FOSS4G-Ribbon.png|thumb|100px|The FOSS4G ribbon.]]
OSGeo runs an annual international conference called [http://foss4g.org FOSS4G] – Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial.  Starting as early as 2006, this event has drawn over 1100 attendees (2017 Boston) and the tendency is to increase this number every year.  It is the main meeting place and educational outreach opportunity for OSGeo members, supporters and newcomers - to share and learn from one another in presentations, hands-on workshops and a conference exhibition.  The FOSS4G ribbon, part of every FOSS4G event logo, symbolizes the flow of ideas, innovation, and sharing within the Open Source geospatial community.  The event history dates back to an important face-to-face meeting of the 3 original founders of the event (Venkatesh Raghavan, Markus Neteler, and Jeff McKenna), who met initially in Bangkok Thailand in 2004, and planned to create a new annual event for the whole Open Source geospatial community, with the event named "[[FOSS4G]]"; the event would go on to help change the history of the geospatial industry.

There are also many regional and local events following this [[FOSS4G]] philosophy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osgeo.org/events/ |title=OSGeo Events |publisher=osgeo.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community==

The OSGeo community is composed of participants from everywhere in the world. {{As of|2018|01|01}}, there were 30,049 unique subscribers to the more than 272 OSGeo mailing lists. {{As of|2012|09}}, OSGeo projects were built upon over 12.7 million lines of code contributed by 657 code submitters including 301 that have contributed within the last 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Project_Stats |title=Project Stats - OSGeo Wiki |publisher=Wiki.osgeo.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sol Katz Award==

The [[Sol Katz]] Award for Geospatial Free and Open Source Software (GFOSS) is awarded annually by OSGeo to individuals who have demonstrated leadership in the GFOSS community. Recipients of the award have contributed significantly through their activities to advance open source ideals in the geospatial realm.

[[File:Sterneamwalberla2.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[long exposure]] (45 min.) photo of Polaris and [[circumpolar stars|neighbouring stars]], taken at Ehrenbürg ([[Franconia]]), 2001.]]

A '''pole star'''  or '''polar star''' is a star, preferably bright, closely aligned to the [[axis of rotation]] of an astronomical object.  

With regard to planet [[Earth]], the pole star refers to [[Polaris]] (Alpha Ursae Minoris), a [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 2 star aligned approximately with its northern axis, and a pre-eminent star in [[celestial navigation]].

==History==
[[File:Precession N.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|The path of the north celestial pole amongst the stars due to the effect of precession, with dates shown]]
[[File:Precession S.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|The path of the south Celestial pole amongst the stars due to the effect of precession]]
In [[classical antiquity]], [[Beta Ursae Minoris]] (Kochab) was closer to the celestial north pole than  Alpha Ursae Minoris.
While there was no naked-eye star close to the pole, the midpoint between Alpha and Beta Ursae Minoris was reasonably close to the pole, and it appears that the entire constellation of [[Ursa Minor]], in antiquity known as  ''[[:wikt:Cynosura|Cynosura]]'' (Greek  Κυνοσούρα  "dog's tail") was used as indicating the northern direction for the purposes of navigation by the [[Phoenicians]].&lt;ref&gt;implied by [[Johannes Kepler]] (''cynosurae septem stellas consideravit quibus cursum navigationis dirigebant Phoenices''): "Notae ad Scaligeri Diatribam de Aequinoctiis" in ''Kepleri Opera Omnia'' ed. Ch. Frisch, vol. 8.1 (1870) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=BRM2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT290 p. 290]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient name of Ursa Minor, anglicized as ''[[:wikt:cynosure|cynosure]]'', has since itself become a term for "guiding principle" after the constellation's use in navigation.

Alpha Ursae Minoris (Polaris) was described as ἀειφανής "always visible" by [[Stobaeus]] in the 5th century, when it was still removed from the celestial pole by about 8°. It was known as ''scip-steorra'' ("ship-star") in 10th-century [[Anglo-Saxon England]], reflecting its use in navigation. In the Hindu [[Puranas]], it is personified under the name ''[[Dhruva]]'' ("immovable, fixed").

In the medieval period, Polaris was also known as ''stella maris'' "star of the sea" (from its use for navigation at sea), as in e.g. [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]] (d. 1272), in the translation of [[John Trevisa]] (1397): 
:"by the place of this sterre place and stedes and boundes of the other sterres and of cercles of heven ben knowen: therefore astronomers beholde mooste this sterre. Then this ster is dyscryved of the moste shorte cercle; for he is ferre from the place that we ben in; he hydeth the hugenesse of his quantite for unmevablenes of his place, and he doth cerfifie men moste certenly, that beholde and take hede therof; and therfore he is called ''stella maris'', the sterre of the see, for he ledeth in the see men that saylle and have shyppemannes crafte."&lt;ref&gt;cited after J. O. Halliwell, (ed.), ''The Works of William Shakespeare'' vol. 5 (1856), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=7NVfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40].]&lt;/ref&gt;

Polaris was associated with [[Marian veneration]] from an early time, [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] being a title of the Blessed Virgin.  
This tradition goes back to a misreading of [[Saint Jerome]]'s translation of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]' ''[[Eusebius' Onomasticon|Onomasticon]]'',  ''De nominibus hebraicis'' (written ca. 390). Jerome gave ''stilla maris'' "drop of the sea" as a (false) Hebrew etymology of the [[Mary (name)|name ''Maria'']]. This ''stilla maris'' was later misread as ''stella maris''; the misreading is also found in the manuscript tradition of [[Isidore]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (7th century);&lt;ref&gt;''Conversations-Lexicon Für Bildende Kunst'' vol. 7 (1857), 141f.&lt;/ref&gt; it probably arises in the [[Carolingian era]]; a late 9th-century manuscript of Jerome's text still has ''stilla'', not ''stella'',&lt;ref&gt;A. Maas,[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15464a.htm "The Name of Mary"], ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1912)&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Paschasius Radbertus]], also writing in the 9th century, makes an explicit reference to the "Star of the Sea" metaphor, saying that Mary is the "Star of the Sea" to be followed on the way to Christ, "lest we capsize amid the storm-tossed waves of the sea."&lt;ref&gt;''stella maris, sive illuminatrix Maria, inter fluctivagas undas pelagi, fide ac moribus sequenda est, ne mergamur undis diluvii'' [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] vol. 120, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=wyJKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA86-IA3 p. 94].&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''stella polaris'' was coined in the Renaissance, even though at that time it was well recognized that it was several degrees away from the celestial pole; [[Gemma Frisius]] in the year 1547 determined this distance as 3°7'.&lt;ref&gt;''Gemmae Frisii de astrolabo catholico liber: quo latissime patentis instrumenti multiplex usus explicatur, &amp; quicquid uspiam rerum mathematicarum tradi possit continetur'', Steelsius (1556), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8XE6AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PT62 p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt;
An explicit identification of Mary as ''stella maris'' with the North Star (''Polaris'') becomes evident  in the title ''Cynosura seu Mariana Stella Polaris'' (i.e. "Cynosure, or the Marian Polar Star"), a collection of  Marian poetry published by Nicolaus Lucensis (Niccolo Barsotti de Lucca) in 1655.
&lt;!--
In Japan, the Pole Star was represented by [[Myōken|Myōken Bosatsu]] (妙見菩薩).{{year needed}}
In the [[Greek Magical Papyri]] the Pole star was identified with Set-Typhon{{cn}}{{Clarify| who or what is "Set-Typhon"?|date=January 2012}}
In [[Chinese mythology]], Emperor [[Zhuanxu]] is mentioned as a god of the Pole Star.{{cn}}{{clarify|date=January 2015}}
--&gt;

==Precession of the equinoxes==
[[File:Earth precession.svg|thumb|left|Precession of Earth's rotational axis]]
As of October 2012, Polaris had the [[declination]]  +89°19&amp;prime;8&amp;Prime; (at [[Epoch (astronomy)#Julian years and J2000|epoch J2000]] it was +89°15&amp;prime;51.2&amp;Prime;). Therefore, it always appears due north in the sky to a precision better than one degree, and the angle it makes with respect to the true horizon (after correcting for refraction and other factors) is equal to the latitude of the observer to better than one degree. 
The celestial pole will be nearest Polaris in 2100 and will thereafter become more distant.&lt;ref name=StarTales&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/ursaminor.htm#polaris | author=[[Ian Ridpath|Ridpath, Ian]] | date=1988 | title=Star Tales | chapter=Chapter Three: The celestial eighty-eight – Ursa Minor | publisher=[[The Lutterworth Press]] | location=[[Cambridge]] | isbn=978-0-7188-2695-6 | quote=...in the early 16th century ...

Due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]] (as well as the stars' proper motions), the role of North Star has passed (and will pass) from one star to another in the remote past (and in the remote future). In 3000 BC, the faint star [[Thuban]] in the [[constellation]] [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] was the North Star.&lt;ref name="Nor"&gt;{{cite book | editor=[[Ian Ridpath|Ridpath, Ian]] | date=2004 | title=Norton's Star Atlas | page=5 | publisher=Pearson Education | location=New York | isbn=0-13-145164-2 | quote=Around 4800 years ago Thuban ({{GreekFont|α}} Draconis) lay a mere 0°.1 from the pole.

During the 1st millennium BC, [[Beta Ursae Minoris]] ("Kochab") was the bright star closest to the celestial pole, but it was never close enough to be taken as marking the pole, and the Greek navigator [[Pytheas]] in ca. 320 BC described the celestial pole as devoid of stars.&lt;ref name=StarTales/&gt;&lt;ref name=KalerKochab&gt;{{citation |title=KOCHAB (Beta Ursae Minoris) |work=Stars |publisher=[[University of Illinois]] | author=[[James B. Kaler|Kaler, James B.]]  |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/kochab.html |accessdate=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]], the celestial pole was about equally distant between Polaris and Kochab.

The precession of the equinoxes takes about 25,770 years to complete a cycle. Polaris' mean position (taking account of [[precession]] and [[proper motion]]) will reach a maximum [[declination]] of +89°32'23", which translates to 1657" (or 0.4603°) from the celestial north pole, in February 2102. Its maximum apparent declination (taking account of [[astronomical nutation|nutation]] and [[aberration of light|aberration]]) will be +89°32'50.62", which is 1629" (or 0.4526°) from the celestial north pole, on 24 March 2100.&lt;ref name=Meeus&gt;Jean Meeus, Mathematical Astronomy Morsels Ch. 50; Willmann-Bell 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Precession will next point the north celestial pole at stars in the northern constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]]. The pole will drift to space equidistant between Polaris and [[Gamma Cephei]] ("Errai") by 3000 AD, with Errai reaching its closest alignment with the northern celestial pole around 4200 AD.&lt;ref name=Monthly1871/&gt;&lt;ref name=EarthSky&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/star-errai-future-north-star |title=Gamma Cephei: A future Pole Star |first1=Bruce |last1=McClure |author2=[[Deborah Byrd|Deborah, Byrd]] |work=[[Earth &amp; Sky|EarthSky]] |date=2017-09-29 |accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iota Cephei]] and [[Beta Cephei]] will stand on either side of the northern celestial pole some time around 5200 AD, before moving to closer alignment with the brighter star [[Alpha Cephei]] ("Alderamin") around 7500 AD.&lt;ref name=Monthly1871/&gt;&lt;ref name=KalerAlderamin&gt;{{citation |title=ALDERAMIN (Alpha Cephei) |work=Stars |publisher=[[University of Illinois]] | author=[[James B. Kaler|Kaler, James B.]]  |url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/alderamin.html |accessdate=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precession will then point the north celestial pole at stars in the northern constellation [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]]. Bright first-magnitude [[Deneb]] will be within 7° of the North Pole in 10,000 AD,&lt;ref name="Nor"/&gt; and third-magnitude [[Delta Cygni]] will be a pole star around 11,500 AD.&lt;ref name=Monthly1871/&gt; Precession will then point the north celestial pole nearer the constellation [[Lyra]], where the [[List of brightest stars|second brightest star]] in the [[northern celestial hemisphere]], [[Vega]], will be a pole star around 13,700 AD.&lt;ref name=Monthly1871/&gt;

Precession will eventually point the north celestial pole nearer the stars in the constellation [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], pointing towards [[Tau Herculis]] around 18,400 AD.&lt;ref name=KalerTauHer&gt;{{citation | title=TAU HER (Tau Herculis) | publisher=[[University of Illinois]] | author=[[James B. Kaler|Kaler, James B.]] | work=Stars | url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/tauher.html | accessdate=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The celestial pole will then return to the stars in constellation Draco (Thuban, mentioned above) before returning to the current constellation, Ursa Minor. When Polaris becomes the North Star again around 27,800 AD, due to its [[proper motion]] it then will be farther away from the pole than it is now, while in 23,600 BC it was closer to the pole.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Over the course of Earth's 26,000-year [[axial precession]] cycle, a series of bright [[Naked eye#Naked eye in astronomy|naked eye]] stars (an [[apparent magnitude]] up to +6; a [[full moon]] is −12.9) in the [[northern hemisphere]] will hold the transitory title of North Star.&lt;ref name=Monthly1871&gt;{{citation  | title=Our Monthly | year=1871 | volume=4 | page=53  | publisher=Presbyterian Magazine Company | postscript=. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdEQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While other stars might line up with the north [[celestial pole]] during the 26,000 year cycle, they do not necessarily meet the naked eye limit needed to serve as a useful indicator of north to an Earth-based observer, resulting in periods of time during the cycle when there is no clearly defined North Star.

==Southern pole star (South Star)==
[[File:South Celestial Pole.ogv|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Series of shots showing the rotation of the Earth's axis relative to the south celestial pole. The Magellanic Clouds and Southern Cross are clearly visible. Near the end of the video, the rise of the moon illuminates the scene.]]
Currently, there is no South Star as useful as [[Polaris]]. [[Sigma Octantis]] is the closest [[naked-eye]] star to the south Celestial pole, but at [[apparent magnitude]] 5.45 it is barely visible on a [[Bortle Scale|clear night]], making it unusable for navigational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It is a [[Giant star#Yellow giants|yellow giant]] 275 [[light year]]s from Earth. Its [[angular separation]] from the pole is about 1° ({{As of|2000|lc=on}}). The [[Crux|Southern Cross]] constellation functions as an approximate southern pole constellation, by pointing to where a southern pole star would be.

At the [[equator]], it is possible to see both Polaris and the Southern Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As a consequence, the constellation is no longer visible from subtropical northern latitudes, as it was in the time of the [[ancient Greeks]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Around 200 BC, the star [[Beta Hydri]] was the nearest bright star to the Celestial south pole. Around 2800 BC, [[Achernar]] was only 8 degrees from the south pole.

In the next 7500 years, the south Celestial pole will pass close to the stars [[Gamma Chamaeleontis]] (4200 AD), [[I Carinae]], [[Omega Carinae]] (5800 AD), [[Upsilon Carinae]], [[Iota Carinae]] (Aspidiske, 8100 AD) and [[Delta Velorum]] (Alsephina, 9200 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonkmft.co.uk/Precession.html|title=Precession|author=|date=|website=moonkmft.co.uk|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the eightieth to the ninetieth centuries, the south Celestial pole will travel through the [[False Cross]]. Around 14,000 AD, when Vega is only 4° from the North Pole, [[Canopus]] will be only 8° from the South Pole and thus circumpolar on the latitude of Bali (8°S).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Sirius]] will take its turn as the South Pole Star in the year 66,270 AD. In fact, Sirius will come to within 1.6 degree of the south celestial pole in 66,270 AD. Later, in the year 93,830 AD, Sirius will miss aligning with the south celestial pole by only 2.3 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Other planets==
Pole stars of other planets are defined analogously: they are stars (brighter than 6th magnitude, ''i.e.'', visible to the naked eye under ideal conditions) that most closely coincide with the projection of the planet's axis of rotation onto the Celestial sphere. Different planets have different pole stars because their axes are oriented differently. (See [[Poles of astronomical bodies]].)

'''Prydain''' ([[Middle Welsh]]: '''''Prydein''''') is the modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for [[Great Britain|Britain]].

==Medieval==
''Prydain'' is the medieval Welsh term for the island of Britain (the name [[Albion]] was not used by the Welsh). More specifically, Prydain may refer to the [[Britons (historical)|Brittonic]] parts of the island; that is, the parts south of [[Caledonia]]. This distinction appears to derive from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, when the island was divided into [[Roman Britain]] to the south and the land of the [[Caledonians]] to the North. The peoples north of the Roman borders eventually came to be known as the [[Picts]] (Welsh: ''Brithwyr''); the Welsh term for Pictland was ''Prydyn'', which caused some confusion in the texts with ''Prydain''. 

In Middle Welsh texts, the related term ''Ynys Prydein'' (Island of Britain), or ''Ynys Brydein'', can also refer to the island (''ynys'') itself but more often is a name for the Brittonic territories south of Caledonia. It is in this context that the name of the collection of traditional material arranged in triads known as ''[[Welsh Triads|Trioedd Ynys Prydein]]'' should be understood. In modern Welsh ''ynys'' means 'island', but in Middle Welsh it can also mean 'land' or 'realm' (cf. [[Latin language|Latin]] ''insula'').&lt;ref&gt;''[[Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru]]'', vol. IV, p. 3819.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous other instances of the term ''Prydain'' in medieval Welsh texts. One of the best known is found in the title of the 10th century vaticinatory poem ''[[Armes Prydein]]'' ('The Prophecy of Britain').&lt;ref&gt;Ifor Williams (ed.), ''Armes Prydein'' (University of Wales Press, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Prydain is also used by Lloyd Alexander as the name for the realm in which his book series ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' takes place.&lt;ref&gt;McNary, Dave. [https://variety.com/2016/film/news/chronicles-of-prydain-movie-disney-1201733058/ "'Chronicles of Prydain' Movie in the Works at Disney (EXCLUSIVE)"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 17 March 2016.

This page discusses the '''[[river]]s and [[hydrography]]''' of the [[States and territories of Australia|state]] '''of [[Tasmania]]''', [[Australia]].

In the [[Tasmania#Geography|geography]] of Tasmania, the state  is covered with a network of rivers and lake systems. As an island, all rivers eventually empty into the waters that surround Tasmania. There are four main river systems:&lt;ref name="ABS2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/509E9088E1E80537CA2573C5000DA6D6?opendocument |title=1384.6 - Statistics - Tasmania, 2008 |work=Bureau of Statistics |publisher=[[Australian Government]] |date=3 January 2008 |accessdate=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#In the south, the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent]] flows from the [[Central Highlands (Tasmania)|Central Highlands]] past [[Hobart]], to the sea at [[Storm Bay]];
#In the west, the [[Gordon River]] takes the waters of [[Lake Gordon]] and [[Lake Pedder]] and is joined by the [[Franklin River]] before flowing into [[Macquarie Harbour]];
#Flowing eastwards and to the south, the [[Huon River]] has its headwaters at [[Scotts Peak Dam]] on Lake Pedder, and reaches the sea in [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]]; and
#Flowing from the north-east, the [[South Esk River|South Esk]], the state's longest river, joins the [[North Esk River|North Esk]] at [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] to create the [[Tamar River|Tamar]].

'''''Schlatt''''' or '''''Flatt''''' is the [[Lower Saxony|Lower Saxon]] name for a heathland pond, an undrained body of water usually shallow, that is fed by [[surface water]] and is largely unaffected by [[ground water]]. The water is impounded by a water-retentive layer. Most ''Schlatts'' can dry out from time to time.

''Schlatts'' are characteristic of the nutrient-poor [[geest (topography)|geest]] ridges of the [[North German Plain]]. Most of them were formed as wind-blown hollows in the [[periglacial]] region of the [[Weichselian Glaciation|last ice age]]. The term is of Lower Saxon origin and is used mainly for the ponds in that part of Germany.

In the district of [[Landkreis Diepholz|Diepholz]] ([[Lower Saxony]]) the Conservation Foundation (''Stiftung Naturschutz'')  has taken upon itself the preservation of ''Schlatts'' as part of a ''Schlatt'' programme. Using volunteers working with the land owners and farmers over 300 small ponds and ''Schlatts'' have been cleaned up and maintained in order to preserve them as habitats for threatened animal and plant species.

A traditional '''Spanish Garden''' is a style of [[garden]] or [[designed landscape]] developed in historic [[Spain]], incorporating principles and elements of [[garden design]] from precedents in ancient [[Persian gardens]], [[Roman gardens]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic gardens]], and the great Moorish gardens of the [[Al-Andalus]] era on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In the 20th and 21st centuries a  'Spanish Garden,' or new gardens in Spain, have continued, interpreted, abstracted, or departed from these traditional planning and aesthetic motifs.

==Traditions==
Traditionally, the [[paradise garden]] is interpreted with a central cross axis, in the four [[cardinal direction]]s, with long [[pond]]s or water channels (a [[Rill#Aesthetic|rill]] or stylized [[qanat]]) where water reflects and flows, set in a walled [[courtyard]]. The remaining quadrants often had [[fruit tree]]s and fragrant plants. Thus, characteristic sensory experiences are refreshing coolness, humidity, sounds, greenery, and fragrance. This type of garden is compatible with the Spanish climate of sun and heat.  Provisions for shade are given with the use of [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s, [[pergola]]s, [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]]ing, and garden [[pavilion]]s. [[Ceramic]] elements and [[tile]]s are often used: in [[water feature]]s; for structural, decorative, and seating elements; and as [[Road surface|paving]]; with solid fields, embellishments and accents; and in [[pottery]]. A clarity from the [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] simplicity often results.&lt;ref&gt;Segall (1999), pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical design eras==
[[Spain]] has a long tradition of making [[garden]]s. Significant gardens were made by:

* Immigrants from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Empires; for example, the [[Palmeral of Elche]] in [[Alicante]]
* Nobility, Christians in the [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Spanish Medieval]] period
* [[Islamic]] rulers and artisans of [[Al-Andalus]], the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Iberian Peninsula]] or Spanish territories, especially in present-day [[Andalusia]] in Southern Spain; for example, the [[Alhambra]], [[Generalife]] in [[Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1990), pp. 1-13&lt;/ref&gt;
* Post-[[Reconquista]] [[Mudéjar]] design and artisans; for example, the [[Alcázar of Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1990), pp. 13-17&lt;/ref&gt;
* Catholic monarchs during the [[Spanish Renaissance]], [[Spanish Gothic architecture|Spanish Gothic]], and [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Spanish Baroque]] periods; for example, the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso]].
* landowning and business dynasties during the Romantic and Modern periods; for example, [[Park Güell]].
* Civic projects and expositions; for example, [[Maria Luisa Park]] and [[Plaza de España (Seville)|Plaza de España]] in [[Seville]].
* In 21st century Spain, gardens are designed by garden and [[landscape design]]ers, [[Horticulture|horticulturalists]], [[artist]]s, [[architect]]s, and [[Landscape architecture|landscape architects]]; for example, the Olympic village public outdoor spaces for the 1992 [[1992 Summer Olympics#Effect on the city|Barcelona Olympics]] or the public spaces for the Universal Exposition of [[Seville Expo '92]]. 

Many historic gardens are protected by a heritage designation, ''[[Jardín histórico]]''.

'''UNAVCO''' is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] university-governed consortium that facilitates geoscience research and education using [[Geodesy]]. The UNAVCO academic and research community seeks to broaden human understanding of the changing Earth by integrating technologies, open geodetic observations, and research. UNAVCO is funded by the National Science Foundation ([[National Science Foundation|NSF]]) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[Nasa|NASA]]) and supports research around the world.

[[File:Unavco-membership.jpg|240px|thumb|right| UNAVCO Membership as of 2012]]

As a university-governed consortium, UNAVCO is collectively tasked with advancing and supporting the science goals of the community. UNAVCO currently has over 100 US academic members, and supports over 65 organizations as associate members. Before incorporation in 2001, UNAVCO existed under different organizational umbrellas for nearly two decades as the University Navstar Consortium, then primarily serving geophysicists and geodesists who study tectonic deformation using high-precision [[GPS]] technology.

Since 2003, UNAVCO's scope has expanded significantly, with service to new science communities – including those who focus on the deformation of ice, the Earth's response to ground water, sea level, and other aspects of the [[hydrosphere]], and renewed interest in imaging the structure of the [[atmosphere]]. UNAVCO has also expanded its support of new geodetic tools: advancing GPS towards mm-level global GPS geodesy and to streaming high rate observations; borehole strain meters and [[seismometer]]s, expanded geodetic imaging using [[lidar]] for Airborne Laser Swath Mapping, InSAR ([[Interferometric synthetic aperture radar|Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar]]), and Terrestrial Laser Scanning, web services and [[cyberinfrastructure]]. GPS is finding applications in a frequency range that used to be the sole provenance of [[seismology]], as GPS measurements grow from one solution per day to one solution per second, with high precision.

As of October, 2013, UNAVCO operates the GAGE (Geodesy Advancing Geosciences and [[Earthscope|EarthScope]]) Facility, located in [[Boulder, Colorado]] with regional offices in [[San Clemente, California]] and [[Anchorage, Alaska]]. The Facility provides science support through community coordination, field engineering, data services, technology innovation, and instrument testing, acquisition, and deployment. It provides scientific support to global geodetic infrastructure that is developed and operated through international collaborations. [[Earthscope|EarthScope]], a set of integrated geophysical observatories, supports investigation of the entire temporal spectrum of Earth deformation processes. In particular, the [[Plate Boundary Observatory]] (PBO) provides geodetic imaging of plate boundary deformation.

UNAVCO undertook an internal reorganization to refine its community support and advisory committees. Three UNAVCO programs focus on: (1) [[#Geodetic Infrastructure|Geodetic Infrastructure]]; (2) [[#Geodetic Data Services|Geodetic Data Services]]; and (3) [[#Education and Community Engagement|Education and Community Engagement]].

==Tools and Services==

===Data===
The UNAVCO GAGE Facility provides access to several types of data that scientists use for quantifying the motions of rock, ice and water at or near the Earth’s surface. Geodetic GPS/GNSS Data (Global Navigation Satellite System / Global Positioning System Data), enable millimeter-scale surface motion measurements at discrete points. Geodetic Imaging Data are collected by a variety of different sensors deployed on satellites, aircraft, and on the ground, and provide high resolution terrain models and deformation measurements over areas of tens of meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Data collected from Strain and Seismic Borehole instruments measure the deformation at or near the surface of the Earth and measure rock physical properties in the vicinity of the installations. At many of the sites where geodetic measurements are made, Meteorological Data are also collected to aid in the processing of the geodetic data. Under the large EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory, UNAVCO acquires, archives, and/or distributes a number of community data sets including GPS, strainmeter, borehole seismometer, tilt meter, and geodetic imaging with radar and lidar, as part of EarthScope’s Plate Boundary Observatory.

GPS data are available both via ftp and via a [http://www.unavco.org/data/gps-gnss/data-access-methods/dai2/app/dai2.html data archive interface]:. UNAVCO is developing Geodesy Seamless Archive Centers (GSAC) with GPS archives at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] (SOPAC) and Goddard Space Flight Center (CDDIS) for facilitating user access to geodesy data.

===GPS/GNSS Systems===
The GAGE Facility manages a community pool of high accuracy portable [[GPS]]/GNSS receiver systems that can be used for a range of applications. These complete systems – receivers, antennas, mounts, power and optional communications – can be deployed for days in episodic campaigns or for many months long-term investigations. Systems are also available for precision mapping applications.

===Terrestrial Laser Scanning===
The GAGE Facility at UNAVCO maintains a pool of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) instruments and associated peripherals, digital photography equipment, software and ancillary equipment optimized to support Earth science investigators. TLS technology is based on lidar ("LIght raDAR") and is also referred to as ground-based lidar or tripod lidar. It is an active imaging system whereby laser pulses are emitted by the scanner and observables include the range and intensity of pulse returns reflected by the surface or object being scanned.

The primary capability of TLS is the generation of high resolution 3D maps and images of surfaces and objects over scales of meters to kilometers with centimeter to sub-centimeter precision. Repeat TLS measurements allow the imaging and measurement of changes through time and in unprecedented detail, making TLS even more valuable for transformative science investigations.

TLS is a powerful geodetic imaging tool ideal for supporting a wide spectrum of user applications in many different environments. Geoscience applications to date include detailed mapping of fault scarps, geologic outcrops, fault-surface roughness, frost polygons, [[lava lakes]], [[Dike (geology)|dikes]], [[fissures]], [[glaciers]], columnar joints and hillside drainages. Repeat TLS surveys allow the imaging and measurement of surface changes through time due, for example, to surface processes, volcanic deformation, [[ice flow]], beach morphology transitions, and post-seismic slip. The incorporation of GPS measurements provides accurate [[georeferencing]] of TLS data in an [[absolute reference frame]]. The addition of digital photography yields photorealistic 3D images. It has been demonstrated that TLS derived 3D imagery is a unique and powerful tool for educational and outreach applications as well.

===Engineering Expertise===
The GAGE Facility provides engineering expertise and equipment resources to investigators in support of their geophysical research projects. This may include: Proposal planning, project logistics and support letters, field engineering support, modern GNSS equipment for loan to projects, permanent GPS station installations, operation, and maintenance, and/or data acquisition, quality control, transfer, management, and archiving.

GAGE Facility engineers provide classroom and in-the-field training, project design and implementation, field engineering, TLS or GPS network operations, and technology development for GPS, TLS and other applications.

===Polar Services===
The GAGE Facility provides geodetic support to NSF-OPP (National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs) funded researchers working in the Arctic and Antarctic. Survey-grade GPS receivers, Terrestrial Laser Scanners, and supporting power and communications systems for continuous data collection and campaign surveying are available. Operation and maintenance services are also provided for long term data collection, with on-line data distribution from the UNAVCO community archive.

===GGN, GNSS, IGS Support===
The GAGE Facility provides global infrastructure support to NASA/JPL in operating a collection of high capability, globally distributed, permanent GPS stations called the Global GPS Network (GGN). Data from these stations are used to produce highly accurate products for GPS Earth science research, multidisciplinary applications, and education. UNAVCO also provides support for the International GNSS Service (IGS).

===Short Courses, Workshops, Internships===
The GAGE Facility’s Education and Community Engagement (ECE) program offers short courses and workshops. They focus on professional development, research, and education, strategic support for scientific investigators in developing broader impacts, in-residence programs for geodesy science community members and educators, professional development in geosciences for K-12 faculty, and for undergraduate students through RESESS (Research Experiences in Solid Earth Science for Students), student internships to encourage broader participation in geosciences.

===Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO)===
UNAVCO operates the [[Plate Boundary Observatory]] (PBO), the geodetic component of [[EarthScope]], funded by the National Science Foundation. The PBO consists of several major observatory components: a network of 1100+ permanent, continuously operating Global Positioning System (GPS) stations many of which provide data at high-rate and in real-time, 78 borehole seismometers, 74 borehole strainmeters, 28 shallow borehole tiltmeters, and six long baseline laser strainmeters. These instruments are complemented by InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) and lidar imagery and geochronology.

===Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network (COCONet)===
UNAVCO operates the Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network (COCONet)[1], which consists of 50 planned continuously operating GPS/weather stations integrated with 65 existing GPS stations operated by partner organizations, 15 of which will be upgraded with new equipment. COCONet provides free, high-quality, open-format GPS and meteorological data for these stations via the internet for use by scientists, government agencies, educators, students, and the private sector. These data are used by local and foreign researchers to study solid earth processes such as tectonic plate motions, tectonic plate boundary interaction and deformation, including earthquake cycle processes and risks. They also serve atmospheric scientists and weather forecasting groups by providing more precise estimates of tropospheric water vapor and enabling better forecasting of the dynamics of airborne moisture associated with the yearly Caribbean hurricane cycle.

==History==
UNAVCO was created in 1984 in response to the challenge of applying GPS to geosciences. At that time it was called the University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO). At its inception, UNAVCO was housed within the [[Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences]] (CIRES) at the [http://www.colorado.edu/ University of Colorado-Boulder]. In 1992, UNAVCO moved under the umbrella of the [http://www2.ucar.edu/ University Corporation for Atmospheric Research] (UCAR), also located in Boulder, Colorado. In 2001, UNAVCO, Inc. incorporated as an independent, non-profit, [501(c)(3)] corporation. For a one-year period, between April 2001 and September 2003, UCAR/UNAVCO and UNAVCO, Inc. both existed. In October 2003, funding for UCAR/UNAVCO ended and the staff and equipment of UCAR/UNAVCO moved to UNAVCO, Inc. The objective of this change was to provide the UNAVCO community with control over UNAVCO resources and activities with no additional cost to the community. UNAVCO, Inc. adopted the former acronym as its official name when it incorporated, though currently the acronym does not specifically stand for anything. In 2004, UNAVCO initiated a formal Education and Outreach program. That program was reconstituted in 2012 to become Education and Community Engagement. A complete UNAVCO timeline is available on [http://www.unavco.org/about/history/history.html their webpage].

==Organization==
In 2012, UNAVCO undertook an internal reorganization to integrate activities and refine its community support and advisory committees. The three new UNAVCO programs focus on: (1) the integration of observing systems and networks across techniques [[#Geodetic Infrastructure|(Geodetic Infrastructure)]]; (2) network data operations, community data products, and cyberinfrastructure for data security, discovery and accessibility [[#Geodetic Data Services|(Geodetic Data Services)]]; and (3) education and outreach strategies [[#Education and Community Engagement|(Education and Community Engagement)]].

===Geodetic Infrastructure===
The Geodetic Infrastructure (GI) program integrates all geodetic infrastructure and data acquisition capabilities for continuously operating observational networks and shorter-term deployments. Supported activities include development and testing, advanced systems engineering, the construction, operation, and maintenance of permanent geodetic instrument networks around the globe, and engineering services tailored to PI project requirements. Major projects currently supported by the GI program include the 1,112 station Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), Polar networks in Greenland and Antarctica (GNET and ANET, together known as POLENET), COCONet spanning the Caribbean plate boundary, the multi-disciplinary AfricaArray, and several other smaller continuously observing geodetic networks.

===Geodetic Data Services===
Geodetic Data Services (GDS) program provides services for the long-term stewardship of unique data sets. These services organize, manage, and archive data, and develop tools for data access and interpretation. GDS provides a comprehensive suite of services including sensor network data operations, data products and services, data management and archiving, and advanced cyberinfrastructure. Services are provided for GPS/GNSS data, Imaging data, Strain and Seismic data, and Meteorological data. GPS/GNSS data enable millimeter-scale surface motions at discrete points. Data from geodetic imaging instruments can be used to map topography and delineate deformation with high spatial resolution. InSAR and Terrestrial LiDAR imaging data services are provided. Strain and seismic data from borehole strainmeters, seismometers, thermometers, pore pressure transducers, tiltmeters, and rock samples from drilling, as well as surface-based tiltmeters and laser strainmeters are available. In addition, temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure data are available from surface measurements of atmospheric conditions from stations. Tropospheric parameters are generated during daily GPS post-processing managed by UNAVCO and are accessible through data access services. The program is optimized to enable access to high-precision geodetic data. The [http://www.unavco.org/data/data.html UNAVCO Data Archive] includes more than 2,300 continuous GPS stations.

===Education and Community Engagement===
The Education and Community Engagement program provides services to communicate the scientific results of the geodetic community, foster education across a broad range of learners, and grow workforce development and international partnerships. Particular focus is given to providing training, developing educational materials, and facilitating technical short courses to scientists studying geodesy. The program also supports formal education (K-12) and informal public outreach through workshops, educational materials for secondary students and undergraduate level courses, museum displays, and social media interactions. UNAVCO provides an annual series of short courses and workshops aimed at current researchers who want to update their skills or branch into new areas of geodetic research. UNAVCO Short Courses are offered to increase the capacity of the scientific community to process, analyze, and interpret various types of geodetic data. Educational Workshops promote a broader understanding of Earth science for college and secondary education faculty.

UNAVCO supports geo-workforce development through undergraduate internship programs, graduate student mentoring, and online resources. The premier internship program for upper division undergraduate students is [http://resess.unavco.org/ Research Experience in the Solid Earth Science for Students] (RESESS). RESESS is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and ExxonMobil. It is a multi-year geoscience research internship as well as a community support and professional development program designed to increase the diversity of students entering the geosciences. Upper-division undergraduate students from underrepresented groups spend 11 weeks in Boulder, Colorado during the summer, conducting an independent geoscience-focused research project. RESESS is a summer internship program dedicated to increasing the diversity of students entering the geosciences. Interns work under the guidance of a research mentor and are mentored and supported throughout the academic year by RESESS program staff from UNAVCO. The alumni of RESESS are 55% Latino/Hispanic, 27% African American/Black, 11% Native American, and 7% Asian American. Of the 30 interns who have gone on to earn a bachelor's degree, 13 are enrolled in a master's degree program and 8 are currently enrolled in a doctoral program. Nine RESESS alumni are working in private industry, five of which are in the geosciences.&lt;ref&gt;Charlevoix &amp; Morris Increasing Diversity in Geoscience Through Research Internships, EOS 95(8), 69–70(2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership and Governance==
UNAVCO Members are educational or nonprofit institutions chartered in the United States (US) or its Territories with a commitment to scholarly research involving the application of high precision geodesy to Earth science or related fields. Members must also be willing to make a clear and continuing commitment to active participation in governance and science activities. Associate Membership is available to organizations other than U.S. educational institutions, when those organizations share UNAVCO’s mission and otherwise meet the qualifications for membership.

A Board of Directors is charged with UNAVCO oversight and governance, and is elected by designated representatives of UNAVCO member institutions. The Board works with the science community to create a broad interdisciplinary research agenda based on applications of geodetic technology, to identify investigator needs for infrastructure support, to develop proposals to appropriate sponsors to maintain that infrastructure capability, and to ensure that UNAVCO and its activities provide high quality, cost-effective, and responsive support. Advisory committees for each of the three programs guide the focus of the programs and help shape their initiatives.

==Science==
For more than two decades, space-based geodetic observations have enabled measurement of the motions of the Earth’s surface and crust at many different scales, with unprecedented spatial and temporal detail and increased precision, leading to fundamental discoveries in continental deformation, plate boundary processes, the earthquake cycle, the geometry and dynamics of magmatic systems, continental groundwater storage, and hydrologic loading.

Space geodesy furthers research on earthquake and tsunami hazards, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, coastal subsidence, wetlands health, soil moisture, groundwater distribution, and space weather.&lt;ref&gt;Geodesy in the 21st Century, Eos, Vol. 90, No. 18, 5 May 2009, by S. Wdowinski and S. Eriksson. http://www.unavco.org/community_science/science-apps/science-apps.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid Earth===
Earth and the tools to study it are constantly changing. The tectonic plates are continuously in motion, though so slowly that even with the highest precision instruments, months or years of observations are necessary to measure it. Over the last several decades, the advent of space-based geodetic techniques have improved the ability to measure tectonic plate motion by several orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal resolution as well as accuracy, and to establish stable terrestrial and celestial reference frames required to achieve these improvements. The research with these systems has led to revolutionary progress in our understanding of plate boundaries and plate interiors.&lt;ref&gt;A. Newman, S. Stiros, L. Feng, P. Psimoulis, F. Moschas, V. Saltogianni, Y. Jiang, C. Papazachos, D. Panagiotopoulos, E. Karagianni, and D. Vamvakaris. Recent geodetic unrest at Santorini Caldera, Greece. J. Geophys. Res.-Solid Earth, Vol. 39, Art. No. L06309, published 30 March 2012.  http://geophysics.eas.gatech.edu/people/anewman/research/papers/Newman_etal_GRL_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryosphere===
Ice covers approximately 10% of Earth’s land surface at the present, with most of the ice mass being contained in the Greenland and Antarctic continental ice sheets. Designing and undertaking geodetic experiments that enable researchers to improve the understanding of ice dynamics allows stronger predictions (through numerical models) of the response of the glaciers to changing climates.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, SA, J Wahr, E Leuliette, T van Dam, KM Larson and O Francis (2008), Geodetic measurements of postglacial adjustments in Greenland. J. Geophys. Res.-Solid Earth, 113 (B2) , Art. No. B02402, {{ISSN|0148-0227}}, ids: 263SI, {{doi|10.1029/2007JB004956}}, Published 14 – Feb 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willis, M. J., A. K.

K., M. J. Willis, M. E. Pritchard, and S. A. Bernstein (2009) Glacier velocities and elevation change of the Juneau Icefield, Alaska (abstract C51B-0490,), AGU Fall meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental and Hydrogeodesy===
Through its sensitivity to mass redistribution and accurate distance measurements, geodesy is uniquely posed to answer fundamental questions about issues relating to water and the environment. Geodetic observations are enabling researchers, for the first time, to follow the motion of water within Earth’s system at global scales and to characterize changes in terrestrial groundwater storage at a variety of scales, ranging from continental-scale changes in water storage using gravity space missions, to regional and local changes using InSAR, GNSS, leveling, and relative gravity measurements of surface deformation accompanying aquifer-system compaction.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, K.M. and F.G.

===Ocean===
Seventy five percent of Earth's crust is unobservable using solely electromagnetic energy-based geodetic techniques. Seafloor geodesy can now expand geodetic positioning to off-shore environments.&lt;ref&gt;Sato, Mariko; Ishikawa, Tadashi; Ujihara, Naoto; Yoshida, Shigeru; Fujita, Masayuki; Mochizuki, Masashi; Asada, Akira.

Geophysical Research Abstracts Vol. 14, EGU2012-12291, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmosphere===
Space geodesy utilizes electromagnetic signals propagating through the atmosphere of Earth, providing information on tropospheric temperature and water vapor and on ionospheric electron density. Thus, in the early twenty-first century, the goal of geodesy has evolved to include study of the kinematics and dynamics of both Earth’s atmosphere and the solid Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, J., L.

Fernandez; and Roberta Klein, Hurricane Vulnerability in Latin America and The Caribbean: Normalized Damage and Loss Potentials, 2003, Natural Hazards Review, pp 101–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Dimensions===
Geodetic research associated with earthquakes and volcanoes have goals of providing early warnings and mitigating future hazard events on a global scale. As the population density increases and more people live in proximity to seismically [[active fault]]s, understanding the nature of earthquakes remains a goal of the Earth sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, J., L. Zhang, A. Dai, F. Immler, M. Sommer and H. Voemel, 2012: Radiation dry bias correction of Vaisala RS92 humidity data and its impacts on historical radiosonde data. J. Atmos.

Soc., in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
High-resolution images and 3D/4D topography maps facilitate field-based tests of a new generation of quantitative models of mass transport mechanisms. Open access to data, tools and facilities for processing, analysis, and visualization, and new algorithms and workflows are changing the landscape of geodetic scientific collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, S.
