'''650 California Street''', also known as the '''Hartford Building''', is a 34 story, 142 m, (466 feet) [[office]] tower on the northwestern edge of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco's]] [[Financial District (San Francisco)|Financial District]].&lt;ref name="emporis"/&gt; The tower is located on [[California Street (San Francisco)|California Street]] on the edge of [[Chinatown (San Francisco)|Chinatown]], and not far from [[555 California Street]]. 650 California is visible from every direction except from the southeast, where the Financial District skyscrapers block the view.

== Description ==
The building was designed by [[Edward Charles Bassett]] of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] for [[The Hartford|Hartford Insurance]], its initial tenant.&lt;ref name="emporis"&gt;{{cite web | title=650 California Street | publisher=Emporis | accessdate=2007-09-24 | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=650californiastreet-sanfrancisco-ca-usa }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is architecturally significant, featuring a tall [[modernist]] lobby, high ceilings, and an exterior skeleton of floor-to-ceiling windows recessed into a square gridwork of [[precast concrete|precast]] white [[reinforced concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/libraries/caohp/bassett.html|title=Edward Charles Bassett (1921-1999), oral history|publisher=Art Institute of Chicago | author=Betty J. Blum|accessdate=2007-09-24|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When this tower was completed in 1964, it was the second in San Francisco larger than {{convert|400000|sqft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="pivotal"/&gt; For a time it was also California's tallest building, replacing both the [[Russ Building]] in San Francisco and the [[Los Angeles City Hall]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name="emporis"/&gt; 

650 California was acquired for {{US$|160 million}} by the Pivotal Group in 2000,&lt;ref name="pivotal"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Pivotal Group| title=Pivotal LLC purchases 650 California Street | date=2000-10-13| accessdate=2009-09-24 | url=http://www.pivotalgroup.com/media-room/oct-13-2000.htm| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091016173759/http://www.pivotalgroup.com/media-room/oct-13-2000.htm| archivedate= 16 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later sold to private investors, A-650 California St. LLC, and AEW Capital Management in 2007.&lt;ref name="hp"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Pivotal Group| title=650 California Street | date=| accessdate=2009-09-24 | url=http://www.pivotalgroup.com/commercial/650-california.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower was acquired by [[Tishman Speyer]] and partner Prudential Real Estate Investors in 2012 for about {{US$|230 million}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2012/05/25/tishmans-650-cal-buy-adds-to-recent.html?page=all |title=Tishman’s 650 Cal buy adds to recent string of big deals |date=May 25, 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2014 |author=J.K.

'''Abrasive blasting''', more commonly known as '''sandblasting''', is the operation of forcibly propelling a stream of [[abrasive]] material against a surface under high [[pressure]] to smooth a [[surface roughness|rough]] surface, roughen a smooth surface, shape a surface or remove surface [[contaminant]]s. A pressurised fluid, typically [[compressed air]], or a [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] wheel is used to propel the blasting material (often called the ''media''). The first abrasive blasting process was [[patent]]ed by [[Benjamin Chew Tilghman]] on 18 October 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smil|first=Vaclav|title=Creating the twentieth century: technical innovations of 1867–1914 and their lasting impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3Mh7qQRM-IC&amp;pg=PA211|isbn=978-0-19-516874-7|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several variants of the process, using various media; some are highly abrasive, whereas others are milder. The most abrasive are shot blasting (with metal [[shot (pellet)|shot]]) and sandblasting (with [[sand]]). Moderately abrasive variants include glass bead blasting (with glass [[bead]]s) and media blasting with ground-up plastic stock or [[walnut]] shells and [[corncob]]s.  Some of these substances can cause anaphylactic shock to both operators and passers by.&lt;ref&gt;See: Travis McEwan, "[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-walnut-death-work-site-1.4368171 Edmonton worker allergic to walnuts dies after inhaling particles at worksite,"] [[CBC News]], 23 October 2017. ''(Retrieved 2017-10-25)''&lt;/ref&gt; A mild version is [[sodablasting]] (with [[sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]]). In addition, there are alternatives that are barely abrasive or nonabrasive, such as [[ice blasting (cleaning)|ice blasting]] and [[dry-ice blasting]].

==Types==
===Sandblasting===
Sandblasting or bead blasting is a generic term for the process of smoothing, shaping and cleaning a hard surface by forcing solid particles across that surface at high speeds; the effect is similar to that of using [[sandpaper]], but provides a more even finish with no problems at corners or crannies. Sandblasting can occur naturally, usually as a result of particles blown by [[wind]] causing [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] [[erosion]], or artificially, using [[compressed air]].  An artificial sandblasting process was [[patent]]ed by [[Benjamin Chew Tilghman]] on 18 October 1870.

Sandblasting equipment typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed. The mixture travels through a hand-held nozzle to direct the particles toward the surface or workpiece. Nozzles come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. Boron carbide is a popular material for nozzles because it resists abrasive wear well.

===Wet abrasive blasting===
One of the original pioneers of the wet abrasive (vapourmatting) process was Norman Ashworth who found the advantages of using a wet process a strong alternative to dry blasting. The process is available in all conventional formats including hand cabinets, walk-in booths, automated production machinery and total loss portable blasting units. Advantages include the ability to use extremely fine or coarse media with densities ranging from [[plastic]] to [[steel]] and the ability to use hot water and soap to allow simultaneous degreasing and blasting.  The reduction in dust also makes it safer to use silicacious materials for blasting, or to remove hazardous material such as [[asbestos]], [[Radiation|radioactive]] or poisonous products.

Process speeds are generally not as fast as conventional dry abrasive blasting when using the equivalent size and type of media, in part because the presence of water between the media and the substrate being processed creates a lubricating cushion that can protect both the surface and the media, reducing breakdown rates. Reduced impregnation of blasting material into the surface, dust reduction and the elimination of static cling can result in a very clean surface. However wet blasting of mild steel will result in immediate or 'flash' corrosion of the blasted steel substrate due to the presence of water. The lack of surface recontamination also allows the use of single equipment for multiple blasting operations—e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[stainless steel]] and [[carbon steel|mild steel]] items can be processed in the same equipment with the same media without problems.

===Bead blasting===
[[Image:2018 Bead blasting.jpg | right | thumb | 220px | Bead blasting paint from a concrete curb. Mixing particles with water substantially reduces dust.]]
''Bead blasting'' is the process of removing surface deposits by applying fine glass beads at a high pressure without damaging the surface. It is used to clean calcium deposits from pool tiles or any other surfaces, remove embedded fungus, and brighten [[grout]] color. It is also used in [[auto body]] work to remove paint.  In removing paint for auto body work, bead blasting is preferred over sand blasting, as sand blasting tends to create a greater surface profile than bead blasting.  Bead blasting is often used in creating a uniform surface finish on machined parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://parts-badger.com/the-cnc-process/surface-finishes/|title=Surface Finishes - Parts Badger|work=Parts Badger|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is additionally used in cleaning mineral specimens, most of which have a [[Mohs scale|Mohs hardness]] of 7 or less and would thus be damaged by sand.

===Wheel blasting===
In wheel blasting, a spinning wheel propels the abrasive against an object. It is typically categorized as an airless blasting operation because there is no propellant (gas or liquid) used. A wheel machine is a high-power, high-efficiency blasting operation with recyclable abrasive (typically steel or stainless steel shot, [[Wire saw|cut wire]], grit, or similarly sized pellets). Specialized wheel blast machines propel plastic abrasive in a [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] chamber, and is usually used for deflashing plastic and [[rubber]] components. The size of the wheel blast machine, and the number and power of the wheels vary considerably depending on the parts to be blasted as well as on the expected result and efficiency. The first blast wheel was patented by Wheelabrator in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRIDGEPORT PROJECT / SOUTHWEST DIVISION HISTORY|url=http://www.crra.org/pages/proj_bridgeport_history.htm|accessdate=9 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100931/http://crra.org/pages/proj_bridgeport_history.htm| archivedate= 23 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydro-blasting===
Hydro blasting is not a form of abrasive blasting as no abrasive media is used. Hydro-blasting, commonly known as water blasting, is commonly used because it usually requires only one operator. In hydro-blasting, a highly pressured stream of water is used to remove old paint, chemicals, or buildup without damaging the original surface. This method is ideal for cleaning internal and external surfaces because the operator is generally able to send the stream of water into places that are difficult to reach using other methods. Another benefit of hydro-blasting is the ability to recapture and reuse the water, reducing waste and mitigating environmental impact.

===Micro-abrasive blasting===
{{Main|Abrasive jet machining}}
Micro-abrasive blasting is dry abrasive blasting process that uses small nozzles (typically 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm to 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) to deliver a fine stream of abrasive accurately to a small part or a small area on a larger part. Generally the area to be blasted is from about 1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to only a few cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at most. Also known as pencil blasting, the fine jet of abrasive is accurate enough to write directly on glass and delicate enough to cut a pattern in an [[eggshell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary F. |last=Benedict |title=Nontraditional Manufacturing Processes |chapter=Figure 2.1 An AJM-machined egg shell... |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdmNVSio8jUC&amp;pg=PA6 |date=1987 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-7352-6 |pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abrasive media particle sizes range from 10 micrometres up to about 150 micrometres. Higher pressures are often required.

The most common micro-abrasive blasting systems are commercial bench-mounted units consisting of a power supply and mixer, exhaust hood, nozzle, and gas supply. The nozzle can be hand-held or fixture mounted for automatic operation. Either the nozzle or part can be moved in automatic operation.

===Automated blasting===
Automated blasting is simply the [[automation]] of the abrasive blasting process. Automated blasting is frequently just a step in a larger automated procedure, usually involving other surface treatments such as preparation and coating applications. Care is often needed to isolate the blasting chamber from mechanical components that may be subject to [[Fouling|dust fouling]].

=== Dry-ice blasting ===
{{main|Dry-ice blasting}}
In this type of blasting, air and [[dry ice]] are used. Surface contaminants are dislodged by the force of frozen carbon dioxide particles hitting at high velocity, and by slight shrinkage due to freezing which disrupts adhesion bonds. The dry ice [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimates]], leaving no residue to clean up other than the removed material. Dry ice is a relatively [[hardness|soft]] material, so is less destructive to the underlying material than sandblasting.

===Bristle blasting===
{{Main|Bristle blasting}}
Bristle blasting, unlike other blasting methods, does not require a separate blast media. The surface is treated by a brush-like [[rotary tool]] made of dynamically tuned high-[[carbon steel]] wire bristles. Repeated contact with the sharp, rotating bristle tips results in localized impact, rebound, and crater formation, which simultaneously cleans and coarsens the surface.

===Vacuum blasting===
{{Main| Vacuum blasting}}
Vacuum blasting is a method that generates very little [[dust]] and spill, as the blast tool does dry abrasive blasting and collects used blast media and loosened particles from the surface to be treated, simultaneously. Blast media consumption is relatively low with this method, as the used blast media is automatically separated from dust and loosened particles, and reused several times.

==Equipment==
[[File:Sandblasting2.jpg|thumb|upright|Device used for adding sand to the compressed air (top of which is a sieve for adding the sand)]]

===Portable blast equipment===
Mobile dry abrasive blast systems are typically powered by a diesel air compressor. The air compressor provides a large volume of high pressure air to a single or multiple "blast pots". Blast pots are pressurized, tank-like containers, filled with abrasive material, used to allow an adjustable amount of blasting grit into the main blasting line. The number of blast pots is dictated by the volume of air the compressor can provide. Fully equipped blast systems are often found mounted on [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-tractor trailers]], offering high mobility and easy transport from site to site. Others are [[Hopper (particulate collection container)|hopper]]-fed types making them lightweight and more mobile.

In wet blasting, the abrasive is introduced into a pressurized stream of water or other liquid, creating a [[slurry]]. Wet blasting is often used in applications where the minimal dust generation is desired. Portable applications may or may not recycle the abrasive.

===Blast cabinet===
[[File:Cabine de sablage arena.JPG|thumb|upright|A sand-blasting cabinet]]

A blast cabinet is essentially a closed loop system that allows the operator to blast the part and recycle the abrasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-sandblasting-cabinet.htm|title=What is a Sandblasting Cabinet? (with pictures)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually consists of four components; the containment (cabinet), the abrasive blasting system, the abrasive recycling system and the dust collection. The operator blasts the parts from the outside of the cabinet by placing his arms in gloves attached to glove holes on the cabinet, viewing the part through a view window, turning the blast on and off using a foot pedal or [[treadle]]. Automated blast cabinets are also used to process large quantities of the same component and may incorporate multiple blast nozzles and a part conveyance system.

There are three systems typically used in a blast cabinet. Two, siphon and pressure, are dry and one is wet:

* A siphon blast system (suction blast system) uses the compressed air to create vacuum in a chamber (known as the blast gun). The negative pressure pulls abrasive into the blast gun where the compressed air directs the abrasive through a blast nozzle. The abrasive mixture travels through a nozzle that directs the particles toward the surface or workpiece.

Nozzles come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. [[Tungsten carbide]] is the liner material most often used for mineral abrasives. Silicon carbide and boron carbide nozzles are more wear resistant and are often used with harder abrasives such as aluminum oxide. Inexpensive abrasive blasting systems and smaller cabinets use ceramic nozzles.

* In a pressure blast system, the abrasive is stored in the pressure vessel then sealed. The vessel is pressurized to the same pressure as the blast hose attached to the bottom of the pressure vessel. The abrasive is metered into the blast hose and conveyed by the compressed gas through the blast nozzle.
* Wet blast cabinets use a system that injects the abrasive/liquid slurry into a compressed gas stream. Wet blasting is typically used when the heat produced by friction in dry blasting would damage the part.

===Blast room===
A blast room is a much larger version of a blast cabinet. Blast operators work inside the room to roughen, smooth, or clean surfaces of an item depending on the needs of the finished product. Blast rooms and blast facilities come in many sizes, some of which are big enough to accommodate very large or uniquely shaped objects like rail cars, commercial and military vehicles, construction equipment, and aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Eric G.|date=2005-09-01|title=How to Create an Abrasive Air Blast Room|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026057605807226|journal=Metal Finishing|volume=103|issue=9|pages=44–46|doi=10.1016/S0026-0576(05)80722-6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each application may require the use of many different pieces of equipment, however, there are several key components that can be found in a typical blast room:
* An enclosure or containment system, usually the room itself, designed to remain sealed to prevent blast media from escaping
* A blasting system; wheel blasting and air blasting systems are commonly used
* A blast pot — a pressurized container filled with abrasive blasting media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.corrosionpedia.com/definition/1979/blast-pot-corrosion|title=What is a Blast Pot? - Definition from Corrosionpedia|work=Corrosionpedia|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A dust collection system which filters the air in the room and prevents particulate matter from escaping
* A material recycling or media reclamation system to collect abrasive blasting media so it can be used again; these can be automated mechanical or pneumatic systems installed in the floor of the blast room, or the blast media can be collected manually by sweeping or shoveling the material back into the blast pot
Additional equipment can be added for convenience and improved usability, such as overhead cranes for maneuvering the workpiece, wall-mounted units with multiple axes that allow the operator to reach all sides of the workpiece, and sound-dampening materials used to reduce noise levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delongequipment.com/blast-rooms/|title=Blast rooms|last=|first=|date=|work=DeLong Equipment|access-date=2017-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113193022/http://www.delongequipment.com/blast-rooms/|archive-date=2016-11-13|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, it was assumed that sharp-edged grains provided the best performance, but this was later demonstrated not to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;1919 Popular Science article on types of minerals found to be suitable for sandblasting – ''Little Grains of Sand'', ''[[Popular Science]]'' monthly, February 1919, page 64, scanned by [https://books.google.com/books?id=7igDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mineral: [[Silica sand]] can be used as a type of mineral abrasive. It tends to break up quickly, creating large quantities of dust, exposing the operator to the potential development of [[silicosis]], a debilitating [[Respiratory disease|lung disease]]. To counter this hazard, silica sand for blasting is often coated with resins to control the dust. Using silica as an abrasive is not allowed in [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], or [[Belgium]] for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSHA Asked to Ban Silica in Abrasive Blasting|url=http://www.paintsquare.com/news/?fuseaction=view&amp;id=2875|publisher=Paint Square|accessdate=9 June 2011|date=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silica is a common abrasive in countries where it is not banned.&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/blasting/ |title = Abrasive Blasting |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |date = 16 April 2011 |accessdate = 22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common mineral abrasive is [[garnet]]. Garnet is more expensive than silica sand, but if used correctly, will offer equivalent production rates while producing less dust and no safety hazards from ingesting the dust.  Magnesium sulphate, or [[kieserite]], is often used as an alternative to [[baking soda]].

Agricultural: Typically, crushed nut shells or fruit kernels. These soft abrasives are used to avoid damaging the underlying material such when cleaning brick or stone, removing [[graffiti]], or the removal of coatings from printed [[circuit board]]s being repaired.

Synthetic:  This category includes [[corn starch]], [[wheat starch]], [[sodium bicarbonate]], and [[dry-ice blasting|dry ice]]. These "soft" abrasives are also used to avoid damaging the underlying material such when cleaning brick or stone, removing graffiti, or the removal of coatings from printed circuit boards being repaired. Sodablasting uses baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) which is extremely [[Friability|friable]], the micro fragmentation on impact exploding away surface materials without damage to the substrate.

Additional synthetic abrasives include process byproducts (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[copper slag]], [[nickel]] [[slag]], and [[coal]] slag), engineered abrasives (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[aluminum oxide]], [[silicon carbide]] or carborundum, glass beads, ceramic shot/grit), and recycled products (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;plastic abrasive, glass grit).

Metallic: Steel shot, steel grit, stainless steel shot, cut wire, copper shot, aluminum shot, zinc shot.

Many coarser media used in sandblasting often result in energy being given off as sparks or light on impact. The colours and size of the spark or glow varies significantly, with heavy bright orange sparks from steel shot blasting, to a faint blue glow (often invisible in [[sunlight]] or brightly lit work areas) from garnet abrasive.

Cleaning operations using abrasive blasting can present risks for [[occupational safety and health|workers' health and safety]], specifically in portable air blasting or blast room (booth) applications. There is a large amount of dust created through abrasive blasting from the substrate and abrasive.&lt;ref name="NIOSH" /&gt; Although many abrasives used in blasting rooms are not hazardous in themselves, (steel shot and grit, cast iron, [[aluminum oxide]], garnet, plastic abrasive and glass bead), other abrasives (silica sand, [[copper slag]], nickel slag, and [[staurolite]]) have varying degrees of hazard (typically free silica or heavy metals). However, in all cases their use can present serious danger to operators, such as burns due to projections (with skin or eye [[lesion]]s), falls due to walking on round shot scattered on the ground, exposure to hazardous dusts, heat exhaustion, creation of an [[explosive]] atmosphere, and exposure to excessive noise. Blasting rooms and portable blaster's equipment have been adapted to these dangers. Blasting lead-based paint can fill the air with lead particles which can be harmful to the nervous system.&lt;ref name="niosh_topic"&gt;{{cite web|title = Abrasive Blasting|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/blasting/|work = NIOSH Topics|publisher = NIOSH|accessdate = 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) mandates engineered solutions to potential hazards, however silica sand continues to be allowed even though most commonly used blast helmets are not sufficiently effective at protecting the blast operator if ambient levels of dust exceed allowable limits. Adequate levels of respiratory protection for blast operations in the United States is approved by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH).
{{Clear}}
Typical safety equipment for operators includes:
* Positive pressure blast hood or helmet – The hood or helmet includes a head suspension system to allow the device to move with the operator's head, a view window with replaceable lens or lens protection and an air-feed hose.
* Grade‑D air supply (or self-contained oil-less air pump) – The air feed hose is typically attached to a grade‑D pressurized air supply.  Grade‑D air is mandated by OSHA to protect the worker from hazardous gases. It includes a pressure regulator, air filtration and a carbon monoxide monitor/alarm. An alternative method is a self-contained, oil-less air pump to feed pressurized air to the blast hood/helmet. An oil-less air pump does not require an air filter or carbon monoxide monitor/alarm, because the pressurized air is coming from a source that cannot generate [[carbon monoxide]].
* Hearing protection – ear muffs or ear plugs
* Body protection – Body protection varies by application but usually consists of gloves and overalls or a leather coat and chaps. Professionals would wear a cordura/canvas blast suit (unless blasting with steel abrasives, then they would use a leather suit).

In the past, when sandblasting was performed as an open-air job, the worker was exposed to risk of injury from the flying material and lung damage from inhaling the dust. The [[silica]] dust produced in the sandblasting process would cause silicosis after sustained [[inhalation]] of the dust. In 1918, the first sandblasting enclosure was built, which protected the worker with a viewing screen, revolved around the workpiece, and used an exhaust fan to draw dust away from the worker's face.&lt;ref&gt;''Making Things Easier for the Sand-Blaster'', Popular Science monthly, December 1918, page 76, scanned by [https://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Silicosis is still a risk when the operator is not completely isolated from the sandblasting apparatus.&lt;ref name="NIOSH" /&gt;

Sandblasting also may present secondary risks, such as falls from [[scaffolding]] or confinement in a small space.&lt;ref name="NIOSH" /&gt; [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] is another potential risk, from the use of small gasoline-powered engines in abrasive blasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FACE 9131|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/face/In-house/full9131.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries and territories now regulate sandblasting such that it may only be performed in a controlled environment using ventilation, protective clothing and breathing air supply.

===Worn-look jeans===
Many consumers are willing to pay extra for [[jeans]] that have the appearance of being used. To give the fabrics the right worn look sandblasting is used. Sandblasting has the risk of causing [[silicosis]] to the workers, and in [[Turkey]], more than 5,000 workers in the [[textile industry]] suffer from silicosis, and 46 people are known to have died from it. Silicosis was shown to be very common among former denim sandblasters in Turkey in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/32/5/1295|title=An epidemic of silicosis among former denim sandblasters|first1=M.|last1=Akgun|first2=O.|last2=Araz|first3=I.|last3=Akkurt|first4=A.|last4=Eroglu|first5=F.|last5=Alper|first6=L.|last6=Saglam|first7=A.|last7=Mirici|first8=M.|last8=Gorguner|first9=B.|last9=Nemery|date=1 November 2008|publisher=|journal=European Respiratory Journal|volume=32|issue=5|pages=1295–1303|accessdate=2 April 2018|via=erj.ersjournals.com|doi=10.1183/09031936.00093507|pmid=18579544}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study confirmed that silicosis is almost inevitable among former sandblasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Silicosis Appears Inevitable Among Former Denim Sandblasters |date=September 2015 |url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=2108970 |journal=Chest |publisher=American College of Chest Physicians |volume=148 |issue=3 |doi=10.1378/chest.14-2848|pmc=4556121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sweden]]'s Fair Trade Center conducted a survey among 17 textile companies that showed very few were aware of the dangers caused by manually sandblasting jeans. Several companies said they would abolish this technique from their own production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Buer, Kathleen |title= Dette dør folk for |trans-title=People are dying for this |url= http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/utenriks/dette-doer-folk-for-3363725.html |work= [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV&amp;nbsp;2 Norway]] |language= Norwegian |date= 11 December 2010 |accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The lettering and engraving on most modern [[cemetery]] monuments and markers is created by abrasive blasting.

Sandblasting can also be used to produce three-dimensional signage. This type of signage is considered to be a higher-end product as compared to flat signs. These signs often incorporate gold leaf overlay and sometimes crushed glass backgrounds which is called [[Cobalt glass|smalt]]s. When sandblasting wood signage it allows the wood grains to show and the [[Dendrochronology#Growth rings|growth rings]] to be raised, and is a popular way to give a sign a traditional carved look. Sandblasting can also be done on clear [[acrylic glass]] and [[glazing (window)|glazing]] as part of a store front or [[interior design]].

Sandblasting can be used to refurbish buildings or create works of art (carved or [[frosted glass]]). Modern masks and resists facilitate this process, producing accurate results.

Sandblasting techniques are used for cleaning boat [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s, as well as brick, stone, and concrete work. Sandblasting is used for cleaning industrial as well as commercial structures, but is rarely used for non-metallic workpieces.

'''Agriculture''' is the cultivation of land and breeding of [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s to provide [[food]], [[fiber]], [[medicinal plants]] and other products to sustain and enhance life.&lt;ref name="Office1999"&gt;{{cite book |title=Safety and health in agriculture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77 |year=1999 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=978-92-2-111517-5 |page=77 |accessdate=13 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722061757/http://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all |quote=defined agriculture as 'all forms of activities connected with growing, harvesting and primary processing of all types of crops, with the breeding, raising and caring for animals, and with tending gardens and nurseries'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture was the key development in the rise of [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[human civilization]], whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that enabled people to live in cities. The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years; people gathered wild grains at least 105,000 years ago and began to plant them around 11,500 years ago before they became domesticated. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Crops originate from at least 11 regions of the world. [[Industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] has in the past century come to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people worldwide still depend on [[subsistence agriculture]].

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s, and technological developments have sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological and environmental  damage. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in [[animal husbandry]] have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and environmental damage through contributions to [[global warming]], depletion of [[aquifer]]s, [[deforestation]], [[antibiotic resistance]], and [[growth hormone]]s in [[industrial meat production|industrially produced meat]]. [[Genetically modified organism]]s are widely used, although they are banned in several countries.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s (such as [[natural rubber|rubber]]). Classes of foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]], [[milk]], [[edible mushroom|fungi]] and [[eggs as food|eggs]]. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although the number of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

==Etymology and scope==

The word ''agriculture'' is a late [[Middle English]] adaptation of Latin ''agricultūra'', from ''ager'', "field", which in its turn came from [[Greek language|Greek]] αγρός, and ''cultūra'', "[[Tillage|cultivation]]" or "growing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=14 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories |editor=Chantrell, Glynnis |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-863121-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of [[ant]], [[termite]] and [[ambrosia beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Agriculture in Insects |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=36 |pages=563–595 |date=December 2005 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626 |author1=Mueller, Ulrich G. |author2=Gerardo, Nicole M. |author3=Aanen, Duur K. |author4=Six, Diana L. |author5=Schultz, Ted R. |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture is defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to "produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services".&lt;ref name=Maine /&gt; Thus defined, it includes [[arable farming]], [[horticulture]], [[animal husbandry]], and [[forestry]], but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded.&lt;ref name=Maine&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maine.gov/education/aged/definition.html |title=Definition of Agriculture |publisher=State of Maine |accessdate=6 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323075557/http://www.maine.gov/education/aged/definition.html |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from [[hunter-gatherer]] to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing [[sedentism]]; examples are the [[Natufian culture]] in the [[Levant]], and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, G. C.

The [[Haber-Bosch]] method allowed the synthesis of [[ammonium nitrate]] fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing [[crop yields]] and sustaining a further increase in global population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec32.pdf |title=Agricultural Scientific Revolution: Mechanical |author=Janick, Jules |publisher=Purdue University |accessdate=24 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525074054/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/Hort_306/text/lec32.pdf |archivedate=25 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/52548/52645.aspx |title=The Impact of Mechanization on Agriculture |journal=The Bridge on Agriculture and Information Technology |date=2011 |volume=41 |number=3 |author=Reid, John F. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105033809/http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/52548/52645.aspx |archivedate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern agriculture has raised political issues including [[water pollution]], [[biofuel]]s, [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[tariff]]s and [[Agricultural subsidy|farm subsidies]], leading to alternative approaches such as the [[organic movement]].&lt;ref name="motherjones1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/04/history-nitrogen-fertilizer-ammonium-nitrate |author=Philpott, Tom |title=A Brief History of Our Deadly Addiction to Nitrogen Fertilizer |date=19 April 2013 |accessdate=7 May 2013 |publisher=Mother Jones |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505115125/https://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/04/history-nitrogen-fertilizer-ammonium-nitrate |archivedate=5 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/ten-worst-famines-of-the-20th-century-20110815-1iu2w.html |title=Ten worst famines of the 20th century |journal=Sydney Morning Herald |date=15 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703063152/http://www.smh.com.au/world/ten-worst-famines-of-the-20th-century-20110815-1iu2w.html |archivedate=3 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Reindeer herding.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reindeer]] herds form the basis of pastoral agriculture for several Arctic and Subarctic peoples.]]

[[Pastoralism]] involves managing domesticated animals. In [[nomadic pastoralism]], herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practised in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Blench | first=Roger | title=Pastoralists in the new millennium | publisher=FAO | date=2001 | pages=11–12 | url=http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201000745/http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf | archivedate=1 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[shifting cultivation]], a small area of a forest is cleared by cutting down all the trees and the area is burned. The land is then used for growing crops for several years. When the soil becomes less fertile, the area is then abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shifting cultivation |url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/swidden |publisher=[[Survival International]] |accessdate=28 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829015112/http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/swidden |archivedate=29 August 2016| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manuring a vegetable garden.jpg|thumb|Spreading manure by hand in Zambia]]

[[Subsistence farming]] is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone, with little left over for transport elsewhere. It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waters, Tony |title=The Persistence of Subsistence Agriculture: life beneath the level of the marketplace |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the typical subsistence [[farmer]] is equivalent to a smallholder, then there are an estimated 2.5 billion such farmers in 2018, cultivating about 60% of the earth's [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=&lt;!--no byline--&gt; |date=7 March 2018 |title=Chinese project offers a brighter farming future |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02742-3 |department=Editorial |journal=Nature |volume=555 |issue=7695 |page=141 |doi=10.1038/d41586-018-02742-3 |pmid=29517037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[intensive farming]], the crops are cultivated to maximise profit, with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs. This type of farming is practiced mainly in highly developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042533 Encyclopædia Britannica's definition of Intensive Agriculture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705221311/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042533 |date=5 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcFactSheet"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/biology/livingthingsenvironment/4foodandsustainabilityrev5.shtml BBC School fact sheet on intensive farming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503035007/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/biology/livingthingsenvironment/4foodandsustainabilityrev5.shtml |date=3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crop cultivation systems===
[[File:An example of slash and burn agriculture practice Thailand.jpg|thumb|left|[[Slash and burn]] shifting cultivation, Thailand]]

Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.&lt;ref name="FAO FS"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |url=http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm |title=Analysis of farming systems |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806063804/http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm |archivedate=6 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCP APS"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. Agricultural Production Systems. pp. 283–317 in "Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology". Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shifting cultivation (or [[slash and burn]]) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops for a period of several years.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. "Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability". pp. 25–57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

[[File:Intercropping coconut n Tagetes erecta.jpg|thumb|[[Intercropping]] of [[coconut]] and [[Tagetes erecta|Mexican marigold]]]]

Further industrialization led to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.&lt;ref name="PCP APS" /&gt; [[Multiple cropping]], in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

Important categories of food crops include [[cereal]]s, legumes, forage, fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; [[Natural fiber]]s include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profiles of 15 of the world's major plant and animal fibres|url=http://www.fao.org/natural-fibres-2009/about/15-natural-fibres/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=26 March 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific crops are cultivated in distinct [[growing region]]s throughout the world. Production is listed in millions of metric tons, based on [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] estimates.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

===Livestock production systems===
{{Main|Livestock|Animal husbandry}}
{{See also|List of domesticated animals}}
[[File:Hog confinement barn interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Intensive animal farming|Intensively farmed]] pigs]]

Animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat, milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]]), and for work and transport.&lt;ref name=Clutton-Brock&gt;{{cite book |author=Clutton-Brock, Juliet |title=A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgL-EbbB8a0C&amp;pg=PR1 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-63495-3 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Working animal]]s, including horses, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[water buffalo]], [[camel]]s, llamas, alpacas, [[donkey]]s, and [[dog]]s, have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Falvey | first=John Lindsay | authorlink=Lindsay Falvey | year=1985 | title=Introduction to Working Animals | isbn=978-1-86252-992-2 | location=Melbourne, Australia | publisher=MPW Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless.&lt;ref name="FAO lps"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sere, C. |author2=Steinfeld, H. |author3=Groeneweld, J. |year=1995 |url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents|title=Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems – Current status issues and trends |publisher=U.N.

Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full |title=Livestock production: recent trends, future prospects |author=Thornton, Philip K. |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0134 |pmid=20713389 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |date=27 September 2010 |volume=365 |issue=1554 |pages=2853–2867 |doi-access=free |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002017/http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all|pmc=2935116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaculture]] or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html |title=Fish Farming's Growing Dangers |journal=Time |author=Stier, Ken |date=19 September 2007|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907071708/http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html |archivedate=7 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 20th century, producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock [[breed]]s and [[crossbreed]]s that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve [[genetic diversity]]. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A global view of livestock biodiversity and conservation – Globaldiv |author=Ajmone-Marsan, P. |journal=Animal Genetics |date=May 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02036.x |pmid=20500752 |volume=41 |issue=supplement S1 |pages=1–5 |url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148417 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803140941/https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148417 |archivedate=3 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Broiler house.jpg|thumb|Raising [[chicken]]s intensively for meat in a broiler house]]

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.&lt;ref name="FAO lps" /&gt;

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.&lt;ref name="FAO lps" /&gt; Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in [[confined animal feeding operations]], sometimes called [[factory farming]]. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt; Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [[growth hormone]]s, are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |title=Growth Promoting Hormones Pose Health Risk to Consumers, Confirms EU Scientific Committee |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=6 April 2013 |publisher=European Union |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502123053/http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production practices===
[[File:Fendt Tractor Ripping up Kulin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tillage|Tilling]] an arable field]]
{{see|Tillage|Crop rotation|Irrigation}}

Tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] to prepare for planting, for nutrient incorporation, or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.&lt;ref name="Soil"&gt;Brady, N. C.; Weil, R. R. 2002. Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCP Tillage"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. "Land Preparation and Farm Energy" pp. 318–338 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pest control includes the management of weeds, [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation, [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, intercropping, [[compost]]ing, avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.&lt;ref name="PCP Pest"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. "Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production" pp. 240–282 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nutrient management]] includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of manure produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, [[green manure]], compost and [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref name="PCP Soil"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. "Soil and Land" pp. 165–210 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a [[fallow]] period. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or [[Manure spreader|by spreading]] either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or [[pasture]]s.&lt;ref name="CS nutrient"&gt;Chrispeels, M. J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. "Nutrition from the Soil" pp. 187–218 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soil nutrient"&gt;Brady, N. C.; Weil, R. R. 2002. "Practical Nutrient Management" pp. 472–515 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PivotWithDrops.JPG|thumb|A [[center pivot irrigation]] system]]

[[Water management]] is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; Some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the [[Great Plains]] in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year.&lt;ref name="PCP Water"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. "Plants and Soil Water" pp. 211–239 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture represents 70% of freshwater use worldwide.&lt;ref name="Pimentel water"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pimentel, D. |author2=Berger, D. |author3=Filberto, D. |author4=Newton, M. |year=2004 |title=Water Resources: Agricultural and Environmental Issues |journal=BioScience |volume=54 |pages=909–918 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0909:WRAAEI]2.0.CO;2 |issue=10 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]], agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the International Food Policy Research Institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.&lt;ref name=ifpri&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/food-security-world-natural-resource-scarcity |author=International Food Policy Research Institute |title=Food Security in a World of Growing Natural Resource Scarcity |year=2014 |publisher=CropLife International |accessdate=1 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305043943/http://www.ifpri.org/publication/food-security-world-natural-resource-scarcity |archivedate=5 March 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Payment for ecosystem services]] is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment. Measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city, to improve the supply of fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tacconi | first1=L. | year=2012 | title=Redefining payments for environmental services | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=73 | issue=1| pages=29–36 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.09.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crop alteration and biotechnology==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}
[[File:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wheat]] cultivar tolerant of high [[salinity]] (left) compared with non-tolerant variety]]

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [[Gregor Mendel]]. His work on [[dominant allele|dominant]] and [[recessive allele]]s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, [[self-pollination]] and [[cross-pollination]], and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding|date=29 January 2004 |publisher=Colorado State University |accessdate=11 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121061931/http://cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |archivedate=21 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in [[New Zealand]]. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stadler |first=L.

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to sharply increase yield by creating "high-yielding varieties". For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the US have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruttan |first=Vernon W. |title=Biotechnology and Agriculture: A Skeptical Perspective |journal=AgBioForum |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–60 |date=December 1999 |url=http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521021149/http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassman |first=K. |title=Ecological intensification of cereal production systems: The Challenge of increasing crop yield potential and precision agriculture |journal=Proceedings of a National Academy of Sciences Colloquium, Irvine, California |date=5 December 1998 |url=http://www.lsc.psu.edu/nas/Speakers/Cassman%20manuscript.html |accessdate=11 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024001804/http://www.lsc.psu.edu/nas/Speakers/Cassman%20manuscript.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conversion note: 1 bushel of wheat=60&amp;nbsp;pounds (lb) ≈ 27.215&amp;nbsp;kg. 1 bushel of maize=56&amp;nbsp;pounds ≈ 25.401&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/index.html|title=20 Questions on Genetically Modified Foods |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=16 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327015739/http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/index.html |archivedate=27 March 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, GMO crops cause [[food safety]] and [[food labeling regulations|food labeling]] concerns.

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including [[glyphosate]]. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5031e/y5031e0i.htm |title=Benefits and risks of the use of herbicide-resistant crops |author1=Kathrine Hauge Madsen |author2=Jens Carl Streibig |publisher=FAO |accessdate=4 May 2013 |website=Weed Management for Developing Countries |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604013840/http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5031e/y5031e0i.htm |archivedate=4 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays.

===Effects and costs===
Agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature (especially herbicides and insecticides), nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, and loss of natural environment. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pretty |year=2000 |title=An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture |journal=Agricultural Systems |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=113–136 |doi=10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7 |first1=J. |display-authors=1 |last2=Brett |first2=C. |last3=Gee |first3=D. |last4=Hine |first4=R.

Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005 /&gt;

Agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs. Yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens, predators, and competitors (such as weeds). Costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units, such as making fields larger; this means removing [[hedge]]s, ditches and other areas of habitat. Pesticides kill insects, plants and fungi. These and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richards |first1=A. J. |title=Does Low Biodiversity Resulting from Modern Agricultural Practice Affect Crop Pollination and Yield? |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2001 |volume=88 |pages=165–172 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2001.146 |url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/880165.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2018 |doi-broken-date=2018-11-03&lt;!--odd case, it's printed in the article but doesn't work--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]] of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] assessed the environmental impacts of consumption and production. It found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. Agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment, including insecticides, especially those used on cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/PriorityProducts/tabid/56053/Default.aspx |title=Priority products and materials: assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production |author=International Resource Panel |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |year=2010 |accessdate=7 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224061455/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/PriorityProducts/tabid/56053/Default.aspx |archivedate=24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that "[a]gricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This includes GHGs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers agro-chemical pesticides and herbicides; (GHG emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs.&lt;ref name="unep.org"&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, https://www.unenvironment.org/search/node?keys=Towards+a+Green+Economy%3A+Pathways+to+Sustainable+Development+and+Poverty+Eradication&lt;/ref&gt; "On average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 (with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed, accounting for higher growth during early years, 48 per cent for 2011–2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020)."&lt;ref name="unep.org" /&gt;
===Livestock issues===
[[File:Biogas.jpg|thumb|Farmyard [[anaerobic digester]] converts waste plant material and manure from livestock into [[biogas]] fuel.]]

It is one of the largest sources of [[greenhouse gas]]es, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It produces 65% of human-related [[nitrous oxide]] (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt;) and 37% of all human-induced [[methane]] (which is 23 times as warming as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.) It also generates 64% of the [[ammonia]] emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving [[deforestation]]; in the Amazon basin 70% of [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|previously forested area]] is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.&lt;ref name="LEAD"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625012113/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |last1=Steinfeld |first1=H. |last2=Gerber |first2=P. |last3=Wassenaar |first3=T. |last4=Castel |first4=V. |last5=Rosales |first5=M. |last6=de Haan |first6=C. |year=2006 |publisher=U.N.

[[File:TerracesBuffers.JPG|thumb|upright|Terraces, [[conservation tillage]] and conservation buffers reduce [[soil erosion]] and [[water pollution]] on this farm in Iowa.]]

Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. There is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and [[ecosystem]] resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. A solution would be to give value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Boelee, E. |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/topics/ecosystems/ |title=Ecosystems for water and food security |year=2011 |publisher=IWMI/UNEP |accessdate=24 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523025920/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Topics/Ecosystems/ |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Molden, D. |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf |title=Opinion: The Water Deficit |publisher=''The Scientist'' |accessdate=23 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113125654/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of [[value added|value addition]] (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. [[Market concentration]] has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute [[economic surplus]] from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.&lt;ref name=Sexton2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sexton, R.

However, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the [[oilseed]]s, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.&lt;ref name=LloydCroserAnderson2013/&gt; Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/24/american-cotton-subsidies-illegal-obama-must-act |title=America's $24bn subsidy damages developing world cotton farmers |author=Kinnock, Glenys |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=16 April 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906122834/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/24/american-cotton-subsidies-illegal-obama-must-act |archivedate=6 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unprocessed commodities such as corn, soybeans, and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality, affecting the price the producer receives.

[[Agricultural science]] is a broad multidisciplinary field of [[biology]] that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social science]]s used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. It covers topics such as agronomy, plant breeding and genetics, [[plant pathology]], crop modelling, soil science, [[entomology]], production techniques and improvement, study of pests and their management, and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation, [[waste management]], and [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref name="Bosso 2015"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bosso | first=Thelma | title=Agricultural Science | publisher=Callisto Reference | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-63239-058-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boucher 2018"&gt;{{cite book | last=Boucher | first=Jude | title=Agricultural Science and Management | publisher=Callisto Reference  | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-63239-965-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of agriculture began in the 18th century, when [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]] conducted experiments on the use of [[gypsum]] (hydrated [[calcium sulphate]]) as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name="JB 1840"&gt;John Armstrong, Jesse Buel.

To which is Added, a Dissertation on the Kitchen and Garden.'' 1840. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Research became more systematic when in 1843, [[John Lawes]] and [[Henry Gilbert]] began a set of long-term agronomy field experiments at [[Rothamsted Research Station]] in England; some of them, such as the [[Park Grass Experiment]], are still running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Long Term Experiments|url=https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/long-term-experiments|publisher=Rothamsted Research|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Silvertown | first=Jonathan | last2=Poulton | first2=Paul | last3=Johnston | first3=Edward | last4=Edwards | first4=Grant | last5=Heard | first5=Matthew | last6=Biss | first6=Pamela M. | title=The Park Grass Experiment 1856-2006: its contribution to ecology | journal=Journal of Ecology | volume=94 | issue=4 | date=2006 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01145.x | pages=801–814}}&lt;/ref&gt; In America, the [[Hatch Act of 1887]] provided funding for what it was the first to call "agricultural science", driven by farmers' interest in fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;Hillison, J.

[[Agricultural policy]] is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), [[economic stability]] (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and [[environmental sustainability]] (especially [[water resource management|water policy]]), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |page=13 |title=Agricultural and food policy choices in Australia |journal=Sustainable Agriculture and Food Policy in the 21st Century: Challenges and Solutions |date=October 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2013 |author1=Hogan, Lindsay |author2=Morris, Paul |url=http://coserve.com.au/PDF/VirtualMeeting/ABARE-Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER-2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural policy can also touch on [[food quality]], ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/agriculture_en |title=Agriculture: Not Just Farming |publisher=European Union |accessdate=8 May 2018 |date=2016-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. [[Agribusiness]] interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of [[lobbying]] and [[campaign contribution]]s. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and [[labor union]]s, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20(9-10).htm |title=Corporatization of Agricultural Policy |author=Ikerd, John |journal=Small Farm Today Magazine |year=2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807024012/http://faculty.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20(9-10).htm |archivedate=7 August 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/22/food-firms-lobbying-samuel-jutzi |title=Corporate Lobbying Is Blocking Food Reforms, Senior UN Official Warns: Farming Summit Told of Delaying Tactics by Large Agribusiness and Food Producers on Decisions that Would Improve Human Health and the Environment |author=Jowit, Juliette |date=22 September 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5397">The '''business mileage reimbursement rate''' is an optional standard mileage rate used in the [[United States]] for purposes of computing the allowable business deduction, for [[Income tax in the United States|Federal income tax purposes]] under the [[Internal Revenue Code]], at {{usc|26|162}}, for the business use of a vehicle. Under the law, the taxpayer for each year is generally entitled to deduct either the actual expense amount, or an amount computed using the standard mileage rate, whichever is greater.

The business mileage reimbursement rate is also used by some employers for computing employee reimbursement amounts when an employee operates a motor vehicle not owned by the employer for the employer's business purposes. The [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) sets the rate for federal jobs. In general, the GSA rate matches the annual rate set by the IRS, although by law the government employee reimbursement rate cannot exceed the mileage rate set by the IRS for business deductions.&lt;ref&gt;''Travel and Subsistence Expenses; Mileage Allowances'', 5 U.S.C. 5704(a)(1), Available from: [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/uscode/index.html US Code Main Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130171856/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/uscode/index.html |date=January 30, 2009 }}, Government Printing Office; Accessed January 28, 2009. "In any year in which the Internal Revenue Service establishes a single standard mileage rate for optional use by taxpayers in computing the deductible costs of operating their automobiles for business purposes, the rate per mile established by the Administrator (of the GSA) shall not exceed the single standard mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service."&lt;/ref&gt;

Reimbursement by an employer on a per-mile basis is also used in other countries; it offers a similar simplification to payment of subsistence [[per diem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18113">The '''capitalist peace''', or '''capitalist peace theory''', posits that according to a given criterion for economic development ([[capitalism]]), developed economies have not engaged in war with each other, and rarely enter into low-level disputes. These theories have been proposed as an explanation for the [[democratic peace theory]] by accounting for both democracy and the peace among democratic nations. The exact nature of the causality depends upon both the proposed variable and the measure of the indicator for the concept used.

==History==
The philosophical roots of capitalist peace can be traced back to [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Norman Angell]], and [[Classical liberalism|classical economic theory]]. In his 1795 essay Perpetual Peace, Immanuel Kant argued, among other things, that "the spirit of commerce . . . sooner or later takes hold of every nation, and is incompatible with war."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1939 [1795]. Perpetual Peace. Translated and Edited by Nicholas Murray Butler. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century Norman Angell reasoned that trade interdependence in modern economies makes war unprofitable.&lt;ref&gt;Angell, Norman. 1913 [1911]. The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power to National Advantage. G.P. Putnam's Sons: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Joseph Schumpeter offered the observation that with the advancement of capitalism people form "an unwarlike disposition."&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph. 1955. Imperialism ; Social Classes : Two Essays. Translated by Heinz Norden. New York : Meridian Books. Pp. 66-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern capitalist peace emerged with the democratic peace. In one of the earliest systematic confirmations of the democratic peace,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A. Bremer, "Dangerous Dyads: Conditions Affecting the Likelihood of Interstate War, 1816-1965," ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', 36:309-41 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Bremer also examined the relationship between capitalism and war. He found capitalism to be a more powerful force for peace than democracy, yet the democratic peace accrued much more attention in the academic and policy literature. Today at least four theories of capitalist peace can be identified, with some of these theories claiming that a capitalist peace may subsume the democratic one, given that capitalism may be the cause of both democracy and peace.

==Definitions==
A key to explaining the capitalist peace rests on the indicative measures for capitalism. There are at least four different definitions of capitalism currently being employed. {{Citation Needed|reason=There's just so many claims here without any citation at all|date=June 2018}}

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
A number of models of the capitalist peace equate free markets with capitalism. In this usage, free markets and trade cause economic development, which in turn accounts for the peace among nations with advanced economies.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
A second understanding of capitalism is one that is conceptualized based on the intensity of market contracting in a society, where a capitalist economy is defined as one where most actors in the economy are integrated by contracting in the market. By definition contracts must be voluntary and undertaken without coercion.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;===
In the third measure for capitalism  inter-state trade is seen as an indicator for a developed, hence a capitalist economy. The level of trade interdependence, therefore, is the operationalized measure of this third type of capitalism.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;===
The final way that capitalism has been measured is with the size of government. States that have limited governments, hence large private sectors, are supposed to be capitalist economies. The size of government is used as an indicator for the level of capitalism a state has achieved.

==Explanations==
There are five primary theories that have attempted to explain the capitalist peace, each of which has used one of the above definitions of capitalism. Each theory has achieved varying levels of success and empirical corroboration, although they all rely on capitalism as the main explanatory variable for peace.

===Trade interdependence===
The interdependent trade explanation for the capitalist peace is built on the foundations of classical economic theory. This idea, which can be traced back to Kant, became the original theoretical explanation for the capitalist peace. In 1996, Erich Weede tied trade and free markets to development and peace, proposing that trade interdependence caused peace between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Weede, Economic Development, Social Order, and World Politics. Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Weede followed this up with what he called the "capitalist peace".&lt;ref&gt;Erich Weede, Balance of Power, Globalization and the Capitalist Peace, Potsdam: Liberal Verlag (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the empirical findings of the link between trade and development have been drawn into question, as one study found that the proportion of GDP to foreign trade is only 0.08, measured by logged GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003785074 | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | year = 2010 | title = Coming to Terms with the Capitalist Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 185–192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic norms theory===
Economic norms theory links the economic conditions of [[clientelism]], which prevail in many lower income societies, and a contract-intensive economy, which prevails in many higher income societies, with divergent political interests and habits.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mousseau, "The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace," ''International Security'', Vol. 33, No. 4 (Spring 2009), 52-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mousseau, "Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror," ''International Security'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Winter 2002-2003), 5-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic norms theory arose as an alternative explanation to the democratic peace, because it identified the causal relationship between democracy and peace as spurious. [[Michael Mousseau]] identified contract-intensive economies as a possible cause of both democracy and peace. The explanation is based on two aspects widely accepted in social science: (1) [[bounded rationality]]; and (2) divergent hierarchies between clientelism and contract-intensive economies. In contract-intensive societies, individuals have a loyalty towards the state that enforces the contracts between strangers. As a consequence, individuals in these societies expect that their states enforce contracts reliably and impartially, protect individual rights, and make efforts to enhance the general welfare. Moreover, with the assumption of bounded rationality, individuals routinely dependent on trusting strangers in contracts will develop the habits of trusting strangers and preferring universal rights, impartial law, and liberal democratic government. In contrast, individuals in contract-poor societies will develop the habits of abiding by the commands of group leaders, and distrusting those from out-groups.

According to economic norms theory, the people in contract-rich nations enjoy a permanent and positive peace. As long as their states accede to popular demands and remain reliably impartial, individuals in nations with contract intensive economies have an interest in everyone’s rights and material welfare, within and outside the nation. Consequently, contract-intensive nations not only avoid war with each other but engage in intense levels of mutual cooperation specifically aimed at promoting each other's material welfare. Leaders of nations with contract-poor economies, in contrast, pursue the interests of their dominant groups and have no interest in the security or welfare of members of out-groups, whether they are internal or external to the nation.

===Free capital markets/capital openness===
This theory, originally introduced by [[EriK Gartzke]], [[Quan Li (academic)|Quan Li]], and [[Charles Boehmer]],  argues that nations with a high level of capital openness are able to avoid conflict with each other and maintain a lasting peace. In particular, nations with freer capital markets are more dependent on international investors, because the investors are likely to withdraw if the country is engaged in a war or inter-state conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "The Capitalist Peace," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 51:166-191 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke and J. Joseph Hewitt, "International Crises and the Capitalist Peace," ''International Interactions'', 2010 (forthcoming)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, leaders of states give greater credibility to threats made by countries with higher levels of capital openness, causing the aforementioned countries to be more peaceful than others by avoiding the possibility of misrepresentation of information. One particular advantage of this theory is that it has been formalized, which helps ensure its internal consistency. The 2007 study performed by Gartzke claimed to make the democratic peace variable insignificant when capital openness was controlled for, but a later re-examination found this study to have several design errors.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dafoe, "Democracy Still Matters: The Risks of Sample Censoring and Cross-Sectional and Temporal Controls," (2009). Available at www.allandafoe.com/research.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Using measured logged GDP per capita, development correlates with openness to foreign capital at 0.14, slightly higher than trade.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, et al., "Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict," ''International Organization'', 55:391-438 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the most recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003784846 | author = Erik Gartzke and J. Joseph Hewitt | year = 2010 | title = International Crises and the Capitalist Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 115–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; failed to control for the variables of economic norms theory and the size of government explanation.

===Size of government===
The size of government explanation for the capitalist peace relies on the fourth definition of capitalism.  Introduced by [[Patrick J. McDonald]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. McDonald, "The Purse Strings of Peace," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 51:569-582 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003784911 | author = Patrick J. McDonald | year = 2010 | title = Capitalism, Commitment, and Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 146–168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea is that smaller governments are more dependent than larger or socialist governments on raising taxes for fighting wars. This makes the commitments of nations with smaller governments more credible than those with larger ones, allowing for nations with smaller governments, and thus "capitalist" economies, to be better positioned for avoiding conflicts.

===Ruling others by force===
This theory, adduces that if men want to oppose war, it is [[statism]] that they must oppose. So long as they hold the tribal notion that the individual is sacrificial fodder for the collective, that some men have the right to rule others by force, and that some (any) alleged "good" can justify it—there can be no peace within a nation and no peace among nations.&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand (1966). "The Roots of War," [[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
==Golden arches theory==

In [[Thomas L. Friedman]]'s 1999 book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas. (2000) ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree''. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; the following observation was presented: "No two countries that both had McDonald's had fought a war against each other since each got its McDonald's". He supported that observation, as a theory, by stating that when a country has reached an [[economic development]] where it has a [[middle class]] strong enough to support a McDonald's network, it would become a "McDonald's country", and will not be interested in fighting wars anymore.

Shortly after the book was published, [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombed Yugoslavia]]. On the first day of the bombing, McDonald's restaurants in [[Belgrade]] were demolished by angry protesters and were rebuilt only after the bombing ended. In the 2000 edition of the book, Friedman argued that this exception proved the rule: the war ended quickly, he argued, partly because the Serbian population did not want to lose their place in a global system "symbolised by McDonald's" (Friedman 2000: 252&amp;ndash;253).

Critics have pointed to two other conflicts fought before 2000 as counterexamples, depending on what one considers "a war":

* The 1989 [[United States invasion of Panama]]
* In 1999, India and Pakistan fought a war over [[Kashmir]], known as the [[Kargil War]]. Both countries had (and continue to have) McDonald's restaurants. Although the war was not fought in all possible theatres (such as Rajasthan and Punjab borders), both countries mobilised their military all along their common borders and both countries made threats involving their nuclear capabilities.

In 2005, Friedman said that he framed this theory in terms of McDonald's [[Golden Arches]] "with [[tongue in cheek|tongue slightly in cheek]]".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas. (2005) [[The Guardian]], 21 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2005 book ''[[The World is Flat]]'' he offered an updated theory he labelled the [[Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention]].

Since 2005, there have been three more conflicts cited as counterexamples:

* The 2006 war between [[Israel]] and [[Lebanon]], following hostilities ongoing since 1973, with [[South Lebanon]] occupied until May 2000. (McDonald's franchises were established in Israel and Lebanon in 1993 and 1998, respectively.) However, the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] were not a party to the fighting, the Israel Defense Forces action being taken instead against the paramilitary group [[Hezbollah]].
* The [[2008 South Ossetia war]] between [[Russia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Both countries had McDonald's at the time (restaurants began in the two countries in 1990 and 1999, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/08/russia-georgia-and-ir-theory-part-i.html Russia, Georgia, and IR Theory: Part 1], ''Lawyers, Guns, and Money'' (featuring photos of McDonald's in both countries)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[2014 Crimean crisis]] between Russia and [[Ukraine]]. Both countries had McDonald's at the time.

Friedman's point is that due to [[globalization]], countries that have made strong economic ties with one another have too much to lose to ever go to war with one another. Regardless of whether the statement is true, the conclusions to be drawn are unclear. The global expansion of McDonald's restaurants is a relatively recent phenomenon when put into the context of the [[history of warfare]], and, with a few notable exceptions, has proceeded into relatively stable markets.

==Dell theory==

The '''Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention''', also known as simply the '''Dell Theory''', has been presented by [[Thomas Friedman]] in his book ''[[The World Is Flat]]''. This theory is an updated version of his previous "[[Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention]]".

:"The Dell Theory stipulates: No two countries that are both part of a major global supply chain, like [[Dell]]’s, will ever fight a war against each other as long as they are both part of the same global supply chain."&lt;ref name="Friedman, 421"&gt;''The World is Flat'' ({{ISBN|1-59397-668-2}}), Thomas L. Friedman, pg 421&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, as long as corporations have major [[supply chain]] operations in countries other than that corporation's home country, those countries will never engage in armed conflicts.  This is due to the economic interdependence between nations that arises from a large corporation (such as [[Dell]]) having supply chain operations in multiple global locations and the reluctance of developing nations (in which supply chain operations commonly take place) to give up their newfound wealth.

In his previous book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'', Friedman argued that no two nations with a [[McDonald's]] franchise had ever gone to war with one another: this was known as the [[Golden Arches theory]].  Later, Friedman upgraded that theory into the "Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention" by saying that people or nations don't just want to have a better standard of living as symbolized by McDonald's franchise in their downtown, but want to have the lump of the labour sector that is created by [[globalization]]. That is, developing nations do not want to risk the trust of the multi-national companies who venture into their markets and include them in the global supply chain.

[[Thomas Friedman]] also warns in his book ''[[The World Is Flat]]'' that the Dell Theory should not be interpreted as a guarantee that nations who are deeply involved in global supply chains will not go to war with each other. It rather means that the governments of these nations and their citizens will have very heavy economic costs to consider as they contemplate the possibility of war. These costs include the long-term loss of the country's profitable participation in the global supply chain.

This theory relates with how conflict prevention occurred between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in their [[2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff|2001 - 2002 nuclear standoff]], where India was at risk of losing its global partners. The relationship between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] was also cited as an example of this theory - they both have strong supply relations with each other and a war between the two seems very unlikely today.

'''Chartered Accountants' Hall''' is a [[Listed building#Categories of listed buildings | Grade II* listed building]] located at 1 Moorgate Place in the [[City of London]]. It is the headquarters of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp;amp; Wales]] (ICAEW). The Hall is one of the richest examples of late [[Victorian architecture]] in the City and has been praised for its seamless integration of sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Simon |last2=Pevsner |first2=Nikolaus |title=London 1: The City of London |date=2002 |publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press |isbn=9780300096248 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It established the fame of its architect, [[John Belcher (architect)|John Belcher]]. Chartered Accountants’ Hall was Belcher's first building in a more monumental [[Baroque Revival]] style, drawing on Baroque architecture which he had studied while travelling in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pile |first1=Liz |title=Chartered Accountants' Hall - Analysis - A building of distinction |url=https://www.accountancydaily.co/chartered-accountants-hall-analysis-building-distinction |website=Accountancy Daily |publisher=Croner-i |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The two men were friends and admired each other's work. A pupil of Belcher's at the time claimed that Pite's energy and personality had 'very strongly' influenced Belcher and had left its impression above all on the Chartered Accountants building.&lt;ref&gt;RIBA Journal (1914), v21 (3rd series), p. 78, cited in Hanson, Brian, "Beresford Pite", Architects Journal, 1 May 1991, vol.193, no.18, MBC Architectural Press, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In ‘The Alliance of Sculpture and Architecture’ (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Friedman |first1=Terry |last2=Linstrum |first2=Derek |last3=Read |first3=Benedict |last4=Rooke |first4=Dark |last5=Upton |first5=Helen |title=The Alliance of Sculpture and Architecture: Hamo Thornycroft, John Belcher and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales |date=1993 |publisher=The Henry Moore Centre for the Study of Sculpture &amp; Leeds City Art Galleries |isbn=0901981559 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors begin a discussion of the influence of Pite upon Belcher's new Baroque style for the Hall by stating: {{Quote |text="To what extent the design was the work of Arthur Beresford Pite [...] has never been satisfactorily established." |title=The Alliance of Sculpture and Architecture: Hamo Thornycroft, John Belcher and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales |}}. 

==Construction==

Between 1880 and 1890, ICAEW was based in 3 Copthall Buildings while a location was sought for a permanent headquarters. During a special meeting in 1888, [[William Welch Deloitte|William Deloitte]] put forward a motion to purchase the site at Moorgate Place on a 999 year lease at a ground rent of £900 per annum. The competition for designs was won by John Belcher, with an estimated cost of £17,250. The ICAEW Council also commissioned [[Hamo Thornycroft]] to produce a sculpted frieze at an additional cost of £3,000.

Construction was delayed as the original contractors went into receivership, the work being completed by Messrs Coll &amp; Sons. In the event, the terms of the lease were altered to £472 for twenty years increasing to £786 thereafter, in return for part of the site being given up to expand Great Swan Alley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howitt |first1=Harold |title=The History of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales 1880-1965 and of its Founder  Accountancy Bodies 1870-1880: The Growth of a Profession and its Influence on Legislation and Public Affairs |date=1966 |publisher=London: Heinemann |pages=30-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation stone of Chartered Accountants’ Hall was laid in July 1890. Under the stone were placed current issues of [[The Times]] and [[The Accountant (magazine) | The Accountant]], a copy of the Institute’s [[Royal charter | Charter]] and Bye-Laws, a list of members, and examples of the copper and silver (though not gold) coins of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boys |first1=Peter |title=Chartered Accountants’ Hall: the First Hundred Years |date=1990 |publisher=ICAEW |location=London |isbn=1853550981 |pages=12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hall was formally opened in 10 May 1893 by the Institute President, [[Edwin Waterhouse]]. It originally provided 19,500 square feet of accommodation. The final cost came to £41,561 3s 0d, including heating, lighting, ground rents and the architect’s commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boys |first1=Peter |title=Chartered Accountants’ Hall: the First Hundred Years |date=1990 |publisher=ICAEW |location=London |isbn=1853550981 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
[[File:Venice bridge in Accountants' Hall (6162647534).jpg|thumb|The former library of the hall, now a members' room, includes a balustraded Venetian-style bridge, decorated with lanterns]]
The building has been described as “one of the few Victorian buildings in the City with interiors worthy of its ornate facades.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Simon |last2=Pevsner |first2=Nikolaus |title=London 1: The City of London |date=2002 |publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press |isbn=9780300096248 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It features a pilastered entrance hall with coffered ceiling after [[Galeazzo Alessi | Alessi’s]] Palazzo Cambiaso in Genoa. The substantial library (now the members’ room) has a gallery and balustraded bridge inspired by the [[Rialto Bridge]] in Venice. It is believed to be the only example of an indoor bridge in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chartered Accountants' Hall: Inside a piece of history |journal=Vital |date=October 2010 |issue=46 |pages=20-21 |url=https://www.icaew.com/-/media/corporate/files/learning-and-development/aca/aca-students/support-and-services/vital-articles/chartered-accountants-hall-inside-a-piece-of-history.ashx |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staircase originally featured stained glass windows by [[Henry Holiday]], completed in 1898&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lot 876: Henry Holiday , a set of four stained glass windows |url=https://www.invaluable.co.uk/auction-lot/henry-holiday-a-set-of-four-stained-glass-windo-876-c-fe4202114e |website=Invaluable |publisher=Invaluable, LLC |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These were re-installed in 2017, a year ahead of the 125th anniversary of the building’s opening, and are now positioned in the entrance to the Great Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Nick |title=From the top: Nick Parker - see last paragraph, 'Stained glass windows come home' |url=https://economia.icaew.com/opinion/december-2017/from-the-top-nick-parker |website=Economia |publisher=ICAEW |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holiday's original 1897 watercolour designs for the windows are housed in the Prints, Drawings &amp; Paintings collection of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design for window in the Institute of Chartered Accountants |url=http://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=&amp;extrasearch=&amp;q=Design+for+window+in+the+Institute+of+Chartered+Accountants&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=0&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch |website=V&amp;A |publisher=V&amp;A |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The council chamber (now the reception room) has a high domed ceiling and elaborate wall-paintings by George Murray to Belcher’s designs, representing the Triumph of the Law and Science bringing Order to Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Simon |last2=Pevsner |first2=Nikolaus |title=London 1: The City of London |date=2002 |publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press |isbn=9780300096248 |page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frieze==
Thornycroft’s frieze depicts groups of figures representing Arts, Sciences, Crafts, Education, Commerce, Manufacture, Agriculture, Mining, Railways, Shipping, India, the Colonies, and Building. The figure of the architect is based on Belcher and the sculptor on Thornycroft himself. The figure of the solicitor is H. Markby of Markby, Stewart &amp; Co., who acted for ICAEW in its early years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howitt |first1=Harold |title=The History of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales 1880-1965 and of its founder Accountancy Bodies 1870-1880: The Growth of a Profession and its Influence on Legislation and Public Affairs |date=1966 |publisher=Heinemann |location=London |pages=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the Hall was expanded in 1930 the frieze was continued for another 50 feet by J.A. Stevenson on the theme of the history of building. This is represented by British, Italian, Gothic, Byzantine, Roman, Greek, Assyrian, Egyptian and Prehistoric figures. 

For the Whitfield extension in the 1960s, [[David McFall]] completed three final panels. These depict Egyptians and the foundation of accounting, 19th century men as the founding fathers of ICAEW, and four Renaissance figures including [[Luca Pacioli]], the first person to publish a work on double-entry bookkeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boys |first1=Peter |title=Chartered Accountants’ Hall: the First Hundred Years |date=1990 |publisher=ICAEW |location=London |isbn=1853550981 |page=37-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First extension==
As ICAEW expanded after the First World War it became necessary to extend the original building. In 1926 the Institute purchased Swan House on the adjoining land. [[John James Joass | J.J. Joass]], a pupil of Belcher’s, was commissioned to extend the building eastwards and provide an additional 5,000 square feet for meeting rooms and offices. The final cost of the extension came to £35,976 9s. 6d. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boys |first1=Peter |title=Chartered Accountants’ Hall: the First Hundred Years |date=1990 |publisher=ICAEW |location=London |isbn=1853550981 |page=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second extension==
In 1957 the [[Society of Incorporated Accountants]] was integrated into the national bodies of accountants, boosting the Institute’s membership by 10,000. [[William Whitfield (architect) | William Whitfield]] was commissioned in 1959 to report on the feasibility of a new building. It was decided to extend the existing building substantially and create a Great Hall to accommodate functions, large meetings and other events. Final designs were accepted in 1964 and the new headquarters was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother |HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] in May 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boys |first1=Peter |title=Chartered Accountants’ Hall: the First Hundred Years |date=1990 |publisher=ICAEW |location=London |isbn=1853550981 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually for a space of this size, Whitfield’s Great Hall is uninterrupted by any supporting columns. Instead the office floors above are supported by exterior concrete piers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Simon |last2=Pevsner |first2=Nikolaus |title=London 1: The City of London |date=2002 |publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press |isbn=9780300096248 |page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rough plaster relief finish that covers the walls is by Cathy Ward and is known as ‘Elephant Trunking’ as it was first used on the Elephant House at [[London Zoo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chartered Accountants' Hall |url=https://openhouselondon.open-city.org.uk/listings/2842 |website=Open House London |publisher=Open City |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Of the building as a whole, [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] noted that: ”here is proof, if proof were needed, that the uncompromisingly new can go with the old, if handled by an appreciative and imaginative architect.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Simon |last2=Pevsner |first2=Nikolaus |title=London 1: The City of London |date=2002 |publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press |isbn=9780300096248 |page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;The two extensions - Joass's complementary extension juxtaposed with Whitfield's [[Brutalist architecture | Brutalist]] bush-hammered concrete - help contribute to Chartered Accountants' Hall being designated a Grade II* listed building. The extension was awarded a Certificate of Commendation by [[The Concrete Society]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chartered Accountants' Hall, One Moorgate Place |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1064586 |website=Historic England |publisher=Historic England |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The total cost of the new building came to almost £2.5 million and added 63,000 square feet of space. The improvements included a new set of offices for the library and a members’ restaurant. It was at this point that the council chamber became the reception room, the old library became the members’ room, and the Oak Hall was divided horizontally into a new council chamber and a set of interview rooms.

==Ornaments and furnishings==
ICAEW possesses numerous antique furnishings and works of art gifted by individuals or accountancy bodies, including several given to celebrate the centenary in 1980.

The walls of the Hall feature portraits of the ICAEW’s first presidents, including [[William Barclay Peat]] and [[William Welch Deloitte]]. A tapestry by [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], depicting modern innovations such as a jet engine, a micro chip and a television,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chartered Accountants' Hall: Inside a piece of history |journal=Vital |date=October 2010 |issue=46 |pages=20-21 |url=https://www.icaew.com/-/media/corporate/files/learning-and-development/aca/aca-students/support-and-services/vital-articles/chartered-accountants-hall-inside-a-piece-of-history.ashx |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; hangs in the eastern entrance. The Hall owns a set of silverware by [[Gerald Benney]] and paintings by [[John Piper (artist) | John Piper]]. The library’s rare book collection holds early works on accounting and bookkeeping, including the complete published works of [[Luca Pacioli]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howitt |first1=Harold |title=The History of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales 1880-1965 and of its founder Accountancy Bodies 1870-1880: The Growth of a Profession and its Influence on Legislation and Public Affairs |date=1966 |publisher=Heinemann |location=London |pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the only complete copy of the oldest surviving original book on accounting in English (James Peele’s ‘The maner and fourme how to kepe a perfecte reconying’)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turning the Pages: ICAEW's collection of rare books |url=https://www.icaew.com/archive/technical/practice-resources/icaew-practice-support/practicewire/news/turning-the-pages |website=ICAEW.com |publisher=ICAEW |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Facilities==
In addition to functioning as ICAEW’s administrative headquarters, Chartered Accountants’ Hall offers business and social facilities to its members and the general public. These include a café, a members’ club, a lending library and a business centre.

'''Constraints accounting''' (CA) allow some variations generally accepted accounting principles(GAAP) when reporting financial statements of company and these variations do not violate the GAAP in light of recognised CA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management Dynamics: Merging Constraints Accounting to Drive Improvement|last = Caspari, J A.|first = Caspari, P.|publisher = John Wiley&amp;Sons,Inc.|year = 2004|isbn = 0-47167231-9|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; CA contains explicit consideration of the role of [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s in accounting and constraints relate to limitations when providing financial information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Accounting information and managerial work|last = Hall, M.|publisher = |year = 2010|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The definition of a constraint is a regulation which belongs to prescribed bounds &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://wsfcs.k12.nc.us/cms/lib/NC01001395/Centricity/Domain/593/1.01%20GAAP%20PowerPoint%203.pptx&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdtJY9MJcxRVzltPBjfEc5chbx-g|title = Generally Accepted Accounting Principles – Accounting Constraints, Concepts, Assumptions, and Principles|date = |accessdate = November 1, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are four main types of constraints which are the ''cost-benefit relationship, materiality, industry practices, and conservatism'',&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://info_12066263_constraints-accounting.html|title = What are the Constraints of Accounting?|date = |accessdate = Oct 18, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Way, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these constraints are also accounting guidelines which border the hierarchy of qualitative information.

==Types of Constraints==

=== Cost-benefit Relationship ===
The [[cost-benefit]] relationship constraint is also called cost effectiveness constraints and is pervasive throughout the framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intermediate Accounting|author1=Kieso, D E. |author2=Weygantdt, J J. |author3=Warfield, T D. |publisher = WILEY|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The companies need to spend money and time in the process of providing financial statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Financial Accounting|author1=Dauberies, H. |author2=Annand, D |publisher = |year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-9936701-2-1|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be more specific, Costs can constraint the range of information when providing financial reporting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/SectionPage&amp;cid=1351027336339|title = Cost - Benefit Analysis|date = |accessdate = Oct 18, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = FASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the companies must "collect, process, analyze and disseminate relevant information"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which need time and money. For investors, they want to know all financial information if possible in ideal condition, which may cause tremendous financial burden in the corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-principles/cost-benefit-principle|title = Cost and Benefit Principles|date = |accessdate = Oct 20, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some financial information may not valuable for external users to acquire a huge benefit, for example, how much money do a company spend for its greening of headquarters. Therefore, when deciding the components of financial reporting, companies need to measure  the sense of particular financial information and the expenditure of providing particular information and the benefits they can acquire from this particular information.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Properly speaking, If the costs in particular information exceed the benefit they can acquire, companies may choose to not disclose this particular information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Accounting Principles: A Business Perspective, Financial Accounting|last = Hermanson, Edwards, and Maher|publisher = |year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, If there is $0.1 difference between checkbook register and [[bank statement]], accountant should ignore the $0.1 rather than waste time and money to find the $0.1.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===  Materiality ===
Companies need to consider [[Materiality (auditing)|materiality]] when providing financial information.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Accounting|last = Leiwy, D.|publisher = |year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, companies must disclose the material information which can influence the financial performance and some immaterial  information can be excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Application of Principles Accounting and Financial Reporting To Public Telecommunications Entities|last = Corporation for Public Broadcasting|publisher = |year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company owns $10 million net assets and therefore a default of customer with $1000 is immateriality and in contrast if the amount of default is $2 million, which can influence the financial decisions and thus means material. However, there are also some small items which can transfer net profit to net loss and these item can be considered as material items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.accountingtools.com/materiality-principle|title = The Materiality Principle|date = |accessdate = Oct 20, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to judge whether the information is material or not, companies can based on the following materiality process:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Essentials of Materiality Assessment|last = KPMG|publisher = |year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Define purpose and scope ====
Expected:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* Take external stakeholder engagement into consideration:  the impact and valuable feedbacks you can acquire from stakeholder;
Advanced:

* Classify the potential materiality themes into Categorise such as group,country etc.;
* Check whether the topics are on the same level or not;
* Align topics name based on the policies and strategies of your organisation;
* Each employees involved in this process need to understand the specific risks and opportunities;
Advanced:
* Connect each material topic with relevant external changes;
* Consider how material topics can influence each other or overlap;

==== Gather information about the impact and importance of topics ====
Excepted:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Research every materiality theme and find the correlations between topics and business in terms of social, economic and environmental impacts;
* Gather information about each material topics which can be used to prioritise the topics in next phase;
Advanced:
* Utilise Methodology such as KPMG True Value to quantify social, economic and environmental impacts;

==== Prioritise ====
Expected:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Prioritise material topics by:
** Identifying relevant business functions and choosing which internal stakeholders need to be joined in prioritising topics. 
** Utilising the methodology developed in phase 4 to ‘score’ each topic. 
** "Setting a threshold or cut-off point for de ning which topics will be considered material."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
						
Advanced:
* Connect with enterprise risk management function;

Expected:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Identify which kind of stakeholders need to review the material topics and evaluate the outcomes;
* Acquired feedbacks form stakeholders;
Advanced:
* Connect the results of materiality assessment with company strategies and operations;

=== Industry Practices ===
Industry Practices is a less dominated constraint compared with cost and relationships and materiality in financial reporting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This constraints means in some industries, it is hard and costly to calculate the production costs and therefore companies in these particular industries choose to only report the current market prices instead of production costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-principles/industry-practices-constraint|title = Industry Practices Constraint|date = |accessdate = Oct 18, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in agriculture industry, calculating cost per crop is difficult and expensive and hence they choose to report the price in the current market which is easier for farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-principles/industry-practices-constraint|title = Industry Practice Constraints|date = |accessdate = Oct 19, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = My Accounting Course}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservatism ===
Accountants estimate the transactions and then choose to whether record the transactions or not based on their own judgement. In terms of that, conservatism is helpful for accountants to make a choice between two similarly alternatives and it makes accountants choose to record the less optimistic choice.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  For example, If there is possible that customers will sue the company and they may also not to sue the company. In this case, accountants need to disclose this situation to investors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Moreover, the Conservatism is also a less dominated constraint, which means firms also need to consider more about bad news than good news when reporting financial statements.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url =|title = JOURNAL OF Accounting &amp; Economics|last = Basu,S.|date = 1997|journal = The conservatism principle and the asymmetric timeliness of earnings|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, firms need to choose the method that " least likely overstates assets and income or understates liabilities and losses"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; when encountering accounting issues. For example, if the staff believe there will be 2% bad debt in terms of receivables  based on historical information and another staff believe there will be 5% because of sudden drop, the company need to use the 5% figure when providing financial statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.accountingtools.com/conservatism-principle|title = The Conservatism Principle|date = |accessdate = Oct 20, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Goldie''' (1842 – 8 June 1926) was the [[Mayor of Auckland City]] from 1898 to 1901 and a [[Member of Parliament]] in New Zealand.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], in 1842, Goldie emigrated to New Zealand in 1863.&lt;ref name="NZH obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19260609.2.101 | title=A life of service | date=9 June 1926 | work=New Zealand Herald | accessdate=1 November 2014 | page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.archives.tas.gov.au/menu.aspx?detail=1&amp;type=P&amp;id=141152 |title=Goldie, David |date=December 2011 |website= |publisher=Tasmanian Government |accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a prominent timber merchant, and a strict Primitive Methodist who resigned as Mayor of Auckland rather than toast the visiting [[George V|Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York]] with alcohol. He was replaced as mayor for the jubilee year by the ''Father of Auckland'', Sir [[John Logan Campbell (politician)|John Logan Campbell]].

He was the father of artist [[C. F. Goldie]].

Goldie contested the [[Auckland West]] electorate in a [[Auckland West by-election, 1879|by-election on 4 March 1879]]. The by-election was caused by the resignation of [[Patrick Dignan]], who also stood in this contest. Dignan and Goldie received 261 and 776 votes, respectively, and with a majority of 515 votes, Goldie was declared elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auckland|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP18790305.2.16.4|accessdate=20 September 2011|newspaper=Evening Post|volume=XVII |issue=360 |date=5 March 1879|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served until the dissolution of parliament on 15 August of that year.&lt;ref name=Scholefield&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17381">'''Demarketing''' may be considered “unselling” or “marketing in reverse”, which includes general and selective demarketing.&lt;ref name="Kotler1" /&gt;

Although the concept of demarketing lacks a precise theoretical definition, it refers to an attempt by the firm to discourage all or some of its customers from making purchases either temporarily or permanently. Since the initial interests in the subject area of how to market strategically in times of shortages began, different viewpoints have been offered as to how the firm should pursue demarketing.&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Q. Dadzie, Georgia State University, Demarketing strategy in shortage marketing environment,JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE · FEBRUARY 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of Demarketing==
While there are many definitions of demarketing—the common thread is the intent to decrease demand.

Businessdictionary.com defines demarketing as: Efforts aimed at discouraging (not destroying) the demand for a product which (1) a firm cannot supply in large-enough quantities, or (2) does not want to supply in a certain region where the high costs of distribution or promotion allow only a too little profit margin. Common demarketing strategies include higher prices, scaled-down advertising, and product redesign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/demarketing.html#ixzz3n5fazLTm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Websters dictionary, demarketing is “The use of advertising to decrease demand for a product that is in short supply.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demarketing&lt;/ref&gt;

A few other definitions include one from [http://dictionaryreference.com DictionaryReference.com]: “Advertising that urges the public to limit the consumption of a product, as at a time of shortage.”&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demarketing&lt;/ref&gt;

The All Business dictionary defines demarketing as: Marketers attempt to reduce the demand for a product when the demand for the product is greater than the manufacturer’s ability to produce it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary-demarketing-4966214-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While demarketing may seem relatively new, it has in fact been around for decades.
In 1971 Phillip Kotler and Sidney Levy introduced the expression “demarketing” in a Harvard Business Review article titled “Demarketing, Yes, Demarketing.”&lt;ref name="Kotler2"/&gt;

Later in 1973, another article appeared in the [[Journal of Marketing]] by Phillip Kotler.  Here, Dr. Kotler elaborated on the “current demand level” and the “desired demand level” in the context of marketing. There is “underdemand, adequate demand, and overdemand.” Each demand situation requires different marketing approaches and corresponding tasks. Specifically, where there is overdemand, the marketing task is to reduce demand by “demarketing.” While demarketing reduces the demand without impugning the product, “countermarketing” seeks to destroy the demand for a product that is “unwholesome” on its face, such as “vice” products. Kotler also used the term “unsell” which “may also be viewed as an effort to sell something else.” Ahead of his time, Kotler observed “unselling (or demarketing) has as much social justification in a democracy as does selling.”&lt;ref name="Kotler1" /&gt;

Kotler also seemed to have anticipated the rise of “[[behavioral economics]]” when he observed in 1973 that “Efforts to turn off demand can profitably draw on certain concepts and theories in psychology” specifically, deconditioning, habit extinction theory, and learning and reinforcement theory.&lt;ref name="Kotler1" /&gt;

In 2011, Dr. Kotler teamed up with R. Craig Lefebvre to write Design Thinking, Demarketing and Behavioral Economics: Fostering Interdisciplinary Growth in Social Marketing. “As the growing number of governments, businesses and private funding sources focus on conditions of consumer excess, we see the social marketing paradigm expanding to accommodate this cultural shift to an Age of Demarketing.”&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1" /&gt;

==Reasons for Demarketing==
According to Lefebvre and Kotler (2011) “Demarketing can be viewed as blending all 4Ps of the [[marketing mix]] and also aiming for policy changes to nudge and sustain healthier and more socially responsible behavioral choices… (and) deeper understanding of the people we wish to serve, the environments in which they make choices, the market research we conduct and the programs we implement.”&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1" /&gt;

Mikl ́os-Thal and Juanjuan (2011) proposed that sellers use demarketing to strategically manage buyers’ quality perceptions. They observed that consistent with ostensible demarketing, Cialdini (1985) suggests a psychological tendency for humans to want things that are less available. Amaldoss and Jain (2005) show that limited availability satisfies consumers’ need for uniqueness, and Stock and Balachander (2005) demonstrate that scarcity can signal high quality.&lt;ref&gt;Mikl ́os-Thal, J. and Zhang Juanjuan (2011). Strategic Demarketing. University of California, San Diego, Faculty Seminars.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the invent of demarketing in the 1970s, many different strategies for implementing demarketing have evolved.  Traditionally in marketing - which seeks to grow the consumer base and increase the demand for a product or service - the [[4 p's|4 P’s]] are [[Product (business)|product]], price, place/distribution and promotion.  The logic then follows that demarketing would adapt this structure to serve the opposite purpose of reducing the consumer base and discouraging demand for a product and service.  Instead of increasing availability of a product or service, a demarketing strategy would be to actually restrict availability.  Furthermore, demarketing would seek to increase availability of the alternatives and highlight the downside of the product or service, therefore making it less attractive to consumers.  To demarket in the pricing arena, the taxes or price might increase with the purpose of shrinking the demand.  Advertising can be minimized or eliminated.  The placement of a product/service or the size of the consumption space can be strategically changed to reduce the likelihood of consumption.  Another strategy would be to promote behavior that does not require the product or service being demarketed.&lt;ref&gt;Shiu, E. L. (2009). Demarketing tobacco through governmental policies – The 4Ps revisited. Journal of Business Research, 62, 269-278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demarketing strategies may differ when being used by a [[private firm]] versus a government entity.  Social marketing strategies have been widely implemented to demarket products or services that are perceived to be harmful or costly to society.  Traditional marketing principles also apply to [[social marketing]], which is used to advance or depress a social idea, cause or behavior.  Instead of talking about products, social marketing makes a proposition.  Instead of discussing placement of a service or product, it deals with accessibility to those services or products.  In place of promotion social marketing uses social communication to spread ideas.  Rather than price, the costs of involvement are highlighted by social marketing in ways that support their marketing or demarketing message.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie, K. P. (2009). Social marketing: A pathway to consumption reduction? Journal of Business Research, 62, 260-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demarketing activities discourage [[demand]]. This stands in sharp contrast to the objectives of marketing: create utility and enhance exchanges. In their provocative article "Demarketing, Yes, Demarketing," Kotler and Levy (1971) distinguish three types of demarketing situations.

===General demarketing===
General demarketing occurs when a seller shrinks the level of total demand. Suppliers of electricity and water use advertisements and publicity campaigns during periods of excess demand.&lt;ref name="Kotler2" /&gt;

===Selective demarketing===
Selective demarketing occurs when a company discourages demand from certain classes of consumers. Adult communities demarket properties to families with children, and producers of goods with a snob appeal avoid low-image retailers.&lt;ref name="Kotler2" /&gt;

===Ostensible demarketing===
Ostensible demarketing occurs when a seller creates an artificial or perceived shortage to whet consumer appetites. Limited distribution of goods may induce consumers to stockpile these “hard-to-get" items.&lt;ref name="Kotler2" /&gt;

Although Kotler and Levy (1971) emphasized the need for careful research into these phenomena, little effort has been devoted to the formal study of demarketing by marketers. This is not surprising, as marketers are trained to build demand rather than destroy it.

==Strategies==

===Price discriminating demarketing=== 
Salop (1977), Chiang and Spatt (1982), Narasimhan (1984), and Gerstner and Holthausen (1986) have shown that price discriminating firms may create transaction costs deliberately to discourage consumers from seeking the lowest price. Busy consumers pay higher prices, whereas those with small transaction costs pay lower prices. For example, some retailers hold "3-hour sales" from 8 to 11 Saturday morning. Consumers who get to the store before 11:00 am pay lower prices but incur the inconvenience of early morning shopping. Busy consumers who want a time-convenient product may pay a higher price for that product, so a firm may make the more convenient product more expensive.

===Bait and switch demarketing=== 
The bait-and-switch demarketing strategy is when a firm advertises one product in such a way that the intention is not that the consumers buy that product, but that they buy a more profitable product in its place. Gerstner and Hess (1990) and Chu, Gerstner and Hess (1992) studied disparagement of products in sales presentations or in point of-purchase displays that are designed to discourage consumers from buying featured brands. These practices, however, might be illegal.

===Stock outage demarketing===
Another known demarketing strategy is stock outage demarketing, where a firm actually plans a stock outage. Stock outages frustrate consumers, but stores often offer rain checks that guarantee delivery at a future date. Nevertheless, Hess and Gerstner (1987) showed that stores might profit from planned stock outages with rain checks because customers may visit the stores twice and buy complementary products on each visit. Balachander and Farquhar (1991) showed that deliberate stock outages help stores charge higher prices and earn higher profits. The possibility of a stock outage in one store makes customers more eager to buy when the other store has the product in stock.

===Crowding costs demarketing===
Crowding cost demarketing is a strategy implemented on “Black Friday” when crowds will deter many consumers from purchasing a product at a lower price.&lt;ref name="Gerstner" /&gt; Retail stores, hotels, and airlines have limited capacities. A low price usually attracts large numbers of shoppers, so customers must hunt for space in crowded parking lots and stand in long checkout lines. Businesses may deliberately accept capacity constraints, recognizing that some customers would trade the higher prices for reduced crowding. Gerstner (1986) derived symmetric equilibrium prices and crowding costs in such markets.

===Differentiation Demarketing=== 
On the other hand, there has been growing scholarly interest in issues that can be construed as demarketing. There are numerous specific strategies for demarketing that would fall within the 4 P’s definitions, although the demarketing terminology is not used. Eitan Gerstner, James Hess and Wujin Chu discuss a few of them in their 1993 article, “Demarketing as a Differentiation Strategy”. The differentiation strategy means that a firm might use a “nuisance factor” that actually drives consumers away from them, and into the arms of their competitors in order to keep their prices elevated. This can also be used to avoid a price war with that competitor.&lt;ref name="Gerstner" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Healthcare===
An example of demarketing in action is the demarketing of healthcare consumption that occurred in Canada in the 1990s.  Canada’s social healthcare system was under stress from overuse or inefficient use.  In order to combat these issues, Dr. Gurprit Kindra, from the University of Ottawa made strategic suggestions in an article he wrote in 1995.  Kindra suggested that some co-payments and user fees be applied to discourage consumption.  He also proposed that a system geared toward more managed care would reduce the number of services being accessed if patients were required to get a referral from a primary point of contact before seeing other specialties.  Among his other suggestions were health promotion and education for the general public that would encourage less utilization of the healthcare services and reducing the convenience to patients by restricting access to free or deeply discounted services like Canada’s publicly subsidized urgent care facilities and instead make available privatized fast-lane services for those consumers who are willing to pay more.&lt;ref&gt;Kindra, G. S. (1995, Summer). Demarketing Inappropriate Healthcare Consumption: Canada's prized health care system suffers from chronic overuse. Journal of Healthcare Marketing, 15(2), 10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borkowski, N. M. (1994, Winter). Demarketing of Health Services. Journal of Healthcare Marketing, 14(4), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paper Reduction===
Promoting the use of paperless products at home and in the office to save the trees, is an example of demarketing paper products. Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin, and other states are now issuing electronic vehicle titles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcentv.com/story/23947884/tx-dept-of-motor-vehicles-launches-first-paperless-vehicle-title-system&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water Conservation===
Due to the severe drought, the State of California has been restricting water usage, while providing tax rebates for installing synthetic turf. An average home that converts to artificial grass saves about 22,000 gallons of water per year.&lt;ref&gt;The Orange County Register, April 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon Footprint===
Imposing tight regulations on coal by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and promoting the use of natural gas at power plants to reduce carbon emissions will accelerate the decline of coal for electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;Getty Images The Hill, Timothy Cama - 06/11/14 06:00 AM EDT&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junk Food===
Promoting high fiber, organic, and healthy products against food and beverages with [[saturated fat]], [[high fructose corn syrup]], and artificial ingredients helps to prevent [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], and other diseases.

===Cigarettes as a “Vice” Product=== 
While demarketing may be employed to decrease demand, countermarketing seeks to destroy demand. Strategies include promoting [[anti-smoking]]/health themes, taxes on tobacco products, imposing mandatory warning labels, decreasing advertising spaces, increasing pricing, and restricting the consumption space in favor of [[nicotine patches]], Nicorette gum,  and Nicorette lozenges.

==Unintended Outcomes==
Research points to behavioral reactions to anti-drug ads that go in the opposite direction from that which was intended. In other words, a boomerang effect occurs where greater levels of exposure to anti-drug campaign results in potentially increased use of drugs. The thinking is that anti-drug publicity may convey the idea that “everyone’s doing it.”
 
In addition, it is possible that the ads had an unintended positive impact on perceptions towards drugs by portraying “benefits” associated with using, an association possibly strengthened by repeated exposure to messages and images suggesting the "good-times" people have while on drugs. Beliefs and behaviors of youths were also affected by perceptions regarding older peers.
 
Further, ABC News reported findings in 2008 that the federal government’s effort to keep youngsters from using drugs “is unlikely to have had favorable effects on youths.” State government efforts have also come under criticism. A December, 2008, article in Science Daily about an effort by the state of Montana states: “An independent review investigating the effectiveness of a publicly funded graphic anti-methamphetamine advertising campaign has found that the campaign has been associated with many negative outcomes.” &lt;ref&gt;Who is Winning the War on Drugs?

The '''Department of Trade and Industry''' ('''DTI''') was a [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|United Kingdom government department]] formed on 19 October 1970. It was replaced with the creation of the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] and the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]] on 28 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
The department was first formed on 19 October 1970&lt;ref name="National Archives"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details?Uri=C135 | title=Records created or inherited by the Department of Trade and Industry | publisher=National Archives | work=National Archives | accessdate=December 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the merger of the [[Board of Trade]] and the [[Minister of Technology|Ministry of Technology]], creating a new cabinet post of [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]. The new department also took over the [[Department for Work and Pensions|Department of Employment]]'s former responsibilities for monopolies and mergers. In January 1974, the department's responsibilities for energy production were transferred to a newly created [[Department of Energy (United Kingdom)|Department of Energy]]. On 5 March that year, following a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] victory in the February 1974 [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|general election]], the department was split into the '''Department of Trade''', the '''Department of Industry''' and the '''[[Department of Prices and Consumer Protection]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PageNotFound/PageNotFound.aspx?url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/webarchive/archiving-datasets.htm|title=Page Not Found - The National Archives|author=|date=|website=nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
In 1983 the departments of Trade and Industry were reunited.  The Department of Energy was re-merged back into the DTI in 1992, but various media-related functions transferred to the [[Department for National Heritage]]. Until it was succeeded in June 2007 the DTI continued to set the [[energy policy of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berr.gov.uk/aboutus/corporate/history/index.html BERR history page]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] the DTI was renamed to the '''Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry''',&lt;ref&gt;

==Structure==
The DTI had a wide range of responsibilities. There were ultimately nine main areas covered by the DTI:
* Company Law
* Trade
* Business Growth
* Innovation
* Employment Law
* Regional Economic Development
* Energy
* Science
* Consumer Law

===Emergent technology===
From 1999 to 2005 it led the national E-Commerce Awards with InterForum, a not for profit membership organisation that helped British businesses to trade electronically. This aimed to encourage Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises to develop their business through the use of E-Commerce technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=E-Commerce In The United Kingdom Facts &amp; Figures for 2016 |url=https://moneypug.co.uk/news/e-commerce-in-the-united-kingdom-facts-figures-for-2016/ |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate policing===
It also had responsibility for investigating misconduct by company directors, in which role [[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]] repeatedly lampooned it as "the Department of Timidity and Inaction".{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Downtown Phoenix''' is the [[central business district]] (CBD) of the City of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], [[United States]]. It is located in the heart of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] or Valley of the Sun. Phoenix, being the county seat of [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] and the capital of Arizona, serves as the center of politics, justice and government on the local, state and federal levels. The area is a major center of employment for the region, with many financial, legal, and other national and international corporations housed in a variety of skyscrapers. Major arts and cultural institutions also call the area home. Downtown Phoenix is a center of major league sports activities, live concert events, and is an equally prominent center of banking and finance in Arizona. Regional headquarters for several major banks, including [[Chase Tower (Phoenix)|JP Morgan Chase]], [[Wells Fargo Plaza (Phoenix)|Wells Fargo]], [[US Bank Center (Phoenix)|US Bank]], [[Bank of America Tower (Phoenix)|Bank of America]], Compass Bank and [[Renaissance Square|Midfirst Bank]] are all located within or close proximity to the area.

The City of Phoenix defines Downtown as the area between 7th Street and 7th Avenue, from McDowell Road on the north to Buckeye Road on the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phoenix.gov/urbanformproject/ Urban Form Downtown Project] City of Phoenix&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of downtown development is concentrated in the smaller area surrounding the intersection of Washington St. and Central Ave (which is the point of origin of Phoenix street addresses and numbering).

== History ==

=== Early Downtown ===
In 1870, a meeting was held to select a town site for the influx of pioneers coming to the recently recognized town of Phoenix. 320 acres were purchased for $50 raised by popular subscription. This original site, the whole of the town of Phoenix in that day, encompasses what would presently be the Downtown Core, bordered by [[Van Buren Street (Arizona)|Van Buren Street]] south to Jackson Street, and Seventh Street to Seventh Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phoenix.gov/CITYGOV/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214011434/http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html |archivedate=February 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the first survey of the new town, streets were laid out in a grid, with Washington Street as the main east-west thoroughfare.  The north-south streets originally bore Native American tribal names, but were changed to more easily remembered numbers, with everything east of Center Street (later [[Central Avenue Corridor|Central Avenue]]) named as streets and everything west as avenues. The town continued to grow, and was eventually incorporated as a city on February 28, 1881, centered around downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incorporation in 1881|url=http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html|work=Out of the Ashes: The History of the City of Phoenix|publisher=City of Phoenix|accessdate=July 28, 2011|authors=Barney, James M.; Goldwater, Barry M.; Williams, Jack|year=1951|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010633/http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html|archivedate=April 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1880s the newly incorporated city made many strides toward modernization with the construction of one of the first electric plants in the West as well as the opening of the horse-drawn streetcar line. The [[Phoenix Street Railway]] system was eventually electrified and expanded to several different lines that connected Downtown Phoenix to other neighborhoods and cities in the Valley. Independence Day of 1887 heralded the arrival first Southern Pacific train. This opened up the economy of the young city, as goods now flowed in and out by train as opposed to wagon. As Phoenix became the center of commerce in the territory, the capital was moved to Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bustling 1890s|url=http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html|work=Out of the Ashes: The History of the City of Phoenix|publisher=City of Phoenix|accessdate=August 8, 2011|authors=Barney, James M.; Goldwater, Barry M.; Williams, Jack|year=1951|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405010633/http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html|archivedate=April 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downtown growth===
After Arizona was granted statehood in 1912, the growth of Phoenix exploded from the downtown epicenter. By the 1930s, a modern skyline composed of various commercial buildings began to take shape and Downtown was a dense, compact and pedestrian friendly city characterized by Victorian buildings and ground-floor retail.&lt;ref&gt;Images of America: Downtown Phoenix; Anderson, Mahmuljin and McPherson pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Post-World War II building focused heavily on suburb creation, and this, combined with the rise of the automobile and evaporative cooling, resulted in large population relocation outside of Downtown.&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Phoenix, Arizona#World War II]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

===Redevelopment===
As Phoenix began to recover from the [[Great Recession]], interest in re-energizing the urban core skyrocketed. In contrast to the pre-recession construction boom in the Phoenix area which primarily focused on the construction of low density communities and [[suburban]] office complexes, the most recent boom has been heavily focused on Central Phoenix, with the construction of higher density development, and a renewed interest in local business, [[bioscience]], education, and the arts. Spurred by [[Arizona State University]]’s quickly developing Downtown Campus and a new [[Phoenix Convention Center|Convention Center]], Downtown Phoenix has quickly transformed into an attractive place for businesses. Areas such as [[Lower Grand]], Roosevelt, and the [[Warehouse District]] have seen a massive investment in art, [[adaptive reuse]], and local restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downtownphoenixjournal.com/2015/04/14/building-a-vision-for-downtown-phoenix-living/|title=Building a Vision for Downtown Phoenix Living|date=April 14, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the [[Super Bowl 49|Super Bowl]] was held in Arizona and, unlike the 2008 Super Bowl, many of the major NFL events were held on the streets of Downtown Phoenix, showcasing to the world how the city had transformed its downtown into a lively, thriving community full of creative energy and opportunity. The construction of Phoenix's [[Valley Metro Rail|light rail system]] has stemmed major development projects in Downtown Phoenix along the Central Avenue corridor.

== Attractions ==
Downtown Phoenix has many points of interest, including museums, sports venues, performing arts venues and a thriving art scene.

=== Museums and cultural venues ===

Downtown's museum and cultural attractions include the [[Arizona Science Center]], The Wells Fargo History Museum, the [[Phoenix Art Museum]], the Rosson House Museum, the Arizona Latino Arts and Cultural Center, the [[Children's Museum of Phoenix]] and the Phoenix Center for the Arts.

===Notable buildings and landmarks===

Luhrs Building &amp; Tower – Located on Central and Jefferson Avenue, the Luhrs Building was completed in 1924 and was Downtown's first 10-story high rise. In 1929, a second phase of the development resulted in the completion of a 14-story Art Deco tower with Spanish Colonial and Southwest influences. Both buildings have been preserved and house office, restaurants and retail businesses.
 
Hanny's – Opened in 1947, Hanny's was the number one location for men's clothing and fashion until closure in 1986. The building now houses an upscale restaurant and cocktail bar.

The Professional Building (Hilton Garden Inn) – Built in 1932 as the headquarters for Valley Bank and the Maricopa County Medical Society, the building provided Phoenix's first medical offices until the bank took over the entire building in 1939. It is the largest limestone sheathed building in Arizona.

Maricopa County Courthouse (Historic City Hall) – The existing building served as the City Hall from 1928–1994 when the “New” City Hall was completed across the street. The building is an excellent example of Renaissance Revival architecture.

The San Carlos – Constructed in 1927, The San Carlos hotel opened its doors on March 19, 1928 as the first hotel in Phoenix with evaporative cooling. The site was previously the location of the first school house in Phoenix.  Major celebrities have stayed in the hotel, including Betty Grable, Mae West, Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. The hotel now has 12 suites named in honor of its famous visitors and remains a working hotel.
 
The Heard Building – When completed in 1920, the Heard building was Downtown's tallest structure and was financed by Dwight B. Heard, a finance and publishing executive. Since completion, it has housed the Arizona Republic newspaper, a radio station and many office and ground-floor restaurant tenants.

St. Mary's Basilica – Built in Romanesque/Mission Revival style, St. Mary's Basilica is the oldest Catholic parish in Phoenix and the second oldest church in Phoenix. Construction began in its first phase in 1880 and the building and grounds were placed onto the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The short-lived [[brutalist]] style has only one example in downtown Phoenix in the [[Wells Fargo Plaza (Phoenix)|Wells Fargo Plaza]]. [[Post modern]], with its return to architectural ornamentation, can be seen in the [[Bank of America Tower (Phoenix)|Bank of America Tower]], both towers at the [[Arizona Center]] and, most notably, in the crown of the Phoenix City Hall Building.

The recent trend of urban living has led to the conversion of the 1930s-era Phoenix Title and Trust building to condominiums called Orpheum Lofts; as well as the newly built residential towers [[44 Monroe]]. Taylor Place, two 13-story towers which serve as the new residential community of the Downtown campus of Arizona State University, opened in August 2008. A 19-story, 320 room [https://www.visitphoenix.com/listing/courtyard-by-marriott-downtown-phoenix-(opening-may-2017)/5627/ Courtyard and Residence Inn by Marriott] opened May 2017 and a new [http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/04/13/true-urban-city-downtown-phoenix-frys-grocery-store-breaks-ground/100298576/ Block 23] Fry's urban grocery and mixed-use high-rise will be completed in 2019.

== Historic Heritage Square ==
{{commons category|Heritage Square, Phoenix}}
Historic Heritage Square is part of Heritage and Science Park on the east end of downtown. It encompasses the only remaining group of residential structures from the original town site of Phoenix.

The Lath House Pavilion, although completed in 1980, its design is heavily influenced by combining 19th Century concepts of a botanical conservatory, a gazebo, a beer garden and a pedestrian shopping arcade, all of which were common features of early Phoenix architecture. The Pavilion hosts many national and cultural festivals throughout the year.
The [[Rosson House]] is the cornerstone of a city block dating from the late 19th century. The house has been restored to its Victorian roots and offers tours.
The Duplex, built in 1923, is the youngest of the homes on the block. Its sleeping porches constructed with canvas and wood panels, let in the cool evening desert air.
The Carriage House is located in the center of the Square. It was built as a mule barn for the Teeter House in 1899.
The Silva House, a bungalow with neoclassical revival influences, was built in 1900. The Rose and Crown, an English Pub, now occupies this historical home.
The Bouvier-Teeter House was built in 1899. It is now a Victorian Tea Room.
The Baird Machine Shop was a commercial structure when it was built in 1929. It is now home to [[Pizzeria Bianco]], which has been named by various sources as the best Pizza in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|author=Ed Levine|title=The Road to Pizza Nirvana Goes Through Phoenix|date=July 7, 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/07/dining/07PIZZ.html?ex=1089777600&amp;en=9decbf0191c234a5&amp;ei=5062&amp;partner=GOOGLE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Thomas House was moved to block 15, of Historic Heritage Square in the 1980s to save the home from demolition. This 1909 neoclassical styled building houses Bar Bianco, an adjunct to Pizzeria Bianco.
The Stevens- Haugsten House was built in 1901 as a rental property.  The building is significant for its representation of the historic California bungalow style built around the turn of the 20th century.
The Stevens House, built in 1901 with obvious midwestern influences, now houses The Arizona Doll &amp; Toy Museum.

== Historic neighborhoods ==
Downtown and Central Phoenix are home to several historic neighborhoods ranging from turn-of-the-20th-century Victorian to mid-20th-century modern architecture. Some of them, like the Willo and Encanto-Palmcroft districts, are more established and in demand, while others are still redeveloping. The better-known districts include Coronado, Roosevelt, Encanto-Palmcroft, [[F. Q. Story Neighborhood Historic District|FQ Story]] and Willo.

===Encanto-Palmcroft Historic District===
Rooted firmly in the City Beautiful movement of planning, the Palmcroft and Encanto Districts were developed starting in the late 1920s. With winding lanes, tree-lined streets, lush landscaping and nearby Encanto Park, this neighborhood resembles more of an English suburb than a Phoenician neighborhood. The district contains many larger, period revival manors, marking a time when it was a getaway from the hustle and bustle of early city life. The Encanto-Palmcroft historic neighborhood is diminutive in size with approximately 330 households. Architecture in Encanto-Palmcroft includes Spanish Colonial, Tudor Revival, Cape Cod and Monterey Revival. The proximity of this quaint Downtown Phoenix neighborhood to Encanto Park represents an approach to suburban planning referred to as “City Beautiful” that evolved in Phoenix as a highly successful achievement. It symbolized a romanticized approach to architecture and the houses tend to “look towards each other,” reinforcing a sense of community. Boundaries: Encanto Boulevard south to McDowell Road; Seventh Avenue west to 15th Avenue

===Roosevelt Historic Neighborhood===
Honored with the first distinction of historical designation in the City of Phoenix, the Roosevelt Neighborhood has a history that is rich and deep. From its architectural milestones still visible today, its importance in Phoenix's original booming tourist trade, and its role as one of the first “streetcar suburbs,” Roosevelt has remained a vital community to the city's past, present, and future. It lies bounded by Central Avenue and 7th Avenue from McDowell to Fillmore and is peppered with buildings and homes of architectural significance. It is a true urban neighborhood, with a walkable scale, close proximity to public transportation, and friendly neighborhood cafes and local businesses.

===Coronado District===
Greater Coronado consists of three neighborhoods — Historic Coronado, Country Club Park and Brentwood — and includes over 5,000 households and hundreds of businesses. Centrally located near both State Road 51 and Interstate 10, single-family homes feature architectural styles ranging from California Bungalow and Spanish Colonial Revival to ranches and the occasional modern re-do. Boundaries: Thomas Road south to Interstate 10; State Road 51 west to Seventh Street

===Garfield Historic District===
Developed from 1883–1955, Garfield Historic District contains nearly 800 households and contains primarily modest bungalows, Period Revival homes and the city's largest concentration of “pyramid cottages.” Before becoming a residential community Garfield was part of an extensive agricultural tract. Boundaries: Roosevelt Street south to Van Buren Street; 16th Street west to Seventh Street

===Willo Historic District===
Willo Historic District has been voted one of the top 10 cottage communities in the United States. Bike-friendly and walk-able to light rail, businesses and cultural attractions, Willo was once considered suburban, and predominantly home to those interested in agricultural pursuits. It's still known for its lush greenery. Boundaries: Thomas Road south to McDowell Road; First Avenue west to Seventh Avenue

===Downtown Core===
Light rail, growing academic campuses and renewed demand for urban living has supercharged development in the Downtown Core. The core offers easy access to restaurants, retail and cultural attractions as the true urban center in the Valley. Boundaries: Fillmore Street south to Pacific Railroad; Seventh Street west to Third Avenue

===Grand Avenue===
Grand Avenue's diagonal course breaks up Phoenix's grid and is dominated by local businesses, art studios, converted warehouses, bars, restaurants and restored storefronts. Boundaries: McDowell Road south to Van Buren Street; Seventh Avenue west to 19th Avenue

===Eastlake Park===
The Eastlake Park neighborhood is a traditional African-American enclave in the Downtown area. The main focal point is the park itself, which is the oldest in the city and originally boasted a centrally located lake and pathway. Boundaries: North of Washington Street south to Jefferson Street; 16th Street west to 12th Street

===Grant Park===
Grant Park is one of 13 neighborhoods in the community of Central City South. Latino heritage and culture is strong in Grant Park, and is home to Friendly House Inc., which has served new immigrants since 1915; American Legion Post 41, the first Legion to allow Hispanics as members after World War II; El Portal Restaurant; St. Mary's Catholic Church, which is on the Hispanic historical registry; Grant Park Community Garden; La Canasta Mexican Restaurant and the Grant Park Community Center, famous for its “Midnight Basketball Classic” and other youth programs.
Boundaries: Grant Street south to Buckeye Road; Central Avenue west to Seventh Avenue

===Evans-Churchill Neighborhood and Roosevelt Row===
The Evans-Churchill neighborhood sits directly adjacent to the Downtown Core and is home to Roosevelt Row — the nationally recognized arts district that hosts [https://artlinkphoenix.com/first-fridays/ First Fridays]. Since 1994 this monthly event has grown to become the largest monthly artwalk in the United States. Increasing interest in this area has prompted Roosevelt Row to becoming more pedestrian-friendly and it is supportive of small local independent businesses that give downtown Phoenix character. The area's development is overseen by the non-profit [http://www.rooseveltrow.org/about/the-community-development-corporation-cdc/ Roosevelt Row Community Development Corporation].  With a mix of single-family homes and infill mid-rise developments, this neighborhood serves as a vibrant and arts-focused transitional area between the dense core and surrounding historic districts. Boundaries: McDowell Road south to Fillmore Street; Seventh Street west to Central Avenue

===Central Park===
Emerging businesses, community gardens and thriving programs for adults and youths are the hallmarks of this close-knit neighborhood located south of Chase Field. Attractions include Bentley Projects, the George Washington Carver Museum and Cultural Center, Central Park Neighborhood Community Center, The Levine Machine and Phoenix Day Child &amp; Family Center, which has served the community since 1915. Central Park Phoenix is one of 13 neighborhoods in the Central City South Community. Boundaries: Lincoln Street south to Buckeye Road; 7th Street west to Central Avenue

===FQ Story===
The quaint F.Q. Story neighborhood consists of over 600 households, most built between 1920 through the 1940s, with architectural styles ranging from Spanish Colonial Revival and Tudor to craftsman bungalows and ranch-style homes. This historic Downtown Phoenix neighborhood is named for Francis Quarles Story, who sold wool in Boston and citrus in Los Angeles before expanding to the Salt River Valley of Arizona. Though never a resident of Phoenix, Story is credited for building the Grand Avenue thoroughfare and the subsequent streetcar line. Boundaries: McDowell Road south to Roosevelt Street; Seventh Avenue west to 17th Avenue

===Warehouse District===
Located just south of the Downtown Core and north of Central City South, the Phoenix [http://www.phxwd.com/ Warehouse District] was the location of early Phoenix's agricultural shipping, historic Chinatown, rail yard and produce distribution centers. The area's remaining period buildings have been top targets for adaptive reuse and are home to several technological and creative-type businesses.  Boundaries: Jackson Street south to Grant Street; 7th Street west to 7th Avenue

== Government and infrastructure ==
Downtown Phoenix is the home of City Hall, Justice Courts, Phoenix Municipal Court, Superior Court of Arizona and Bankruptcy Court. [[United States Postal Service]] operates the Downtown Phoenix Post Office at 522 North Central Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/69201?p=1&amp;s=AZ&amp;service_name=post_office&amp;z=Phoenix Post Office Location – PHOENIX DOWNTOWN]." ''[[United States Postal Service]]''. Retrieved on April 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown Phoenix has the [[Valley Metro Light Rail]] which consists of 37 stations throughout 3 different cities in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. Some of the major stations, like [[Van Buren/1st Avenue and Van Buren/Central Avenue stations]], are located in Downtown Phoenix.

== Downtown Phoenix in film and television ==
Mel's Diner, on the outskirts of downtown has been an old Phoenix landmark for decades. It is famous for being the setting for the TV sitcom ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]''.

Many movies have been filmed in Phoenix using downtown locations.

* The 1960 film, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' features the Downtown Phoenix skyline in the opening shot. Originally [[Alfred Hitchcock]] wanted a helicopter shot to fly through downtown into the window of a hotel, but the shot was changed to a series of pan and fade shots.
* In the 1998 remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' [[Gus Van Sant]] filmed the opening shot using a helicopter and zooming into the 8th floor of the [[Westward Ho (Phoenix)|Westward Ho]].
* Parade scenes for the 1956 [[Marilyn Monroe]] film, ''[[Bus Stop (1956 film)|Bus Stop]]'', were filmed in front of the [[Westward Ho (Phoenix)|Westward Ho]].
* In the film ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'', [[Lela Rochon]] is shown in front of the [[Phoenix City Hall]] building in her character's introduction scene.
* In the film ''[[The Gauntlet (film)|The Gauntlet]]'', the open shots feature the Phoenix skyline. Downtown is also used in the final climatic shoot-out between [[Clint Eastwood|Clint Eastwood's]] character and the Phoenix Police, ending in front of the [[Phoenix Symphony Hall]].
* In the film ''[[Ninja III: The Domination]]'', a car chase uses the streets of downtown.
* ''[[Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie]]'' was filmed at The [[Dodge Theater]] in 2003.
* In the 1978 made-for-TV movie ''A Fire in the Sky'', a comet crashes into [[Earth]] west of the city which destroys downtown Phoenix. Many landmarks are shown during the destruction. [[Wells Fargo Plaza (Phoenix)|Wells Fargo Plaza]] and the [[Hyatt Regency Phoenix]] are shown collapsing while the glass skin of the [[Chase Tower (Phoenix)|Chase Tower]], is blown from its steel skeleton. The [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] of the [[Westward Ho (Phoenix)|Westward Ho]] falls to the ground as a result of the impact blast. This film should not be confused for the [[Fire in the Sky|1993 alien abduction movie]] of the same name.
* In ''[[The Banger Sisters]]'', the skyline is featured.
* In the film ''[[The Getaway (1994 film)|The Getaway]]'', Phoenix stands in for Albuquerque with [[Kim Basinger]] navigating through downtown's streets and alleys.
* The [[Arizona Center]] is used in the opening scenes of the 1998 film, ''[[Phoenix (1998 film)|Phoenix]]''.
* The [[Paul Newman]] film, ''[[Pocket Money]]'', used the [[Westward Ho (Phoenix)|Westward Ho]] courtyard for scenes in 1972.

'''Employee of the Month''' is a talk show hosted by [[Catie Lazarus]] that features guests with jobs of interest, ranging from television personalities and musicians to comedians and puppeteers. It began as a live show in 2010 and became a podcast&lt;ref name="itunes.apple"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/employee-of-the-month/id487274151|title=EMPLOYEE of the MONTH|publisher=iTunes|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012. Lazarus has hosted live tapings at [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]] in [[New York City]], [[92nd Street Y|92 Y]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.92y.org/index.php/weblog/item/employee_of_the_month_catie_lazarus/|title=Employee of the Month Catie Lazarus|publisher=92 Y Online|accessdate=July 7, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126174623/http://blog.92y.org/index.php/weblog/item/employee_of_the_month_catie_lazarus/|archivedate=January 26, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Los Angeles]] and [[The Bell House (New York)|The Bell House]] in [[Brooklyn]].

Lazarus hatched the idea for the podcast when she was frustrated with her own attempt at finding a job, which led her to approach successful people to talk about their work and how they had landed their dream jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/jobs/search_terms_fVBGy8zvQIh7axOalg611H|title=Job seeker’s futile efforts lead to career ‘talk show’|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable interview subjects ==
[[Jon Stewart]] chose ''Employee of the Month'' to give his first interview after announcing his decision to retire from the [[Daily Show]] in February, 2015.  Stewart follows many of his Daily Show collaborators, including Aasif Mandvi, Dave Attell, Wyatt Cenac, Buck Henry, Mo Rocca, David Wain, and Lewis Black as guests on the show; in turn, Lazarus herself appeared in the Daily Show in a sketch about a prequel to Hot Tub Time Machine. Stewart discussed some of his future plans, assuring fans that he was not retiring. Though he plans to spend more time with his family, he suggested that he would continue writing – to which Lazarus later responded by giving him a notebook as a parting gift - and even that he could return to stand-up comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/jon-stewart-is-ready-for-next-iteration-of-the-daily-show-20150220|title=Jon Stewart Is Ready for 'Next Iteration' of 'Daily Show' - Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Federal City Council''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]]&lt;ref name= irseos/&gt; that promotes economic development in the city of [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States. Incorporated on September 13, 1954,&lt;ref name= corp/&gt; it is one of the most powerful private groups in the city, and is highly influential in [[United States Congress|Congress]].  It was the primary backer of a wide range of important projects, including the near-complete razing of [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.|Southwest D.C.]] in favor of redevelopment in the 1950s and 1960s, the construction of the [[Washington Metro]] [[Rapid transit|subway]] system, the construction of the [[Washington Convention Center|city's first]] and [[Walter E. Washington Convention Center|second convention centers]], the construction of the [[Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center]], and the construction of the [[Verizon Center]]. It has also been successful in pushing for changes in the [[District of Columbia Public Schools]], reform of the federal role in the District of Columbia's finances, and reform of the District's tax structure.

The association, whose members are largely drawn from the business community, prefers to work behind the scenes and avoid media attention. It is highly influential, although assessments of its influence in the past decade have varied. The organization has also created a number of independent nonprofits and subsidiary bodies, which have worked on range of issues, from waterway restoration to crime.

==History==

===Founding and early issues===
The Federal City Council was incorporated on September 13, 1954,&lt;ref name= corp/&gt; "to develop, stimulate and encourage civic leadership in community development in the National Capitol".{{sfn|Derthick|1962|page=89}} [[Phil Graham]], co-owner and publisher of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', was the major force in creating the council.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt; Graham was deeply concerned about the decline of the District of Columbia in the post-World War II period and the city's rapid loss of population and business to suburbs in Maryland and Virginia.&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt; Graham was also worried that the [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.|Southwest Washington]] urban renewal project, authorized in 1946{{sfn|Subcommittee on Fiscal and Government Affairs|1978|page=112}} and funded in 1949,{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|page=260}} would be cancelled, ending the city's best chance at turning itself around.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt; In 1952, Graham held a meeting of like-minded top businessmen in the boardroom of Riggs Bank to discuss formation of an organization to counteract these trends.&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt; These discussions led to formation of the Federal City Council in 1954. Membership was largely limited to businesspeople, because the group felt that only private sector money and a business-like approach to development and management could improve the District.&lt;ref name=irwinmakings /&gt; Among the original members of the group in 1954 were Graham{{sfn|Derthick|1962|page=115}} and Francis Addison, Jr., president of Security Bank and former president of the [[Greater Washington Board of Trade|Washington Board of Trade]].{{sfn|Derthick|1962|page=151}} [[George A. Garrett]], a former ambassador, was elected the organization's first president on November 16.&lt;ref name=GarrettHead&gt;{{cite news|title=G.A. Garrett Federal City Council Head|work=The Washington Post|date=November 17, 1954|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental concept which the group agreed upon early in its history was to work behind the scenes and only on projects that can shape the city for 20 years or more.&lt;ref name=oconnellspotlight /&gt;

The Federal City Council was active in a wide range of issues in the 1950s, including slum clearance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Expert Prods District to Rush Slum Clearance|work=The Washington Post|date=February 2, 1955|page=A18|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Allbrook|first=Robert C.|title=Ike Names Garrett to Spur SW Plan|work=The Washington Post|date=March 17, 1955|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited with successfully lobbying the Eisenhower administration to expedite the razing of much of Southwest Washington{{sfn|Derthick|1962|page=91}}&lt;ref name=powelldubious&gt;{{cite news|last=Powell|first=Michael|title=Showing Dubious Progress in a Deadly District|work=The Washington Post|date=April 19, 1998|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|The Federal City Council has also been criticized for pursuing the wholesale demolition of Southwest D.C.  As reporter Michael Powell of ''The Washington Post'' put it in 1998: "If there was a distant trigger for the homicides that now beset Washington, many criminologists and activists locate it in this huge dislocation. The destruction of neighborhoods and the grouping of thousands of poor families in isolated public housing at a time of social unrest fed a growing alienation and violence."&lt;ref name=powelldubious /&gt;}} It was also involved in an attempt to locate the headquarters of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in the District of Columbia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Council Launches a Renewed Effort to Get the CIA to Locate in District|work=The Washington Post|date=December 24, 1955|page=A1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Dulles, Planners Agree On CIA Site at Langley|work=The Washington Post|date=March 8, 1956|page=A53}}&lt;/ref&gt; urban planning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eisen|first=Jack|title=Civic Group Urges Area Control Body|work=The Washington Post|date=November 20, 1957|page=A1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Area Authority of Real Power Also Proposed|work=The Washington Post|date=December 24, 1957|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; demolition of the temporary [[Main Navy and Munitions Buildings]] on the [[National Mall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plea Made to Rid D.C. of 'Tempos'|work=The Washington Post|date=May 10, 1958|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the site of the proposed [[John F.

Cultural Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Culture Site Action Urged Upon House|work=The Washington Post|date=July 30, 1958|page=A11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the size of the federal payment made to the city in lieu of [[property taxes]].&lt;ref name=eisendrive&gt;{{cite news|last=Eisen|first=Jack|title=Federal City Council Projects Drive to Boost Federal Payment to D.C.|work=The Washington Post|date=December 10, 1958|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly active on the [[Theodore Roosevelt Bridge]] issue. It pushed hard for a bridge rather than a tunnel, and, once a bridge had been chosen, for the bridge's location to be about {{convert|800|ft|m}} upstream from the final location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal Council Enters Bridge-or-Tunnel Debate|work=The Washington Post|date=December 19, 1956|page=B1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Civic Group Lauds Bridge Action Move|work=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 1957|page=B1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Aid of Federal City Council Sought By Seaton on Relocation of Bridge|work=The Washington Post|date=May 16, 1958|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s: Pushing big economic projects===
[[File:Looking northeast over Southwest Washington DC - July 1939.jpg|thumb|Wholesale demolition of the slums in Southwest D.C. (''depicted'') was a key goal of the Federal City Council.]]
Urban planning and the federal contribution to the city's budget continued to occupy some of the Federal City Council's agenda in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allbrook|first=Robert C.|title=Area Citizens Need 'Regional Voice'|work=The Washington Post|date=November 20, 1960|page=E2|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Lindsay|first=John J.|title=NCPC Head Fights Bill to Curb Agency in D.C.|work=The Washington Post|date=May 25, 1961|page=D1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Council Asks Congress to Pay Share|work=The Washington Post|date=June 17, 1961|page=D16|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Claiborne|first=William L.|title=Six Years $4 Billion Could Make D.C. Ideal 'Fairgrounds'|work=The Washington Post|date=June 14, 1970|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But big economic development projects moved to center stage for the organization.  It unsuccessfully pushed for a "Federal City Center" (a vast complex of government office buildings akin to [[Federal Triangle]]) in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Landauer|first=Jerry|title=Plan Pushed For Federal City Center|work=The Washington Post|date=July 24, 1960|page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also pushed hard for construction of the D.C. Cultural Center, even though it lost the battle to erect the auditorium at [[L'Enfant Plaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barthelmes|first=Wes|title=SW Auditorium Site Favored|work=The Washington Post|date=November 4, 1956|page=B4|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Landauer|first=Jerry|title=Drive Planned for Convention Hall Here|work=The Washington Post|date=November 27, 1960|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was far more successful in opposing cancellation of the Southwest Washington urban renewal project, which called for razing nearly all buildings in that quadrant of the city and constructing a new urban center. Although the Federal City Council's specific plans were not adopted, it was deeply involved in the planning process and its studies often relied on by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Group Raps Bill to Curb D.C. Renewal|work=The Washington Post|date=May 10, 1960|page=B2|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Survey of Urban Renewal Setup Accepted by Federal City Council|work=The Washington Post|date=September 29, 1960|page=A23|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Carberry|first=James R.|title=Bill to Combine RLA, Housing Authority Argued|work=The Washington Post|date=July 21, 1961|page=B7|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Carberry|first=James R.|title=Plan to Merge Renewal Agencies Altered Drastically by House Unit|work=The Washington Post|date=August 3, 1961|page=A1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Mintz|first=Morton|title=Future of Renewal Seen Far From Citizen Group's Hopes|work=The Washington Post|date=September 6, 1961|page=B4|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Lindsay|first=John J.|title=Renewal Plans Meet Opposition|work=The Washington Post|date=January 18, 1962|page=B1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Committee to Iron Out Legislation on Renewal|work=The Washington Post|date=July 12, 1962|page=B1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Clopton|first=Willard|title=2 Agencies Blast Plan to Shift Renewal Setup|work=The Washington Post|date=May 3, 1963|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal City Council even raised money to develop its own concepts for redeveloping downtown and Southwest D.C., and lobbied Congress to have its plans adopted. In 1962, it won adoption of its proposal in the House of Representatives. When the bill died in the Senate at the end of the [[87th United States Congress|87th Congress]], it went to the Senate and won passage there in 1963. When the 1963 legislation moved to the House, Representatives [[John Dowdy]] and [[John L. McMillan]] attached a number of [[Rider (legislation)|riders]] to the bill that required [[Procurement|competitive bidding]], forced federal agencies to give displaced businesses priority in receiving federal assistance, required the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) to develop plans for relocating low-income residents, and placed limits on the number of redevelopment projects that could be approved or constructed at any given time. But many liberals in Congress as well as [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|HUD Secretary]] [[Robert C. Weaver]] opposed these riders.{{sfn|Gillette|2006|page=171}} The riders were enacted into law. Unwilling to see redevelopment of Southwest D.C. collapse, the Federal City Council agreed to sponsor legislation that would authorize the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA, the federal bureau overseeing the reconstruction of Southwest D.C.) to conduct redevelopment on the same basis as federal agencies in other cities. Although this meant ignoring the Federal City Council's plans for redevelopment, it allowed the RLA to begin acting quickly and decisively on redevelopment projects.{{sfn|Gillette|2006|page=172}}

Two of the major projects the Federal City Council pushed for in the 1960s were [[Inner Loop (Washington, D.C.)|Inner Loop]] highway system and its associated [[Three Sisters Bridge (District of Columbia)|Three Sisters Bridge]], and the [[Washington Metro]] subway system. The Inner Loop was strongly opposed by local citizens, who felt it was unnecessary, destroyed many neighborhoods, and despoiled the environment. However, Representative [[William Huston Natcher|William Natcher]], chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations for the District of Columbia of the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Committee on Appropriations]], was not only a strong advocate of bridge and highway construction but also convinced that construction of the Inner Loop was essential to the growth of the District of Columbia. The Federal City Council, too, advocated the Inner Loop as a response to the flight of retail and light industry for the suburbs (a trend which began in the 1950s). The organization believed that quick and easy automobile access to the city (with lots of inexpensive parking) would draw shoppers and retailers back. A large subway system was equally important, as the Federal City Council concluded that surface transit alone could not meet the needs of the rapidly growing D.C. metropolitan area. The organization pushed hard for construction of Metro even though Representative Natcher threatened to cancel the subway project if the Inner Loop was not constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Action Called Major Step for Both Projects|work=The Washington Post|date=April 7, 1961|page=D1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Clopton|first=Willard|title=Put Downtown Subway First, Council Urges|work=Washington Post|date=May 5, 1963|page=B1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Both Transit, Roads Backed By Council|work=Washington Post|date=June 22, 1963|page=B1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Eisen|first=Jack|title=Width and Design of Freeway Draw Criticism at D.C.

As part of its Inner Loop push, the Federal City Council asked the City Commission to "[[Nationalization|nationalize]]" all parking the city. This was a major step, for it meant government ownership of all [[parking lot]]s, [[Multi-storey car park|parking garages]], and [[valet parking]] lots in the city. The Washington Parking Association, a trade association of parking lot owners, strongly opposed the move. Although the City Commission was willing to pass nationalization legislation, there was extensive opposition in Congress (which had the power to overturn any city law), and the measure died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Downie|first=Leonard, Jr.|title=Federal City Unit Charges Distortion By Private Group on Parking Here|work=The Washington Post|date=July 12, 1965|page=B3|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Dan|title=Approval Postponed On Public Parking Bill|work=The Washington Post|date=December 23, 1965|page=A1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Board of Trade Shifts, Supports Parking Bill|work=The Washington Post|date=January 11, 1966|page=C1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Dan|title=City's Disappearing Parking Lots Key Issue in Legislative Hassle|work=The Washington Post|date=March 25, 1966|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, smaller projects with the Federal City Council worked on during the 1960s included another attempt to get rid of the "tempos" on the National Mall,&lt;ref name=tempotf&gt;{{cite news|title=Task Force to Rid City of Tempos|work=The Washington Post|date=December 22, 1963|page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt; construction of a "national aquarium" in [[East Potomac Park]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Jean|title=Aquarium Goes to Potomac Park, With Span Planned to Maine Ave|work=The Washington Post|date=June 16, 1964|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a major boost in police to create a "war on crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=D.C. Crime War Backed By Federal City Council|work=The Washington Post|date=March 3, 1967|page=A19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agenda of the Federal City Council could also work against democracy in the District of Columbia. During the 1960s, there was an increasingly strong push for [[District of Columbia home rule]]. Because it supported the vested interests of the status quo, the Federal City Council strongly opposed home rule. It opposed initiatives supported by home rule activists, and often proposed and pushed for the adoption of plans that home rule advocates opposed. In order to win support for its proposals, the Federal City Council raised money to re-elect members of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Committee on the District of Columbia]]—most of whom also opposed home rule, as it significantly reduced their power in Congress.{{sfn|Fauntroy|2003|page=47}}

===1970s: Focus on economic development===
[[File:DCConventionCenter.jpg|thumb|The Federal City Council successfully pushed for construction of D.C.'s first convention center.]]
Although portions of the Inner Loop were constructed, the majority of highways that comprised the system (including the elements most destructive of neighborhoods and the environment) were cancelled by federal court decisions and by changes in national transportation policy during the late 1960s and the early 1970s.{{sfn|Gutheim|Lee|2006|page=297}} The [[Three Sisters Bridge]] project was killed in the House of Representatives in early December 1971.&lt;ref name=EisenFunds&gt;{{cite news|last=Eisen|first=Jack|title=House Releases District Subway Funds|work=The Washington Post|date=December 3, 1971|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Inner Loop dead, the Federal City Council continued to push for city-owned parking and for full funding of the Metro system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyer|first=Eugene L.|title=Council to Step Into Parking Jam|work=The Washington Post.'' April 5, 1970|page=D1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Feaver|first=Douglas B.|title=Full System For Metro Is Backed|work=The Washington Post|date=December 21, 1977|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With federal funds for massive infrastructure development dwindling fast in the early 1970s, the Federal City Council turned its focus to smaller projects that would spur economic development.  One of its key issues was the construction of a [[Washington Convention Center|Dwight D. Eisenhower Convention Center]] to make the city attractive to large trade association conventions.  The push for a convention center began in 1973. Although there was extensive opposition in Congress at first, the Federal City Council lobbied hard for federal approval. This was finally given in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scharfenberg|first=Kirk.|title=Center's Planning Financed|work=The Washington Post|date=April 5, 1973|page=C1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last1=Barker|first1=Karlyn|last2=Hamilton|first2=Martha M.|title=Project Held Boon for Old Downtown Landowners|work=The Washington Post|date=July 3, 1978|page=C1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Baker|first=Donald P.|title=Civic Center In D.C.

Building Corporation" to assist developers in obtaining financing for major projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lippman|first=Thomas W.|title=Fauntroy Backs D.C.

As part of its economic redevelopment initiative, the Federal City Council also sought to repeal [[Rent control in the United States|rent control]] laws in the District of Columbia. Rent control, the organization argued, discouraged new housing from being built in the city and retarded the city's economic growth. The city's rent control law, enacted in 1975, was seen as vulnerable by the Federal City Council in 1975 and 1976, as few residents had seen its benefits and did not yet support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewar|first=Helen|title=Rent Control Seen Curbing Unsubsidized City Housing|work=The Washington Post|date=September 30, 1975|page=C2|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Whitaker|first=Joseph D.|title=New Housing Called Prime Need in D.C.|work=The Washington Post|date=September 30, 1975|page=C1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Rent Control Seen Bar to D.C. Units|work=The Washington Post|date=April 3, 1976|page=D28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its repeal attempt was unsuccessful, however.

The Federal City Council also began unsuccessfully pushing in the late 1970s for a regional economic planning board similar to the urban planning body it had pressed for in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Donald P.|title=Proposed Planning Panel Attacked on Hill|work=The Washington Post|date=February 24, 1978|page=C2|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Jones|first=William H.|title=Regional Approach For D.C.|work=The Washington Post|date=May 31, 1978|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s: The trade center, crime, and schools===
In the 1980s, the Federal City Council backed two plans—one to reduce flights at [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington National Airport]] and another to redevelop [[Buzzard Point]]—at the opening and close of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feaver|first=Douglas B.|title=Plan to Cut National Flights Is Backed|work=The Washington Post|date=July 11, 1980|page=B1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Hilzenrath|first=David S.|title=Official, Developers Share a Vision for Buzzard Point|work=The Washington Post|date=August 20, 1988|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither plan was implemented. It also released a study in 1980 criticizing the District government for allowing significant deterioration in the city's {{convert|1300|mi|km}} of water pipes. (The city took no action until a series of major pipeline breaks led to emergency action in 1993.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spayd|first=Liz|title=D.C. Was Alerted More Than 10 Years Ago About Aging Water Pipes|work=The Washington Post|date=December 28, 1993|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ronald Reagan Bld.jpg|thumb|The Federal City Council initiated the effort to build the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, which completed the Federal Triangle complex.]]
The concept for a massive "trade center", which would become an international headquarters for corporations and trade associations, was a more successful project.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt; In June 1983, the Federal City Council proposed that a huge $300 million structure be built on unused land adjacent to [[Maine Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Maine Avenue SW]]. Despite local citizen opposition, the organization convinced [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|D.C. Mayor]] [[Marion Barry]] to begin pushing the plan through the [[Council of the District of Columbia|D.C. City Council]] and Congress. Opposition from executive branch agencies, however, derailed the plan, and by 1986 the Federal City Council was looking for an alternative site for the building. In late 1986, the association began pushing for construction of the trade center on a parking lot in [[Federal Triangle]], an area originally intended for a major government office building in the 1930s but never built due to the financial distress caused by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. This site won near-universal approval, and in 1987 Congress authorized construction of the [[Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Struck|first=Myron|title='Trade Center' Planned for D.C.|work=The Washington Post|date=June 11, 1983|page=F1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=World Class on the Waterfront|work=The Washington Post|date=June 16, 1983|page=A28|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Teeley|first=Sandra Evans|title=Objections to SW Trade Center Prompt City Review of Plans for Waterfront|work=The Washington Post|date=July 5, 1983|page=B5|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Slacum|first=Marcia A.|title=Mayor Seeks Council's Backing for Cultural and Trade Center|work=The Washington Post|date=January 13, 1984|page=B8|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Harris|first=Lyle V.|title=SW Plan's Future Uncertain|work=The Washington Post|date=July 25, 1984|page=DC1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Mintz|first=John|title=New Sites Eyed In District for Trade Center|work=The Washington Post|date=May 23, 1986|page=C8|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Havemann|first=Judith|title=Trade Center Draws Support|work=The Washington Post|date=October 30, 1986|page=C1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Havemann|first=Judith|title=Completion of Federal Triangle Voted|work=The Washington Post|date=August 8, 1987|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald A.

The construction of the Washington Metro and development of the federal government became major issues for the Federal City Council in the mid-1980s. The group received approximately $250,000 in August 1985 to study the transit needs of the area through the year 2000, the first time a group independent of Metro was authorized by the federal government to conduct such a study.&lt;ref name=bruskedotawards&gt;{{cite news|last=Bruske|first=Ed|title=DOT Awards Metro System Study|work=The Washington Post|date=August 17, 1985|page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's study, released in March 1986, said Metro faced a financial crisis by 2000 caused by significant cuts in federal funds as well as rapidly growing capital improvement needs (such as replacing subway cars and worn equipment and track).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynton|first=Stephen J.|title=Rapidly Rising Costs Forecast for Subway Equipment Upkeep|work=The Washington Post|date=March 12, 1986|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1986, the Federal City Council issued a report that recommended that the federal government undertake a 10-year plan to construct new federal office buildings rather than lease space for federal agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Havemann|first=Judith|title=U.S. Urged to Rent Less Private Office Space|work=The Washington Post|date=December 2, 1986|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal seemed to die, but in 1990 the GSA incorporated its key recommendations into a new office space consolidation policy.

In the late 1980s, the Federal City Council turned its attention to crime rather than development. By this time, Washington, D.C., was suffering from an epidemic of [[crack cocaine]] use. The drug made an appearance in the United States in 1981, and by the end of 1986 was deeply entrenched in the District of Columbia.{{sfn|Haley|2009|page=27}} The following year, one study estimated that there were 24,000 drug dealers in the city (38.6 per 1,000 residents), with at least 14,000 of them dealing on a regular basis (at least one day per week).{{sfn|Lusane|Desmond|1991|page=173}} By one estimate, cocaine and crack cocaine use doubled in the city between 1986 and 1987.{{sfn|Lusane|Desmond|1991|page=170}} A private study estimated that one in six African American men in the city were arrested for selling illegal drugs before the age of 21, and by 1990 a shocking one in four African American men in the city had sold drugs before the age of 30.{{sfn|Lusane|Desmond|1991|page=170}} By 1990, the District of Columbia had the nation's highest rate of drug addiction (32.9 per 1,000 residents).{{sfn|Lusane|Desmond|1991|page=170}} The crack cocaine epidemic drove the city's murder rate in 1988 to 372,{{sfn|Leon|2010|page=79}} and 80 percent of the city's murders were drug-related.{{sfn|Walsh|Ellis|2007|page=269}} With drug-related crime outstripping by far economic development as the city's largest problem, in 1986 the Federal City Council joined with the Community Foundation, the [[Greater Washington Board of Trade]], and the Greater Washington Research Center to form the Washington Fund for the Prevention of Substance Abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Lynne|title=Suburban Drug Use Here Worst in U.S.|work=The Washington Post|date=February 26, 1988|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 1988, the Federal City Council also sponsored the creation of the Corporation Against Drug Abuse (CADA), an employer-funded entity to encourage the adoption of stricter drug testing and drug abuse policies in the workplace and to work against drug abuse generally in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Lynne|title=A Corporate Attack on Drugs|work=The Washington Post|date=October 25, 1988|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its interest in social programs, the Federal City Council also turned its attention for the first time to the [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] (DCPS). DCPS Superintendent Andrew E. Jenkins awarded the organization a $500,000 grant to assemble a team of 51 community leaders and review DCPS curricula, budget, extra-curricular programs, and educational goals and priorities. The grant was one of the largest ever made by the school system. The report, due in June 1989, was expected to guide the DCPS system through the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Rene|title=Group of 'Doers' to Scrutinize How Well D.C.

In 1989, the Federal City Council issued a report castigating the government of the District of Columbia for allowing the city's roads to deteriorate. The report noted that the city spent just $5 million a year on road repair, which it used almost exclusively for temporary patches rather than permanent repair, upgrades, and maintenance. The report identified a $1.6 billion backlog in street maintenance projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=French|first1=Mary Ann|last2=Fehr|first2=Stephen C.|title=D.C.

Another project which the Federal City Council supported was construction of the MCI Center (now the [[Verizon Center]]) in [[Chinatown (Washington, D.C.)|Chinatown]]. Along with the Greater Washington Board of Trade and other private groups, the Federal City Council—not public officials, fans, or sports interests—pushed for a new arena downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heath|first=Thomas|title=Group Planning Downtown D.C.

But the Capital Centre was a small, aging facility, and there seemed an opportunity to bring the teams back into the District of Columbia. The effort began in the summer of 1993, when Federal City Council president [[Ann Dore McLaughlin]] had a casual conversation with [[Gordon Gund]], owner of the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] professional basketball team, and learned of the "Cleveland model" for a public-private partnership to build a basketball arena in downtown [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. McLaughlin later shared this information with then-D.C. Mayor [[Sharon Pratt Kelly]], who was enthusiastic but emphasized that the private sector must take the lead on the effort. McLaughlin began having talks with Pollin's friends and associates, and members of Pollin's staff. In early November, the Board of Trade sought and won a meeting with Pollin.&lt;ref name=heathjumped&gt;{{cite news|last=Heath|first=Thomas|title=D.C.

The Federal City Council and its Committee on Public Education remained active on education issues in the 1990s.

In the late 1990s, the Federal City Council adopted its first strategic plan.&lt;ref name=debonisshades /&gt;

===2000s: Moving away from economic development===
[[File:Michelle Rhee.jpg|thumb|The Federal City Council actively promoted the mayoral takeover of D.C.'s public schools, which led to the hiring of new schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee.]]
Under the leadership of chairman Terence Golden in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Federal City Council began changing its focus away from big-budget infrastructure projects and toward more "community living" initiatives such as the creation of affordable housing, improved public schools, anti-drug and anti-crime initiatives, and support programs for at-risk youth.&lt;ref name=BisnowBackPage&gt;{{cite news|last=Bisnow|first=Mark|title=The Back Page|work=Washington Business Journal|date=March 28, 2005|accessdate=November 27, 2016|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2005/03/28/editorial3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization spent two years trying to convince the federal government to reopen [[Pennsylvania Avenue|Pennsylvania Avenue NW]] in front of the [[White House]] (to no avail)&lt;ref name=fehrmainstreet&gt;{{cite news|last=Fehr|first=Stephen C.|title=Opening 'America's Main Street'|work=The Washington Post|date=August 25, 2000|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Forgey|first=Benjamin|title=A Chance to Restore a Symbol Of an Open Society|work=The Washington Post|date=September 30, 2000|page=C1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Fehr|first=Stephen C.|title=Avenue Plan a Culmination of Frustration|work=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 2000|page=C1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Hsu|first=Spencer S.|title=Architects Offer Plan To Reopen Pa.

Education reform continued to draw the organization's attention as well. The Federal City Council funded a study of the school system's administration, staff training, and curriculum by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] in 2001. The study led the D.C. Public Schools to adopt a five-year plan, titled "Business Plan for Strategic Reform", for making system wide improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blum|first=Justin|title=District Readies Schools Shake-Up|work=The Washington Post|date=July 29, 2001|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the organization partnered with the [[Jim Kimsey|Kimsey Foundation]] and the Morino Institute to fund on-the-job training for 40 school principals over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moreno|first=Sylvia|title=D.C. Schools Tapped For Principal Training|work=The Washington Post|date=February 3, 2003|page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Federal City Council led an effort to raise private money to help improve the salary of the Superintendent of the District of Columbia Public Schools. The move came as the city struggled to find a replacement for [[Paul L.

Although Rhee never made any such statement, the claims gained some traction among some public school activists.&lt;ref name=woodleeclarrklatest&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woodlee|first1=Yolanda|last2=Clark|first2=Ashlee|title=Hear the Latest About the Federal City Council?|work=The Washington Post|date=August 9, 2007|page=T1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Federal City Council was, according to ''The Washington Post'' reporter Mike DeBonis, "a prime supporter of Fenty's education reform efforts."&lt;ref name=debonisraisedpower&gt;{{cite news|last=DeBonis|first=Mike|title=$180,000 Raised for D.C.

Reform of city finances and government also occupied the Federal City Council. In 2001, at the behest of Natwar M. Gandhi, D.C.'s chief financial officer, the organization agreed to update its 1994 study on city revenues in order to build a consensus in Congress for a restructuring of the District's financing mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hsu|first=Spencer S.|title=Downturn Has D.C. Looking For Help|work=The Washington Post|date=November 28, 2001|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report, ''Assessing the District's Financial Position'', released in March 2002, called for a [[commuter tax]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hsu|first=Spencer S.|title=District Appeals to U.S. For Tax on Commuters|work=The Washington Post|date=March 12, 2002|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and restoration of an annual federal payment in lieu of property taxes.  The report also warned of half-billion dollar budget deficits if city spending were not slashed and tax cuts deferred.&lt;ref name=hsudeficits&gt;{{cite news|last=Hsu|first=Spencer S.|title=D.C. Deficits On Horizon, Study Finds|work=The Washington Post|date=March 15, 2002|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the organization raised $100,000 to help incoming chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, [[Vincent C. Gray]], fund a multiyear strategy plan for council action. It also raised more than $400,000 to help Fenty pay for an improved candidate recruitment process for his mayoral cabinet, and for a study on how to take over the public school system.&lt;ref name=kingtwocouncils /&gt;

For the first time since the 1980s, the organization made another major push to improve funding for Metro. In September 2004, the Federal City Council joined with the Board of Trade and the [[Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments]] to create a task force to study Metro's revenues and financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Layton|first1=Lyndsey|last2=Ginsberg|first2=Steven|title=New Ways Of Funding Metro to Be Explored|work=The Washington Post|date=September 9, 2004|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group proposed that local governments dedicate a portion of their sales tax to Metro, but the plan generated no interest by local or state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ginsberg|first=Steven|title=Leaders Find Tax Increase to Aid Metro Unappealing|work=The Washington Post|date=January 1, 2005|page=B1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last1=Duggan|first1=Paul|last2=Aratani|first2=Lori|title=Government and Business Officials Push For New Metro Financing System|work=The Washington Post|date=May 30, 2016|accessdate=December 13, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/government-and-business-officials-push-for-new-metro-financing-system/2016/05/30/f0eb84d8-234c-11e6-9e7f-57890b612299_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s: Narrowed priorities===
[[File:Mayor Williams Anthony.jpg|thumb|Former D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams was appointed chief executive officer/executive director of the Federal City Council in 2012.]]
In the 2010s, the Federal City Council continued to tackle many small issues in an attempt to improve the livability of Washington, D.C.  These included improving the streetscape of 10th Street SW (also known as L'Enfant Promenade),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Connell|first=Jonathan|title=New partnership for SW waterfront|work=The Washington Post|date=May 24, 2010|page=A15}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding a [[Bus lane|bus-only lane]] and [[tram|streetcar]] to [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street NW]] in downtown, reopening Pennsylvania Avenue NW near the White House,&lt;ref name=debonisshades /&gt; addressing congestion on downtown streets, improving D.C.'s tourism industry,&lt;ref name=debonisanacostia /&gt; supporting the 2015 merger between [[Exelon]] and [[Pepco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Aaron C.|last2=Heath|first2=Thomas|title=Two Sides Target Bowser on Exelon-Pepco Deal|work=The Washington Post|date=September 18, 2015|page=B3|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Aaron C.|last2=Heath|first2=Thomas|title=D.C.

In 2011, the Federal City Council began work on a new strategic plan to guide the organization's decision-making. It was the first strategic plan for the organization in more than a decade. The plan identified four key priorities: Lowering unemployment by developing new industries (its top priority), ensuring the city's financial stability and integrity (its second priority), improving public education, and improving city infrastructure. By design, the strategic plan closely tracked the major priorities of newly elected Mayor Vincent C. Gray.&lt;ref name=debonisshades&gt;{{cite news|last=DeBonis|first=Mike|title=Shades of Gray at Federal City Council|work=The Washington Post|date=August 12, 2011|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stewartdebonisleadlocal /&gt; In April 2012, the Federal City Council hired former mayor Anthony Williams as its new executive director. He replaced eight-year veteran John W. Hill, Jr. Williams reiterated the organization's focus on jobs, government effectiveness and efficiency, and improvements to infrastructure.&lt;ref name=WilliamsExecDir /&gt; Williams' appointment was widely seen by the news media as a significant boost to the organization's influence.&lt;ref name=stewartdebonisleadlocal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=Nikita|last2=DeBonis|first2=Mike|title=Ex-Mayor to Lead Local Policy Group|work=The Washington Post|date=April 20, 2012|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To work toward the goal of lower unemployment, the Federal City Council opposed enactment in 2013 of a "[[living wage]]" law in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=deboniswade&gt;{{cite news|last=DeBonis|first=Mike|title=Federal City Council, Ralph Nader Wade Into 'living wage' debate|work=The Washington Post|date=August 10, 2013|accessdate=December 13, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/mike-debonis/wp/2013/08/09/federal-city-council-ralph-nader-wade-into-living-wage-debate/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also joined an effort, spearheaded by The 2030 Group, to plan a multi-decade strategy for helping seven key industries in the region grow as well as how to encourage greater economic diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCartney|first=Robert|title=Here's how D.C. business thinks region should react to painful sequestration|work=The Washington Post|date=August 29, 2015|accessdate=December 13, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/heres-how-dc-business-thinks-region-should-react-to-painful-sequestration/2015/08/29/be5b78dc-4c44-11e5-902f-39e9219e574b_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax issues largely occupied the group's attention when it came to the city's financial stability. The Federal City Council supported a successful city sales tax on gym memberships and yoga classes that generated $5 million a year. The organization backed the "wellness tax" in order to pay for a city council-enacted income tax cut that cost $143 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeBonis|first=Mike|title=Gym Levy Survives Challenge in D.C.|work=The Washington Post|date=June 25, 2014|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal City Council also supported the D.C. Tax Revision Commission, and members of the council served on the commission.  The commission recommended changes to the District's tax code (including adding a bracket for middle-income earners and an increase in the standard deduction) which made it the second-most [[Progressive tax|progressive]] in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeBonis|first=Mike|title=Study: D.C.'s tax system is one of America's fairest|work=The Washington Post|date=January 15, 2015|accessdate=December 13, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/mike-debonis/wp/2015/01/15/study-d-c-s-tax-system-is-one-of-americas-fairest/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the organization also supported a bid to make the District of Columbia the American host-city candidate for the [[2024 Summer Olympics]]. As the Federal City Council saw it, the bid gave the region an opportunity to engage in forward-looking plans that would ensure the region's economic stability by developing infrastructure, transportation, tourism, cultural facilities, and sporting venues that would last for 30 to 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramsey|first=W.

The Federal City Council was active on a much wider range of infrastructure initiatives.  It advocated in 2012 creation of a public-private investment trust fund to help rebuild and improve the city's parks, public transit system, and sewer system.&lt;ref name=oconnellinvesttrust /&gt; It established an internal task force to identify new means of financing bridge improvement, repair, and replacement; a new city jail; and improvements to city-owned golf courses.&lt;ref name=oconnellspotlight /&gt; In 2013, the organization announced the creation of the Anacostia Waterfront Trust to coordinate regional efforts to end the continuing pollution of the [[Anacostia River]] and to begin cleanup efforts of the riverbed. Doug Siglin, formerly the federal affairs director for the [[Chesapeake Bay Foundation]], was named executive director of the Trust. The Federal City Council agreed to back a multibillion-dollar federal plan to end raw sewage flows into the river; mitigation of [[greywater]], [[surface runoff]], and [[urban runoff]] into the river; and research into the best way to address the deep deposits of dangerous contaminants on the river bottom.&lt;ref name=debonisanacostia&gt;{{cite news|last=DeBonis|first=Mike|title=Anacostia River Is Federal City Council's Newest Focus|work=The Washington Post|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=December 13, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/mike-debonis/wp/2013/10/28/anacostia-river-is-federal-city-councils-newest-focus/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pipkin|first=Whitney|title=D.C.'s 'Forgotten River' Getting Some Attention|work=Bay Journal|date=March 11, 2014|accessdate=December 13, 2016|url=http://www.bayjournal.com/article/d.c.s_forgotten_river_getting_some_attention}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its Anacostia River initiative, the council supported legislation (enacted in 2014) banning the use of [[polystyrene]] foam containers for use by [[Take-out|food carryout]] providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flaherty|first=Mary Pat|title=D.C.

The report called for Metro's board to be drastically reduced in number and to be composed of transit professionals rather than political appointees. It also called for weaker protections for Metro's [[trade union]]s, and for each state-level partner to adopt a dedicated tax to support Metro's capital needs and operations. The Federal City Council said it would attempt to build a coalition,&lt;ref name=Mccartneyblowup /&gt; consisting primarily of the region's largest employers and businesses with the most revenue,&lt;ref name=mccartneysavemetro /&gt; to support the changes.&lt;ref name=Mccartneyblowup&gt;{{cite news|last=McCartney|first=Robert|title=How to Salvage Metro?

The Federal City Council was somewhat inactive on education reform for the first half of the 2010s.

By 2016, the Federal City Council had expanded on its strategic plan by agreeing conduct more research into the city's problems, as well as act as a lobbyist for business before the Council of the District of Columbia. Lobbying came to the forefront due to the formation in 2001 of the [[DC Fiscal Policy Institute]], a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[think tank]] focused on local issues founded by the left-leaning [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]]. As part of its lobbying effort, the Federal City Council sent representatives on a trade mission to [[China]] and worked to defeat a proposed [[Parental leave|paid family leave]] bill.&lt;ref name=oconnellspotlight&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Connell|first=Jonathan|title=Back In Spotlight, Former D.C.

==Projects==
On several occasions, the Federal City Council has created subsidiary organizations to take on tasks of a specific geographic or technical nature. Some of these have proven highly influential in themselves. Short-term initiatives include a 1963 effort to demolish temporary building on the National Mall,&lt;ref name=tempotf /&gt; a 1988 task force to win federal approval for the construction of an international trade center,&lt;ref name=5named /&gt; the early 1990s Downtown Interactive Task Force,&lt;ref name=irwinmakings /&gt; a 2002 effort to lobby the federal government for more money for the District of Columbia (led by Robert G. Liberatore, a senior vice president at [[DaimlerChrysler]]),&lt;ref name=hsudeficits /&gt; and a 2012 working group to identify new means of financing infrastructure.&lt;ref name=oconnellspotlight /&gt;

The Federal City Council has, on occasion, created longer-lived, semi-permanent or permanent subsidiaries or organizations as well.

===Downtown Progress===
The first longer-term project initiated by the Federal City Council was Downtown Progress. In 1958, the Federal City Council recommended the creation of a new organization to attract business investment in the former retail core of the District of Columbia.{{sfn|Derthick|1962|page=93}} On April 1, 1960, this organization, the National Capital Downtown Committee, Inc.—better known as "Downtown Progress"—was formed as a joint effort of the Federal City Council and a federal agency, the [[National Capital Planning Commission]].{{sfn|Derthick|1962|page=200}} Knox Banner was Downtown Progress' long-time leader.&lt;ref name=PearsonBanner&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Richard|title=Knox Banner, Key Figure in Efforts to Revitalize Downtown D.C., Dies|work=The Washington Post|date=April 11, 1994|page=D4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, which represented primarily very large businesses, produced a number of extensive, expensive plans to redevelop downtown D.C. and build an extensive network of subway lines beneath the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haggerty|first=Mary Ann|title=The Place That Lost Its Heart|work=The Washington Post|date=September 4, 1995|page=WBIZ12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization helped to win the creation of the Washington Metro, and development of the Washington Convention Center. It was not successful, however, in pushing for a similar network of underground tunnels and roadways that would accommodate rapid-transit buses and truck delivery. Downtown Progress also worked closely with the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation to develop plans for the [[Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site#Rejuvenation|restoration and redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue NW]] in the 1960s and 1970s, and worked with the [[National Park Service]] to restore [[Ford's Theatre]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=PearsonBanner /&gt;

===Municipal Research Bureau===
The second long-term organization created by the Federal City Council was the Municipal Research Bureau.  Created in 1974, it was led by Philip M. Dearborn, Jr., an expert in municipal finance and director of the Brookings Institution's Greater Washington Research Program. Its mission was to provide general research on issues important to the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=bernsteindies&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|title=Philip Dearborn Dies; City Finance Expert|work=The Washington Post|date=August 24, 2002|page=B6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It merged with the Washington Center for Metropolitan Studies in 1978 to become the Greater Washington Research Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Engel|first=Margaret|title=Think Tank Emerges as an Influential Voice In the D.C. Area|work=The Washington Post|date=November 21, 1982|accessdate=December 13, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1982/11/21/think-tank-emerges-as-a-influential-voice-in-the-dc-area/7177ae65-9dd0-414c-b496-d4e5bfe37b4b/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greater Washington Research Center merged with the Brookings Institution in 2001.&lt;ref name=bernsteindies /&gt;

===The Economic Club===
In 1986, the Federal City Council spawned the [[Economic Club of Washington]].&lt;ref name=irwinnewgen /&gt; The group formed in response to the nationalization and globalization of many D.C. businesses, as well as the rapid increase in "[[new economy]]" businesses inside the city and in the surrounding suburbs. There was a sense that many of the area's mid- and top-level managers were not from the area, felt little attachment to the region, and had few friends in the city.&lt;ref name=irwinnewgen /&gt;&lt;ref name=bhattaraibig&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhattarai|first=Abha|title=A Quarter-Century of Big Names In Business|work=The Washington Post|date=June 4, 2012|page=A19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Economic Club was founded by Federal City Council members Ed Hoffman (president of [[Woodward &amp; Lothrop]]) and R. Robert Linowes (a successful local attorney). The goal was two-fold: First, to provide a way for business leaders to socialize, become acquainted with one another, and form a sense of community; second, to expose its members to new thinking and ideas in the realm of economics.&lt;ref name=irwinnewgen&gt;{{cite news|last=Irwin|first=Neil|title=Economic Club of Washington Attracts New Generation of Movers, Shakers|work=The Washington Post|date=May 31, 2004|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has since become "a cornerstone of the Washington business community", largely on the basis of its ability to bring a group of top-level business leaders together to listen to policymakers.&lt;ref name=bhattaraibig /&gt; (It does not advocate for, lobby on behalf of, or speak for the business community.)&lt;ref name=bhattaraibig /&gt;

===Committee on Public Education===
D.C. Committee on Public Education (a group of parents and business, religious, and civic leaders), in 1988.&lt;ref name="horwitzpanelpraise"/&gt; When released on June 20, 1989, the report recommended spending $355 million over the next five years to extend the school day by five hours (to a 7 A.M. to 6 P.M. schedule); extend the school year by 40 days; construct new schools; repair existing schools; and add stronger math and science programs and multicultural education to the curriculum. To pay for the plan, the Federal City Council's team suggested cutting administrative costs by $8.5 million, eliminating 400 central staff positions, closing some schools, and selling some school property.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; The Committee on Public Education remained active for many years, issuing reports critical of the public school system.&lt;ref name=horwitzpanelpraise /&gt;&lt;ref name="horwitzdeclining"/&gt;

===Agenda Progress and D.C. Agenda===
Another major project of the Federal City Council was Agenda Progress.  This project came about in 1991 after former President [[Jimmy Carter]] asked members of the Federal City Council whether they believed their efforts would completely turn the city around in five to ten years. None did. Agenda Process was launched shortly after Carter's speech as a means to identify projects and mechanisms that would meet the challenge Carter set for the group.&lt;ref name=fisherstraussborn /&gt;

Agenda Progress spent 1993 and 1994 cooperating with the Brookings Institution on a study of the finances of the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=hendersondefhit /&gt;&lt;ref name=fullerdisband /&gt; This study deeply influenced the Clinton administration's decision to impose the [[District of Columbia Financial Control Board]] on the city in 1995.&lt;ref name=fullerdisband /&gt;

In 1995, Agenda Progress was renamed D.C. Agenda, and led by former Barry administration official James O. Gibson. Its original purpose was to serve as an unofficial transition committee at the start of Marion Barry's fourth term (1995 to 1999) as mayor. It represented the interests of large corporations and nonprofits doing business with city, providing them with research and technical assistance. In time, D.C. Agenda shifted its focus to building coalitions to support its agenda on city governance and financial/tax reform, improved support for economic development, neighborhood redevelopment, and at-risk youth intervention.{{sfn|Barras|1998|page=164}}&lt;ref name=fullerdisband&gt;{{cite news|last=Fuller|first=Nicole|title=DC Agenda Disbands As Funding Dwindles|work=The Washington Post|date=August 5, 2004|page=DE3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, D.C. Agenda mimicked or implemented city functions and acted as a liaison with corporations or nonprofits to implement public policy. D.C. Agenda also had a subsidiary body, the D.C. Agenda Support Corporation, led by former District of Columbia Administrator Carol Thompson Cole.{{sfn|Barras|1998|page=164}} D.C. Agenda had several subcommittees as well, including an Economic Development Strategy Group (organized in 1996 and led by local attorney Dana Stebbins).&lt;ref name=pyattdance /&gt;

In 1997, D.C. Agenda proposed creating a nonprofit, tax-exempt, public-private economic development corporation.&lt;ref name=fullerdisband /&gt; The organization, dominated by private developers, would have broad power (including [[Eminent domain in the United States|eminent domain]] and the right to own property) to direct planning and engage in redevelopment of the city's downtown and business corridors. The proposal asked for $50 million in cash from the federal government (with 40 percent earmarked for redevelopment efforts by other nonprofits), and $250 million in redistributable tax credits and surplus federal property.&lt;ref name=pyattdance&gt;{{cite news|last=Pyatt|first=Rudolph A., Jr.|title=D.C.'s Public and Private Sectors Finally May Be Ready to Dance|work=The Washington Post|date=May 22, 1997|page=E3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D.C. Agenda proposal became the [[National Capital Revitalization Corp.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Behr|first=Peter|title=D.C. Development Plan Wins Broad Support|work=The Washington Post|date=February 3, 1998|page=D5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was created by law adopted by the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] in April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loeb|first1=Vernon|last2=Wilgoren|first2=Debbi|title=Council's Plan to Hand Over Economic Development Powers Criticized|work=The Washington Post|date=March 12, 1998|page=J1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Pyatt|first=Rudolph A., Jr.|title='Cowboy Capitalism' Allegations Overshadow D.C. Revitalization Measure|work=The Washington Post|date=June 25, 1998|page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D.C. Agenda created the nonprofit D.C. Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation in 1999.&lt;ref name=fullerdisband /&gt;&lt;ref name=davisbankrupted&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Aaron C.|title=Mismanagement Has Bankrupted a D.C.

After several years of mismanagement, the trust collapsed and dissolved in April 2016.&lt;ref name=davisbankrupted /&gt;{{Efn|In 2007, D.C. Council member [[Harry Thomas, Jr.]] embezzle more than $350,000 from the trust and was sentenced to more than three years in prison. After the scandal, the trust struggled to obtain new funding. In 2013, a congressional investigation found that the trust lacked financial controls to properly account for its expenditures, which included administering the city's $20 million school voucher program.&lt;ref name=davisbankrupted /&gt;}}

In 2000, D.C. Agenda began collecting funds from the public as part of a political campaign to support a [[referendum]] that would dramatically alter the powers of the D.C. State Board of Education. More than $80,000 was collected from 25 individuals. But the [[District of Columbia Office of Campaign Finance]] found that D.C. Agenda had failed to register as a [[political action committee]], as required by law. D.C. Agenda president John H. McKoy{{Efn|McCoy was a former executive at Lockheed Martin IMS, a former director of the District of Columbia Office of Planning, a former executive vice president of the [[Anacostia Waterfront Corporation]], and director of programmatic initiatives at the nonprofit Fight for Children.}} agreed to return all the funds to avoid a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woodlee|first=Yolanda|title=D.C. Group Pushing School Board Change Hits Campaign Snag|work=The Washington Post|date=June 18, 2000|page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D.C. Agenda dissolved in May 2004 after failing to raise the $1.7 million a year its annual budget required.&lt;ref name=fullerdisband /&gt;{{Efn|D.C. Agenda drew its funding from grants provided by several national and local foundations, corporations, and the local and federal government.&lt;ref name=fullerdisband /&gt;}} Several of the organization's subsidiary efforts, such as the Neighborhood Information Service, the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation Awards, and Neighborhood College, were transferred to other nonprofits in the area.&lt;ref name=fullerdisband /&gt;{{Efn|The Neighborhood Information Service collected a wide range of economic, social, demographic, and other information on the District's 131 neighborhoods, and distributed this information free to neighborhood leaders. The Cafritz Foundation Awards recognized city employees for exceptional service.  Neighborhood College was a free program which educated neighborhood leaders about the history and current socio-economic status of their neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=fullerdisband /&gt;}}

===Washington, DC Police Foundation===
The Washington, DC Police Foundation (also known as the National Capital Police Fund) is a grant-making arm of the Federal City Council which provides grants to the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] (MPD). According to the Federal City Council, the foundation was created in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|website=Federal City Council|date=2016|accessdate=December 15, 2016|url=http://www.federalcitycouncil.org/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made a $10,000 grant to the MPD in 2004 to purchase stolen goods tracking software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilber|first=Del Quentin|title=D.C. Cracks Down as Stolen-Goods Dealers Evolve|work=The Washington Post|date=August 16, 2004|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a $30,000 grant in 2005 to allow the MPD to purchase automobiles with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] tags for use as "bait cars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilber|first=Del Quentin|title=Inefficiency Plagues Program to Curb D.C. Auto Thefts|work=The Washington Post|date=August 21, 2005|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear how the foundation generates its income.

===Anacostia Waterfront Trust===
In October 2013, the Federal City Council established a new nonprofit, the Anacostia Waterfront Trust, to coordinated regional and federal efforts to prevent the dumping of raw sewage and toxic materials into the Anacostia River, and to research ways in how best to handle the contaminants already on the riverbed.&lt;ref name=debonisanacostia /&gt; The organization began researching the history of [[Anacostia Park]] in 2016, in an attempt to identify past plans for the park. The effort was a prelude to beginning an effort to craft a strategic vision for the park that would allow for its sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kobell|first=Rona|title=Anacostia Park, once planned as an urban oasis, still more of a mirage|work=Bay Journal|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=December 14, 2016|url=http://www.bayjournal.com/article/anacostia_park_once_planned_as_an_urban_oasis_still_more_of_a_mirage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust also supported the D.C. government's plan for trading "stormwater retention credits" (similar to [[carbon credit]]s) among businesses in an effort to reduce low-quality runoff into the Anacostia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Jeff|title=DC ready to ramp up its stormwater trading program|work=Bay Journal|date=September 28, 2016|accessdate=December 14, 2016|url=http://www.bayjournal.com/article/dc_ready_to_ramp_up_its_stormwater_retention_trading_program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the Federal City Council==

===Influence===
The Federal City Council is highly influential in [[real estate development]] and [[urban planning]] issues in the District of Columbia.{{sfn|Fauntroy|2003|page=46}} It is the Federal City Council's focus on construction and development that, according to ''The Washington Post'' reporter David Leonhardt, has allowed the organization to be at the forefront in promoting "almost every major downtown development project since World War II", including Southwest urban renewal, the entire Washington Metro, the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, and the renovation of Union Station.&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt;&lt;ref name=debonisshades /&gt;&lt;ref name=stewartdebonisleadlocal /&gt;&lt;ref name=irwinmonday&gt;{{cite news|last=Irwin|first=Neil|title=Monday Morning|work=The Washington Post|date=September 27, 2004|page=F2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s through the late 1970s, ''The Washington Post'' said, the organization "sometimes carried more clout on Capitol Hill than the District's political leadership."&lt;ref name=irwinmakings /&gt; ''Post'' columnist Colbert I. King said its power rivaled that of the city council in 2006,&lt;ref name=kingtwocouncils /&gt; while ''Post'' reporters Marc Fisher and Valerie Strauss in 1997 said the group consisted of "Washington's corporate and governmental elite".&lt;ref name=fisherstraussborn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Marc|last2=Strauss|first2=Valerie|title=Born on Heels of Rights Movement, University Kept Marching in Place|work=The Washington Post|date=January 16, 1997|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Bisnow of the ''Washington Business Journal'' called the Federal City Council "the most important organization in Washington you've never heard of" in 2005&lt;ref name=BisnowBackPage /&gt; and ''Post'' reporter Mike DeBonis described it as "the city's ultimate conglomeration of economic power".&lt;ref name=debonisshades /&gt; ''Post'' reporter Jerry Knight called the organization "self-appointed...business Brahmins" in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight|first=Jerry|title=Business Rethinks Barry|work=The Washington Post|date=March 13, 1989|page=WBIZ34}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Colbert I. King said in 2007 that the Federal City Council was synonymous with the Washington establishment.&lt;ref name=kingfredweknew /&gt;

In 2012, however, ''The Washington Post'' business columnist [[Steven Pearlstein]] argued that the Federal City Council lost much of its influence in the first decade of the 21st century. He argued that, in part, the organization was a victim of its success, having accomplished most of its goals. This has allowed members of the organization to turn their attention elsewhere. He also asserted it lacked effective and visionary leadership, that globalization of local businesses had robbed the organization of support, that excessive partisanship at the federal and state levels make progress nearly impossible, and that many of the problems now confronting the city are regional in nature.&lt;ref name=pearlstein&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearlstein|first=Steven|title=What Washington Needs Now? An Old-Fashioned Business Cabal|work=The Washington Post|date=January 22, 2012|page=G2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its members admit to being self-interested and looking out for their own interests, but claim they do so only to make the city more livable.&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt; The group has also been criticized for ignoring the views of residents affected by Federal City Council projects,&lt;ref name=irwinmakings /&gt; of lacking accountability, and pursuing an agenda at odds with those of the public.&lt;ref name=debonisshades /&gt;

===Avoiding press attention===
The Federal City Council has a longstanding unofficial policy of avoiding press attention and publicity,&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt;&lt;ref name=debonisshades /&gt;&lt;ref name=woodleeclarrklatest /&gt;{{Efn|''The Washington Post'' has consistently supported the Federal City Council's projects in its editorial pages.&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt;}} although in 2016 executive director Anthony Williams said that the group would be implementing some incremental changes to its policy of avoiding the press.&lt;ref name=oconnellspotlight /&gt;

The group's media-avoidance policy has been characterized in various ways. ''[[The Economist]]'' described it in 1988 as a "select and shadowy gathering of some of the city's top business and professional people", "[o]perating on the old-boy network".&lt;ref name=Economist /&gt; In 1997, reporter Bradford McKee called the organization "secretive" and "a shadow chamber of commerce and phantom government..."{{sfn|McKee|1997|pages=48-49}} In 2014, Jonathan O'Connell at ''The Washington Post'' called it "historically insular".&lt;ref name=oconnellspotlight /&gt; Other descriptions of the group's publicity shyness have been more positive. ''Washington Post'' columnist Colbert I. King has dismissed theories that the organization is "a clandestine outfit", noting it merely "work[s] quietly behind the scenes on city issues".&lt;ref name=kingtwocouncils /&gt; This view is echoed by ''Post'' reporters Yolanda Woodlee and Ashlee Clark.&lt;ref name=woodleeclarrklatest /&gt; ''Post'' business columnist Steven Pearlstein has argued that the organization's avoidance of publicity has been one of the reasons it has been so successful.&lt;ref name=pearlstein /&gt;

===Membership===
The Federal City Council is a private, nonprofit organization of business people, civic leaders, former federal executive branch officials, and local and federal politicians.{{sfn|Barras|1998|page=164}}&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt;&lt;ref name=WilliamsExecDir /&gt;&lt;ref name=pyattdance /&gt; Membership in the organization is by invitation only.&lt;ref name=BisnowBackPage /&gt; Members are known as "trustees", and the membership group is known as the Board of Washington Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Names in the News|work=The Washington Post|date=July 29, 2004|page=T6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Washington Business Journal'' says the organization declines to identify its members.&lt;ref name=oconnellspotlight /&gt; However, as of December 2016 the organization provides the names of about 225 trustees and "trustee emeritus" on its Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trustees|website=Federal City Council|date=2016|accessdate=December 14, 2016|url=http://www.federalcitycouncil.org/trustees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal City Council's members include some of the city's wealthiest&lt;ref name=IriwnWoodleeTantalizing&gt;{{cite news|last1=Irwin|first1=Neil|last2=Woodlee|first2=Yolanda|title=10.3 Acres of Tantalizing Potential in D.C.|work=The Washington Post|date=October 16, 2003|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most civic-minded businesspeople.&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt; The members have been described as the representative of the city's "business elite"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Marc|title=District No Joke Now|work=The Washington Post|date=October 26, 2011|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organization as the "key business voice" in the city.&lt;ref name=irwinmakings /&gt;

Reports of the number of members have varied over time. ''The Washington Post'' said it had either 100&lt;ref name=yatescook /&gt; or 137 members in 1975,&lt;ref name=irwinmakings /&gt; 150 members in 1994,&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt; 150 members in 2000&lt;ref name=fehrmainstreet /&gt; and 2002,&lt;ref name=hsudeficits /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timberg|first1=Craig|last2=Leonnig|first2=Carol D.|title=As Barry Plots Another Comeback, Williams Keeps His Thoughts to Himself|work=The Washington Post|date=March 21, 2002|page=T2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 190 members in 2002,&lt;ref name=inbriefdole /&gt; more than 250 members in 2003,&lt;ref name=IriwnWoodleeTantalizing /&gt; 194 members in 2004,&lt;ref name=irwinmakings /&gt;{{Efn|These were mostly white men.

As of 2003, the Federal City Council and the Washington Board of Trade shared many members, [[George Mason University]] professor Michael K. Fauntroy characterized the Federal City Council as "more of an elitist group than the Board".{{sfn|Fauntroy|2003|pages=46-47}} As late as 1994, the Federal City Council's membership was overwhelmingly white.&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt; Terence C. Golden, the organization's chairman in 2004, admitted, "This was basically a white man's business organization in a city that was very divided".&lt;ref name=irwinmonday /&gt;

The Federal City Council at one point had an ''ex officio'' class of membership. These individuals include people such as [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] secretaries and local university presidents. As of 1994, there were about 50 ex-officio members.&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt;

===Governance, presidents, and chairmen===
Leadership of the Federal City Council consists of a president and a chairman of the Washington Board of Trustees. A presidential term is one year. A president may succeed him or her self, there are no term limits, and most presidents serve several years. The board meets twice a year.&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt; The chairman is assisted by a vice chairman.&lt;ref name=Mccartneyblowup /&gt; Additional officers include a [[Secretary (title)|secretary]]; [[treasurer]]; two vice presidents; vice presidents for federal relations, membership, membership engagement, nominations, and strategic planning; a [[general counsel]]; and the chief executive officer/executive director.&lt;ref name=fccofficers /&gt;

The board elects 28 members to serve on an executive committee, which meets monthly and governs the organization between board meetings.&lt;ref name=leonhardtchallenges /&gt; ''Ex officio'' members of the executive committee (who have no voting rights) include the chairs of the Federal City Council's standing committees and task forces, the chair of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, and the chair of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Committee|website=Federal City Council|date=2016|accessdate=December 14, 2016|url=http://www.federalcitycouncil.org/executive-committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the organization established a "national advisory board" consisting of individuals who may have once lived in Washington, D.C., or who have a strong interest in the city but do not live there. These individuals were often former members of Congress, former executive branch department heads, or corporate executives.&lt;ref name=eisendrive /&gt; This body apparently no longer exists.

A partial list of the presidents of the Federal City Council includes:
# George A.

Hertell was a co-founder of '''Goldman, Antonetti, Ferraiuoli, Axtmayer and Hertell''', now the third largest full service law firm in Puerto Rico. From 1992-96, Hertell was managing director for the Caribbean and Latin America affairs at ''Black, Kelly, Scruggs &amp; Healey'', a government and public affairs company based in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 1989, he served as a member of the Commission to Review U.S. Magistrates for Reappointment of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.

Hertell was sworn in as the United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic on November 8, 2001.  At the time the Dominican Republic was the fourth largest trading partner of the United States in the Western Hemisphere after Canada, Brazil and Mexico and the largest economy in Central America and the Caribbean. In April 2007, Hertell officially left his post as ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dominicantoday.com/app/article.aspx?id=23455 U.S. ambassador Hans Hertell and his wife Marie bid farewell tonight], dominicantoday.com; accessed April 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Chargé d'affaires]] Roland W.

'''The Helmsley Building''' is a 35-story building located at 230 [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] between [[45th Street (Manhattan)|East 45th]] and [[46th Street (Manhattan)|East 46th]] Streets in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]], which was built in 1929 as the '''New York Central Building''', and was designed by [[Warren &amp; Wetmore]], the architects of [[Grand Central Terminal]], in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]]. Before the completion of the Pan Am Building—now the [[MetLife Building]]—this building stood out over the city's second most prestigious avenue as the tallest structure in the great "Terminal City" complex around Grand Central.&lt;ref name="helmsley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecityreview.com/helmsley.html|title=The Helmsley Building|accessdate=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIA"&gt;White, Norval &amp; Willensky, Elliot; ''[[American Institute of Architects|AIA]] Guide to New York City'', 4th Edition; New York Chapter, [[American Institute of Architects]]; Crown Publishers/Random House. 2000. {{ISBN|0-8129-3106-8}}; {{ISBN|0-8129-3107-6}}. p.277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic exits and enters the [[Park Avenue Viaduct]] through the building, through two portals, one for uptown traffic and one for downtown. They connect to Park Avenue proper at East 46th Street.

The building was designated a New York City Landmark in 1987.&lt;ref name="Landmarks"&gt;Dolkart, Matthew A. MO &amp; Postal, Matthew A.: ''Guide to New York City Landmarks; Third Edition'': The [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]; John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc; 2004. {{ISBN|0-471-36900-4}}. P.118.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== New York Central Building ===
Before the electrification of the [[New York Central Railroad]] in 1912–1913, the neighborhood north of Grand Central Terminal was one of open-air railway yards and tracks used by steam locomotives. The electrification and subsequent covering of the yards enabled the continuation of Park Avenue to the north and the construction of new buildings (with curious foundations). Among them was the New York Central Building.&lt;ref name="helmsley"/&gt;

In 1913, '''New York Central''' unveiled a concept for a visual termination point in the city. Although the original plan was to have this termination point be over New York Central's [[Grand Central Terminal]], the concept was instead realized in the form of '''The New York Central Building''' just across the street to the north. The New York Central Railroad Company built their 34-story headquarters at 230 [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Ave.]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1929.

On September 10, 1931, [[capo di tutti capi]] [[Salvatore Maranzano]] was murdered in his ninth-floor office here by hitmen sent by [[Lucky Luciano]] and [[Vito Genovese]], ambitious underlings whom Maranzano had hired [[Vincent Coll|Vincent "Mad Dog" Coll]] to kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysonglines.com/4av.htm|title=4th Avenue: New York Songlines|accessdate=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portal to Park Avenue.jpg|thumb|200px|Uptown traffic exits the [[Park Avenue Viaduct]] through the eastern portal of the Helmsley Building during "Summer Streets", when 7 miles of New York City streets are closed to vehicular traffic.]]

====Exterior====
The building is a slab-sided skyscraper between East 45th and East 46th Street, with a distinctive design that includes a means of transporting Park Avenue from street level to the divided aerial highway that passes through the building, and then around Grand Central Terminal to 42nd Street, and then back to street level. The top of the building is pyramidal, and capped by an ornate [[cupola]].&lt;ref name="Landmarks"/&gt;

====Interior====
"The impressive lobby, planned as a corridor connecting 45th and 46th Streets, echoes the magnificence of the exterior. The design and ornamentation celebrate the prowess of the New York Central Railroad, which had its headquarters on the premises. A sense of imperial grandeur is created by marble walls and bronze detail, which includes extensive use of the railroad’s initials. The Chinese Red elevator doors open into cabs with red walls, wood moldings, gift domes, and painted [[cloudscape (art)|cloudscapes]]".&lt;ref name="Landmarks"/&gt;

=== New York General Building ===
When [[New York Central Railroad Company|New York Central]] sold the building, [[General Tire|General Tire &amp; Rubber Company]] renamed the building the '''New York General Building'''. The building was easily renamed as the "C" and "T" in Central were chiseled into "G" and "E" respectively.

=== The Helmsley Building ===
When General Tire &amp; Rubber Company sold the building to Helmsley-Spear, [[Leona Helmsley]] renamed the building '''The Helmsley Building''', which is its current name. The deal in which the ownership of this {{convert|2300000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} building, which was owned by the [[Helmsley-Spear|Helmsley-Spear Management]] until August 1998, changed hands stipulated that the building would not be renamed again. The building was purchased by Max Capital for $253 million, but in 2006 was sold again to [[Istithmar]], an investment firm owned by the royal family of Dubai, for $705 million. It was later sold to [[Goldman Sachs]] in 2007 for over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=114271 Emporis: 230 Park Avenue]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the building was sold for $1.2 billion to property firm [[RXR Realty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Herbert Lash |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/05/us-usa-property-mondayproperties-helmsle-idUSKBN0NQ29M20150505 |title= New York's Helmsley Building sold for $1.2 billion to RXR Reality |publisher=Reuters |date=5 May 2015 |accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''INID''' is an [[acronym]] for '''Internationally agreed Numbers for the Identification of (bibliographic) Data'''.&lt;ref name="st9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/pdf/03-09-01.pdf|title=WIPO standard ST.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; INID codes are used by [[patent office]]s worldwide for indicating specific bibliographic data items on the title pages of [[patent]]s and patent application publications.  INID codes use Arabic numerals, and so are language-independent. For example, number ''(30)'' indicates priority data, and ''(51)'' technical area according to the [[International Patent Classification]] (IPC).&lt;ref&gt;Example for INID codes on the [http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;F=0&amp;IDX=EP0123456&amp;QPN=EP0123456 front page] of {{Patent|EP|0123456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INID codes are standardised by [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in ST.9.&lt;ref name="st9" /&gt;

'''Independent Contractors of Australia (ICA)''' was established in 1999, with the aim to create a national association to represent [[independent contractors]] in the Australian workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/ken-phillips-28588.html Australian Broadcasting Commission ''The Drum'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://2011.businesscongress.com.au/speaker/ken-phillips/ Australian Chambers Business Congress 1-3 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairwork.gov.au/resources/fact-sheets/workplace-rights/Pages/independent-contractors-and-emplyees-fact-sheet.aspx ''Fairwork Australia'' Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Independent contractors]] operate in the workplace by contracting out their services rather than being engaged under an employment agreement. They are able to be distinguished from employees by some key differences. [[Independent contractors]] operate their business entity in order to provide a good or service for an agreed price usually stipulated in a commercial contract. Other differences are that in most cases [[independent contractors]] are paid for the results they achieve; provide the materials and equipment needed to complete the work they do and are free to delegate their work to others. Also, they are free to accept or refuse work and may make a profit or a loss from the contracts they enter into with their clients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business.gov.au/BusinessTopics/Independentcontractors/Documents/Independentcontractorstheessentialhandbook.pdf ''Independent Contractors The Essential Handbook'' Commonwealth of Australia (Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education)2011 pp 2-3]&lt;/ref&gt; ICA is a not-for-profit association incorporated under the Associations Incorporation Act (1981) of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business.gov.au/GBDirectory/I/Pages/IndependentContractorsofAustralia.aspx ''Directory of Government and Business Associations'' in Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

ICA is governed by a [[Board of directors|Board]] under the rules established by its [[Articles of Association]].&lt;ref name =brochure&gt;[http://www.independentcontractors.net.au/Downloads/about/ICA-Brochure-June-2014.pdf ICA brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Articles of Association ===

The articles&lt;ref name =brochure/&gt; under which ICA was established determine that the purpose of the association is:
# to uphold and defend the right of all eligible Australians to engage in the [[labour market]] as free and [[independent contractors]], and to be recognised by [[governments]], tax officials and regulators as [[independent contractors]];
# to engage in lobbying and public debate to ensure that the Australian community is aware that if Australians' rights to engage freely in the labour market are impaired or denied, then the rights of all Australians to live in freedom will be at risk;
# to maintain the common law distinctions which the courts have made between employment and contract in [[labour market]] relationships;
# to take all such action as the association or the committee shall think conducive to the attainment of these objectives.

=== Board ===

The ICA constitution requires the election of ten Board members, with four who are [[independent contractors]], up to at least three who are company members, and up to three who are association members. The elected Board can then appoint an additional two members.

=== Past presidents ===

* The Hon [[Norman Lacy]] (November 2008 – Present)
* Marie-Louise MacDonald (December 2007-November 2008)
* Michael Kelson (April 2007-December 2007) 
* Angela MacRae (July 2005-April 2007) 
* [[Bob Day]] (2001-July 2005)

=== Executive Director ===

Ken Phillips has been Executive Director of ICA since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessspectator.com.au/bs.nsf/Article/contractors-small-business-law-pd20091012-WR3MK?OpenDocument&amp;src=is&amp;cat=hr%20_%20education-al Business Spectator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenationalsmallbusinesssummit.com.au/presenters/ken-phillips The NAB National Small Business Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/author.asp?id=111 Online Opinion]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding, membership, and location==

ICA is funded by its membership fees and revenue raised from sponsorship, advertising and events. Membership is open to [[independent contractors]]; to companies who engage [[independent contractors]]; and to industry associations whose members engage independent contractors. Membership fees range from $50 per annum for individual affiliate members to $12,000 per annum for industry associations with more than 201 member companies.&lt;ref name =brochure/&gt;

There are 1.1 million [[independent contractors]] in the Australian workforce of 11.3 million. However, Other Business Operators (OBOs) are also self-employed and make up another 1 million workers.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) separates OBOs from independent contractors on the basis that they are self-employed workers whose primary activity is managing others (i.e. they have employees) and/or selling goods and services to earn income rather than relying on the provision of their labour. Whereas independent contractors are defined as workers who provide their time and labour and who only manage themselves. Hence the self-employed total 2.1 million and make up 18.6% of the total workforce.&lt;ref&gt;CFMEU, ''Race to the Bottom - Sham Contracting in Australia's Construction Industry. A report by CFMEU Construction &amp; General'', March 2011, p 11&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''international business company''' or '''international business corporation''' ('''IBC''') is an [[offshore company]] formed under the laws of some [[jurisdiction]]s as a tax neutral company which is usually limited in terms of the activities it may conduct in, but not necessarily from, the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated.  While not taxable in the country of incorporation, an IBC or its owners, if resident in a country having "controlled foreign corporation" rules for instance can be taxable in other jurisdictions.   

==Features==
Characteristics of an IBC vary by jurisdiction, but will usually include:
[[File:Chart of an offshore company structure.jpg|thumb|Chart of an offshore company structure]]
* exemption from local corporate taxation and stamp duty, provided that the company engages in no local business (annual agent's fees and company registration taxes are still payable, which are normally a few hundred U.S. dollars per year) 
* preservation of confidentiality of the beneficial owner of the company 
* wide corporate powers to engage in different businesses and activities
* abrogation or restriction of the requirement to demonstrate [[corporate benefit]]
* the ability to issue [[stock|shares]] in either [[Registered instrument|registered]] or [[Bearer instrument|bearer]] form (although many countries have restricted or eliminated bearer shares now)
* an abrogation of any requirements to appoint local directors or officers
* provision for a local [[registered agent]] or registered office

It must be noted that all of the above characteristics are also attributable to many "onshore" countries which have either a residency or territorial based tax system where setting up a company, LLC or LLP in the jurisdiction along with the use of "nominees" will offer all of the above characteristics.  US LLCs, UK LLPs and Hong Kong companies are all examples which are widely used in similar capacity to IBCs and which meet all of the characteristics above. 

However, under pressure from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF), most offshore jurisdictions have removed or are removing the "ring fencing" of IBCs from local taxation.  In most of the jurisdictions, this has been accompanied by reductions of levels of corporate tax to zero to avoid damaging the offshore finance industry.  

In contrast, Seychelles residents are legally able to own and operate a Seychelles IBC as long as the IBC is not conducting business within Seychelles.  Seychelles also has a "territorial" tax system meaning that Seychelles residents are only taxed on their locally sourced income.  Therefore, there is no advantage to non-residents over residents and claims of "ring fencing" have no merit on the Seychelles IBC.  This has been, and continues to be, used successfully by Seychelles in defense of the Seychelles IBC vs. international bodies such as the OECD and FATF.  Boosting the defense even more is that there are no restrictions on a Seychelles IBC owning shares of a Seychelles domestic company.

Further, most jurisdictions have either eliminated or highly restricted the issuing of bearer shares by IBCs due to international pressures.

==The IBC legal entry==
An IBC is a legal entity incorporated under specific legislation which is free from all local taxes (except small fixed annual fees). Typically the IBC is limited in the activities it may conduct in, but not necessarily from, the country of incorporation. [[Anguilla]], [[Bahamas]], [[Belize]], [[Dominica]], [[Nevis]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St Vincent]] and [[Seychelles]] have special IBC legislation in place.  The [[British Virgin Islands]] and [[Gibraltar]] formerly had popular IBC regimes, but in each case the relevant legislation has been repealed.&lt;ref&gt;For BVI, see [[BVI Business Companies Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical IBC Uses==

IBCs are offshore companies that are most commonly used for [[offshore bank]]ing to conduct international trade, investment activities, as a [[special purpose entity]], by professionals and for asset protection. Offshore companies can be involved in buying and selling goods and services, hold bank accounts and operate businesses. IBCs are also commonly used for the ownership of real property and land; for ownership of intellectual property, licensing and franchising; personal service by individuals working overseas and offshore e-business among other things.

The term [[Offshore company]] seems more commonly used than International Business Company (IBC).  Although all IBCs are necessarily offshore companies, not all offshore companies are IBCs.  Both terms refer broadly to a similar type of corporate structure.  The term 'offshore' is used to refer to a company, or bank account, set up outside the jurisdiction of residence or place of doing business.

Rockefeller's maternal grandfather was former U.S. Senator [[Charles H.

Humphries played college basketball for the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Minnesota Golden Gophers]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], and for the [[United States men's national basketball team]].

==Early years==
Humphries was born in Minnesota to Debra and William Humphries. His father was a [[American football|football]] player, at the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=usa&gt;{{cite web|title=USA Basketball Bio: Kris Humphries |url=http://www.usabasketball.com/biosmen/kris_humphries_bio.html |work=USABasketball.com |accessdate=April 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327043119/http://www.usabasketball.com/biosmen/kris_humphries_bio.html |archivedate=March 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humphries is half African-American from his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kim Kardashian &amp; Kris Humphries To Wed This Summer!

His first success in sports came in competitive swimming, where he was the top 10-year-old in the nation in six events, first, beating young [[Michael Phelps]] in the remaining events. Kris Humphries held the US national record for the 50-meter freestyle for 10 and under boys for 18 years until it was recently broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA Swimming National Age Group Records|url=http://usaswimming.org/_Rainbow/Documents/e8f10a43-499e-4c61-a6e3-3d6abe76f29d/USA%20SWIMMING%20NATIONAL%20A%20G%20%20RECORDS%20L%20C.pdf|work=USASwimming.org|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 12 he gave up swimming to pursue a career in basketball.

Humphries attended [[Hopkins High School]], where he led the team to a 25–2 record in 2002 and its first Minnesota state championship in 49 years.&lt;ref name=usa/&gt; He was named a 2003 [[McDonald's All-American Team|McDonald's All-American]] and named Second Team All-USA by [[USA Today]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Kris Humphries Info Page – Bio|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/kris_humphries/bio/|work=NBA.com|accessdate=April 14, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306120916/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/kris_humphries/bio/|archivedate=March 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named to the Super 25 Basketball Team by USA Today, named [[Minnesota Mr. Basketball]], and state player of the year by the [[Minneapolis Star Tribune]] and College Basketball News.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He was one of 10 finalists for the 2003 Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award, averaging a [[Double-double|double double]] in his final three seasons, averaging 25.7 [[point (basketball)|points]], 11.4 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and 5.0 [[assist (basketball)|assists]] a game as a senior.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Considered a five-star recruit by [[Rivals.com]], Humphries was listed as the No. 2 power forward and the No. 15 player in the nation in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kris Humphries Recruiting Profile|url=https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/maple/4700|work=Rivals.com|accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humphries accepted a scholarship offer to [[Duke University]], but later reconsidered and chose the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duke releases McDonald's recruit Kris Humphries|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/acc/2003-05-19-duke-humphries_x.htm|work=USAToday.com|date=May 19, 2003|accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
At Minnesota, Humphries was named 2004 [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] Freshman of the Year and named to the All-Big Ten First Team by the media and coaches. He was named Honorable Mention All-America by the [[Associated Press]] and by Rivals.com. He was the first freshman to lead the Big Ten in scoring and rebounding in the same season. He scored in double figures in all 29 games, with 16 point/rebound double-doubles on the season for Minnesota. He averaged 21.7 points and 10.1 rebounds (both tops in the Big Ten), while shooting .444 [[field goal percentage|percent from the field]] and .742 [[free throw|from the line]]. On February 18, 2004 he set a school record with 36 points in a game against [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana]]. He also set a school record for most points by a freshman for a season with 629 and was the first Big Ten freshman to be named conference Player of the Week in two of the first three weeks of the season. Humphries only played one season for Minnesota before declaring for the NBA Draft.

Although Humphries was personally successful at Minnesota, the team struggled. The Gophers finished 12–18, with a 3–13 record in the Big Ten during Humphries' lone season, tying Penn State for the worst record in the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCAA Division I Basketball Standings - 2003-04|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/standings/_/year/2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics accused Humphries of playing selfishly, preferring to inflate his statistics and NBA draft stock rather than help the team win games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Rand |title=Top recruits have had problems at U |url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/gophers/83305812.html?page=2&amp;c=y |work=StarTribune.com |date=February 10, 2010 |accessdate=February 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210225938/http://www.startribune.com/sports/gophers/83305812.html?page=2&amp;c=y |archivedate=February 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team had a .500 record before his arrival and finished with a 10–6 conference record in the season after he left.

==Professional career==

===Utah Jazz (2004–2006)===
Humphries was [[NBA draft|drafted]] by the [[Utah Jazz]] with the 14th overall selection in the [[2004 NBA draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HUMPHRIES TAKEN BY UTAH WITH 14TH PICK OF NBA DRAFT|url=http://www.gophersports.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/062504aaa.html|work=GopherSports.com|date=June 25, 2004|accessdate=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kris Humphries Statistics|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/humphkr01.html|work=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent two seasons with the Jazz, averaging 3.6 ppg and 2.7 rpg in 11.6 minutes per game.&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite web|title=Kris Humphries Info Page – Career Stats and Totals|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/kris_humphries/|work=NBA.com|accessdate=April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington Wizards (2014–2016)===
[[File:Kris Humphries (15698676076).jpg|thumbnail|Humphries warming-up with Wizards in November 2014.]]
On July 19, 2014, Humphries was acquired by the [[Washington Wizards]] in a sign-and-trade deal that sent a protected 2015 second round pick and a trade exception to the Boston Celtics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/pressrelease/celtics-complete-trade-wizards|title=Celtics Complete Trade with Wizards|work=NBA.com|date=July 19, 2014|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 9, 2014, he underwent successful surgery to repair nerve damage in his right small finger, and was subsequently sidelined for three to four weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wizardsmysticstoday.monumentalnetwork.com/2014/10/10/wizards-injury-update|title=WIZARDS INJURY UPDATE|work=WizardsMysticsToday.MonumentalNetwork.com|date=October 10, 2015|accessdate=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of her death, she bequeathed Montpelier to the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] and established an endowment for its maintenance; it had been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]]. During the National Trust's major restoration of the mansion in 2003–2008 to its design during the time of Madison's residency, it reduced the house from the 55-room structure developed by the du Pont family back to its original 22 rooms.

She was a great-granddaughter of [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vetmed.vt.edu/emc/welcome/mds.asp |title=Marion duPont Scott |accessdate=2009-08-20 |quote= |publisher=[[Virginia Tech]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of French Huguenot descent, the [[Du Pont family]] usually spell the family name as "du Pont" in the French style. Both Marion and her brother, [[William duPont, Jr.]], chose to spell their surname conjoined.

Marion grew up riding in the hunt country of Virginia and became an accomplished horsewoman. She became interested in racing as well and developed what became known as the Montpelier Stable. She owned and bred Thoroughbreds for both flat and steeplechase racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginialiving.com/virginiana/history/a-tomboys-legacy/ |title=A Tomboy's Legacy |last1=Sargent |first1=Sarah |last2= |first2= |date=March 3, 2016 |website= [[Virginia Living]]|publisher=Cape Fear Publishing |access-date=June 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, she and her brother William developed a number of racing venues, including [[Delaware Park Racetrack|Delaware Park]], which he designed in 1937 in Delaware;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delpark.com/about_history.php "History of Delaware Park"], Official Website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fair Hill Training Center|Fair Hill]], home to the National Steeplechase Association Headquarters and its race course in Maryland, on more than 5,000 acres of land formerly owned by William duPont, Jr.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/central/fairhill.asp Fairhill NMRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124050249/http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/central/fairhill.asp |date=2012-01-24 }}, Official website&lt;/ref&gt; and the Springdale Race Course, Camden, South Carolina, home of the [[Carolina Cup]] and the Colonial Cup races.&lt;ref name="Races"&gt;[http://www.montpelierraces.org "History of Montpelier Races"], Montpelier Hunt Races website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolina-cup.org/ "Springdale Race Course"], Carolina Cup Website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, she and her brother William founded the Montpelier Steeplechase Hunt Races, held on the grounds of the estate. They are held the first Saturday in November each year at the Montpelier horse racing [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] course. It is a National Steeplechase Association event.&lt;ref name="Races"/&gt;

Marion was married to Thomas Hugh Somerville (1895–1963), an inspector with [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Hugh Somerville," 1920 U. S. Federal Census for Orange Country, Virginia, accessed on ancestry.com. According to the 1930 U. S. Federal Census, he had no occupation that year and lived at Montpelier with Marion. Date of death from the Social Security Death Index, at ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a son of Samuel Wilson Somerville of [[Culpeper, Virginia]]. They married on 28 December 1925 and divorced in 1935. They had no children.

Secondly, she married [[Randolph Scott]], an American movie actor, in 1936. (He had been best man at her first wedding.) They divorced in 1939; they had no children.

She also owned the 25 acre Holly Hedge estate in [[Camden, South Carolina]] from 1944 until her death in 1983. This large antebellum home was built in 1835 and included a modern ten stall horse barn. She purchased the Springdale Race Course in Camden SC as well and also owned a large equine training facility there. Her legacy lives in Camden, SC with the annual steeplechase "Marion duPont Scott's Colonial Cup" that she founded in 1970. Scott Park adjacent to her previous training facility is a city park on land that she donated to the city. Battleship Road in Camden, SC is named after her famous horse.

In 1976, she compiled and published her book "Montpelier-The Recollections of Marion duPont Scott," with help from writer Gerald Strine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vetmed.vt.edu/emc/welcome/mds.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  Marion Scott had additions made to Montpelier for her own use, including wings that brought the total of rooms up to 55. At her death in 1983, Marion had bequeathed the estate, designated a [[National Historic Landmark]], to the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]. Her father's will had said that if she were childless, the property would be inherited by her brother and his children. Her will included a provision for his children to sell or give their interests in the property to the National Trust or forfeit their share of a separate $3.1 million trust. In addition, she provided $10 million to the National Trust to buy the property and to establish an endowment. As her brother had died in 1965, his five children inherited Montpelier. Although two nephews sued the National Trust in an effort to break the will, they finally sold their interests in 1984.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3W0pAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wekDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5199,1037087&amp;dq=evelyn+du+pont+donaldson&amp;hl=en Marjorie Hunter (NY Times News Service), "James Madison's Montpelier to become museum:], ''Gainesville Sun''], 18 November 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] took over the property, it undertook a major restoration in the 2000s to return it to its design when occupied by James and Dolley Madison in the early 1800s. It reduced the size to the original 22 rooms and is trying to locate the original furnishings or goods of the same period.

==Montpelier Stable==
Marion Scott owned [[Thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|racehorses]] that competed under her ''[[Glossary of North American horse racing|nom de course]]'', Montpelier Stable, in both [[Flat racing]] and [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechase]]. The graves and tombstones of three of her racehorses lie to the left of the Montpelier mansion. [[Battleship (horse)|Battleship]] and Annapolis were sons of [[Man o' War]]. Battleship is the only horse in history to win both the [[American Grand National]] and the [[Grand National|British Grand National]] [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase races]].

=== Awards ===
Scott's horse [[Mongo (horse)|Mongo]] was voted the 1963 [[American Champion Male Turf Horse]]. Following the creation of the [[Eclipse Award]]s in 1971, her horse [[Soothsayer (steeplechase horse)|Soothsayer]] was voted the 1972 [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Steeplechase horse|American Champion Steeplechase Horse]]. In 1976 [[Proud Delta]] was voted [[American Champion Older Female Horse]].

=== Equine Medical Center ===
:See [http://www.vetmed.vt.edu/emc/ Marion duPont Scott Center]
She bequeathed funds to [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] to establish an equine medical center. It was founded in 1984 in [[Leesburg, Virginia]], through her gift. A stipulation of the gift called for the Westmoreland Davis Memorial Foundation, which operates [[Morven Park]], to offer 200 acres upon which the medical center was built. At the end of this 100-year agreement, the land reverts back to Morven Park. The Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center at Morven Park is a full-service [[equine]] [[hospital]] that offers advanced specialty care, 24-hour emergency treatment and diagnostic services for all ages and breeds of horses. The hospital sees approximately 3,000 horses annually, and employs 120 equine healthcare professionals. The Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center at Morven Park is affiliated with the [[Virginia–Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine]].

'''Marketing research''' is "the process or set of processes that links the producers, customers, and end users to the marketer through information used to identify and define marketing opportunities and problems; generate, refine, and evaluate marketing actions; monitor marketing performance; and improve understanding of marketing as a process. 
Marketing research specifies the information required to address these issues, designs the method for collecting information, manages and implements the data collection process, analyzes the results, and communicates the findings and their implications."&lt;ref&gt;''The Definition of Marketing,'' [[American Marketing Association]]. http://www.marketingpower.com/AboutAMA/Pages/DefinitionofMarketing.aspx. Retrieved 2011-12-02. Approved by the AMA Board of Directors in October 2007, the [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the systematic gathering, recording, and analysis of [[qualitative data|qualitative]] and [[quantitative data|quantitative]] data about issues relating to [[marketing]] products and services. The goal of marketing research is to identify and assess how changing elements of the [[marketing mix]] impacts [[customer behavior]]. The term is commonly interchanged with [[market research]]; however, expert practitioners may wish to draw a distinction, in that ''market'' research is concerned specifically with [[markets]], while ''marketing'' research is concerned specifically about marketing processes.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{Citation  | last = McDonald  | first = Malcolm | title = Marketing Plans  | place = Oxford, England  | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann  | year = 2007   | edition = 6th  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=os0K20MsepoC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=%22market+research+vs.+marketing+research%22&amp;q=  | isbn = 978-0-7506-8386-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Marketing research is often partitioned into two sets of categorical pairs, either by target market:

* [[Consumer]] marketing research, and
* [[Business-to-business]] (B2B) marketing research.

Or, alternatively, by methodological approach:

* [[Qualitative marketing research]], and
* [[Quantitative marketing research]].

Consumer marketing research is a form of applied [[sociology]] that concentrates on understanding the preferences, attitudes, and behaviors of [[consumer]]s in a [[market economy|market-based economy]], and it aims to understand the effects and comparative success of [[marketing campaign]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The field of consumer marketing research as a statistical science was pioneered by [[Arthur Nielsen]] with the founding of the [[ACNielsen]] Company in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nielsenmedia.com/nc/portal/site/Public/menuitem.d7deb7344c5a8ffe818e6c1047a062a0/?vgnextoid=10097f5e82854010VgnVCM100000880a260aRCRD&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, marketing research may also be described as the systematic and objective identification, collection, analysis, and dissemination of information for the purpose of assisting management in [[decision making]] related to the identification and solution of problems and opportunities in marketing.&lt;ref name="Malhotra"&gt;{{Citation

==Role==
The purpose of marketing research (MR) is to provide management with relevant, accurate, reliable, valid, and up to date [[market information]]. Competitive marketing environment and the ever-increasing costs attributed to poor decision making require that marketing research provide sound information. Sound decisions are not based on gut feeling, intuition, or even pure judgment.

[[Marketing management|Manager]]s make numerous strategic and tactical decisions in the process of identifying and satisfying customer needs. They make decisions about potential opportunities, target market selection, market segmentation, planning and implementing marketing programs, marketing performance, and control. These decisions are complicated by interactions between the controllable marketing variables of product, [[pricing]], promotion, and distribution. Further complications are added by uncontrollable environmental factors such as general economic conditions, technology, [[public policies]] and laws, political environment, competition, and social and cultural changes. Another factor in this mix is the complexity of [[consumer]]s. Marketing research helps the marketing manager link the marketing variables with the environment and the consumers. It helps remove some of the uncertainty by providing relevant information about the marketing variables, environment, and consumers.  In the absence of relevant information, consumers' response to marketing programs cannot be predicted reliably or accurately. Ongoing [[marketing]] research programs provide information on controllable and non-controllable factors and consumers; this information enhances the effectiveness of decisions made by marketing managers.&lt;ref name="Twedt"&gt;{{Citation

Traditionally, marketing researchers were responsible for providing the relevant information and marketing decisions were made by the managers. However, the roles are changing and marketing researchers are becoming more involved in decision making, whereas marketing managers are becoming more involved with research. The role of marketing research in managerial decision making is explained further using the framework of the [[Decision-making#DECIDE|DECIDE]] model.

==History==
{{See|History of marketing}}

Evidence for commercial research being gathered informally dates to the Medieval period. In 1380, the German textile manufacturer, [[Johann Fugger]], travelled from Augsburg to Graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry. He exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas. Although, this type of information would have been termed "commercial intelligence" at the time, it created a precedent for the systemic collection of marketing information.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, S.E., ''Market Research: Text and Cases'', 2nd ed., Himalaya Publishing House, 2014, p. 21  [www.himpub.com/documents/Chapter873.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the European age of discovery, industrial houses began to import exotic, luxury goods - calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum  and coffee from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century,'' Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; International traders began to demand information that could be used for marketing decisions. During this period, [[Daniel Defoe]], a London merchant, published information on trade and economic resources of England and Scotland. Defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to the state of trade including; ''Trade of Britain Stated,'' (1707); ''Trade of Scotland with France,'' (1713) and ''The Trade to India Critically and Calmly Considered,'' (1720) - all of which provided merchants and traders with important information on which to base business decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Backscheider,  P.R., ''Daniel Defoe: His Life,'' Baltimore, Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the late 18th-century, European and North-American economies were characteristed by local production and consumption. Produce, household goods and tools were produced by local artisans or farmers with exchange taking place in local markets or fairs.  Under these conditions, the need for marketing information was minimail. However, the rise of mass-production following the industrial revolution, combined with improved transportation systems of the early 19th-century, led to the creation of national markets and ultimately, stimulated the need for more detailed information about customers, competitors, distribution systems and market communications.&lt;ref&gt;Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th-century, manufacturers were exploring ways to understand the different market needs and behaviours of groups of consumers. A study of the German book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation as early as the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Fullerton, R.A., "Segmentation Strategies and Practices in the 19th-Century German Book Trade: A Case Study in the Development of a Major Marketing Technique", in ''Historical Perspectives in Consumer Research: National and International Perspectives,'' Jagdish N. Sheth and Chin Tiong Tan (eds), Singapore, Association for Consumer Research, pp 135-139&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1880s, German toy manufacturers were producing models of [[tin toys]] for specific geographic markets; London omnibuses and ambulances destined for the British market; French postal delivery vans for Continental Europe and American locomotives intended for sale in America.&lt;ref&gt;Pressland, David, ''Book of Penny Toys,'' Pei International, 1991; Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood, Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; Such activities suggest that sufficient market information was collected to support detailed market segmentation.

In 1895, American advertising agency, N. H. Ayer &amp; Son, used telegraph to contact publishers and state officials throughout the country about grain production, in an effort to construct an advertising schedule for client, Nichols-Shephard company, an agricultural machinery company in what many scholars believe is the first application of marketing research to solve a marketing/ advertising problem)&lt;ref&gt;Lockley, L.K., "Notes on the History of Marketing Research,' ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 14, no. 5, 1950, pp. 733-736 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1246952?seq=1#fndtn-page_scan_tab_contents Online: Also note that some sources provide an earlier date of 1879 for this event; See for instance: Kenneth E. Clow, Karen E. James, ''Essentials of Marketing Research: Putting Research Into Practice,'' p. 10 [but the first cited source is more likely to be reliable because journal articles are peer-reviewed, while text-books do not undergo rigorous reviewing and as a consequence are more error-prone]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1902 and 1910, George B Waldron, working at Mahin's Advertising Agency in the United States used tax registers, city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated vs illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in a very early example of simple market segmentation.&lt;ref name="Jones, G.D.B 2016, p. 66"&gt;Jones, G.D.B. and Tadajewski, M. (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockley, L.C., "Notes on the History of Marketing Research", ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 14, No. 5, 1950, pp. 733–736&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 [[Charles Coolidge Parlin]] was appointed as the Manager of the Commercial Research Division of the Advertising Department of the Curtis Publishing Company, thereby establishing the first in-house market research department - an event that has been described as marking the beginnings of organised marketing research.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, S., ''Market Research: Text and Cases,'' 2nd ed., Himalaya Publishing House, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His aim was to turn market research into a science. Parlin published a number of studies of various product-markets including agriculture (1911); consumer goods (c.1911); department store lines (1912) a five-volume study of automobiles (1914).&lt;ref&gt;Boorstin, J. D., ''Charles Coolidge Parlin,'' in: ''The Americans: The Democratic Experience,'' Random House, 1974, [e-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 Paul Cherington improved on primitive forms of demographic market segmentation when he developed the 'ABCD' household typology; the first socio-demographic segmentation tool.&lt;ref name="Jones, G.D.B 2016, p. 66" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockley, L.C., "Notes on the History of Marketing Research", ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 14, no. 5, 1950, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, market researchers such as [[Ernest Dichter]] recognised that demographics alone were insufficient to explain different marketing behaviours and began exploring the use of lifestyles, attitudes, values, beliefs and culture to segment markets.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson B. S.  and Levy, J., "A History of the Concept of Branding: Practice and Theory", ''Journal of Historical Research in Marketing,'' vol. 4, no. 3, 2012, pp. 347-368; DOI:10.1108/17557501211252934&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first three decades of the 20th-century, advertising agencies and marketing departments developed the basic techniques used in quantitative and qualitative research - survey methods, questionnaires, gallup polls etc. As early as 1901, Walter B Scott was undertaking experimental research for the Agate Club of Chicago.&lt;ref name="Online"&gt;Lockley, L.C., "Notes on the History of Marketing Research," ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 14, no. 5, 1950, pp. 733-736 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1246952?seq=1#fndtn-page_scan_tab_contents Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, George B Waldron was carrying out qualitative research for Mahins Advertising Agency.&lt;ref name="Online"/&gt; In 1919, the first book on commercial research was published, ''Commercial Research: An Outline of Working Principles'' by Professor C.S. Duncan of the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name="Petty, R.D. 2016, p. 108"&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in: D.G. Brian Jones, Mark Tadajewski (eds), ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Adequate knowledge of consumer preferences was a key to survival in the face of increasingly competitive markets.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, F., "Building Knowledge about the Consumer: The Emergence of Market Research in the Motion Picture Industry,"  ''Business History'', vol. 45, no. 1, 2003, pp 101-127&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, advertising agencies, such as [[J Walter Thompson]] (JWT), were conducting research on the ''how'' and ''why'' consumers used brands, so that they could recommend appropriate advertising copy to manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Petty, R.D. 2016, p. 108"/&gt;

The advent of commercial radio in the 1920s, and television in the 1940s, led a number of market research companies to develop the means to measure audience size and audience composition. In 1923, [[Arthur Nielsen]] founded market research company, A C Nielsen and over next decade pioneered the measurement of radio audiences. He subsequently applied his methods to the measurement of television audiences. Around the same time, [[Daniel Starch]] developed measures for testing advertising copy effectiveness in print media (newspapers and magazines), and these subsequently became known as Starch scores (and are still used today).

During, the 1930s and 1940s, many of the data collection methods, probability sampling methods, survey methods, questionnaire design and key metrics were developed. By the 1930s, Ernest Dichter was pioneering the focus group method of qualitative research. For this, he is often described as the 'father of market research.'&lt;ref&gt;American Marketing Association (AMA), [https://www.ama.org/resources/Best-Practices/Pages/Father-of-Research.aspx. Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Dichter applied his methods on campaigns for major brands including Chrysler, Exxon/Esso where he used methods from psychology and cultural anthropology to gain consumer insights. These methods eventually lead to the development of ''motivational research.''&lt;ref&gt;Karmasin, H., "Ernest Dichter’s Studies on Automobile Marketing," in: Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R. (eds.), ''Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 109-125&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing historians refer to this period as the "Foundation Age" of market research.

By the 1930s, the first courses on marketing research were taught in universities and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Clow, K.E. and James, K.E., ''Essentials of Marketing Research: Putting Research Into Practice'', Thousand Oaks, Ca, Sage, 2010 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The text-book, ''Market Research and Analysis'' by Lyndon O. Brown (1937) became one of the popular textbooks during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, S. R. ''Market Research: Text and Cases'', 2nd ed., Himalaya Publishing House, 2014 [www.himpub.com/documents/Chapter873.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of trained research professionals proliferated throughout the second half of the 20th-century, the techniques and methods used in marketing research became increasingly sophisticated. Marketers, such as Paul Green, were instrumental in developing techniques such as [[conjoint analysis]] and [[multidimensional scaling]], both of which are used in positioning maps, market segmentation, choice analysis and other marketing applications.&lt;ref&gt;Wind, Y. and Green, P.E. "Paul Green and a Brief History of Marketing Research", in: ''Wind Y. and  Green P.E. (eds), ''Marketing Research and Modeling: Progress and Prospects. International Series in Quantitative Marketing,'' vol 14, Boston, MA, Springer, 2004, pp 1-13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Web analytics]] were born out of the need to track the behavior of site visitors and, as the popularity of [[e-commerce]] and [[Online advertising|web advertising]] grew, businesses demanded details on the information created by new practices in web data collection, such as [[Click-through rate|click-through]] and [[exit rate]]s. As the Internet boomed, websites became larger and more complex and the possibility of two-way communication between businesses and their consumers became a reality. Provided with the capacity to interact with online customers, Researchers were able to collect large amounts of data that were previously unavailable, further propelling the marketing research industry.

In the new millennium, as the Internet continued to develop and websites became more interactive, data collection and analysis became more commonplace for those marketing research firms whose clients had a web presence. With the explosive growth of the online marketplace came new competition for companies; no longer were businesses merely competing with the shop down the road&amp;nbsp;— competition was now represented by a global force. Retail outlets were appearing online and the previous need for bricks-and-mortar stores was diminishing at a greater pace than online competition was growing.With so many online channels for consumers to make purchases, companies needed newer and more compelling methods, in combination with messages that resonated more effectively, to capture the attention of the average consumer.

Having access to web data did not automatically provide companies with the rationale behind the behavior of users visiting their sites, which provoked the marketing research industry to develop new and better ways of tracking, collecting and interpreting information. This led to the development of various tools like online focus groups and pop-up or website intercept surveys. These types of services allowed companies to dig deeper into the motivations of consumers, augmenting their insights and utilizing this data to drive market share.

As information around the world became more accessible, increased competition led companies to demand more of market researchers.  It was no longer sufficient to follow trends in web behavior or track sales data; companies now needed access to consumer behavior throughout the entire purchase process.This meant the Marketing Research Industry, again, needed to adapt to the rapidly changing needs of the marketplace, and to the demands of companies looking for a competitive edge.

Today, marketing research has adapted to innovations in technology and the corresponding ease with which information is available. B2B and B2C companies are working hard to stay competitive and they now demand both quantitative (“What”) and qualitative (“Why?”) marketing research in order to better understand their target audience and the motivations behind customer behaviors.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

This demand is driving marketing researchers to develop new platforms for interactive, two-way communication between their firms and consumers. Mobile devices such as Smart Phones are the best example of an emerging platform that enables businesses to connect with their customers throughout the entire buying process.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

As personal mobile devices become more capable and widespread, the marketing research industry will look to further capitalize on this trend. Mobile devices present the perfect channel for research firms to retrieve immediate impressions from buyers and to provide their clients with a holistic view of the consumers within their target markets, and beyond. Now, more than ever, innovation is the key to success for Marketing Researchers. Marketing Research Clients are beginning to demand highly personalized and specifically-focused products from the marketing research firms; [[big data]] is great for identifying general market segments, but is less capable of identifying key factors of niche markets, which now defines the competitive edge companies are looking for in this mobile-digital age.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Characteristics==
First, marketing ''research is systematic''. Thus systematic planning is required at all the stages of the marketing research process. The procedures followed at each stage are methodologically sound, well documented, and, as much as possible, planned in advance. Marketing research uses the scientific method in that data are collected and analyzed to test prior notions or hypotheses. Experts in marketing research have shown that studies featuring multiple and often competing hypotheses yield more meaningful results than those featuring only one dominant hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Hypotheses%20in%20Marketing%20Science.pdf | title = Hypotheses in Marketing Science: Literature Review and Publication Audit| author = J. Scott Armstrong, Roderick J. Brodie and Andrew G. Parsons | journal = Marketing Letters | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–187 | year = 2001 | doi=10.1023/a:1011169104290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing research is ''objective''. It attempts to provide accurate information that reflects a true state of affairs. It should be conducted impartially. While research is always influenced by the researcher's research philosophy, it should be free from the personal or political biases of the researcher or the [[management]]. Research which is motivated by personal or political gain involves a breach of professional standards. Such research is deliberately biased so as to result in predetermined findings. The objective nature of marketing research underscores the importance of ethical considerations. Also, researchers should always be objective with regard to the selection of information to be featured in reference texts because such literature should offer a comprehensive view on marketing. Research has shown, however, that many marketing textbooks do not feature important principles in marketing research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/policies.pdf | title = Principles Involving Marketing Policies: An Empirical Assessment | author = J. Scott Armstrong and Randall L. Schultz | journal = Marketing Letters | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–265 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1007/bf00999231 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101217085615/http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/policies.pdf | archivedate = 2010-12-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related business research==
Other forms of business research include:

* [[Market research]] is broader in scope and examines all aspects of a business environment. It asks questions about [[competition|competitors]], [[market structure]], government regulations, economic trends, technological advances, and numerous other factors that make up the business environment (see [[environmental scanning]]).  Sometimes the term refers more particularly to the financial analysis of companies, industries, or [[List of recognized economic sectors|sectors]]. In this case, financial analysts usually carry out the research and provide the results to investment advisors and potential investors.
* Product research&amp;nbsp;— This looks at what [[product (business)|products]] can be produced with available technology, and what new product innovations near-future technology can develop (see [[new product development]]).
* [[Advertising research]]{{snd}} is a specialized form of marketing research conducted to improve the efficacy of advertising. [[Copy testing]], also known as "pre-testing," is a form of customized research that predicts in-market performance of an ad before it airs, by analyzing audience levels of attention, [[Wikt:Brand linkage|brand linkage]], motivation, entertainment, and communication, as well as breaking down the ad's [[Wikt:flow of attention|flow of attention]] and [[Wikt:flow of emotion|flow of emotion]]. Pre-testing is also used on ads still in rough (ripomatic or [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatic]]) form. (Young, p.&amp;nbsp;213)

==Classification==
Organizations engage in marketing research for two reasons: firstly, to identify and, secondly, to solve marketing problems. This distinction serves as a basis for classifying marketing research into problem identification research and problem solving research.

Problem identification research is undertaken to help identify problems which are, perhaps, not apparent on the surface and yet exist or are likely to arise in the future like company image, market characteristics, sales analysis, short-range forecasting, long range forecasting, and business trends research. Research of this type provides information about the marketing environment and helps diagnose a problem. For example, the findings of problem solving research are used in making decisions which will solve specific marketing problems.

The [[Stanford Research Institute]], on the other hand, conducts an annual survey of consumers that is used to classify persons into homogeneous groups for segmentation purposes. The [[National Purchase Diary]] panel (NPD) maintains the largest diary panel in the United States.

Standardized services are research studies conducted for different client firms but in a standard way. For example, procedures for measuring advertising effectiveness have been standardized so that the results can be compared across studies and evaluative norms can be established. The Starch Readership Survey is the most widely used service for evaluating print advertisements; another well-known service is the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] and Robinson Magazine Impact Studies. These services are also sold on a syndicated basis.

*Customized services offer a wide variety of marketing research services customized to suit a client's specific needs. Each marketing research project is treated uniquely.
*Limited-service suppliers specialize in one or a few phases of the marketing research project. Services offered by such suppliers are classified as field services, coding and data entry, data analysis, analytical services, and branded products. Field services collect data through the internet, traditional mail, in-person, or telephone interviewing, and firms that specialize in interviewing are called field service organizations. These [[organization]]s may range from small proprietary organizations which operate locally to large multinational organizations with WATS line interviewing facilities. Some organizations maintain extensive interviewing facilities across the country for interviewing shoppers in malls.
*Coding and data entry services include editing completed questionnaires, developing a coding scheme, and transcribing the data on to diskettes or magnetic tapes for input into the computer. NRC Data Systems provides such services.
*Analytical services include designing and pretesting questionnaires, determining the best means of collecting data, designing sampling plans, and other aspects of the research design. Some complex marketing research projects require knowledge of sophisticated procedures, including specialized experimental designs, and analytical techniques such as conjoint analysis and multidimensional scaling. This kind of expertise can be obtained from firms and consultants specializing in analytical services.
*Data analysis services are offered by firms, also known as tab houses, that specialize in computer analysis of quantitative data such as those obtained in large surveys. Initially most data analysis firms supplied only tabulations (frequency counts) and cross tabulations (frequency counts that describe two or more variables simultaneously). With the proliferation of [[software]], many firms now have the capability to analyze their own data, but, data analysis firms are still in demand. {{Citation needed|reason=last statement makes a claim|date=January 2014}}
*Branded marketing research products and services are specialized data collection and analysis procedures developed to address specific types of marketing research problems. These procedures are patented, given brand names, and marketed like any other branded product.

==Types==
Marketing research techniques come in many forms, including:

*[[Ad Tracking]]&amp;nbsp;– periodic or continuous in-market research to monitor a [[Wikt:brand|brand's]] performance using measures such as brand awareness, brand preference, and product usage. (Young, 2005)
*[[Advertising Research]]&amp;nbsp;– used to predict [[copy testing]] or [[Ad Tracking|track]] the efficacy of advertisements for any medium, measured by the ad's ability to get attention (measured with [[AttentionTracking]]), communicate the message, build the brand's image, and motivate the consumer to purchase the product or service. (Young, 2005)
*[[Brand awareness]] research&amp;nbsp;— the extent to which consumers can recall or recognize a brand name or product name
*Brand association research&amp;nbsp;— what do consumers associate with the brand?
*Brand attribute research&amp;nbsp;— what are the key traits that describe the brand promise?
*[[Brand management|Brand name testing]]{{snd}} what do consumers feel about the names of the products?
* Buyer decision making process— to determine what motivates people to buy and what decision-making process they use; over the last decade, [[Neuromarketing]] emerged from the convergence of neuroscience and marketing, aiming to understand consumer decision making process
*[[Commercial eye tracking]] research&amp;nbsp;— examine advertisements, package designs, websites, etc. by analyzing visual behavior of the consumer
*[[Concept testing]]{{snd}} to test the acceptance of a concept by target consumers
*[[Coolhunting]] (also known as trendspotting){{snd}} to make observations and predictions in changes of new or existing cultural trends in areas such as fashion, music, films, television, youth culture and lifestyle
*[[Copy testing]]&amp;nbsp;– predicts in-market performance of an ad before it airs by analyzing audience levels of [[Wikt:attention|attention]], [[Wikt:brand linkage|brand linkage]], [[Wikt:motivation|motivation]], entertainment, and communication, as well as breaking down the ad's [[Wikt:flow of attention|flow of attention]] and [[Wikt:flow of emotion|flow of emotion]]. (Young, p 213)
*[[Customer satisfaction research]]{{snd}} quantitative or qualitative studies that yields an understanding of a customer's satisfaction with a transaction
*[[Demand]] estimation&amp;nbsp;— to determine the approximate level of demand for the product
*[[Distribution (business)|Distribution channel]] audits&amp;nbsp;— to assess distributors’ and retailers’ attitudes toward a product, [[brand]], or company
*Internet strategic intelligence&amp;nbsp;— searching for customer opinions in the Internet: chats, forums, web pages, blogs... where people express freely about their experiences with products, becoming strong opinion formers.
*[[Marketing effectiveness]] and analytics&amp;nbsp;— Building models and measuring results to determine the effectiveness of individual marketing activities.
*Mystery consumer or [[mystery shopping]]{{snd}} An employee or representative of the market research firm anonymously contacts a salesperson and indicates he or she is shopping for a product.  The shopper then records the entire experience. This method is often used for quality control or for researching competitors' products.
*[[Positioning (marketing)|Positioning]] research&amp;nbsp;— how does the [[target market]] see the [[brand]] relative to competitors?{{snd}} what does the brand stand for?
*[[Price elasticity of demand|Price elasticity]] testing&amp;nbsp;— to determine how sensitive customers are to price changes
*Sales forecasting&amp;nbsp;— to determine the expected level of sales given the level of demand. With respect to other factors like Advertising expenditure, sales promotion etc.
*[[Market segment|Segmentation research]]{{snd}} to determine the [[demographics|demographic]], [[psychographic]], cultural, and behavioral characteristics of potential buyers
*[[Online panel]]{{snd}} a group of individual who accepted to respond to marketing research online
*Store audit&amp;nbsp;— to measure the sales of a product or product line at a statistically selected store sample in order to determine [[market share]], or to determine whether a retail store provides adequate service
*[[Test market]]ing&amp;nbsp;— a small-scale product launch used to determine the likely acceptance of the product when it is introduced into a wider market
*[[Viral Marketing Research]]{{snd}} refers to marketing research designed to estimate the probability that specific communications will be transmitted throughout an individual's [[Social Network]]. Estimates of [[Social Networking Potential]] (SNP) are combined with estimates of selling effectiveness to estimate ROI on specific combinations of messages and media.

All of these forms of marketing research can be classified as either problem-identification research or as problem-solving research.

There are two main sources of data&amp;nbsp;— primary and secondary.  Primary research is conducted from scratch.  It is original and collected to solve the problem in hand. Secondary research already exists since it has been collected for other purposes.  It is conducted on data published previously and usually by someone else. Secondary research costs far less than primary research, but seldom comes in a form that exactly meets the needs of the researcher.

A similar distinction exists between exploratory research and conclusive research. Exploratory research provides insights into and comprehension of an issue or situation. It should draw definitive conclusions only with extreme caution. Conclusive research draws conclusions: the results of the study can be generalized to the whole population.

Exploratory research is conducted to explore a problem to get some basic idea about the solution at the preliminary stages of research. It may serve as the input to conclusive research. Exploratory research information is collected by focus group interviews, reviewing literature or books, discussing with experts, etc. This is unstructured and qualitative in nature. If a secondary source of data is unable to serve the purpose, a convenience sample of small size can be collected. Conclusive research is conducted to draw some conclusion about the problem. It is essentially, structured and quantitative research, and the output of this research is the input to [[management information systems]] (MIS).

Exploratory research is also conducted to simplify the findings of the conclusive or descriptive research, if the findings are very hard to interpret for the marketing managers.

==Methods==
Methodologically, marketing research uses the following types of research designs:&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Research: An Applied Orientation 2006 (5th Edition) by Naresh Malhotra. {{ISBN|0-13-222117-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Based on questioning:
:*[[Qualitative marketing research]]{{snd}} generally used for exploratory purposes&amp;nbsp;— small number of respondents&amp;nbsp;— not generalizable to the whole population&amp;nbsp;— statistical significance and confidence not calculated&amp;nbsp;— examples include [[focus group]]s, [[Interviews|in-depth interviews]], and [[projective techniques]]
:*[[Quantitative marketing research]]{{snd}} generally used to draw conclusions&amp;nbsp;— tests a specific [[hypothesis]]{{snd}} uses random [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] techniques so as to infer from the sample to the population&amp;nbsp;— involves a large number of respondents&amp;nbsp;— examples include [[statistical survey|surveys]] and [[questionnaire construction|questionnaires]].  Techniques include [[choice modelling]], [[MaxDiff|maximum difference preference scaling]], and [[Analysis of covariance|covariance analysis]].

;Based on observations:
:*[[Ethnographic]] studies&amp;nbsp;— by nature qualitative, the researcher observes social phenomena in their natural setting&amp;nbsp;— observations can occur cross-sectionally (observations made at one time) or longitudinally (observations occur over several time-periods){{snd}} examples include product-use analysis and computer cookie traces.  See also [[Ethnography]] and [[Observational techniques]].
:*[[Experimental techniques]]{{snd}} by nature quantitative, the researcher creates a quasi-artificial environment to try to control spurious factors, then manipulates at least one of the variables&amp;nbsp;— examples include purchase laboratories and test markets.

Researchers often use more than one research design. They may start with secondary research to get background information, then conduct a focus group (qualitative research design) to explore the issues. Finally they might do a full nationwide survey (quantitative research design) in order to devise specific recommendations for the client.

==Business to business==
Business to business (B2B) research is inevitably more complicated than consumer research.  The researchers need to know what type of multi-faceted approach will answer the objectives, since seldom is it possible to find the answers using just one method.  Finding the right respondents is crucial in B2B research since they are often busy, and may not want to participate.  Encouraging them to “open up” is yet another skill required of the B2B researcher.  Last, but not least, most business research leads to strategic decisions and this means that the business researcher must have expertise in developing strategies that are strongly rooted in the research findings and acceptable to the client.

There are four key factors that make B2B market research special and different from consumer markets:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b2binternational.com/whitepapers4.html Business-to-Business Marketing] By Paul Hague, Nick Hague and Matt Harrison (undated) accessed October 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

* The decision making unit is far more complex in B2B markets than in consumer markets.
* B2B products and their applications are more complex than consumer products.
* B2B marketers address a much smaller number of customers who are very much larger in their consumption of products than is the case in consumer markets.
* Personal relationships are of critical importance in B2B markets.

==Small businesses and nonprofits==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
Marketing research does not only occur in huge corporations with many employees and a large budget. Marketing information can be derived by observing the environment of their location and the competitions location. Small scale surveys and focus groups are low cost ways to gather information from potential and existing customers. Most secondary data (statistics, demographics, etc.) is available to the public in libraries or on the internet and can be easily accessed by a small business owner.

Below are some steps that could be done by SME (Small Medium Enterprise) to analyze the market:

# Provide secondary and or primary data (if necessary);
# Analyze Macro &amp; Micro Economic data (e.g. Supply &amp; Demand, GDP, Price change, Economic growth, Sales by sector/industries, interest rate, number of investment/ divestment, I/O, CPI, Social analysis, etc.);
# Implement the marketing mix concept, which is consist of: Place, Price, Product, Promotion, People, Process, Physical Evidence and also Political &amp; social situation to analyze global market situation);
# Analyze market trends, growth, market size, market share, market competition (e.g. SWOT analysis, B/C Analysis, channel mapping identities of key channels, drivers of customers loyalty and satisfaction, brand perception, satisfaction levels, current competitor-channel relationship analysis, etc.), etc.;
# Determine market segment, market target, market forecast and market position;
# Formulating market strategy &amp; also investigating the possibility of partnership/ collaboration (e.g. Profiling &amp; SWOT analysis of potential partners, evaluating business partnership.)
# Combine those analysis with the SME's business plan/ business model analysis (e.g. Business description, Business process, Business strategy, Revenue model, Business expansion, Return of Investment, Financial analysis (Company History, Financial assumption, Cost/Benefit Analysis, Projected profit &amp; Loss, Cash flow, Balance sheet &amp; business Ratio, etc.).
:Note as important : Overall analysis should be based on 6W+1H (What, When, Where, Which, Who, Why and How) question.

==International plan==
International Marketing Research follows the same path as domestic research, but there are a few more problems that may arise. Customers in international markets may have very different customs, cultures, and expectations from the same company. In this case, Marketing Research relies more on primary data rather than secondary information. Gathering the primary data can be hindered by language, literacy and access to technology.
Basic Cultural and Market intelligence information will be needed to maximize the research effectiveness. Some of the steps that would help overcoming barriers include:
# Collect secondary information on the country under study from reliable international source e.g. WHO and IMF
# Collect secondary information on the product/service under study from available sources
# Collect secondary information on product manufacturers and service providers under study in relevant country
# Collect secondary information on culture and common business practices
# Ask questions to get better understanding of reasons behind any recommendations for a specific methodology

==Common terms==
Market research techniques resemble those used in political polling and social science research. [[Meta-analysis]] (also called the Schmidt-Hunter technique) refers to a statistical method of combining data from multiple studies or from several types of studies. Conceptualization means the process of converting vague mental images into definable concepts. Operationalization is the process of converting concepts into specific observable behaviors that a researcher can measure. Precision refers to the exactness of any given measure. [[Reliability (psychometric)|Reliability]] refers to the likelihood that a given operationalized construct will yield the same results if re-measured. [[Validity (psychometric)|Validity]] refers to the extent to which a measure provides data that captures the meaning of the operationalized construct as defined in the study. It asks, “Are we measuring what we intended to measure?”

* Applied research sets out to prove a specific hypothesis of value to the clients paying for the research. For example, a cigarette company might commission research that attempts to show that cigarettes are good for one's health. Many researchers have ethical misgivings about doing applied research.
* [[Sugging]] (from SUG, for "selling under the guise" of market research) forms a sales technique in which sales people pretend to conduct marketing research, but with the real purpose of obtaining buyer motivation and buyer decision-making information to be used in a subsequent sales call.
* [[Frugging]] comprises the practice of soliciting funds under the pretense of being a research [[organization]].

==Careers==
Some of the positions available in marketing research include vice president of marketing research, research director, assistant director of research, project manager, field work director, statistician/data processing specialist, senior analyst, analyst, junior analyst and operational supervisor.&lt;ref name="Boudreaux"&gt;{{Citation

The most common entry-level position in marketing research for people with bachelor's degrees (e.g., [[BBA]]) is as operational supervisor. These people are responsible for supervising a well-defined set of operations, including field work, data editing, and coding, and may be involved in programming and data analysis. Another entry-level position for BBAs is assistant project manager. An assistant [[project manager]] will learn and assist in questionnaire design, review field instructions, and monitor timing and costs of studies. In the marketing research industry, however, there is a growing preference for people with master's degrees. Those with MBA or equivalent degrees are likely to be employed as project managers.&lt;ref name="Boudreaux"/&gt;

A small number of business schools also offer a more specialized [[Master of Marketing Research]] (MMR) degree. An MMR typically prepares students for a wide range of research methodologies and focuses on learning both in the classroom and the field.

The typical entry-level position in a business firm would be junior [[research analyst]] (for [[BBA]]s) or research analyst (for [[MBA]]s or MMRs). The junior analyst and the research analyst learn about the particular industry and receive training from a senior staff member, usually the marketing research manager. The junior analyst position includes a training program to prepare individuals for the responsibilities of a research analyst, including coordinating with the marketing department and sales force to develop goals for product exposure. The research analyst responsibilities include checking all data for accuracy, comparing and contrasting new research with established norms, and analyzing primary and secondary data for the purpose of market forecasting.

As these job titles indicate, people with a variety of backgrounds and skills are needed in marketing research. Technical specialists such as statisticians obviously need strong backgrounds in statistics and data analysis. Other positions, such as research director, call for managing the work of others and require more general skills. To prepare for a career in marketing research, students usually:

* Take all the [[marketing]] courses.
* Take courses in [[statistics]] and [[quantitative method]]s.
* Acquire [[computer]] skills.
* Take courses in [[psychology]] and [[consumer behavior]].
* Acquire effective written and verbal [[communication]] skills.
* Think creatively.&lt;ref name="Boudreaux"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2999">{{for|the role of registered agent in the US|Registered Agent}}

A '''process agent''' is a [[agent (law)|representative]] upon whom [[court]] papers may be served. In the US, the role is generally a requirement of US State law and is known as a [[registered agent]], a resident agent or statutory agent. However, process agents are utilized in the US by [[truck drivers]], [[brokers]] or [[freight forwarders]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration/process-agents&lt;/ref&gt; for similar purposes. Process agents that provide nationwide coverage for motor carriers are commonly referred to as blanket companies&lt;ref&gt;http://li-public.fmcsa.dot.gov/LIVIEW/pkg_html.prc_limain&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In the UK, a process agent is a contractual relationship, permitted by the Civil Procedure Rules.

==England and Wales==

Under English Civil Procedure Rules,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil Civil Procedure Rules]&lt;/ref&gt; it is necessary to serve papers to start proceedings correctly.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Procedure Rules, Part 6&lt;/ref&gt;  If a party does not have an address within the United Kingdom, the procedure for serving these papers can be lengthy and complicated, with proof of service particularly difficult in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Procedure Rules, Practice Direction 6A&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is therefore customary to appoint a process agent and contractually agree that service at the address of the agent will constitute proper service for the purposes of Rule 6.1.1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. In order to meet the requirements of Rule 6.1.1 an appropriate contractual clause needs to be inserted into the agreement specifying the details of the appointment.

It is also possible to appoint a Process Agent for the purposes of arbitration proceedings in a similar manner.

The role of a process agent&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawdebenture.com/our-services/united-kingdom/process-agent/what-is-the-role-of-a-process-agent/ What Is The Role of a Process Agent?]&lt;/ref&gt; is a vitally important service for many businesses dealing with suppliers, banks or tenders in the UK. Process agents accept service of notices, proceedings or documents on behalf of their overseas clients in situations where it is not possible for them to be served abroad. A process agent can act in a broad capacity for a company including but not limited to; acting as a process agent for court actions, receiving documents in connection with arbitration proceedings and receiving notices under contracts where an independent party is needed. 

A typical example of a process agency arrangement is where an overseas entity raises a loan from a city institution. Often the lending bank will require the appointment of a UK-based process agent&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawdebenture.com/our-services/united-kingdom/process-agent/ UK-based Process Agent]&lt;/ref&gt; to receive formal notices should the borrower default on the loan.

'''Richard Clarke Cabot'''  (May 21, 1868 – May 7, 1939) was an American physician who advanced clinical [[hematology]], was an innovator in teaching methods, and was a pioneer in [[social work]].

==Early life and education==
Richard Clarke Cabot was born May 21, 1868, in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], one of five sons of [[James Elliot Cabot]] and Elizabeth (Dwight) Cabot.&lt;ref name=papers&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua02998 "Cabot, Richard C. (Richard Clarke), 1868-1939. Papers of Richard Clarke Cabot : an inventory,"] Harvard University archives. Accessed Jan. 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; James Cabot was a philosopher and [[Harvard University]] professor who also trained as a lawyer and biographer, and was a friend of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

==Professional career==
[[Image:Picture of Richard Clarke Cabot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cabot at work.]]
Cabot studied philosophy at [[Harvard University]] before switching to medicine.  Inspired by the beliefs of [[John Dewey]], Cabot felt more drawn to action than contemplation, and he admired the work of [[Teddy Roosevelt]] and [[Jane Addams]].  After completing his studies in 1892, he turned down the role of the first [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] to work in the hospital's much less prestigious outpatient department.  At this time, outpatient wards dealt mostly with people who couldn't afford inpatient treatment, or for the treatment of incurable chronic conditions such [[tuberculosis]] or [[diabetes]].  This involved working populations who lived in unhealthy, overcrowded accommodation, often recent migrants.&lt;ref name=gehlert /&gt;

He changed the way that the outpatient department was run, believing that economic, social, family and psychological conditions underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with.  He envisaged that social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health.  In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.  In 1905 Cabot created one of the first positions of  professional [[Social workers|social worker]] in the world, given to Garnet Pelton, and then to Ida Cannon.&lt;ref&gt;Beder, J. (2006) Hospital Social Work: The interface of medicine and caring.  Routlege: New York&lt;/ref&gt; Although Clarke credited his approach as similar to that of [[Anne Cummins (social worker)|Anne Cummins]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Baraclough, J. (2004-09-23). Cummins, Anne Emily (1869–1936), social worker. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 3 Jan. 2018, see [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-75263 link]&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital refused to support the hiring of social workers, and Cabot had to pay their wages himself.  Pelten developed tuberculosis herself soon after taking up the position and was forced to retire.  Cannon stayed in the position for forty years and became Head of Social Work at the hospital.  Cabot and Cannon pioneered many programs to improve the health of patients, including art classes for psychiatric patients, low-cost meals for patients and research on the social factors that increased a person's likelihood of developing tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=gehlert /&gt;

In 1917 Cabot took up a position in the [[Medical Reserve Corps]] for a year.  He returned briefly to Massachusetts General Hospital in 1918 and then left to take up the position of chair at Harvard's Department of Social Ethics in 1919.  At this time, the hospital agreed to pay the wages of social workers, as up to this point, Cabot had paid the wages of thirteen social workers over the last 12 years.&lt;ref name=gehlert /&gt;  He went on to write about his experiences in his book ''Social Work''&lt;ref&gt;Cabot, R.C. (1919). ''Social Work'', webpage: [https://books.google.com/books?id=acDjrZh_zdsC Google-Books-dsC].&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also credited with discovering [[Cabot rings]], and for describing, along with his colleague, Locke, the [[eponym]]ous Cabot-Locke [[Heart murmur|murmur]], a [[diastolic]] murmur occasionally heard in severe [[anemia]], unrelated to [[heart valve]] abnormalities.

Cabot established a tradition of teaching conferences at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH) that featured generating [[differential diagnoses]], and founded the long-standing feature of Case Record of MGH in ''New England Journal of Medicine''.

== Family and personal life ==
Cabot's paternal grandfather, [[Samuel Cabot, Jr.]], became a sailor at age 19 and married Elizabeth Perkins, daughter of a successful Boston trader.  [[Samuel Cabot III]] later took over the running of the firm.

Richard married [[Ella Lyman Cabot|Ella Lyman]], and both held [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] views.  This philosophy, as well as his parents' commitment to philanthropy, had a strong influence of Richard.  Around the end of the 19th Century, such ideals were out of favor, with the dominant beliefs at the time being [[social Darwinism]].&lt;ref name=gehlert&gt;Gehlert, S. in Gehlert, S. and T.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5805">The '''Senior Community Service Employment Program''' ('''SCSEP''') is a program of the [[United States Department of Labor]], its [[Employment and Training Administration]], to help more senior citizens get back into or remain active in the labor workforce. It is a community service and work-based training program.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor, ETA, [http://www.doleta.gov/seniors/html_docs/AboutSCSEP.cfm "About SCSEP"]&lt;/ref&gt; It does this through job skill training and employment assistance with an emphasis on getting a ready job with a suitable and cooperating company or organisation. In such a setting, the worker is paid the [[Minimum wage in the United States|United States minimum wage]], or the highest of Federal, State or local minimum wage, or the prevailing wage, for an average of 20 hours per week, and experiences on-the-job learning and newly acquired skills use. The intention is that through these community jobs, the older worker will gain a permanent job, not subsidized by federal government funds.

People who are 55 or older can obtain job training and job search services from SCSEP. In each area of the country, SCSEP services are accessed through local organizations. These are usually nonprofits, but sometimes a state agency will administer the program.

== Eligibility guidelines ==
The participant must be at least 55 years of age and from a family receiving regular cash welfare payments or with an annual family income of no more than 25% over the [[Poverty in the United States|Federal poverty level]] as defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]]. There are certain exclusions in the income calculation, such as [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI).&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Labor, ETA, [http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEGL/TEGL12-06_508.pdf "Training and Employment Guidance Letter No. 12-06], December 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment priority is given to persons over age 60, veterans, and qualified spouses of veterans. Preference is given to minority, limited English-speaking, and Indian eligible individuals. Preference is also given to eligible individuals who have the greatest economic need.

== History ==
SCSEP was authorised by the [[United States Congress]] in Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 &lt;ref&gt;[[United States Code]], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3056- US Code Section 42 , Chapter 35, Subchapter IX, § 3056] - Older American Community Service Employment Program&lt;/ref&gt; and its later amendments &lt;ref&gt;United States Public Law, [http://www.doleta.gov/Seniors/other_docs/owp-106-501.pdf Amended Public Law for Title V] Public Law 106–501—NOV. 13, 2000 114 STAT. 2267, Title V—Amendment to Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, Section 501.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide subsidized, part-time, community [[Public service|service]] work based training for low-income persons age 55 or older who have poor employment prospects. The program has evolved significantly in the last 50 years.  The program is administered by nonprofit organizations and local government agencies.

== Controversy ==
Experience Works, Inc., was historically the largest provider of SCSEP services.  In 2015, the grantee was cited for $1.6 million dollars in questioned costs by the Department of Labor. The report details the use of unrestricted and accrued annual leave to cover a $1.6 million grant overspend, which $1.4 million was used to pay participant wages and fringe benefits, the misuse of federal funds to cover activities including first-class travel, pet hotels, fruit bouquets, personal loans to the CEO, and frequent credit card use on entertainment and prohibited lobbying. The number now totals approximately $2 million in questioned expenses.   &lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Labor, Monitoring Report, December 18, 2015]]. [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4wFqjuHcI_1X1FtMmpEUnEwRHM]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a follow up report critical of current management for not taking any corrective actions to restore funds.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Labor, Report to Sally A. Boofer, 2016]]. [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4wFqjuHcI_1cFZaTldJTnc3OW8]&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the prior management's actions, the U.S. Department of Labor has revamped the funding for SCSEP and the Inspector General has expanded the investigation into the activities of the previous management.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration]]. [https://www.doleta.gov/grants/pdf/FOA-ETA-16-04-A.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal investigation is aided by a whistleblower and other former employees. In September, 2016 the Inspector General issued a preliminary report describing the organization as financial insolvent and took steps to curtail and eliminate federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;[[Office of Inspector General, September 30, 2016]]  [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4wFqjuHcI_1UlVSdkRGVGdCbUU]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, more than 100 employees were terminated as a result of the funding reduction and were paid only part of their accrued leave.

== Funding ==
SCSEP has received stable funding of $434,371,000 during the last several years.  The Trump administration has called for the elimination of the program, which is meeting some resistance in Congress.

The most recent budget proposal from the White House would eliminate the program entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/documents/general/budget/2016/CBJ-2016-V1-06.pdf U.S. Department of Labor]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Simon Gicharu''' is an educationalist and founder of [[Mount Kenya University]], which is East and Central Africa’s largest private university. He was born in 1964 in Gathiruini village, in [[Kiambu|Kiambu County]], Kenya. He is the first in a family of seven. Dr. Gicharu is also the Chairman of the Rural Electrification Authority and National Private Universities Owners Association of Kenya. He is the founder of Equip Africa Institute  and patron of the Graduate Enterprise Academy. He is also a board member at Thika Water and Sewerage Company, and the patron of Inter Universities Rover Moot under the [[The Kenya Scouts Association|Kenya Scouts Association]]. In 2015, Dr. Gicharu was named the Eastern African [[Ernst &amp; Young|Ernst and Young]] Entrepreneur of the Year. He is married with three children.

==Early life and education==
His early life experiences were the cauldron in which his successful characteristic traits were shaped. As a pupil at Kiawairia Primary School and later Gathiruini Secondary School, Gicharu had to walk many kilometres to and from school. His parents were peasant farmers and their small piece of land, which they tilled for subsistence, provided barely enough for their upkeep. To supplement the domestic income, Dr. Gicharu, alongside his siblings, picked coffee at large commercials farms where he was paid by the kilo.

At Murang’a High School where he undertook his O-Levels, he was the captain in his final year. While in school, he etched a reputation for entrepreneurial acumen, and for assisting fellow students in Mathematics, a subject he excelled in.

Mr Gicharu obtained a Bachelor of Education Science (Honours) degree from [[Kenyatta University]] in 1990. His majors were Mathematics and Chemistry. Soon after graduation, he continued to exercise his passion for education, teaching his favourite Maths subject at various secondary schools in Kenya, and later at the [[Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology]], and at the [http://wikimapia.org/9568852/Thika-Technical-Training-Institute Thika Technical Training Institute]. He would also author Kenya’s first post-secondary school book on Mathematics, Applied Mathematics for Craft Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maktaba.ku.ac.ke/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=99353 |title=Kenyatta University Library catalog › Details for: Applied mathematics for craft engineering |publisher=Maktaba.ku.ac.ke |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
Dr. Gicharu has also previously worked as a lecturer at Thika Technical Training Institute. In 1995, he earned a British Council scholarship to study Managing Enterprise Development at Cranfield University, [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. When he came back he established Kenya Entrepreneurship Promotion Programme (KEPP), which provided micro-loans and training to young [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]]. His seed capital was only Ksh20,000 (US$220). KEPP later started offering training in [[Computer|computers]] and changed its name to Thika School of Management Studies (TSMS), with introduction of [[Management]] courses. 
Gradually, TSMS increased its student enrolment and the number of courses. The type of courses it offered was determined by the [[job]] demands of the day and with the explosion in use of information science and [[technology]], TSMS changed its name to Thika Institute of Technology (TIT) in 2003.

That same year, Dr. Gicharu, resolved that Science training would be the backbone of TIT. He made a blind trip to [[India]], on scanty information that at the [[Punjab State]], they were assembling [[Science]] equipment in cottage industries that was relatively affordable. Dr. Gicharu immediately purchased the equipment.  TIT was the first private college in [[Kenya]] to be accredited to offer the Diploma programme in [[Pharmacy]].

In 2017, Gicharu was noted to have a keen interest in venturing into the media within Kenya, having already started a television and radio station in Rwanda.
Gicharu and Tom Mshindi (Editor in Chief of [[Nation Media Group]]) hold controlling shares in 360 media&lt;ref&gt;http://nairobilawmonthly.com/index.php/2018/06/05/media-like-false-preachers/&lt;/ref&gt; headed by former [[Nation Media Group]] reporter Samwel Born Maina. The firm was set up by Gicharu and team to “disrupt the media relations sector in Kenya, especially in an election year.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.360media.co.ke/?p=1640&lt;/ref&gt;
Gicharu’s 360 Media has become linked to the scandal involving [[Cambridge Analytica]] developing online campaigns in the 2017 Kenyan elections portraying “[[Raila Odinga]] as a blood-thirsty individual who is also sympathetic to [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] and having no development agenda,” whilst portraying the incumbent President Kenyatta as “tough on terrorism, and being good for the economy.”&lt;ref&gt;http://nairobilawmonthly.com/index.php/2018/06/05/media-like-false-preachers/&lt;/ref&gt;
Gicharu has recently gone on to self-fund TV47 and Beats 47 in Kenya, new television and radio stations, via his company Cape Media, headed by his son Kevin Gicharu.&lt;ref&gt;https://businesstoday.co.ke/mku-founder-launches-tv-radio-station/&lt;/ref&gt;

==University==
In 2008, the Institute was awarded a Letter of Interim Authority by the Commission for University Education in Kenya, to operate as an independent university under the name Mount Kenya University. The university was granted a full Charter status in 2011. At the age of 46 years, Dr. Gicharu became the youngest Kenyan to have established a chartered university. The only other indigenous Chartered university was started by the former President H.E Daniel Arap Moi. Mount Kenya University, with 16 Campuses and Centres in Kenya, Rwanda, Somaliland, Tanzania, Burundi and Uganda employs over 3,000 people and has a student population of about 50,000. The University is a member of Inter-university Council of East Africa and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.

==Awards==
*"1st Class Chief of the Order of the Burning Spear (CBS)." The highest award a civilian can get in Kenya. He was accorded the title by H.E the President of the Republic of Kenya in 2013 in recognition of his contribution to the growth of tertiary education in Kenya.

'''The Ottobar''' is a well known [[music venue]] located in the [[Charles Village]] neighborhood of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in the [[United States]]. The club was named one of the top music venues and one of the top indie and alternative music venues in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;ref name="bestindiealt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bestvenue" /&gt;  The Washington Post describes it as a "bastion of sub-mainstream music...where the insular community of artists and scenesters flock to hear the best touring bands."&lt;ref name="Post2013" /&gt; It also hosts theme events, dance parties, and an occasional burlesque show.&lt;ref name="Post2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAtoday2015" /&gt;

==History==
The Ottobar originally opened in Downtown Baltimore in September 1997 at 203 East Davis Street in the former Chambers Nightclub.&lt;ref name="Ottobar" /&gt; It was a very small venue which provided an intimate setting for live music and performance art. Despite its size, it attracted national acts such as [[Blonde Redhead]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[Fear (band)|Fear]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Le Tigre]], [[of Montreal]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]], [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]], and [[The White Stripes]]. It also supported local artists of the time, such as [[Daybreak (band)|Daybreak]], [[Goliath (band)|Goliath]], [[Lungfish (band)|Lungfish]], [[Oxes]], [[The Goons]], and [[The Oranges Band]].&lt;ref name="Ottobar" /&gt; The Ottobar has booked more than 12,000 acts since it opened in 1997.&lt;ref name="bestindiealt"/&gt; Performance art showcased included The 80's Prom, Salute To Satan, Tiny Couch Night, and The Death of Vaudeville Night. The Davis Street location closed on November 17, 2001.&lt;ref name="Ottobar" /&gt;[[Image:Ottobar Concert Hall 06082017 LHCollins.jpg|thumb|left|450px| [[Jenn Wasner]] and Flock of Dimes performing at the Ottobar, June 8, 2017]]

The Ottobar reopened the same month at its current 2549 North Howard Street location in lower [[Charles Village]], south of the [[Johns Hopkins University]] campus and the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]. The Charles Village location is considerably larger, but still provides an intimate listening experience by permitting fans to be close to the bands.&lt;ref name="Ottobar" /&gt; The venue is valued by artists for its clientele and sound system.&lt;ref name="billboard2007" /&gt; Food is not served at the Ottobar.&lt;ref name="USAtoday2015" /&gt; There is a bar and concert area on the main floor, a balcony with seating and a good view of the first floor, and an area for dance parties on the second floor.&lt;ref name="bestvenue" /&gt; The second floor also has pool tables, a sofa, a small performance space, and a bar. It has been reported that there is a secret passage to the apartment next door which functions as the dressing room.&lt;ref name="billboard2007" /&gt;[[Image:Ottobar crowd 06082017 LHCollins 500.jpg|thumb|right|400px| Ottobar crowd in bar area, June 2017]]

The new Ottobar also showcases emerging musical artists as well as national acts.&lt;ref name="bestvenue" /&gt; Some of the artists who have performed at the Ottobar include national artists [[Animal Collective]], [[At the Drive In]], [[Atmosphere]], [[The Black Keys]], [[Bouncing Souls]], [[Coheed and Cambria]], [[Damnwells]], [[David Cross]], [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[Dinosaur Jr]], [[Drive-By Truckers]], [[Father John Misty]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Jonathan Richman]], [[KRS-ONE]], [[Maroon 5]], [[The Melvins]], [[Michael Ian Black]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[Sharon Van Etten]], [[Supersuckers]], [[TV on the Radio]], [[The Breeders]], Brand New, Movielife, Saves the Day, Frank Turner, Samiam, and the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]]. The venue also supports and showcases local artists such as [[Celebration (2000s band)|Celebration]], [[Lake Trout (band)|Lake Trout]], [[Misery Index (band)|Misery Index]], [[Ponytail (band)|Ponytail]], and [[Thrushes (band)|Thrushes]]. There are theme nights such as Underground Dance Party, Pet Wedding, Butcher Knife Throwing Contest, Spelling Bee, Ottobar Boys and Girls Choir, and Book Burning For Peace.&lt;ref name="USAtoday2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bestvenue" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ottobar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BaltSunSVE2014" /&gt;[[Image:Ottobar Bar 06082017 LHCollins.jpg|thumb|right|400px| Ottobar bar, June 2017]]

In 2014, tragedy struck when Thomas Malenski and another employee were stabbed by Nicholas Heath after they escorted a friend of Heath's outside.&lt;ref name="BaltSun2015" /&gt; Malenski later died of his wounds. Musicians, patrons and employees were surprised and said they had never felt unsafe coming to or being inside the Ottobar. The only other reported issues had been neighbors occasionally complaining that patrons were noisy as they left the bar.&lt;ref name="WBaltTV" /&gt;

The Ottobar also hosts fundraisers and other events for various causes. In 2017, supporters of Planned Parenthood of Maryland met at Ottobar in Baltimore the day before the Women's March on Washington.&lt;ref name="PP 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BaltMag2014" /&gt;

Management announced in November 2018 that the venue would change ownership in 2019. Details of that transition were immediately unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Waldman |first1=Tyler |title=Ottobar, Landmark Of Baltimore Music Scene, To Change Hands |url=http://www.wbal.com/article/344447/3/ottobar-landmark-of-baltimore-music-scene-to-change-hands |accessdate=2 November 2018 |work=WBAL NewsRadio 1090 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2018 Sale==
On November 02, 2018 It was announced on the Facebook that the owners of Ottobar sold the business, to a new unidentified group:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hey Ottobar friends &amp; family, we have a big announcement:
It's the end of an era...the current owners of Ottobar will be handing the reigns over to a new group in 2019. 
We would like to thank the talented musicians &amp; artists who have graced the Ottobar's stage over the past 21 years. Thank you to our neighbors in Remington, Old Goucher, &amp; Charles Village for welcoming us to the neighborhood and supporting us all of these years. To all past &amp; present staff...the deepest appreciation for your tireless efforts. We couldn't have made it 21 years without you! Finally, thank you Baltimore &amp; all of our customers &amp; music fans from far &amp; wide for showing us so much love. It's been a great 20+ year ride! Thanks again for all of your support! So many great memories! Also, make sure to vote on Tuesday!''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Thomas Grainger''' [[FRSE]] (12 November 1794 – 25 July 1852) was a Scottish [[civil engineer]] and [[Surveying|surveyor]]. He was joint partner with [[John Miller (engineer)|John Miller]] in the prominent engineering firm of '''Grainger &amp; Miller'''.

==Life==

Grainger was born at Gogar Green near [[Ratho]], outside [[Edinburgh]] to Helen Marshall and Hugh Grainger. Educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]], at 16 he got a job with John Leslie, a [[Surveying|land surveyor]].

He started his own practice in 1816, and in 1825 he formed a partnership with [[John Miller (engineer)|John Miller]] which lasted until 1847. Their firm operated from the ground floor of Grainger's house at 56 George Street, in the centre of [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/83400483|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1845 and 1849 his company worked on the digging of the [[Bramhope Tunnel]] and building the [[Arthington Viaduct]] as part of laying the [[Leeds]] to [[Stockton-on-Tees]] line. The first modern [[train ferry|rail ferry]], the ''Leviathan'', was designed in 1849 by Grainger for the [[Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway]] to cross the [[Firth of Forth]] between [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]] and [[Burntisland]]. The service commenced on 3 February 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/sites/s/scotland_street_tunnel/index.shtml Subterranea Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Projects he was involved in included many railway bridges, viaducts and tunnels, including work on the [[Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway]], [[Ballochney Railway]], [[Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway]], [[Wishaw and Coltness Railway]], [[Paisley and Renfrew Railway]], [[Dundee and Arbroath Railway]], [[Arbroath and Forfar Railway]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railbrit.co.uk/engineers/Thomas_Grainger.htm Railscot entry, Thomas Grainger]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Leeds Northern Railway]], where he was chief engineer at the time of his death.

[[Benjamin Hall Blyth]] served as an apprentice under him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=201431|title=Grainger &amp; Miller|last=Goold|first=David|date=|website=www.scottisharchitects.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Stockton-on-Tees]] on 25 July 1852 as a result of injuries sustained in a train collision two days earlier. One of two fatal casualties, Grainger had sustained a compound fracture to his right leg, which quickly turned gangrenous. Following his death his body was returned home for burial in the family plot in the kirkyard at [[Gogar, Edinburgh|Gogar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=201429 Scottish Architects]&lt;/ref&gt;
