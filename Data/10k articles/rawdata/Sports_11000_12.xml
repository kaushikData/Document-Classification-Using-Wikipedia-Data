'''Aerobics''' is a form of [[physical exercise]] that combines rhythmic [[aerobic exercise]] with [[stretching]] and [[strength training]] routines with the goal of improving all elements of fitness ([[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], [[muscle|muscular]] strength, and [[Circulatory system|cardio-vascular]] fitness). It is usually performed to music and may be practiced in a group setting led by an [[teacher|instructor]] ([[fitness professional]]), although it can be done solo and without musical accompaniment. With the goal of preventing illness and promoting [[physical fitness]], practitioners perform various routines comprising a number of different dance-like exercises. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and complexity. A well-balanced aerobics class will have five components: warm-up (5–10 minutes), cardio vascular conditioning (25–30 minutes), muscular strength and conditioning (10–15 minutes), cool-down (5–8 minutes) and stretching and flexibility (5–8 minutes). Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their fitness level. Many gyms offer a variety of aerobic classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class.

==History==
[[Image:Aqua Aerobics.JPG|thumb|A water aerobics class at an Aquatic Centre.]]
Both the term and the specific exercise method were developed by Dr [[Kenneth H. Cooper]], an exercise physiologist, and Col. Pauline Potts, a physical therapist, both of the [[United States Air Force]]. Cooper, an exercise enthusiast, was puzzled about why some people with good muscular strength were prone to perform poorly at activities such as long-distance running, swimming, and bicycling. He began using a [[bicycle ergometer]] to measure sustained performance in terms of a person's ability to use oxygen. In 1968, he published ''Aerobics'', which included exercise programs using running, walking, swimming and bicycling. At the time the book was published there was increasing awareness of the need for increased exercise due to widespread weakness and inactivity. Cooper published a mass-market version "''The New Aerobics''" in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/aerobics-kenneth-cooper-to-receive-harvard-healthy-cup-award/|title=“Father of Aerobics” Kenneth Cooper, MD, MPH to receive Healthy Cup Award from Harvard School of Public Health|date=2008-04-16|work=News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clubindustry.com/forprofits/dr-kenneth-cooper-and-how-he-became-known-father-aerobics|title=Dr. Kenneth Cooper and How He Became Known as the Father of Aerobics|date=2008-09-01|work=Club Industry|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aerobics gained worldwide popularity after the release of [[Jane Fonda]]'s exercise videos in 1982.

== Step aerobics ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Step aerobics is a form of aerobic exercise that uses a low elevated platform, the step, of height tailored to individual needs by inserting risers. Step aerobics classes are offered at many gyms.

Step aerobics was developed by Gin Miller around 1989.  After a knee injury, Miller consulted with an orthopedic doctor, who recommended she strengthen the muscles supporting the knee by stepping up and down on a milk crate; from this she developed the step regimen.
[[File:Aerobics class.jpg|thumb|Aerobics class]]
Step aerobics can also be involved in dancing games, such as ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' or ''[[In the Groove (video game)|In the Groove]]''.

===Moves and techniques===
Often moves are referred to as [[Reebok]] step moves in reference to one of the first makers of the plastic step commonly used in gyms.

The "basic" step involves raising one foot onto the step, then the other so that they are both on the step, then stepping the first foot back, followed by the second.  A "right basic" would involve stepping right foot up, then the left, then returning to the floor alternating right then left.

Some instructors switch immediately between different moves, for example between a right basic and a left basic without any intervening moves, effectively "tapping" the foot without shifting weight; tap-free or smooth stepping alternates the feet without "taps"

[[Image:the step.jpg|thumb|a step with 2 risers]]
Common moves include:

*Basic Step
*Corner knee (or corner kick)
*Repeater knee (aka Triple knee)
*T-Step
*Over-the-Top
*Lunges
*V-Step
*Straddle Down
*L-Step
*Split Step
*I-Step

===Choreography===
Many instructors will prepare a set of moves that will be executed together to form the choreography of the class.  Usually, the choreography will be timed to 32 beats in a set, ideally switching legs so that the set can be repeated in a mirrored fashion.  A set may consist of many different moves and the different moves may have different durations.  For example, a basic step as described above takes 4 beats (for the 4 steps the person takes).  Similarly, the "knee up" move also takes 4 beats.  Another common move, the repeater knee, is an 8-beat move.

Classes vary in the level of choreography. Basic level classes will tend to have a series of relatively basic moves strung together into a sequence. More advanced classes incorporate dance elements such as turns, mambos, and stomps. These elements are put together into 2–3 routines in each class. One learns the routines during the class and then all are performed at the end of the class. Regardless of the complexity of the choreography, most instructors offer various options for different levels of intensity/dance ability while teaching the routines.

== Freestyle aerobics ==
[[File:Exercices d'aérobic.jpg|thumb|An Aerobics class]]
'''Freestyle aerobics''' is an aerobics style in which a group instructor choreographs several short dance combinations and teaches them to the class. This is usually achieved by teaching the class 1-2 movements at a time and repeating the movements until the class is able to join the whole choreography together. Aerobic music is used throughout the class. This is sometimes followed by a strength section which uses body weight exercises to strengthen muscles and a stretch routine to cool down and improve [[flexibility]]. Classes are usually 30–60 minutes in length and may include the use of equipment such as a barbell, [[aerobics|aerobic]] step, or small weights.

In freestyle aerobics, the instructor choreographs the routine and adjusts it to the needs and wants of her/his class. There is often no difference between base movements in freestyle and pre-choreographed programs.

It is practiced to improve aerobic fitness, [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]] and strength.

==Aerobic gymnastics== 
[[File:figuraaerobic.jpg|thumb|right|A sport aerobics team]]
[[Aerobic gymnastics]], also known as [[sport aerobics]] and [[Competition#Sports|competitive]] aerobics, may combine complicated [[choreography]], [[rhythmic gymnastics|rhythmic]] and [[acrobatic gymnastics]] with elements of aerobics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Aerobic|url=https://www.fig-gymnastics.com/site/page/view?id=277|website=Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance is divided into categories by age, sex and groups (individual, mixed pairs and trios) and are judged on the following elements: dynamic and static strength, jumps and leaps, kicks, balance and flexibility. Ten exercises are mandatory: four consecutive high leg kicks, patterns.  A maximum of ten elements from following families are allowed: [[push-ups]], supports and balances, kicks and splits, jumps and leaps.  Elements of [[tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]] such as [[Handspring (gymnastics)|handsprings]], [[handstand]]s, [[flip (acrobatic)|back flips]], and aerial [[somersault]]s are prohibited.  Scoring is by judging of artistic quality, creativity, execution, and difficulty of routines.  Sport aerobics has state, national, and international competitions, but is not an olympic sport.

==Benefits==
Like other forms of exercise, step aerobics helps burn calories and fat. The number of calories burned depends on the speed of movements, step height, length of exercise, and the persons height and weight.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1652">[[File:Cricketfieldingpositions.jpg|thumb|400px|right]] The '''cow corner''' is a region of the field with respect to the batsman in [[cricket]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Williamson. [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/239756.html A glossary of cricket terms.] ESPN Cricinfo.&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of cow corner depends on a batsman's [[handedness]], but it is always a part of the [[Fielding (cricket)|field]] in the deep on the batsman's [[leg side]], typically stretching from forward of deep midwicket to backward of long on. The diagram shows the location of cow corner for a right-handed batsman.

Cow corner is named because that is where 'cow shots' are intended to go. Cow shots are wild and risky shots which were considered to be mostly played by players with little knowledge of, or ability to apply, the more difficult techniques of the game. Such players were supposed to be particularly prominent in the type of cricket played in rural or agricultural areas, where players did not have exposure to more sophisticated methods of playing. Such shots are also called agricultural.

This region of the field has been somewhat more frequented in more recent forms of the game, including T20 matches, as batsmen have had to find ways to hit the ball to the boundary even for [[yorker]]-length deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;Shubham Khare.

==Synopsis==
{{Anchor|Plot}} 

The film follows Josh "Skreech" Sandoval, a [[skateboarder]] living in [[California]].  It was shot in various California towns as well as [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] and [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]].

The film begins with Sandoval cleaning out a pool behind an abandoned house.  He skates in the pool a short time before a neighbor threatens to call the police.  Toward the end of the film, Sandoval and Josh "Peacock" Henderson are interviewed on ''[[The Daily Habit]]'' where they discuss the effect the [[2008-2012 global recession|recession]] has had on the availability of empty pools.

Sandoval skates in a contest in Malmö.  He also skates at several different [[skateparks]] and pools in California.  He spends a lot of time with his girlfriend, Leslie.  They smoke [[marijuana]], drink alcohol, hike, and fish.  Sandoval also visits his infant son, Sid, and his ex-girlfriend, Angela.  He gets a [[tattoo]] of a rocket with "Sid" written across it.  At the tattoo parlour, Leslie flips through a skateboard book in which Sandoval is pictured as representative of "odd".

Sandoval usually stays with friends.  At one point he is sleeping in a tent in a friend's backyard.  After receiving a phone call from his mother, he says that he had not heard from her in six months, and before that had not heard from her in a year.

Sandoval and Leslie have a garage sale, then leave for a [[roadtrip]] to [[Arizona]] and [[Portland, Oregon]].  When they return, Leslie goes back to school and Sandoval begins working at a [[bowling alley]] next to [[Disneyland]].

==Background==
Filmmaker Tristan Patterson met Sandoval at a party in [[Chino, California]].  During the party, a video featuring Sandoval skating was projected on a wall.  According to Patterson, Sandoval had this style that was all his own and he had this instinct for what he did."&lt;ref name=Filmmaker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Brandon|title=Tristan Patterson, 'Dragonslayer'|journal=Filmmaker|date=October 26, 2011|url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/news/2011/10/tristan-patterson-dragonslayer/|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dukla Prague''' ({{lang-cz|Dukla Praha}}) was a Czech [[association football|football]] club from the city of [[Prague]]. Established in 1948 as '''ATK Praha''', the club won a total of 11 Czechoslovak league titles and eight Czechoslovak Cups, and in the 1966–67 season, reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. As late as 1985–86 they reached the [[UEFA]] [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] semi-final and they also made a great impact in the American Challenge Cup competition in [[New York City]] with four wins between 1961 and 1964. The club sent seven players to the silver medal winning Czechoslovakia national team in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], in a year which saw them win the fifth of their domestic league titles as well as their player [[Josef Masopust]] be named [[Ballon d'Or (1956–2009)|European Footballer of the Year]]. Between the start of the competition in 1955 and 1991, Dukla played more matches in the [[European Cup]] than any other team in Czechoslovakia.

Dukla Prague football club was connected to clubs of other sports, but this connection continues no longer. Separate [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[team handball|handball]], [[modern pentathlon]], [[cycling]] etc. clubs named Dukla Praha however still nurture world class athletes in their respective sports (like [[Roman Šebrle]] and others). In contrast to the football clubs, these are still under patronage of the [[Military of the Czech Republic|Czech Army]].

== History ==
Dukla Prague was formed in 1948 as '''{{lang|cs|Armádní tělovýchovný klub}} (ATK) Praha''' and started life in the top division of Czechoslovak football.&lt;ref name=pivoda7&gt;Pivoda 2013, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jerabek-profile&gt;Jeřábek 2007, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dukla organisation, as it later became known, was run by the [[Czechoslovak Army]] and included seven sports teams.&lt;ref name=duklareturns&gt;{{cite news|first=František|last=Bouc|url=http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/2742-dukla-returns.html|title=Dukla Returns|work=Prague Post|date=6 December 2006|accessdate=14 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615221959/http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/2742-dukla-returns.html|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club changed its name to '''{{lang|cs|Ústřední dům armády}} (ÚDA) Praha''' in 1953, winning the first of eleven league titles in the [[1953 Czechoslovak First League|1953 season]].&lt;ref name=pivoda7/&gt;&lt;ref name=jerabek-profile/&gt; The club went on to win the [[1956 Czechoslovak First League|1956 league title]], changing their name to '''{{lang|cs|Dukla Praha}}''' the same year in honour of those had fallen at the [[Battle of Dukla Pass]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=jerabek-profile/&gt; The subsequent [[1957–58 Czechoslovak First League|1957–58 season]] brought the club a second consecutive league title for the club and their third overall.

The 1960–61 season marked the inaugural season of the [[Czechoslovak Cup]]. That season, Dukla completed a "[[double (association football)|double]]" as they defeated [[Dynamo Žilina]] in the cup final to add to their fourth league title.&lt;ref name=jerabek-profile/&gt;&lt;ref name=jer233&gt;Jeřábek 2007, pp. 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt; The club was on the verge of another double in 1962, winning the league but losing in the cup final to [[ŠK Slovan Bratislava|Slovan Bratislava]].&lt;ref name=jerabek-profile/&gt;&lt;ref name=jer233/&gt; 1962 was also a World Cup year. Dukla were represented by seven players on the [[Czechoslovakia national football team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fotbal.idnes.cz/masopust-vzpomina-0nw-/fot_reprez.aspx?c=A121022_135015_fot_reprez_mn|title=Masopust vzpomíná, jak se v jedenašedesátém málem musel zastřelit|language=Czech|work=Mladá fronta DNES|date=22 October 2012|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reached the [[1962 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] before losing to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. Dukla star [[Josef Masopust]] scored in the final as Brazil won 3–1 and was later named as the winner of the 1962 [[Ballon d'Or (1956–2009)|Ballon d'Or]]. Dukla spent the next two seasons winning the league again, making a total of four titles in a row. The 1964–65 season yielded just the Cup before Dukla completed their second double in 1965–66.&lt;ref name=jerabek-profile/&gt; The club's final trophy of the decade came in the 1968–69 cup. In the first nine seasons of the cup competition, therefore, Dukla had reached six finals and won four titles.&lt;ref name=jer233/&gt;

The competition's format changed after the 1968–69 season, and it was not until 1980–81 that Dukla would record another title in the competition, repeating the achievement in 1982–83, 1984–85 and 1989–90.&lt;ref name=jer233/&gt; In the 1985–86 season, the club recorded its record win, a 10–0 victory against [[TJ Dynamo České Budějovice|Dynamo České Budějovice]].&lt;ref name=pivoda28&gt;Pivoda 2013, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International competitions ===
Between the start of the competition in 1955 and 1991, Dukla played more matches in the [[European Cup]] (45) than any other team in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name=jer244&gt;Jeřábek 2007, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The five players from the Czechoslovak league with the most appearances in the competition in the pre-Champions League era of the European Cup all represented Dukla in the competition, these being [[Josef Masopust]], [[Jozef Adamec]], [[Jiří Čadek]], [[Josef Vacenovský]] and [[Dušan Kabát]].&lt;ref name=jer244/&gt;

Czech writer and sports journalist [[Ota Pavel]] wrote a unique book about Dukla's first victory in the [[American Challenge Cup]] and named it ''Dukla mezi mrakodrapy'' ({{lang-en|Dukla Among Skyscrapers}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/cz/clanek/5002|title=Dukla mezi mrakodrapy|language=Czech|work=Czech Radio|date=7 July 2001|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supremacy of Dukla was so undisputed the organizers decided to establish the American Challenge Cup as the final of next International Soccer League editions, in which Dukla was invited to play against the winners of the group stage. Dukla won three American Challenge Cups, over Brazil's [[America Football Club (RJ)|America-RJ]] in 1962 (1–1 and 2–1), over [[West Ham United]] in 1963 (1–0 and 1–1) and over [[Zagłębie Sosnowiec]] in 1964 (3–1 and 1–1).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/usadave/islii.html R.S.S.S.F.: USA&amp;nbsp;– International Soccer League II]&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years they struggled to maintain international recognition, however they were well known to [[United Kingdom|British]] fans thanks to [[Half Man Half Biscuit]]'s cult song: "All I want for Christmas is a Dukla Prague away kit" which was the B-side of their 1986 single "The Trumpton Riots" and was subsequently issued on the album [[Back Again in the DHSS]] and then on the CD release of the album [[Back in the DHSS]].  Fans of the band have created considerable demand for replica Dukla Prague shirts and made the team a favourite among hipster football fans.

Dukla's overall record in the International Soccer League and the American Challenge Cup thus comprises 11 wins, four draws and one loss with a score of 49–19.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/usadave/islii.html International Soccer League statistics] on Rec. Sport. Soccer Statistics Foundation (R.S.S.S.F.) website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Czech Republic era ===
1994 saw the club's long-running association with the military come to an end and at the same time its status as a top-division team was lost.&lt;ref name=duklareturns/&gt; Dukla finished last in the [[1993–94 Czech First League]], employing three different managers over the course of the season.&lt;ref name=pivoda99&gt;Pivoda 2013, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In a season which saw the club lose 7–0 to [[FK Viktoria Žižkov|Viktoria Žižkov]],&lt;ref name=pivoda28/&gt; Dukla won just one of their thirty matches, a 1–0 victory against [[SK Hradec Králové|Hradec Králové]].&lt;ref name=pivoda99/&gt; Dukla played the following 1994–95 season in the third-tier [[Bohemian Football League]], finishing in third place behind [[SK Chrudim]] and [[FK Pelikán Děčín|Pelikán Děčín]].&lt;ref name=pivoda99/&gt; Dukla was unable to win the league in the 1995–96 season either, again finishing third, this time behind [[AFK Atlantic Lázně Bohdaneč|Atlantic Lázně Bohdaneč]] and [[FK Česká Lípa|Česká Lípa]].&lt;ref name=pivoda99/&gt;

The club then merged with second division side FC Portál Příbram in 1996.&lt;ref name=duklareturns/&gt;&lt;ref name=pivoda99/&gt; The new club, which later became known as [[1. FK Příbram]], played one season in Prague at Juliska before moving to [[Příbram]] in 1997, the last home match at Juliska being a 2–2 draw with relegated [[FK Baník Havířov|Baník Havířov]] on 1 June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Pivoda 2013, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reformation and return ===
{{Main|FK Dukla Prague}}
The name of Dukla Prague disappeared from the Czech football for several years, but not forever. Dukla Dejvice, a local Prague team founded in 1959, began playing at Juliska stadium and adopted Dukla Prague's yellow and red colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Vladislav|last=Pivoňka|url=http://www.sestka.cz/index.php?clanek=941|title=Fotbalová Dukla hraje stále dál...|language=Czech|work=Šestka&amp;nbsp;– Noviny MČ Praha 6|date=|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club entered the [[Prague Championship]] in 2001. In November 2006, Dukla Prague management announced that it had agreed to take over the [[Czech 2. liga|second league]] rights of the [[Jakubčovice Fotbal|Jakubčovice]] team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deniksport.cz/Clanek480264.htm Czech article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032934/http://www.deniksport.cz/Clanek480264.htm |date=27 September 2007 }} in the Sport daily from 19 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary club returned to the Czech top league in 2011.

'''''EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer''''' is a [[video game]] developed by EA Canada for the [[Wii]] console. It was released on May 19, 2009 in North America.&lt;ref name="NA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easportsactive.com/home.action?id=Active%20Press%20Release-20081112111814201.xml|title=EA Sports Active Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game ships with a strappable pouch to hold the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]] and a [[Strength training|resistance band]].

The game is the first in a line of ''EA Sports Active'' branded games and related peripherals.&lt;ref name=gspot/&gt; An expansion, ''EA Sports Active: More Workouts'', was released on November 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://easportsactive.com/news.action?id=EA%20SPORTS%20Active%20More%20Workouts-20090818080518631.xml EA SPORTS Active Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

A follow-up, [[EA Sports Active 2]], released in November 2010. An [[National Football League|NFL]]-themed version, [[EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp]], was released on the same day.

== Gameplay ==

''EA Sports Active'' is an [[Exergaming|exercise game]] consisting of activities that use the motion controls of the Wii platform. Primarily played using the [[Wii Remote]], the game package includes a pouch that allows the player to strap the attached Nunchuk to their legs in order to track their lower body movements. The [[Wii Balance Board]] is also supported but is not required for play.&lt;ref name=gspot&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6201028.html Q&amp;A: EA Sports Active-ating Wii]&lt;/ref&gt;

The game features a number of exercise options supervised by a virtual [[personal trainer]] including 20 minute workout regimens and a 30 Day Challenge mode that lets players set workout goals such as calories burned or a number of sessions while tracking their progress over time. The idea is that the weight loss will happen on its own if the calories burned goals in each workout are met or exceeded.&lt;ref name=CTV&gt;[http://krisabel.ctv.ca/post/Review-e28093-EA-Sports-Active-Personal-Trainer.aspx Review – EA Sports Active Personal Trainer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The game also awards trophies for reaching specific fitness landmarks such as accumulating 10 total workout hours, working out with a friend, and completing all the exercises in the 30 Day Challenge.

Players are also encouraged to create a custom workout session built around either personal favorite exercises, calorie goals (such as burning 100+ calories in one session), or targeting specific body areas. To help aid in creating a balanced workout, a percentage chart displays how much of the routine is devoted to either upper body, lower body, or cardio development. The intensity of the workout can be altered by changing the difficulty levels of either a single exercise or the entire routine.

== Development ==

EA Sports' [[Peter Moore (business)|Peter Moore]] claims that ''EA Sports Active'' was developed to focus more on a higher-impact "Western" philosophy of exercise focused mainly on weight loss, compared to a lower-impact, stretching and balance based "Eastern" approach as taken by [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Wii Fit]]''.&lt;ref name=gspot/&gt; EA also saw a strong business opportunity in creating a game for people who need to work out yet do not have the time or are not comfortable doing so in public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/11/20/peter-moore-names-ea-sports-highlight-predicts-fitness-boom/ EA Sports Chief Names His Brand’s 2008 Highlight, Predicts Fitness Gaming Boom]&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrity personal trainer [[Bob Greene (fitness guru)|Bob Greene]] was involved with developing the game.&lt;ref name=gspot/&gt;

''EA Sports Active'' has received generally positive reviews from video game critics and mainstream media.

One of the biggest critiques on EA's community message boards about the game was the lack of real resistance offered by the supplied elastic band. Many found that folding the band over itself as suggested by the game’s tutorial to be ineffective in increasing the resistance level. However, the supplied grips for the elastic band can be used with other elastic bands, specifically those used in [[pilates]], in order to increase the intensity of all upper body exercises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/235442.page#2261301 EA Sports Active General Discussion - Elastic Band for muscle development]&lt;/ref&gt;

EA claims that ''EA Sports Active'' has sold over 600,000 units worldwide between May 19, 2009 and June 1, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gonintendo.com/viewstory.php?id=84609 EA Sports Active Has Great Sales... Told Ya!]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.8 million units in its quarter. It is EA's best selling Wii title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gonintendo.com/viewstory.php?id=91934 EA very happy with booming Wii business, EA Sports Active sells 1.8 million]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of an option to switch to left-handed has caused discontent for some left-handed users who have purchased the game as this is not advertised on the outer packaging.

==More Workouts==
After the success the game received, EA Sports released an expansion pack on 17 November 2009, titled '''''EA Sports Active: More Workouts''''', which as the name suggests added several new workouts to the existing program.

:''For ride-on golfing vehicle see [[Golf cart]] 
An '''electric golf trolley''' is an [[electric cart]] (a battery-powered [[cart]]) that is designed to carry a [[golf]] bag, complete with [[golf club (equipment)|clubs]] and other [[golf equipment]]. It eliminates the need for golfers to carry their own clubs or hire a [[caddie]], and requires much less effort than a manual push or pull trolley.

Electric golf trolleys were introduced into the United Kingdom by [[Joe Catford]] who established the company [[Powakaddy]] in 1983. Having sold Powakaddy in the early 1990s, Catford went on to found HillBilly, another company specialising in electric golf trolleys.

'''Highmarking''' or '''High-Marking''' is a popular activity performed by snowmobilers in [[mountainous]] terrain, where the [[snowmobile]] operator tries to ride as far up a steep mountain slope as possible, then turn around and come back down the hill without getting stuck, rolling the snowmobile or losing power.

This activity is extremely dangerous because optimum highmark terrain is typically in areas where [[avalanche]] danger is extremely high. Snowmobilers are the recreation group most likely to be killed in an avalanche, largely due to the activity of highmarking.

According to the [[Utah Avalanche Forecast Center]], "Avalanche victims are almost exclusively backcountry recreationists--snowmobilers, climbers, snowboarders, snowshoers, skiers and hikers. Snowmobilers lead the list with twice the number of fatalities as any other activity."


Highmarking is the recreational maneuver of attempting to reach the highest point of a snow-covered feature such as a mountain, on a [[snowmobile]]. It refers to a specific activity in which the snowmobile operator's main goal is to accelerate and gain maximum elevation upon the face of a mountain before the machine reaches the top of the feature or upward progress is suddenly forced to diminish because of the grade of the feature, which gives the rider no choice but to turn around.

A High mark begins when a snowmobiler leaves an established trail and fully accelerates; blazing his/her own trail upward toward the summit of a snow-covered mountain face, ideally lying at a 30-45% grade. As the terrain gets steeper, the machine's acceleration slows down. At the apex of the elevation gained, the rider must sharply turn 180 degrees and descend the feature. The height of the arching track left in the snow by a pioneering rider usually sparks competition within members of a rider's party, urging the rest to surpass the height of the original arch, thus initiating a competition. High marks vary in their degrees of difficulty depending on the pitch of a given ascent and conditions of the snow.

Highmarking involves serious personal injury risk factors, most notably the danger of the rider triggering an [[avalanche]] and becoming buried in the ensuing cataclysm. According to [http://www.snowmobilers.org], "Highmarking accounts for more than 63 percent of the avalanche fatalities involving snowmobilers in North America." Highmarking should only be attempted by snowmobilers who are equipped with avalanche transceivers and accompanied by other riders capable of detecting a distress signal and rescuing a buried snowmobiler.

'''''Jane Blalock v. Ladies Professional Golf Association''''' was an ongoing lawsuit that took place between 1972 and 1975, following a professional [[golf]] incident in 1972. A month after winning the notable [[Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle]] in 1972, American golfer [[Jane Blalock]] was allegedly observed replacing her marker incorrectly at the [[Bluegrass Invitational]] during the [[1972 LPGA Tour]].&lt;ref name="droughtcorneliius"/&gt; Blalock was fined and suspended by the [[LPGA Tour]] executive board. The suspension led to a fair degree of press coverage, with Blalock filing an anti-trust countersuit in [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia]] shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt;

In June 1973, federal judge [[Charles Allen Moye Jr.|Charles A. Moye Jr.]] ruled that "LGPA players cannot police their own members," and that Blalock's suspension "was ill-founded."&lt;ref name="antitrust"/&gt;  A court awarded Blalock damages the following year.&lt;ref name="damagesfurthertipled"/&gt; The LPGA subsequently announced plans to appeal.&lt;ref name="favordamages"/&gt; The ongoing lawsuit led to the LPGA searching for its first [[commissioner]], and after Ray Volpe was appointed to the role in July 1975,&lt;ref name="lpgavolpe"/&gt; a month later the LPGA dropped its appeal and settled all claims on the Blalock case.&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor"/&gt;

==Background==
[[Jane Blalock]] was born in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] on September 19, 1945.&lt;ref name="all-timereocrdmade"/&gt; She began golfing at age 13, and won the New Hampshire Amateur five straight times beginning in 1965, plus the New England Amateur in 1968. Blalock attended [[Rollins College]] in [[Florida]], graduating in 1967 with a degree in [[history]]. Prior to her playing the LPGA Tour, Blalock worked as a high school history teacher.&lt;ref name="googlewinner"/&gt;

The first time Blalock played on the LPGA Tour was as an amateur at the 1964 [[Lady Carling Eastern Open]]. She finished T33.

Still an amateur, Blalock finished 5th at the 1969 [[Burdine's Invitational]].&lt;ref name="all-timereocrdmade"/&gt;

Blalock turned pro later in 1969 and went on to earn [[LPGA Tour Rookie of the Year]] honors.&lt;ref name="hofficialboublalock"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Blalock notched her first professional victory at the [[Potamkin Cadillac Classic|Lady Carling Open]].&lt;ref name="jcaptures"/&gt; On April 16, 1972, Blalock won the inaugural version of the [[Dinah Shore Colgate Winner's Circle]],&lt;ref name="receiveswin"/&gt; an event which would later be considered a [[women's major golf championships|women's major golf championship]]. One month later she won the [[Suzuki Golf Internationale]], beating [[Kathy Whitworth]].&lt;ref name="takessuzuku"/&gt;

==History of the conflict==
===Disqualification (1972)===
{{See also|1972 LPGA Tour}}
After reaching the status of "top money winner on this year's [LPGA] tour," Blalock was competing in the [[Bluegrass Invitational]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] by mid May 1972. After the second round the LPGA executive board called Blalock in to tell her she was disqualified from the tournament, contending that she signed an incorrect scorecard and also levying a $500 fine.&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Although Blalock's scorecards had been signed and attested by fellow competitors, Tourney director Gene Mcauliff stated that Blalock "did not mark her ball properly on the 17th green and then failed to take a two-stroke penalty as required for that infraction."&lt;ref name="droughtcorneliius"/&gt;

All five members of the executive committee, Linda Craft, [[Sharon Miller]], [[Judy Rankin]], Cynthia Sullivan, and Penny Zavichas, were themselves active players.&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt; After Blalock's initial interaction with the committee at the Bluegrass Invitational, 27 LPGA players signed an [[affidavit]] demanding "that more severe action be taken against Jane Blalock,"&lt;ref name="refuseback"/&gt; specifically arguing that probation, a fine, and disqualification from the Bluegrass tournament were not enough punishment.&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt;

===Hearings and suspension (1972)===

|style="text-align: left;"|"[The LPGA committee] told Blalock she had been observed incorrectly marking her ball on several occasions. Blalock had never before been accused of violating the rules. Despite denying the charges, she was disqualified from the tournament. Before her next event, on the advice of a friend, Blalock apologized, saying, 'If all these things you say are true, I guess I've dug my own grave and I'll just have to live with it.' LPGA president [Cynthia Sullivan] interpreted Blalock's comments as an admission of guilt. When that view was reported to the players, 29 of them signed a petition calling for the LPGA to suspend Blalock for the rest of the '72 season, which it did a few days later."

On May 20, 1972&lt;ref name="antitrust"/&gt; the LPGA executive board suspended Blalock for one year "for actions inconsistent with the code of ethics of the organization."&lt;ref name="suspensionbl"/&gt; The suspension came shortly after the announcement that Blalock wouldn't be allowed to compete in the [[Potamkin Cadillac Classic|Lady Carling Open]]. The tour also put a hold on her money earnings from the tour, at the time around $50,000.&lt;ref name="concentrahard"/&gt;

In defending their reasons for the suspension, the board stated in a press release that "the action was taken after Miss Blalock met with the executive committee on three occasions in the last 10 days. She admitted actions on the golf course which are contrary to the rules of the game."&lt;ref name="suspensionbl"/&gt; According to ''Sports Illustrated,'' the board also claimed that Blalock had "been under suspicion for over a year, that there [had] been repeated violations, that witnesses in the gallery at Louisville had observed her replacing the ball to the side of her marker on the green&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor72"/&gt; and that Janie tearfully admitted to her guilt. Miss Blalock was denying everything."&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; LPGA executive director Bud Erickson also stated that he had requested Blalock to feign a back injury in an effort to avoid bad publicity, but she refused.&lt;ref name="refuseback"/&gt;

===Initial anti-trust lawsuit (1972)===
On June 1, 1972, Blalock filed a $5 million [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust]] [[countersuit]] against the LPGA's suspension&lt;ref name="suitresolved"/&gt; on advice of her attorneys,&lt;ref name="suspensionbl"/&gt; with the intent of "[leaving] it to the court whether she had been suspended wrongly."&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Blalock's lawyers motioned for her be allowed to continue playing while the suit was resolved.&lt;ref name="suitresolved"/&gt; As part of their argument, Blalock's lawyers denied she had ever admitted guilt to the LPGA,&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt; and that the described admissions had been a misinterpretation of her words.&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt; Furthermore, using the sequence of events, attorney Eugene Partain "alleged that the suspension and petitions were likely the result of other players attempting to remove a significant competitor, and that the act of suspending [Blalock] from playing in any significant tournaments was a violation of federal antitrust laws by the LPGA."&lt;ref name="notenoughpunish"/&gt;

Around June 19, Blalock met with the LGPA in [[U.S. District Court]] in [[Atlanta]] over the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Later that month U.S. District Court Judge [[Charles Allen Moye Jr.|Charles A. Moye Jr.]] granted the motion for Blalock to continue competing in the LPGA Tour until the lawsuit was resolved,&lt;ref name="motiongranted"/&gt; in effect creating a temporary [[restraining order]] against the suspension. Moye also ruled that any tour money Blalock earned during the case would be placed in a court trust. The LPGA reacted to Moye's rulings by announcing they would file an appeal suit.&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor72"/&gt;

===Colleagues' initial reactions (1972)===
News of the suspension and alleged rules violation drew significant press coverage, as well as mixed reactions from Blalock's colleagues. Though he said he'd never seen her move a ball against the rules himself, her former instructor [[Bob Toski]] stated that "She has a compulsion to win. I think she needs psychiatric help" and "the other players tell me this has been going on for a while." In contrast, Blalock's [[caddie]] from the Suzuki tournament contacted her with an offer to testify in her support.&lt;ref name="ddmiitedguit"/&gt; Men's professional golfer [[Dave Hill (golfer)|Dave Hill]], who himself filed an antitrust suit in 1971 against the [[PGA Tour]],&lt;ref name="davehilef"/&gt; sent Blalock a note of encouragement. In his golf memoir ''Teed Off'', published in 1977, Hill wrote that he didn't know how Blalock continued to play well under the pressure she was enduring. The fact that Blalock did play well made Hill think she was innocent unless she was a victim of some illness.&lt;ref name="illnessshe"/&gt;

Golfer [[Sandra Palmer]] had also publicly defended Blalock as of July 8, 1972, after she and Blalock tied for lead at the [[George Washington Golf Classic]]. Stated Palmer to the press, "I've never seen her do anything [illegal], nor do I think probably that very many of the players have. I think supposedly that out of all these players who accused, only one or two have played with her." Palmer explained she didn't understand why bystanders hadn't reported the alleged infractions when they occurred, also pointing out that other players had always signed Blalock's scorecards without reporting any incidents. Stated Palmer, "if you see an infraction of the rules... you don't wait until three years later to report something. Once you've signed that card, you're as guilty as the person who committed the violation."&lt;ref name="vilationcard"/&gt;

===Probation of Sandra Palmer (1972)===
The ''[[Sarasota Journal]]'' reported on June 28, 1972 that [[Sandra Palmer]] had been "warned" by the LPGA over her statements of support for Blalock, with the LPGA explaining to Palmer that "you're entitled to your own opinion, but when it hurts our members, we feel you owe the organization an apology."&lt;ref name="statmentsdrama"/&gt; [[Bud Erickson]], executive director of the LPGA, later clarified that Palmer was also ordered "not to make any further statements of support for Miss Blalock."&lt;ref name="nosupportstatement"/&gt; The warning occurred as the tour arrived at the [[Potamkin Cadillac Classic|Lady Pepsi Golf Tournament]], where Blalock had previously won two championships.&lt;ref name="statmentsdrama"/&gt; On August 2, 1972, Palmer was put on one year's probation by the LPGA executive committee for voicing her support of Blalock.&lt;ref name="nosupportstatement"/&gt; Blalock went on to win two more times in 1972, at the [[Dallas Civitan Open]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19720911&amp;id=2XchAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pIkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4553,2391280&amp;hl=en Jane Blalock wins Dallas golf playoff]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lady Errol Classic]].&lt;ref name="ladyreerolclassic"/&gt;

After filing the original anti-trust suit, Blalock amended the suit to include only damages from not being able to compete in the Lady Carling Tournmanent in 1972 for $4,500.&lt;ref name="favordamages"/&gt;

|style="text-align: left;"|"In [the early 1970s] the [[LPGA]] was run by the players themselves. There was no office for the organization and no nonplaying director of the LPGA. Blalock, who denied she ever cheated and said she was the victim of older, jealous players as she began to make a mark on the tour, sued in [[United States federal courts|Federal Court]] in [[Atlanta]] to retain her playing rights and won. The court declared that players had no right to deprive a fellow competitor from an equal chance at the prize money they all were trying to earn."

In June 1973, Judge Charles Moye Jr. ruled that "LGPA players cannot police their own members." The ruling declared that Blalock's suspension "was ill-founded," with all remaining litigation to be focused on damages.&lt;ref name="antitrust"/&gt; In September 1973, ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]'' reported that as a result of the court ruling in Blalock's favor, the LPGA and their new president [[Carol Mann]] were looking to appoint a [[commissioner]] to "[enable] the association to penalize, suspend and fine members who violate rules and regulations."&lt;ref name="commissionera"/&gt;

In August 1974, a court awarded Blalock the full $4,500 she had asked for in damages,&lt;ref name="damagesfurthertipled"/&gt; with the LPGA again announcing plans to appeal.&lt;ref name="favordamages"/&gt; Afterwards, in March 1975 Judge Charles Moye again ruled in Blalock's favor, awarding her $13,500 in damages and ordering the LPGA to pay her legal fees of $95,303. The LPGA again announced it would appeal the ruling in its entirety.&lt;ref name="damagesfurthertipled"/&gt; Ray Volpe was appointed the first LPGA Commissioner on July 8, 1975,&lt;ref name="lpgavolpe"/&gt; and a month later the LPGA announced it had dropped its appeal and settled "all claims and counter claims growing from a dispute between it and golfer Jane Blalock."&lt;ref name="courtrustinfavor"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Blalock refused to condemn her critics, including her former mentor Bob Toski, after her lawsuit was settled. She said to a reporter in 1978 "I should not judge others as they have judged me. Life is too short and there is too much sadness. So I can't clutter my mind with all that other stuff. It makes it hard to concentrate."&lt;ref name="concentrahard"/&gt; Bob Toski left the [[Senior PGA Tour]] in 1986 after he became involved in a controversy over how he was marking his ball.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H7VhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sc4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1779,6138908&amp;dq=bob+toski+seniors+tour&amp;hl=en Toski withdraws from Senior Tour]&lt;/ref&gt; Toski returned in April 1986&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FPcjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bdsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3915,2451335&amp;dq=toski+golf&amp;hl=en 28 Teams To Compete In Legends of Golf]&lt;/ref&gt; and played several more years on the Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pgatour.com/players/player.02208.bob-toski.html |title=Bob Toski – Results – Career |publisher=PGA Tour |access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blalock continued playing on the LPGA Tour through 1987. When she was through playing, Blalock had 27 Tour wins to her credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=2008 LPGA Media Guide|publisher=[[LPGA Tour]] |year=1977 |pages=52 and 363}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first female golfer to earn over $100,000 in four consecutive years&lt;ref name="retirementnyt"/&gt; and the seventh overall to reach the one million dollar mark in career earnings.&lt;ref name="earningsmillion"/&gt; Between 1969 and 1980, Blalock made the cut in 299 consecutive tournaments, an all-time LPGA Tour record.&lt;ref name="all-timereocrdmade"/&gt;

In 1976, Blalock testified for the LPGA Tour in a suit against a sponsor trying to start a Women's [[Masters Tournament]].&lt;ref name="againstsponsor"/&gt; Blalock wrote a column  for the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' in 1981 complaining about the association's overuse of sex appeal in promoting the tour.&lt;ref name="sexappealnotneeded"/&gt;

With 27 LPGA Tour wins, Blalock almost qualified for the [[World Golf Hall of Fame]] under the standards in use as of 2011. However, she never won a major championship in her career nor was she ever LPGA Player of the Year or winner of the LPGA Vare Trophy.&lt;ref name="worldgolffame"/&gt; Blalock would have to be voted in by the Veterans Committee.&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt;  As of 2018, all eligible [[List of golfers with most LPGA Tour wins|golfers with 20 or more wins on the LPGA Tour]] are in the World Golf Hall of Fame except Blalock. Several golfers who primarily played the LPGA Tour, [[Hollis Stacy]] who was inducted in 2012,&lt;ref name="hollisstacy2012"&gt;[http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7247989/hollis-stacy-selected-world-golf-hall-fame Hollis Stacy selected for Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judy Rankin]] and [[Donna Caponi]] have fewer career wins than Blalock but have been selected by the Veterans Committee. Blalock said in 2001 "It's almost a relief that I don't qualify. What if every year my name came up and every year I didn't make it? I'd be thinking, 'is what happened the reason?'"&lt;ref name="didntmakeit"/&gt;

In July 2014, she was voted into the [[Legends Tour|Legends Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="qlpgahome"/&gt;

In July 2009, Price began dating [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighter and former ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' actor [[Alex Reid (fighter)|Alex Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a167353/price-spends-night-with-ex-soap-actor.html|title=Price spends night with ex-soap actor|date=26 July 2009|accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 February 2010, Price married Reid in a private ceremony in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] at the chapel in the [[Wynn Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8494848.stm|title=Model Katie Price married Alex Reid in Vegas|date=2 February 2010|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; They later also formally married in a church in the UK; the ceremony was filmed for her TV series.

She married Kieran Hayler, at the Sandals Royal Bahamian Resort and Spa in the [[Bahamas]] on 16 January 2013. Hayler proposed on Christmas Day 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a451938/katie-price-a-psychic-told-me-id-marry-a-kevin-kieran-is-close.html|title=Katie Price: 'A psychic told me I'd marry a Kevin, Kieran is close'|work=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Katie Price announces her Divorce with Kieran Hayler|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/05/katie-price-announces-her-divorce-with-kieran-hayler/|agency=Indo-Asian News Service|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since separated from Kieran.

=== Children ===
Katie Price gave birth to her first child, son Harvey Price, in Brighton in May 2002. Harvey's father is former [[Association football|footballer]] [[Dwight Yorke]]. Harvey was found to be [[blindness|blind]], having a condition known as [[septo-optic dysplasia]], meaning that the development of his [[optic nerve]] was unpredictable. As he has matured, she has also discovered that he is on the [[Autism spectrum|autistic spectrum]], gains weight easily because he suffers from [[Prader–Willi syndrome]], and finds walking difficult.&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=173652006 |title=Two faces of Jordan |accessdate=18 March 2007 |author=Catherine Deveney |date=5 February 2006 |work=The Scotsman |location=UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205194741/http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=173652006 |archivedate=5 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, she gave birth by [[Caesarean section]] to her second son, Junior Savva Andreas Andre. In June 2007, she gave birth to her third child, daughter Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther Andre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6913310.stm|title=Jordan decides on daughter's name|accessdate=24 July 2007|date=24 July 2007|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Price gave birth to her third son, Jett Riviera Hayler. On 4 August 2014, she gave birth to a second daughter, Bunny Hayler, two weeks prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/katie-price-shares-first-picture-of-newborn-daughter-30485790.html|title=Katie Price shares first picture of newborn daughter|accessdate=5 August 2014|date=5 August 2014|work=The Irish Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surgery ===
In 2002, Price was treated for a [[leiomyosarcoma]] on her finger. The cancerous tumour was removed at a [[Nuffield Health|Nuffield Hospital]] near her Brighton home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2185943.stm|title=Jordan treated for cancer|accessdate=18 March 2007|date=11 August 2002|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, Price underwent surgery in the United States to reduce the size of her breast implants and also had [[rhinoplasty]]. However, she was not happy with the results of her breast implants, so returned to Beverly Hills, California in July 2008 for corrective surgery. She returned to the United Kingdom with much smaller size 32C breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23429284-details/Downsizing+Jordan:+How+Katie+Price+shrank+her+assets+in+time+for+Christmas/article.do |title=Downsizing Jordan: How Katie Price shrank her assets in time for Christmas |accessdate=20 February 2008 |date=27 December 2007 |work=London Evening Standard |location=UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803092317/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23429284-details/Downsizing%20Jordan%3A%20How%20Katie%20Price%20shrank%20her%20assets%20in%20time%20for%20Christmas/article.do |archivedate=3 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal issues ===
In September 2009, Price claimed that she had previously been raped by a "famous celebrity", but had not reported the incident. Price insisted that she would "absolutely never" reveal who the attacker was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/surrey/8261575.stm|title=Price contacted over rape claim |date=17 September 2009|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Surrey Police]] stated that they had not contacted Price: "No allegation of rape has been made and Miss Price will not be making a statement to police".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/surrey/8262226.stm|title=Price not quizzed over rape claim|date=18 September 2009|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal debt ===
In August 2018 Price was able to avoid [[bankruptcy]] after a High Court hearing was adjourned to give her three months to pay off her debts, reportedly totalling more than £250,000, nearly a tenth of which is tax. Price did not attend court, but submitted proposals for an [[Individual voluntary arrangement|Individual Voluntary Arrangemnt]] (IVA), whereby creditors are repaid over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/relationships/rise-fall-katie-price/|title=The rise and fall of Katie Price|first=Mark|last=Frith|date=7 August 2018|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/1435781/katie-price-bankruptcy-money-net-worth-court-hearing-kris-boyson|title=Katie Price avoids bankruptcy and is given 12 weeks to pay back debts|first=Alana|last=Anderson|date=7 August 2018|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UTEP Sun Bowl Stadium Aerial View Sept 6 2009.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Kidd Field, top left, and its replacement, [[Sun Bowl Stadium]], as seen from the air.]]
'''Kidd Field''' is an athletic facility used primarily by [[UTEP]] in [[El Paso, Texas]]. Constructed for its then-primary use as a football field in 1938, it was the site of the [[Sun Bowl]] until 1963 when [[Sun Bowl Stadium]] opened. Kidd Field is used for [[track and field]] meets today. Kidd Field cost $2,000 to build, and El Paso holds an annual Easter festival there.  Built in the early 1930s, Kidd Field has been home to numerous All-Americans, national champions, national record-holders and Olympians. Named after UTEP (then Texas College of Mines and Metallurgy) professor and athletic booster John W. Kidd, the facility was shared with the UTEP football team until 1962, when the facility became sole home to the track and field team.  The track features an eight-lane Mondo Track, the same surface used for the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. The track was made possible by generous donations from Wayne and Russ Vandenburg of EPT Management and Mark Fry. The track was dedicated in former Miner legend Larry K. Durham's name. His contribution gave Kidd Field a makeover in 2011, and it was dedicated in his name in April 2012.  A state-of-the-art Daktronics video board was added in January 2008. The 9x15-foot LED video display plants fans right into the action on the track, providing graphics and video elements that display real-time highlights throughout a meet. The lit facility also houses throws and jumps arenas, making Kidd Field one of the top track-only complexes in the country.

Australia has a rich history of bidding for and hosting major international [[multi-sport event]]s and [[world championship]]s. It has hosted two [[Summer Olympics]], one [[Summer Paralympics]] and three [[Commonwealth Games]]. In 2018, it will be hosting [[2018 Commonwealth Games]].

[[Australian Government]] provides funding for the hosting of major sports events in Australia. It provided $247.3&amp;nbsp;million in funding for the hosting of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]] and [[2000 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]].&lt;ref name=jolly&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jolly|first1=Rhonda|title=Sports funding: federal balancing act|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/2012-2013/SportFunding#_Toc360096383|website=Praliamentary Library|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, it has provided funding to [[2015 Asian Cup]], [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], [[2015 Netball World Cup]] and [[2018 Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref name=health&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Sports Events|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/sport-events|website=Dept. of Health website|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2015 Cricket World Cup, it provided $14&amp;nbsp;million in funding.&lt;ref name=ley&gt;{{cite web|title=International cricket community arrives in Australia|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2015-ley009.htm|website=Dept. of Health website|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its objectives in providing funding were to 
inspire Australian children to be active as well as providing a boost to the economy.&lt;ref name=ley/&gt; The event held in both Australia and New Zealand was expected to inject $360&amp;nbsp;million directly into both economies.&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;

Several [[Australian states and territories|Australian state and territory]] governments have established major event organisations to assist in the bidding and financing for major international sporting events in Australia. Their objectives are to improve their economies through tourism and further develop community and sporting facilities. Examples of these organisations are [[Victorian Major Events Company]], [[Events New South Wales]] and [[Tourism and Events Queensland]].

The cost of bidding and hosting sporting events has sometimes come under scrutiny. It was reported that Melbourne's 2014 [[Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix]] cost taxpayers almost $60&amp;nbsp;million. This was an additional $9.3&amp;nbsp;million than 2013 and due to declining ticket sales and increased costs.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite news|last1=Redrup|first1=Yolanda|title=Costs of staging Melbourne Formula One Grand Prix increase again|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/costs-of-staging-melbourne-formula-one-grand-prix-increase-again-20140910-10evs1.html|accessdate=18 February 2015|work=The Age|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia unsuccessfully bidded for he [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]s. The bid was managed by the [[Football Federation of Australia]] and was granted $42&amp;nbsp;million in Australian Government funding.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Madeleine|title=Senate to vote on possible inquiry into Australia's unsuccessful World Cup 2022 bid|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-22/senate-to-vote-on-inquiry-into-unsuccessful-world-cup-2022-bid/5983756|website=ABC News, 23 December 2014|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid came under scrutiny as only one vote out of 22 of the FIFA Executive Committee members was obtained and the ethics of Australia's bidding process.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

'''McCulloch Stadium''' is a 2,500-seat outdoor stadium in [[Salem, Oregon]], [[United States]]. Built in 1950, the multi-use facility serves as home to [[Willamette University]]'s football and track &amp; field teams, and [[high school]] football games. Located in [[Bush's Pasture Park]] south of Willamette's campus, the stadium includes a grandstand, football field, and track.

==History==
Charles E. McCulloch donated $50,000 to the school in June 1947 in order to build an athletic complex on {{convert|10|acres}} at what is now Bush's Pasture Park.&lt;ref name=donation&gt;{{cite news|title=$50,000 Received By Willamette|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 16, 1947|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, McCulloch was president of the university's board of trustees and an attorney in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] where he was a partner at what is now [[Stoel Rives]].&lt;ref name=donation/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.stoel.com/Anniversary_Timeline.aspx|work=Anniversary|publisher=Stoel Rives LLP|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed stadium was to have seating for 3,500 in a concrete grandstand, plus a baseball diamond, track, and practice field for the football team.&lt;ref name=donation/&gt; Construction began in March 1950 with it planned to be completed in time for that year's football season.&lt;ref name="bearcats get"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bearcats Get New Stadium|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=March 5, 1950|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced the stadium would be named for Charles E. McCulloch and have a total capacity of 7,000.&lt;ref name="bearcats get"/&gt;

On October 14, 1950, a dedication ceremony was held with school president [[G. Herbert Smith]] and Oregon governor [[Douglas McKay]] on hand to welcome [[Hawaii Warriors football|Hawaii]] and honor the 1941 Willamette team that was stranded in Hawaii after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=N.W. Conference Clubs Await Full Saturday Slate|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=October 14, 1950|page=The Oregonian; Date: 10–14-1950;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Giants]] football team held their first scrimmage of the 1958 season at the stadium on July 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NY Giants Hold First Scrimmage|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j25YAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BPgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=charles%20mcculloch%20stadium%20willamette&amp;pg=2987%2C1234425|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=[[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]]|date=August 2, 1958|location=Bend, Ore|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1970 the track surface was converted to an asphalt and rubber surface, which was resurfaced in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="track"&gt;{{cite news|title=Track back to proper length|last=Gault|first=Roy|date=March 28, 2001|work=Statesman Journal|pages=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCulloch Stadium went through a major renovation in 1993.&lt;ref name=SO&gt;[http://www.salemhistory.net/education/willamette_university.htm Salem Online History: Willamette University]&lt;/ref&gt; After renovations, the field was named Ted Ogdahl Field in honor of the former coach while the locker rooms were dedicated in the honor of Jeff Knox.&lt;ref name=SO/&gt; In October 1997, [[Liz Heaston]] became the first female to play in a college football game, kicking two extra points in the [[1997 Linfield vs. Willamette football game|game]] at McCulloch against [[Linfield College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Called into history|last=Bachman|first=Rachel|date=October 14, 2007|work=[[The Oregonian]]|pages=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new $300,000 rekotan track surface was installed at the stadium in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Willamette gets improvement to athletic facilities|last=English|first=Reid|date=September 22, 2000|work=Statesman Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time university officials discovered the previous track was {{convert|6|m|ft}} too long.&lt;ref name="track"/&gt; In 2003 the grass field was removed and a new FieldTurf surface was installed at a cost of $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Willamette University 2003-04 highlights|date=May 16, 2004|work=Statesman Journal|pages=2J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year lights were re-installed at McCulloch at a cost of $110,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McCulloch Stadium|last=English|first=Reid|date=October 1, 2003|work=Statesman Journal|pages=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new video scoreboard was added at the facility in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Permit issue slows WU scoreboard plans|last=Hagan|first=Chris|date=September 26, 2007|work=Statesman Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Pallaeh vetulonia 2001 (a).jpg|thumb|250px|"Palla eh!" game in [[Vetulonia]], 2001]]
'''Palla''' ([[Italian (language)|Italian]] for ''ball'') is a traditional [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] ball game played in villages between [[Siena]] and [[Grosseto]].  It is also called '''palla EH!''' (or '''pallaeh!''') because players call out ''eh!'' before serving.

Small handmade balls contain a lead pellet wrapped in rubber and wool with a leather cover.  The game is played by facing teams who strike (not catch) the ball with either a bare or gloved hand.  Courts are marked out with painted lines on town streets, but there is no net, and players can move between sides.  Adjacent buildings, objects, and sometimes spectators, are considered "in play."  Play does stop for oncoming automobiles.  Similar to [[real tennis]], a second bounce can result in a "chase" rather than an outright point, marked in chalk where the ball stops rolling.

Scoring is identical to that of tennis (15-30-40-game).  In the variant called '''pallaventuno''' (or '''palla 21''') each game counts as 7, and a set is won with three games (7 for the first, 14 for the second, and 21 for the third, hence the name given to the game). In the other variant, games are simply counted in progression (game 1, game 2). '''Pallacorda''' (or '''palla della corda''') is an extinct form of the game where a cord was strung across the street.  [[Pisa]], [[Prato]], [[Rome]], Siena, and various Tuscan towns still have streets named ''via Pallacorda'' or ''via Della Corda''.

==Historical significance==

Palla is of interest to those who study the history of tennis, as it provides some insight into the development of the more contemporarily popular sport.  Given the similarities of scoring and the use of chases, it is highly likely palla and tennis share a common sporting ancestor, the various games of palla being more primal in form.

The fact that real tennis was originally played without [[racquet]]s is
well documented.  The name of the sport in [[French (language)|French]] is
[[jeu de paume]], or ''game of the palm'' (of the hand).  However, the development of the net is documented less well.  In real tennis the net is also referred to sometimes as "the line."  Palla eh! uses only a line painted on the ground to mark territory, and this is probably all it was originally.  The cord was added for pallacorda probably just to keep the players on their respective sides of the court, and a ball that went under the cord, yet across the line, was probably still a fair shot.  Later illustrations of pallacorda and tennis show tassels hung from the cord to indicate if a ball went below the cord.  The net was merely an enhancement on the tassels, and it now serves three functions: marking territory, controlling player movement, and restricting the flight of the ball.  When modern [[tennis|lawn tennis]] adopted real tennis' net, it also brought with it these three functions.

The fact that variants of palla are all street games, and that they are clearly related to real tennis suggests something of the development of the latter sport's court.  It had been assumed that a real tennis court developed from the layout of monastery [[cloister]]s.  This is mainly due to the early popularity of the game among clerics, and similarities of some court features to a cloister.  However, this theory has two problems.  Cloisters are usually square, while a tennis court is much longer than it is wide.  Secondly, some of the similar features of tennis courts were actually introduced in the 16th century, and earlier layouts were less similar to cloisters.  The study of palla has led many to suggest that the first tennis courts were made by those who wanted to play the street game, but could afford a more private and much cleaner setting.  Similarities to cloisters in later court designs could either be coincidence, or intentional innovations.  The proportions of the court and features such as penthouses and windows could easily relate to medieval streets.

==Locations currently hosting the game==

The game is still practiced today in six villages in Southern Tuscany. Normally the game is played from Spring through Summer.
Tournaments are held in each village between July and August. The actual schedule of the tournaments is confirmed each year a few weeks before its start.

*[[Ciciano]], in the Municipality of [[Chiusdino]] ([[Provincia di Siena|SI]]), the first week-end of August.
*[[Piloni]], in the Municipality of [[Roccastrada]] ([[Provincia di Grosseto|GR]]), the second or third week-end of August (depending on agreements with Torniella)
*[[Scalvaia]], in the Municipality of [[Monticiano]] (SI), the last week-end of July
*[[Torniella]], in the Municipality of Roccastrada (GR), the second or third week end of August (depending on agreements with Piloni)
*[[Vetulonia]], in the Municipality of [[Castiglione della Pescaia]] (GR), usually the last week-end of August
*[[Tirli]], in the Municipality of [[Castiglione della Pescaia]] (GR), either around mid-July or after Vetulonia.

==Publicity==
Stewart became a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]], and was determined to "get the message out" via television.  His first major appearance was at the [[1977 NBA Finals]]; by the time of the [[1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1979 MLB All-Star Game]], broadcasters actively tried to avoid showing him.&lt;ref name="Kenyon"&gt;{{cite news

Stewart was briefly jailed by [[Moscow]] police at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Kenyon"/&gt;  In the late 1980s, he began a string of [[stink bomb]] attacks. Targets included [[Robert Schuller]]'s [[Crystal Cathedral]], the [[Orange County Register]], the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]], and a Christian bookstore.&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; The stated intent of an attempted attack at the [[American Music Awards]] was to show the public that "God thinks this stinks."&lt;ref&gt;Gorightly, Adam (1999). {{Kooks Museum|page=rainbow|name="Somewhere Over the Rainbow, Man"|sep=,}}. Retrieved on 2008-01-13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
Stewart was arrested in 1992 after a standoff in a [[California]] hotel during which he entered a vacant room with two men he was attempting to kidnap and surprised a maid who then locked herself in the bathroom. Reportedly, Stewart believed that the [[Rapture]] was due to arrive in six days.&lt;ref name="People"/&gt; During the standoff, he threatened to shoot at airplanes taking off from nearby [[Los Angeles International Airport]], and covered the hotel room windows with "John 3:16" placards.&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt;

'''Street King''' was a flavored energy drink created by American rapper [[50 Cent|Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson]] and Pure Growth Partners, CEO Chris Clarke.

==Overview==
Jackson partnered with Pure Growth Partners' Founder and CEO Chris Clarke to launch the product,&lt;ref name="hiphopwired"&gt;{{cite web|first=Danielle |last=Canada |url=http://hiphopwired.com/2011/08/12/50-cent-releasing-%E2%80%9Cstreet-king%E2%80%9D-energy-shots-proceeds-to-feed-1-billion-children/ |title=50 Cent Releasing "Street King" Energy Shots, Proceeds To Feed 1 Billion Children |publisher=Hip-Hop Wired |date=2011-08-12 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which through the [[World Food Programme|United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)]], was intended to provide a meal for a child in Africa with each shot purchased. The product was manufactured and distributed by Street King LLC in [[New York, NY]].

The drink is sold in {{Convert|74|ml|USoz|adj=on}} [[Shot glass|shots]] which contain a [[caffeine]] amount of 285&amp;nbsp;mg,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skenergyshots.com/product/&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to that of 2-3 cups of coffee.&lt;ref name="hiphopwired"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coffeetea.about.com/od/caffeinehealth/a/How-Much-Caffeine-Is-In-Coffee-Tea-Cola-And-Other-Drinks.htm|title=How Much Caffeine Is in Coffee, Tea, Cola and Other Drinks?|author=Lindsey Goodwin|work=About.com Food|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/84898-rapper-launches-energy-shot-with-philanthropic-edge |title=Rapper launches energy shot with philanthropic edge |publisher=Beverage Industry |date=2011-08-11 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Street King is available in orange-mango and grape.&lt;ref name="hiphopwired"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In September 2011, Jackson publicly committed to donating one billion meals to the World Food Program over five years.

{{Bowling techniques sidebar |expanded=all}}
'''Swing bowling''' is a technique used for [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] in the sport of [[cricket]]. Practitioners are known as swing [[bowler (cricket)|bowlers]]. Swing bowling is generally classed as a subtype of [[fast bowling]].

==Physics==
[[File:Bart King c1908cr.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Philadelphian cricket team|Philadelphians']] [[Bart King]] helped to perfect swing bowling in the early 20th century{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}]]
The essence of swing bowling is to get the [[cricket ball]] to deviate sideways as it moves through the air towards or away from the [[batsman]]. To do this, the bowler makes use of six factors:

* The raised seam of the cricket ball
* The angle of the seam to the direction of travel&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, J.M.T., Hose, D.R. &amp; Trowbridge, E.A. (1996) Cricket ball swing: a preliminary analysis using computational fluid dynamics. In: S.J. Haake (Ed.)The Engineering of Sport. A.A. Balkema, Rotterdam, pp. 11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The wear and tear on the ball
* The polishing liquid used on the ball
* The speed of the delivery
* The bowler's action

The asymmetry of the ball is encouraged by the constant polishing of ''one side'' of the ball by members of the [[fielding positions in cricket|fielding]] team, while allowing the opposite side to deteriorate through wear and tear. With time, this produces a marked difference in the aerodynamic properties of the two sides &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF02844161|title = An overview of cricket ball swing|journal = Sports Engineering|volume = 8|issue = 4|pages = 181–192|year = 2005|last1 = Mehta|first1 = Rabindra D}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Both turbulent and laminar airflow contribute to swing. Air in laminar flow separates from the surface of the ball earlier than air in turbulent flow, so that the ''separation point'' moves toward the front of the ball on the laminar side.  On the turbulent flow side it remains towards the back, inducing a greater [[lift (force)|lift]] force on the turbulent airflow side of the ball.  The calculated net lift force is not enough to account for the amount of swing observed. Additional force is provided by the [[pressure-gradient force]].

To induce the pressure-gradient force the bowler must create regions of high and low [[static pressure]] on opposing sides of the ball. The ball is then "sucked" from the region of high static pressure towards the region of low static pressure. The [[Magnus effect]] uses the same force but by manipulating spin across the direction of motion. A layer of fluid, in this case air, will have a greater velocity when moving over another layer of fluid than it would have had if it had been moving over a solid, in this case the surface of the ball.  The greater the velocity of the fluid, the lower its static pressure.

[[File:Off break small.gif|thumb|Animation of an inswinger bowl from a right arm over the wicket bowler to a right arm batsman.]]
When the ball is new the seam is used to create a layer of turbulent air on one side of the ball, by angling it to one side and spinning the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this turbulent air creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the turbulent air due to the greater air coverage and as there is a difference in air velocity, the static pressure of both sides of the ball are different and the ball is both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the turbulent airflow side of the ball.

When the ball is older and there is an asymmetry in roughness the seam no longer causes the pressure difference, and can actually reduce the swing of the ball. Air turbulence is no longer used to create separation point differences and therefore the lift and pressure differences. On the rough side of the ball there are scratches and pits in the ball's surface.  These irregularities act in the same manner as the dimples of a golf ball: they trap the air, creating a layer of trapped air next to the rough side of the ball, which moves with the surface of the ball. The smooth side does not trap a layer of air. The next layer of air outward from the ball will have a greater velocity over the rough side, due to its contact with a layer of trapped air, rather than solid ball. This lowers the static pressure relative to the shiny side, which swings the ball. If the scratches and tears completely cover the rough side of the ball, the separation point on the rough side will move to the back of the ball, further than that of the turbulent air, thereby creating more lift and faster air flow.  This is why a new ball will swing more than an old ball. If the seam is used to create the turbulent air on the rough side, the tears will not fill as quickly as they would with laminar flow, dampening the lift and pressure differences.

Reverse swing occurs in exactly the same manner as conventional swing, despite popular misconception. Over time the rough side becomes too rough and the tears become too deep – this is why golf ball dimples are never below a certain depth, and so "conventional" swing weakens over time; the separation point moves toward the front of the ball on the rough side. When polishing the shiny side of the ball, numerous liquids are used, such as sweat, saliva, sunscreen, hair gel (which bowlers may apply to their hair before a game) and other illegal substances like Vaseline (applied to the clothing where the ball is polished). These liquids penetrate the porous surface of the leather ball. Over time the liquid expands and stretches the surface of the ball (which increases the surface area meaning more lift) and creates raised bumps on the polished side, due to the non-uniform nature of the expansion. The valleys between the bumps hold the air in the same manner as the tears on the rough side. This creates a layer of air over the shiny side, moving the separation point towards the back of the ball on the shiny side. The greater air coverage is now on the shiny side, giving rise to more lift and faster secondary airflow on that side. There is therefore lower static pressure on the shiny side, causing the ball to swing towards it, not away from it as in conventional swing.

The rough side tears hold the air more easily than the shiny side valleys, so to maintain the air within the valleys the initial air layer must have a very high velocity, which is why reverse swing is primarily, but not necessarily, achieved by fast bowlers. Due to the less static nature of the initial air layer it takes longer for the swing to occur, which is why it occurs later in the delivery. This is why conventional and reverse swing can occur in the same delivery.

Cold and humid weather are said to enhance swing. Colder air is denser and so may affect the differential forces the ball experiences in flight. When looking at humidity, changes between 0% and 40% humidity appear to have little to no effect on the ball's swing; yet, when approaching  100% humidity "condensation shock" has been observed enhancing the swing of the ball &lt;ref&gt;http://rramakrishnan.com/H/000/Tamil/Articles-Mod/Cricket%20Ball%20Aerodynamics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Conventional swing==
[[File:James Anderson bowl.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Jimmy Anderson (cricketer)|Jimmy Anderson]], a swing bowler for the England cricket team]]
Typically, a swing bowler aligns the seam and the sides of the ball to reinforce the swing effect. This can be done in two ways:
*'''[[Outswinger]]''': An outswinger to a right-handed batsman can be bowled by aligning the seam slightly to the left towards the slips and placing the roughened side of the ball on the left. To extract consistent swing, a bowler can also rotate his wrist toward the slips while keeping his arm straight. To a right-handed batsman, this results in the ball moving away to the [[Fielding (cricket)#Off and leg side fields|off side]] while in flight, usually outwards from his body.
*'''[[Inswinger]]''': An inswinger to a right-handed batsman can be bowled by aligning the seam slightly to the right and placing the roughened side of the ball on the right. To extract consistent swing, a bowler can also rotate or "open up" his wrist towards leg slip. To a right-handed batsman, this results in the ball moving in to the [[leg side]] while in flight, usually inwards towards his body.

The curvature of swing deliveries can make them difficult for a batsman to hit with his [[cricket bat|bat]]. Typically, bowlers more commonly bowl outswingers, as they tend to move away from the batsman, meaning he has to "chase" the ball to hit it. Hitting away from the batsman's body is dangerous, as it leaves a gap between the bat and body through which the ball may travel to hit the [[wicket]]. Also, if the batsman misjudges the amount of swing, he can hit the ball with an edge of the bat. An inside edge can ricochet on to the wicket, resulting in him being out bowled, while an outside edge can fly to the [[wicket-keeper]] or [[slip (cricket)|slip]] fielders for a catch.

An inswinger presents relatively fewer dangers to the batsman, but on some particular days can be devastating due to risk of being bowled or [[leg before wicket]].  [[Shane Bond]] was considered a great exponent of inswing bowling.

An inswinger combined with a [[yorker]] can be especially difficult for the batsman to defend against, especially if used as a surprise delivery after a sequence of outswingers.

There has been a distinct lack of left-arm swing bowlers in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mid-Wicket Tales: From Trumper to Tendulkar|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IPwjBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first1=S|last1=Giridhar|first2=V. J.|last2=Raghunath|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|date=2014|page=115|isbn=9789351500902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most famous left-arm bowlers were [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan's]] [[Wasim Akram]], [[India national cricket team|India's]] [[Zaheer Khan]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia's]] [[Alan Keith Davidson|Alan Davidson]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka's]] [[Chaminda Vaas]].

==Reverse swing==
{{redirect|Reverse swing|reverse swing in doors|Door}}
Normal swing occurs mostly when the ball is fairly new. As it wears more, the aerodynamics of the asymmetry changes and it is more difficult to extract a large amount of swing. When the ball becomes very old—around 40 or more overs old—it begins to swing towards the shine. This is known as ''reverse swing''—meaning a natural outswinger will become an inswinger and vice versa.&lt;ref name="guardian2005"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/aug/18/ashes2005.ashes2 How England reversed a losing trend | Sport | The Guardian&lt;!-- reflinks title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, both sides have turbulent flow, but here the seam causes the airflow to separate{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} earlier on one side. The result is always a swing to the side with the later separation, so the swing is away from the seam.

Reverse swing tends to be stronger than normal swing, and to occur late in the ball's trajectory. This gives it a very different character from normal swing, and because batsmen experience it less often, they generally find it much more difficult to defend against. It is also possible for a ball to swing normally in its early flight, and then to alter its swing as it approaches the batsman. This can be done in two ways&lt;ref name="Cricinfo"&gt;http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/499176.html&lt;/ref&gt; one for the ball to reverse its direction of swing, giving it an 'S' trajectory: the other is for it to adopt a more pronounced swing in the same direction in which the swing is already curving; either alteration can be devastating for the batsman. In the first instance, he is already committed to playing the swing one way, which will be the wrong way to address swing which is suddenly coming from the opposite direction: in the second instance, his stance will be one which is appropriate for the degree, or extent, of the expected swing, and which could suddenly leave him vulnerable to [[Leg before wicket|LBW]], being caught behind, or bowled. Two consecutive deliveries from Wasim Akram, one of each type, were considered to be the turning point of the [[1992 Cricket World Cup Final|1992 World Cup Final]].&lt;ref name="Cricinfo"/&gt;

Pioneers and notable practitioners of reverse swing have mostly been Pakistani fast bowlers. In the early days of reverse swing, Pakistani bowlers were suspected of [[ball tampering]] to achieve the conditions of the ball that allow reverse swing. According to [[Shahryar Khan|Shaharyar Khan]], reverse swing was invented by Salim Mir, who played for the Punjab Cricket Club in [[Lahore]] and taught it to his team-mate [[Sarfraz Nawaz]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Shahryar Khan|Shaharyar M. Khan]] and Ali Khan, ''Cricket Cauldron'', I.B. Tauris, London, 2013, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarfraz Nawaz introduced reverse swing into international cricket during the late 1970s, and passed their knowledge on to their team-mate [[Imran Khan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/4155734.stm BBC SPORT – Cricket – England – What is reverse swing?]&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn taught the duo of [[Wasim Akram]] and [[Waqar Younis]]. The English pair of [[Andrew Flintoff]] and [[Simon Jones (cricketer)|Simon Jones]], having been taught by [[Troy Cooley]] and the Indian bowlers like [[Zaheer Khan]] and [[Ajit Agarkar]], are also well known for the ability to reverse swing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewisdencricketer.com/item.php?parent_id=3&amp;child_id=0&amp;item_id=294 Forgotten Hero] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216124419/http://www.thewisdencricketer.com/item.php?parent_id=3&amp;child_id=0&amp;item_id=294 |date=16 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlers tend to disguise the direction of reverse swing by running up starting with the opposite hand before switching hands and covering the ball for as long as possible before release. [[Neil Wagner]] utilizes this to show the ball is reversing, but disguises the direction of swing.

==Playing swing bowling==
Playing swing bowling is considered to be a hallmark of a batsman's skill.

Firstly, a batsman needs good eye reflexes which are considered to be a key skill when facing swing bowling. Secondly a batsman often needs to anticipate ''beforehand'' what the ball will do and adjust accordingly to play swing bowling. This can be done by observing the bowler's grip and action (which may have a marked difference depending on which type of swinger is to be delivered), by observing the field set, which may depend on the types of deliveries expected (as a rule outswingers will have more slips assigned) or by means of prior knowledge of the bowler; many can bowl or are proficient in only one type of swing. Traditional methods include the batsmen playing the ball as late as possible, and not playing away from the body. Other effective measures for combating swing bowling include standing well outside the crease, thus giving the ball less time to swing; and guessing the direction of swing based on the seam position observed in the ball's flight.

Since reverse swing occurs at faster speeds, later in the trajectory of the ball and with no real obvious change in action and grip (Waqar Younis from Pakistan for example had the same action and grip for nearly all his deliveries.

Controversy regarding reverse swing has never left modern cricket, as the Pakistani team was accused of [[ball tampering]] by the Australian umpire [[Darrell Hair]] during the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2006#Fourth Test .2817–20 August.29|fourth test against England in 2006]] when the ball began to reverse swing after the 50th over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/engvpak/content/current/story/257055.html Cricinfo – As the chaos unfolded]&lt;/ref&gt; His co-umpire Billy Doctrove supported him. A hearing subsequently found that there was insufficient evidence to convict anyone of ball tampering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/260776.html?CMP=OTC-RSS ''"I therefore conclude, (1) Mr ul-Haq is not guilty of the charge of ball-tampering..."'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on 27 May 1954,&lt;ref name=Release&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=kenlib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS33772219&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 The Times, 27 May 1954, page 2: ''Classified - Picture Theatres - Odeon Leic. Sq. - The Rainbow Jacket''] Linked 2015-07-06&lt;/ref&gt; and the reviewer for ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that, "''It is, then, an entertaining film, a film in love with racing and yet not quite so devotedly so as to refrain from suggesting that in the running of the [[St. Leger]] there can be some very queer goings-on indeed.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=kenlib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS68506299&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 The Times, 27 May 1954, page 4: ''Odeon Ceinama - "The Rainbow Jacket"''] Linked 2015-07-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixty years after the premiere, ''[[TV Guide]]'' felt that "''a trite outcome mars this fairly entertaining film, which features real-life British racing figures [[Raymond Glendenning]] and [[Gordon Richards]],''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/the-rainbow-jacket/review/115359 |title=The Rainbow Jacket Review |publisher=Movies.tvguide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' noted that the film was "''the first collaboration between Dearden and [[TEB Clarke]] after [[The Blue Lamp]]...Despite its intriguing subject, the film offers little but the cosy, sentimental view of life that is typical of late Ealing films.''"&lt;ref name="timeout1"/&gt;

'''''Toby Tortoise Returns''''' is an animated [[Technicolor]] cartoon in [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' series. It was directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]]. It is a sequel to ''[[The Tortoise and the Hare (film)|The Tortoise and the Hare]]''. It premiered on August 22, 1936.&lt;ref name=Disney&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1936/tobytortoisereturns.html |title=Toby Tortoise Returns |publisher=disneyshorts.org |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810201228/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1936/tobytortoisereturns.html |archive-date=2010-08-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This time the plot revolves around a boxing match. The short features characters from other ''Silly Symphonies'', including Elmer Elephant and Tillie Tiger from ''[[Elmer Elephant]]'', Fifer Pig, Fiddler Pig, Practical Pig and the Big Bad Wolf from ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|Three Little Pigs]]'', and Jenny Wren and the cuckoo from ''[[Who Killed Cock Robin? (1935 film)|Who Killed Cock Robin?]]''.&lt;ref name=Disney/&gt; It was released in [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], and [[DVD]] formats in various countries.&lt;ref name=Disney/&gt;

==Plot==
Max Hare is boxing Toby Tortoise, and beating him severely in round one. Between rounds, Jenny Wren from ''[[Who Killed Cock Robin? (1935 film)|Who Killed Cock Robin?]]'' tells Toby she "likes a man who takes his time", which seems to reinvigorate him. Come round two, Max deals out what should be the finishing blow, but Toby pulls into his shell to avoid the fists. Feeling robbed, Max demands that Toby come out and face him, but Toby says he feels safer in his shell. Max tries to make him come out by dumping a bucket of water in Toby's shell, but Toby pops out wearing a diving helmet, then ducks back into his shell. At the end of his patience, Max fills his shell with fireworks to draw out Toby. This backfires, however, as Toby begins unintentionally shooting fireworks in Max's direction. One firework sends Max flying out of the arena with the paramedics who were waiting to take Toby to the hospital. Once the fireworks stop, Toby is declared the winner.

The '''Tuctu Golf Club''' was a [[golf course]] located in [[Morococha]], Peru.  During operation, it was the highest golf course in the world.  The course was located at an elevation of {{convert|14335|ft}} at its lowest point.  As late as 1993, it held the world record for the highest golf club.  The course was abandoned in the mid-1990s and is said to be unrecognizable today, as it is overgrown with weeds and grasses. Today, the land is owned by a mining company.&lt;ref name="Worldgolf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldgolf.com/travel/highest-golf-courses.htm|title=World Golf:The World's Highest Golf Course|last=Penner|first=Andrew|year=2003|publisher=Worldgolf.com|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 14,000 feet, it was also known for inducing nosebleeds among the golfers.

Since at least [[John L. Sullivan]], in the late 19th century, there have been world champions in [[professional boxing]]. At the very beginnings, before any sanctioning body was established, many boxers proclaimed themselves as legitimate champions. Eventually, champions were recognized through public acclamation, succesively establishing a [[lineal championship|lineage]]. Important sets of weight classes were those specified in 1909 by the [[National Sporting Club]] of [[London]], and those contained in the 1920 Walker Law which established the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] (NYSAC). NYSAC recognized champions from its foundation in 1920.&lt;ref name="guin-hist"&gt;Morrison, pp.14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Boxing Association (NBA) was founded by other U.S. state bodies in 1921.&lt;ref name="guin-hist"/&gt;  Until the 1960s, both usually recognised the same lineal champion.&lt;ref name="guinn-data"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morrison|first=Ian|title=The Guinness World Championship Boxing book|publisher=Guinness Publishing|year=1990|pages=126–137|isbn=0-85112-900-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, disputes could arise if the champion retired or moved to a different weight class.  Occasionally, the International Boxing Union (renamed the [[European Boxing Union]] in 1946) recognised a different champion.  The disputes were usually short-lived as a lucrative fight would be organised between the rival champions.

The growing popularity of boxing outside of the USA led to creation of various boxing organizations, each strengthening their influence (most notably [[BBBofC]]) and having their own champion. This resulted in a growing number of boxers claiming to be legitimate champions. On August 23, 1962, the NBA officially became the [[World Boxing Association]] and moved their headquarters to [[Panama City]], [[Panama]]. A year later NYSAC along with [[European Boxing Union]] and BBBofC supported creation of the [[World Boxing Council]]. In April 1983, members of [[United States Boxing Association]] along with Robert W. Lee (a former WBA vice-president) voted to expand the organisation and form the USBA-International. The organization later changed the name to [[International Boxing Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibfusbaregistration.com/ibfusba_02APR2014/index.php/about/history-of-ibf |title=History of IBF/USBA |publisher=[[International Boxing Federation]] |accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural IBF Heavyweight Champion was [[Larry Holmes]], who relinquished the WBC title to accept IBF's recognition, thus helping the newly formed organization to establish its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.ibf-usba-boxing.com/index.php?pg=2|title=IBF/USBA History|publisher=IBF|accessdate=2008-11-15}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Another major sanctioning body, the [[World Boxing Organisation]], was established in 1988 in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]] by a group of local businessmen. At the beginnings, when most of the challengers for WBA, WBC and IBF titles were Americans, WBO had a wider variety of countries, mainly [[United Kingdom]], represented in title bouts. As of 2018, [[WBO]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[IBF]] and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] are all recognized as major boxing organizations by each other and the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]]. 

==Championship recognition==

===1884–1910===
Champions were recognized by public acclamation. A champion in that era was a fighter who had a notable win over another fighter and kept winning afterward. Retirements or disputed results could lead to a championship being split among several men for periods of time. With only minor exceptions, the heavyweight division remained free from dual title-holders until the 1960s. For an early example, see the [[1896 World Heavyweight Championship]].

===Sanctioning organizations: 1910–present===
Gradually, the role of recognizing champions in the division evolved into a more formal affair, with public acclamation being supplemented (or in some cases, contradicted) by recognition by one or more athletic commissions, sanctioning organizations, or a combination of them.  The most notable examples with respect to the heavyweight division have included:
* The [[European Boxing Union|International Boxing Union]] (IBU), which was formed in Paris in 1910.  The organization would become the [[European Boxing Union]] in 1946, but would recognize "world" champions in various divisions until it subordinated itself in that area to the [[World Boxing Council]].
* The [[New York State Athletic Commission]] (NYSAC).  A governmental entity initially formed for the purpose of regulating boxing in [[New York (state)|the State of New York]], thanks to New York's place as the epicenter of boxing from the 1930s through 1950s, the NYSAC expanded its reach to sanctioning championship bouts.  This practice continued until, like the IBU, the NYSAC became a member of the [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC).
* The National Boxing Association (NBA) was organized in 1921.  In 1962, the organization was renamed the [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA).
* The [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) was organized in 1963.
* The [[International Boxing Federation]] (IBF), which was founded in 1983 by the members of the [[United States Boxing Association]] after the USBA withdrew from membership in the WBA.
* The [[World Boxing Organization]] (WBO), which was founded in 1989 by disgruntled members of the [[World Boxing Council]].
There are also titles that aren't considered major but play a significant role in legitimizing the champion:
* [[Lineal championship]] was considered as the only form of the world championship until 1921. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called "the man who beat the man", implying that the only way to win the championship is either to beat the current champion or (when the title is vacated due to suspension, retirement etc.) to become the winner of a fight between No. 1 and No. 2 (occasionally No. 3) ranked contenders.
* ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' began awarding championship belts in 1922, stopped giving belts to world champions in the 1990s, then reintroduced their title in 2002, and ignored the current ongoing world championship lineage. Under the original version of the policy, you could win the title by either defeating the reigning champion or winning a box-off between the magazine's No. 1 and No. 2 (occasionally No. 3) ranked contenders. A fighter could not be stripped of the title unless he lost or retired. Since May 2012, under the new policy, ''The Ring'' title can be awarded when the No. 1 and No. 2 contenders face each other or when either of them faces No. 3, No. 4 or No. 5 contender. In addition, the title can be taken away by losing the fight, moving to another weight class, not scheduling a fight for 18 months in the division, not scheduling a fight with a top 5 contender for two years in any weight class, or retiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/172677-the-ring-updates-championship-policy|title=''The Ring'' updates championship policy|date=May 3, 2012|work=Ring TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title fight wins &amp; beaten opponents — ''The Ring''/lineal champions==

Though these lists do not include ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' and [[lineal championship]] fights after 1921, they only include title fight wins in weight classes where the champion have also captured ''The Ring'' or lineal title.

[[File:ZUBAZ 10.jpg|thumb|Green Bay Packer and Zubaz enthusiasts at the San Diego Boardwalk before the [[Green Bay Packers]] and [[San Diego Chargers]] game on November 6, 2011.]]'''Zubaz''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|uː|b|æ|z}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zubaz.com/About.aspx About Us: The Pant, The Myth, The Legend...] Zubaz.com&lt;/ref&gt; is a brand of shorts and pants that became popular during the early 1990s.

==History and description==
In 1988, Bob Truax and Dan Stock began brainstorming a new kind of shorts for the heavy-lifting man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalfloss.com/article/27813/brief-history-zubaz A Brief History of Zubaz] Mental Floss. Trex, Ethan. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair developed a comfortably baggy pair of shorts with an elastic waistband. Zubaz was registered as a trademark in 1989. Initially, they were marketed as a comfortable, functional pair of shorts for [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]].&lt;ref name="strib" /&gt; [[Road Warrior Hawk|Michael Hegstrand]], [[Road Warrior Animal|Joseph Laurinaitis]] and manager Nick Derella used their professional wrestling personae as [[The Road Warriors]] to help popularize the pants in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name="strib" /&gt;

They hoped to make a pair of shorts that would stretch and expand with the body during a workout. In a short time, the shorts became wildly popular in the [[United States]]. The Zubaz company sold $100 million worth of products in 1991 alone. The company slogan was "Dare to be Different."

Although Zubaz began as a line of shorts, the brand was extended into long pants, caps, shirts, and even diapers. The pants are tapered at the ankle, with the outer part of the leg being longer than the inner part. They have an [[Elastomer|elastic]] waistband to allow for greater [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]] and movement. The pants were originally created in a zebra print, but later began to be sold in almost any design imaginable.

Regardless of the specific design, Zubaz are almost always bright, flashy, and often ostentatious. Zubaz designed the uniforms of several [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]] teams in the early 1990s, including the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] and the now-defunct [[New Orleans Night]]. However, these designs were considered outlandish and were soon replaced.

In a 1993 survey in ''[[Inside Sports]]'' magazine, Zubaz finished third in the voting for "Worst Thing to Happen in Sports" that year. Ahead of it were the retirement of [[Michael Jordan]] and the death of wrestler [[Dino Bravo]].

The long pants were the most popular item in the product line. Despite the decline in popularity, fans still sometimes wear Zubaz pants in team colors at professional [[American football|football]] games.

Zubaz manufactured "slider shorts." These shorts had the famous wild patterns at the bottom of the garment while the rest of the garment displayed the name and logo of the sport team and the Zubaz name.

The original business went bankrupt in 1996&lt;ref name="strib"&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/local/east/16943196.html Zubaz pants are back], Herón Márquez Estrada, ''Minneapolis Star Tribune'', March 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and Truax and Stock bought back the trademark rights. In 2007, Zubaz resurfaced, offering a limited production release of the original classic Zubaz patterns. In 2014 the brand fully resurfaced with a wider selection on its internet storefront.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/zubaz-pants-are-back/16943196/|title=Zubaz pants are back|website=Startribune.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revived brand opened its first storefront in [[Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls]], a mall in [[Niagara Falls, New York]], in November 2016; Zubaz chose [[Western New York]] as its first brick-and-mortar location because of the brand's particular association with the [[Buffalo Bills]], as fans of the franchise have consistently been one of the brand's most loyal customer bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buffalonews.com/2016/11/16/zubaz-store-opens-fashion-outlets/|title=Zubaz opens chain's first brick-and-mortar store at Fashion Outlets|date=16 November 2016|website=Buffalonews.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another sign of the resurrection of the Zubaz brand, on July 16, 2008 the [[Saint Paul Saints]] [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball|independent professional baseball]] team wore Zubaz pants during their game against the [[Sioux City Explorers]]. The bases were also painted in a recognizable Zubaz tiger-striped pattern. On the December 6 edition of professional wrestling TV show, ''[[TNA Impact]]'', [[Christopher Daniels]] and [[Frankie Kazarian|Kazarian]] wrestled the main event in pink and black Zubaz pants. Lately, the Russian Curling team wore Kansas City Chiefs pants in the 2014 Winter Olympics. The [[Detroit Tigers]] also recently wore the Zubaz pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2068425-detroit-tigers-invade-cleveland-dressed-in-full-zubaz|title=Detroit Tigers Dressed in Full Zubaz After Beating Red Sox|first=Dan|last=Carson|website=Bleacherreport.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
