'''Benjamin Developments Ltd v Robt Jones (Pacific) Ltd''' [1994] 3 NZLR 189 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding  the interpretation of express terms of a contract.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Express terms must be given their plain meaning and [[extrinsic]] evidence (i.e. background matters) is not able to be considered, unless such terms are uncertain or ambiguous.

==Background==
In 1988 [[Bob Jones (businessman)|Robert Jones (Pacific) Ltd]] agreed to purchase a building being constructed by Benjamin Developments (a subsidiary of [[McConnell Dowell]] Corporation). The building later became the Coopers and Lybrand building, and is now known as the [[ANZ Centre]].

However, the purchase agreement was conditional, with the main condition that prior to possession, Benjamin Developments was required to lease the building, and at specified rentals.

In the aftermath of the stock market crash, Benjamin Developments struggled to find tenants for the building. Faced with the option of having to sell the property to an underwriter for a significant amount less than RJP had agreed to pay, they decided to offer significant cash incentives to attract tenants to the building, about $60 million worth in total.

When it came time for RJP to take possession, they refused, claiming that the floors were a few inches too short, and that they claimed that the contact called for real rentals, without incentives.

==Held==
The court ruled that the plain meaning of the lease rentals did not exclude incentives. Hardie-Boys stated "Where however the contractual intention is clear from the words used then the court must give effect to it. It is not permissible to inquire into preliminary or background matters in order to find a different meaning".

{{italic title}}
'''''Brenhinoedd y Saeson''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Kings of the English'') is the medieval title of three [[Middle Welsh]] [[annals|annalistic]] [[chronicle]]s known from three 14th-century manuscripts (referred to as ''P'', ''R'', and ''S'') recording events from 682 to the English conquest of [[Wales]] in 1282 (P was subsequently continued to 1332, S ultimately to 1461). The title ''Brenhinoedd y Saeson'' is found only in the rubric to the earlier of the two surviving manuscripts of version S: the other two texts are commonly known as ''[[Brut y Tywysogion]]'', but this title is found only in manuscripts of the late 16th century and cannot be considered authentic.

The three versions of ''Brenhinoedd y Saeson'' are closely related to and are probably translations from a text or texts evidenced by those Cambro-Latin annalistic chronicles now known as ''[[Annales Cambriae]]''.

==Sources==
P survives in a single medieval manuscript: &lt;br&gt;Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS. [[Peniarth 20]], written c.1330, probably at the [[Cistercian]] abbey of [[Valle Crucis Abbey|Valle Crucis]] (Llanegwestl). The scribe of this manuscript also wrote the earlier of the two manuscripts containing S.

R survives in four medieval manuscripts:
# Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS. 3035B (Mostyn 116);
# Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS. Peniarth 18;
# Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS. Peniarth 19;
# Oxford, Jesus College, MS. 111 (''Llyfr Coch Hergest'', '[[Red Book of Hergest|The Red Book of Hergest]]').
These all date from about 1350 to about 1400.

S survives in two medieval manuscripts:
# London, British Library, MS. [[Cotton Cleopatra]] B.v., written at [[Valle Crucis Abbey]] soon after 1332;
# Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, MS. 7006D (''Llyfr Du Basing'', '[[Black Book of Basingwerk|The Black Book of Basingwerk]]'), written in or soon after 1461 (where the chronicle ends). The principal scribe was the poet [[Gutun Owain]], who died c. 1500, and whose datable manuscript output lies between 1456 and 1497.

==Dating==
P is datable 1286 – c.1330; R is datable 1307 – 1350; S is datable c. 1200 (probably 1282 or 1286) – 1300. The order of composition of the three versions remains to be determined.

The '''''CNPS Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California''''' is a botanical [[online database]] providing information on rare, threatened, and endangered [[List of California native plants|California native plants]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rareplants.cnps.org CNPS: Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnps&gt;[http://www.cnps.org/cnps/rareplants/inventory/ CNPS: About the Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sponsored by the [[California Native Plant Society]] (CNPS). &lt;ref name=cnps/&gt; 

==Description==
All [[plant]] [[taxa]] that the [[State of California]] or [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] list as being [[threatened species]], [[endangered species]], or rare species in California, are included in the lists.&lt;ref name=cnps/&gt;&lt;ref name=J&gt;The Jepson Manual, Vascular Plants of California, 2nd ed., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} They are continually updated with additions, changes, and deletions. &lt;ref name=cnps/&gt; In 2014 the CNPS Rare Plant Program began including [[Lichen]]s of Conservation Concern. &lt;ref name=cnps/&gt;

The Inventory is published every three to five years and is used by the State and Federal government for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] planning. &lt;ref name=cnps/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Holt | first= Judy | title= "UC Riverside: Botanical and Related Pest Management Programs" | journal= Noxious Times | publisher= California Interagency Noxious Weed Coordinating Committee | volume =  3 | issue=  3 | date= Winter 2001 | url=http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/phpps/ipc/noxioustimes/pdfs/2001winter.pdf | accessdate= 2007-11-07 | postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==History==
CNPS originally developed the ''Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California'' with the guidance of botanist and evolutionary biologist [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]]. &lt;ref name=cnps/&gt;

The 1st Edition was printed in 1974. The last print version, the 6th Edition, was published in 2001. The 8th Edition, released in 2010 with ongoing updates, is the current database.&lt;ref name=cnps/&gt;  

The online database publication, which depends on volunteer contributions, is supported by the California Native Plant Society, [[University of California, Riverside Herbarium]], and other institutions, organizations, and individuals.

{{for|other churches of this dedication|St Peter ad Vincula (disambiguation)}}
The '''Chapel Royal of St. Peter ad Vincula''' ("St. Peter in chains") is the parish church of the [[Tower of London]]. It is situated within the Tower's [[Salt Tower|Inner Ward]] and dates from 1520. It is a [[Royal Peculiar]]. The name refers to [[Saint Peter|St. Peter's]] [[Liberation of Saint Peter|imprisonment]] under [[Agrippa I|Herod Agrippa]] in [[Jerusalem]]. The Chapel is probably best known as the burial place of some of the most famous prisoners executed at the Tower, including [[Anne Boleyn]], [[Catherine Howard]] and [[Lady Jane Grey]].

At the west end is a short tower, surmounted by a lantern bell-cote, and inside the church is a nave and shorter north aisle, lit by windows with cusped lights but no tracery, a typical [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] design.

The church is a [[Chapel Royal]], and the priest responsible for it is the chaplain of the Tower, a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] and member of the [[Ecclesiastical Household]]. The canonry was abolished in 1685 but reinstated in 2012.

== History ==
The existing building was rebuilt for [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] by [[Sir Richard Cholmondeley]] in 1519–20, but a chapel stood in its position since before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]].&lt;ref name=camelot&gt;[http://www.camelotintl.com/tower_site/tower/chapel.html "Chapel of St Peter Ad Vincula"], Camelot International: The Tower of London (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parish of the Tower of London=== &lt;!-- Redirects from [[Tower of London (parish)]] and others --&gt;
St Peter ad Vincula was the church of the [[extra-parochial area]] of Tower Within, part of the [[Liberties of the Tower of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer, Volume 1 | year = 1793 |author1=Burn, Richard | author2=John Burn}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December 1729 the church was added to the [[Bills of mortality]], a record of burials in London, but was excluded in 1730 because of a successful claim by the inhabitants of it being extra-parochial and outside of the normal parish system.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title= Collection of Yearly Bills of Mortality, from 1657 to 1758 Inclusive | author= Miller, A. | year= 1759}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extra-parochial places were eliminated in the 19th century, and in 1858 the area became a [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]], following the Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857.&lt;ref name="Youngs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Youngs |first= Frederic A, Jr. |title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol. I: Southern England |year=1979 |publisher=[[Royal Historical Society]] |location=London |isbn=0-901050-67-9 |pages=556–707}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tower of London liberty was dissolved in 1894,&lt;ref&gt;"Tower of London", ''Star'', Issue 5033, 20 August 1894, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and the parish was absorbed by [[St Botolph without Aldgate]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="Youngs"/&gt;

==Burials and monuments==
The church contains many splendid monuments. In the north-west corner is a memorial to [[John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter|John Holland, Duke of Exeter]], a [[Constable]] of the Tower who died in 1447. Under the central arcade lies the effigy of Sir [[Richard Cholmondeley]], a [[Lieutenant]] of the Tower who died in 1521.&lt;ref name=camelot/&gt; In the sanctuary, there is an impressive monument to Sir Richard Blount, who died in 1564 and is buried in the church, and his son Sir [[Michael Blount|Michael]], died in 1610, both Tudor Lieutenants of the Tower, who would have witnessed many of the executions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030308014750/http://www.touruk.co.uk/london_churches/stpeteradvincula_church1.htm "St Peter ad Vincula, Tower of London, Tower Hill, London EC3: tourist information"], TourUK, accessed 7 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a fine 17th-century organ, decorated with carvings by [[Grinling Gibbons]].

The church is perhaps most notable as the burial place of some of the most famous Tower prisoners, including three queens: [[Anne Boleyn]] and [[Catherine Howard]], the second and fifth wives of Henry VIII, respectively, and [[Lady Jane Grey]], who reigned for nine days in 1553. [[George Boleyn]], brother of Anne, was also buried here after his execution in 1536, as were [[Edmund Dudley]] and Sir [[Richard Empson]], tax collectors for [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and [[Guildford Dudley]], husband to Lady Jane Grey, in February 1554, after being executed on [[Tower Green]]. Others were [[Thomas More]] and [[John Fisher]], who incurred the wrath of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and after their execution, they were canonised as martyrs by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; [[Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel|Philip Howard]], a third saint who suffered under the Tudors, was also buried here for a time before his body was relocated to Arundel.&lt;ref name=camelot/&gt; After their executions, the following people were also buried here: Henry VIII's minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]] (1540);&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Doyne Courtenay. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aGjSAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex], ''Notices of the historic persons buried in the chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula'', J. Murray (1877), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley]], the brother of [[Jane Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], who is remembered for his unseemly conduct towards his step-niece, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (1549);&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Doyne Courtenay. ''Notices of the Historic Persons Buried in the Chapel of St. Peter Ad Vincula''. J. Murray (1877), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aGjSAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA127 pp. 127–134]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (1552);{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]]  and [[John Gates (courtier)|John Gates]] in connection with the 1553 succession crisis (1553);{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]], under the communion table (1685).&lt;ref&gt;[https://histfam.familysearch.org//getperson.php?personID=I93058&amp;tree=Nixon "James Scott, Duke of Monmouth"], Family Search, accessed 12 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of "remarkable persons" buried in the chapel between 1534 and 1747 is listed on a table on the west wall.&lt;ref name=camelot/&gt;  [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] memorialised those buried in the chapel in his 1848 ''History of England'': "In truth there is no sadder spot on the earth than that little cemetery.  Death is there associated, not, as in Westminster Abbey and Saint Paul's, with genius and virtue, with public veneration and with imperishable renown; not, as in our humblest churches and churchyards, with everything that is most endearing in social and domestic charities; but with whatever is darkest in human nature and in human destiny, with the savage triumph of implacable enemies, with the inconstancy, the ingratitude, the cowardice of friends, with all the miseries of fallen greatness and of blighted fame. Thither have been carried, through successive ages, by the rude hands of gaolers, without one mourner following, the bleeding relics of men who had been the captains of armies, the leaders of parties, the oracles of senates, and the ornaments of courts."&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, Thomas Babington. ''The History of England from the Accession of James II'', 5 vols. (1848)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chapel Royal==
The church is a [[Chapel Royal]] and the priest responsible for it is the chaplain of the Tower of London, a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] and member of the [[Ecclesiastical Household]].  The canonry was abolished in 1685 but reinstated in 2012. The Reverend Roger Hall, [[MBE]] was installed as a canon the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrp.org.uk/NewsAndMedia/Pressresources/tolpressresources/ReverendRogerHallbecomesfirstCanonfor300years "Reverend Roger Hall becomes Tower's first Canon for 300 years"], Historic Royal Palaces, accessed 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapel can be visited as part of a specific tour within the Tower of London or by attending the regular Sunday morning service.

The '''''Codex coemeterium''''' (sb423 National Library, [[Clementinum]], [[Prague]]) is a 16th-century [[grimoire]] manuscript. The text, composed in [[Latin]], is largely concerned with [[demonology]] and [[necromancy]]. The book falls into [[A.E. Waite]]'s category of 'Unprinted literature of ceremonial magic' though extracted elements have been reproduced in later treatises.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Arthur Edward (1898). ''[[The Book of Ceremonial Magic]]''. [[Routledge]], 2006. {{ISBN|0710311532}} p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; It is heavily based on the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'', which was listed in the [[Catholic Church]]'s index of prohibited books.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Danish Film Institute''' ({{lang-da|Det Danske Filminstitut}}) is the national [[Denmark|Danish]] agency responsible for supporting and encouraging film and cinema culture, and for conserving these in the national interest.

Also known as '''''Filmhuset''''' ("the film house"), it is located in [[Gothersgade]] in central [[Copenhagen]]. Facilities directed at the general public include a library and [[Cinemateket]] which is Denmark's national film museum.

It is an institution under the [[Ministry of Culture of Denmark|Danish Ministry of Cultural Affairs]]. The current Director of the Film Institute is Claus Ladegaard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.b.dk/kultur/claus-ladegaard-tager-styringen-hos-filminstituttet|title=Claus Ladegaard tager styringen hos Filminstituttet|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is a member of [[European Film Promotion]], the network of European film organisations for the worldwide promotion of European film.

==History==
The Danish Film Institute was founded in 1972, replacing the Danish Film Foundation (Danish: Den Danske Filmfond). In 1996 a new Danish Film Act merged the Film Institute with Statens Filmcentral and the National Danish Film Museum with effect from the following year and at the same event the institution relocated to its current premises at Filmhuset in Gothersgade.

==Activities==
The Danish Film Institute is active within three main areas which are subsidized:
* Production and development of all types of films
* Distribution and communication of films and film culture
* Archives and museum activities
The Film Institute presents Danish films at feastivals abroad and in Denmark and subsidizes the import of foreign quality films. It maintains the [[Danish National Filmography]] (''Danmarks Nationalfilmografi''), a database about Danish films since 1896.

==Facilities==

===Cinemateket===
Cinemateket is the national Danish film museum, dedicated to broaden the knowledge and interest in Danish as well as foreign film. It has three cinemas which show a combination of film classics and quality films of various themes. Occasionally contemporary films which would otherwise not reach the Danish market are shown. In the videoteque in the library is it possible to watch [[short film|short]] and [[documentary film]]s. Other facilities include a book shop, a café and a restaurant.

===Library===
The Danish Film Institute's library on the first floor holds 55,000 books and subscribes to 240 mainly European and American magazines. The library lends regular books—usually for a period of one month—while magazines, manuscripts and rarer publications may only be referenced on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/det-danske-filminstituts-bibliotek|title=Det Danske Filminstituts Bibliotek|publisher=AOK|accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Encyclopedia of Math snap shot.jpg|thumbnail|''Encyclopedia of Mathematics'' snap shot]]
The '''''Encyclopedia of Mathematics''''' (also '''''EOM''''' and formerly '''''Encyclopaedia of Mathematics''''') is a large reference work in [[mathematics]]. It is available in book form and on CD-ROM.

==Overview==
The 2002 version contains more than 8,000 entries covering most areas of mathematics at a graduate level, and the presentation is technical in nature. The encyclopedia is edited by [[Michiel Hazewinkel]] and was published by [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] until 2003, when Kluwer became part of [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]. The CD-ROM contains animations and three-dimensional objects.

The encyclopedia has been translated from the Soviet ''Matematicheskaya entsiklopediya'' (1977) originally edited by [[Ivan Matveevich Vinogradov]] and extended with comments and three supplements adding several thousand articles.

Until November 29, 2011, a static version of the encyclopedia could be browsed online free of charge online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eom.springer.de/|title=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This URL now redirects to the new [[wiki]] incarnation of the EOM.

==''Encyclopedia of Mathematics'' wiki==
A new dynamic version of the encyclopedia is now available as a public wiki online.&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofmath.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org|title=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new wiki is a collaboration between Springer and the [[European Mathematical Society]]. This new version of the encyclopedia includes the entire contents of the previous online version, but all entries can now be publicly updated to include the newest advancements in mathematics. All entries will be monitored for content accuracy by members of an editorial board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Editorial_Board|title=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; selected by the [[European Mathematical Society]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2341">'''Epistolography''', or the art of writing [[Letter (message)|letters]], is a [[genre]] of [[Byzantine literature]] similar to [[rhetoric]] that was popular with the intellectual elite of the [[Byzantine]] age.&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"Epistolography" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 718. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter became a popular literary form in the fourth century AD and combined Christian and classical Greek traditions. The collections of the emperors [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], [[Libanios]], and [[Synesius]], and the work of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] were particularly notable, while letters of [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and the [[Pauline Epistles]] of the [[New Testament]] were influential in the development of the genre.&lt;ref name=Oxf/&gt;

In some cases large numbers of letters have survived from the more prolific practitioners. Nine hundred from [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] (345–402) survive, and Libanius (c. 314–392 or 393) left over 1500 letters in Greek. Scholars have sometimes been disappointed with the content of the letters, which have tended to include [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] conventions to the exclusion of factual matters, or, in the case of Libanius, to include many generic recommendations on behalf of applicants to the Roman bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Averil Cameron|Cameron, A.]] (1998) "Education and literary culture" in Cameron, A. and [[Peter Garnsey|Garnsey, P.]] (eds.) ''[[The Cambridge Ancient History|The Cambridge ancient history: Vol. XIII The late empire, A.D. 337-425]]''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 696.&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.H.M. Jones]] described the writing of letters in the later [[Roman Empire]] as a social convention  of elegant compositions which contained no information and solicited none.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.H.M. (1964) ''The later Roman empire 284-602: A social, economic, and administrative survey. Volume II.'' Oxford: [[Basil Blackwell]], p. 1004. {{ISBN|0631149651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre later died out before being revived in the 11th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref name=Oxf/&gt;

'''Erich Auerbach''' (November 9, 1892 &amp;ndash; October 13, 1957) was a [[Germans|German]] [[philology|philologist]] and [[comparative literature|comparative scholar]] and [[Literary criticism|critic of literature]]. His best-known work is ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', a history of representation in Western literature from ancient to modern times and frequently cited as a classic in the study of realism in literature.&lt;ref name="Greenberg1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Mark L.|title=Literature and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpXDUHNgvQ0C&amp;pg=PA280|accessdate=23 April 2012|year=1992|publisher=Lehigh UP|isbn=978-0-934223-20-1|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Auerbach, who was [[Jew]]ish and born in Berlin, was trained in the German [[philology|philological]] tradition and would eventually become, along with [[Leo Spitzer]], one of its best-known scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U8VpxmzH3LsC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=%22Erich+Auerbach%22+jewish&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VVJHTtLyOurs0gGomtTzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA Auerbach (1993), p. xiii]&lt;/ref&gt; After participating as a combatant in [[World War I]], he earned a [[doctorate]] in 1921 at [[University of Greifswald]], served as librarian at the [[Berlin State Library|Prussian State Library]] for some years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=March 5, 2015|title=What is concrete?
|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n05/michael-wood/what-is-concrete |journal=[[The London Review of Books]] |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=19–21 |access-date=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1929 became a member of the philology [[faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] at the [[University of Marburg]], publishing a well-received study entitled ''Dante: Poet of the Secular World''.

With the rise of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] Auerbach was forced to vacate his position in 1935. Exiled from [[Nazi Germany]], he took up residence in Istanbul, Turkey, where he wrote ''Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature'' (1946), generally considered his masterwork.&lt;ref&gt;Wellek, Rene. "Erich Auerbach (1892–1957)." ''Comparative Literature'' 10: 1 (Winter, 1958), 93–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Auerbach's life and work in Turkey is detailed and placed in historical and sociological context by Kader Konuk, ''East West Mimesis: Auerbach in Turkey'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Konuk|first=Kader|title=East West Mimesis: Auerbach in Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDGhU1g9hM0C|year=2010|publisher=Stanford UP|isbn=9780804775755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to the United States in 1947, teaching at [[Pennsylvania State University]] and then working at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. He was appointed [[professor]] of [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[philology]] at [[Yale University]] in 1950, a position he held until his death in 1957 in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Wellek, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Yale, Auerbach supervised [[Fredric Jameson]]'s doctoral work.&lt;ref&gt;Best, Steven, and Kellner, Douglas. ''Postmodern Theory: Critical Interrogations.'' New York: Guilford Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In the fifty year commemoration reprinting of Auerbach's ''Mimesis'', [[Edward Said]] of Columbia University included an extended introduction to Auerbach and mentioned the book's debt to [[Giambattista Vico]] stating: "As one can immediately judge by its subtitle, Auerbach's book is by far the largest in scope and ambition out of all the other important critical works of the past half century. Its range covers literary masterpiences from Homer and the Old Testament right through to Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust, although as Auerbach says apologetically at the end of the book, for reasons of space he had to leave out a great deal of medieval literature as well as some crucial modern writiers like Pascal and Baudelaire."&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Fifty Year Anniversary of Mimesis," included in Fifty Year Anniversary edition of Mimesis. Princeton University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''filibuster''' is a political procedure where one or more members of parliament or congress debate over a proposed piece of legislation so as to delay or entirely prevent a decision being made on the proposal. It is sometimes referred to as "talking a bill to death" or "talking out a bill"&lt;ref&gt;"Talking it out" usage example: {{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6654675.stm |title=MPs renew info exemption effort |date=15 May 2007 |work= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is characterized as a form of [[obstructionism|obstruction]] in a [[legislature]] or other decision-making body. This form of political obstruction reaches as far back as Ancient Roman times and could also be referred to synonymously with [[Stonewalling|political stonewalling]]. Due to the often extreme length of time required for a successful filibuster, many speakers stray off topic after exhausting the original subject matter. Past speakers have read through laws from different states, recited speeches, and even read from cookbooks and phone books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Jon |title=The art of the filibuster: How do you talk for 24 hours straight? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20672974 |website=BBC News Magazine |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word filibuster comes from the Spanish "fee-lee-bote," English "[[fly-boat]]," a small, swift sailing-vessel with a large mainsail, which enabled [[buccaneer]]s to pursue merchantmen in the open sea and escape when pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=R. A. Van Middeldyk | title=The History of Puerto Rico | year=1910 | page=131 | url=http://archive.org/details/historyofpuertor00vanm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' finds its only known use in early modern English in a 1587 book describing "flibutors" who robbed supply convoys.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', "filibuster", pp. F:212–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English ''filibuster'' was borrowed from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in the 19th century. Originally it applied to pirates infesting the Spanish American coasts, but around 1850 it designated the followers of [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and [[Narciso López]], who were then pillaging Spanish colonies in [[Central America]].&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{citation | entry=FILIBUSTER | title=[[Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]] | year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word entered American political slang with the meaning "to delay legislation by [[dilatory motion]]s or other artifices."&lt;ref name="webster" /&gt;

==Ancient Rome==
One of the first known practitioners of the filibuster was the [[Roman Senate|Roman senator]] [[Cato the Younger]]. In debates over legislation he especially opposed, Cato would often obstruct the measure by speaking continuously until nightfall.&lt;ref name="goldsworthy"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|title=Caesar: Life of a Colossus|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|year=2006|page=583}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Roman Senate had a rule requiring all business to conclude by dusk, Cato's purposely long-winded speeches were an effective device to forestall a vote.

Cato attempted to use the filibuster at least twice to frustrate the political objectives of [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name="goldsworthy"/&gt; The first incident occurred during the summer of 60 BCE, when Caesar was returning home from his [[promagistrate|propraetorship]] in [[Hispania Ulterior]]. Caesar, by virtue of his military victories over the raiders and bandits in Hispania, had been awarded a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]  by the Senate. Having recently turned forty, Caesar had also become eligible to stand for [[Roman consul|consul]]. This posed a dilemma. Roman generals honored with a triumph were not allowed to enter the city prior to the ceremony, but candidates for the consulship were required, by law, to appear in person at the [[Forum Romanum|Forum]].&lt;ref name="goldsworthy"/&gt; The date of the election, which had already been set, made it impossible for Caesar to stand unless he crossed the ''[[pomerium]]'' and gave up the right to his triumph. Caesar petitioned the Senate to stand ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]],'' but Cato employed a filibuster to block the proposal. Faced with a choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship and entered the city.

Cato made use of the filibuster again in 59 BCE in response to a land reform bill sponsored by Caesar, who was then consul.&lt;ref name="goldsworthy"/&gt; When it was Cato's time to speak during the debate, he began one of his characteristically long-winded speeches. Caesar, who needed to pass the bill before his co-consul, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]], took possession of the ''[[fasces]]'' at the end of the month, immediately recognized Cato's intent and ordered the [[lictor]]s to jail him for the rest of the day. The move was unpopular with many senators and Caesar, realizing his mistake, soon ordered Cato's release. The day was wasted without the Senate ever getting to vote on a motion supporting the bill, but Caesar eventually circumvented Cato's opposition by taking the measure to the [[Tribal Assembly]], where it passed.

==Westminster-style parliaments==
{{See also |Westminster system}}
&lt;!--Should probably transclude the introduction for Westminster system here--&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], a bill defeated by a filibustering manoeuvre may be said to have been "talked out". The procedures of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] require that members cover only points germane to the topic under consideration or the debate underway whilst speaking. Example filibusters in the Commons and Lords include:
* In 1874, [[Joseph Gillis Biggar]] started making long speeches in the House of Commons to delay the passage of [[Irish coercion acts]]. [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], a young Irish nationalist [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), who in 1880 became leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, joined him in this tactic to obstruct the business of the House and force the Liberals and Conservatives to negotiate with him and his party. The tactic was enormously successful, and Parnell and his MPs succeeded, for a time, in forcing Parliament to take the [[Irish Question]] of return to self-government seriously.
* In 1983, Labour MP [[John Golding (British politician)|John Golding]] talked for over 11 hours during an all-night sitting at the committee stage of the [[British Telecommunications]] Bill. However, as this was at a standing committee and not in the Commons chamber, he was also able to take breaks to eat.
* On July 3, 1998, Labour MP [[Michael Foster (Worcester MP)|Michael Foster]]'s Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill was blocked in parliament by opposition filibustering.
* In January 2000, filibustering directed by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs to oppose the [[Disqualifications Act 2000|Disqualifications Bill]] led to cancellation of the day's parliamentary business on [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]'s 1000th day in office. However, since this business included [[Prime Minister's Questions]], [[William Hague]], Conservative leader at that time, was deprived of the opportunity of a high-profile confrontation with the Prime Minister.
* On Friday 20 April 2007, a [[Private Member's Bill]] aimed at exempting Members of Parliament from the Freedom of Information Act was 'talked out' by a collection of MPs, led by Liberal Democrats [[Simon Hughes]] and Norman Baker who debated for 5 hours, therefore running out of time for the parliamentary day and 'sending the bill to the bottom of the stack.' However, since there were no other Private Members' Bills to debate, it was resurrected the following Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6586131.stm |title=MPs' info exemption bill revived |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-24 |accessdate=2010-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2011, Labour peers, including most notably [[John Prescott]], were attempting to delay the passage of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill 2010]] until after 16 February, the deadline given by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] to allow the referendum on the Alternative Vote to take place on 5 May. On the eighth day of debate, staff in the House of Lords set up camp beds and refreshments to allow peers to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703396604576087740260334576?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Ainsley | last=Thomson | title=U.K. in Marathon Session on Voting Bill | date=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2012, Conservative and [[Scottish National Party]] MPs used filibustering to successfully block the Daylight Savings Bill 2010–12, a Private Member's Bill that would put the UK on [[Central European Time]]. The filibustering included an attempt by [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]] to amend the bill to give the county of [[Somerset]] its own time zone, 15 minutes behind London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/parliament/2012/01/conservative-backbenchers-halt-effort-to-move-the-clocks-forward.html | title=Conservative backbenchers halt effort to move clocks forward | date=January 21, 2012 | accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n58wr9FVzO0 | title=Jacob Rees-Mogg Proposes Somerset Time Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2014, Conservative MPs [[Philip Davies]] and [[Christopher Chope]] successfully filibustered a Private Member's Bill that would prohibit retaliatory evictions. Davies's speech was curtailed by Deputy Speaker [[Dawn Primarolo]] for disregarding her authority, after she ordered Davies to wrap up his then hour-long speech. A closure motion moved by the government, which was agreed to 60–0, failed due to being inquorate.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/chan70.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/fury-as-retaliatory-evictions-bill-talked-out-of-commons/7007119.article|title=Fury as retaliatory evictions bill talked out of Commons|publisher=Inside Housing|accessdate=15 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814222938/http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/fury-as-retaliatory-evictions-bill-talked-out-of-commons/7007119.article|archivedate=14 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2016 Conservative Minister [[Sam Gyimah]] filibustered a bill sponsored by [[John Nicolson (politician)|John Nicolson]] of the [[Scottish National Party]] that would pardon historic convictions of homosexuality (which is no longer an offence), replacing an existing law that requires each pardon to be applied for separately.

The all-time Commons record for non-stop speaking, six hours, was set by [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] in 1828, though this was not a filibuster. The 21st century record was set on December 2, 2005 by [[Andrew Dismore]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP for [[Hendon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hendon]]. Dismore spoke for three hours and 17 minutes to block a Conservative Private Member's Bill, the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Protection of Property) Bill, which he claimed amounted to "vigilante law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4492688.stm BBC News] – "MP's marathon speech sinks bill." Retrieved February 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dismore is credited with speaking for 197 minutes, he regularly accepted interventions from other MPs who wished to comment on points made in his speech. Taking multiple interventions artificially inflates the duration of a speech and thus may be used as a tactic to prolong a speech.

In local [[unitary authorities of England]] a motion may be carried into closure by filibustering. This results in any additional motions receiving less time for debate by Councillors instead forcing a vote by the Council under closure rules.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

====Northern Ireland====
A notable filibuster took place in the [[Northern Ireland House of Commons]] in 1936 when [[Tommy Henderson]] (Independent Unionist MP for Shankill) spoke for nine and a half hours (ending just before 4 am) on the Appropriation Bill. As this Bill applied government spending to all departments, almost any topic was relevant to the debate, and Henderson used the opportunity to list all of his many criticisms of the Unionist government.

===Australia===
Both houses of the [[Government of Australia|Australian]] parliament have strictly enforced rules on how long members may speak, so filibusters are generally not possible, though this is not the case in some state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/standing_orders/a00.htm Parliament of Australia] – Standing Orders and other orders of the Senate.

In opposition, [[Tony Abbott]]'s Liberal National [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] used [[Suspension of the rules|suspension]] of [[Parliamentary procedure|standing orders]] in 2012 for the purposes of filibustering, most commonly during question time against the Labor government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ireland|first=Judith|title=Abbott finds a new victim for his schtick|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/blogs/question-time/abbott-finds-a-new-victim-for-his-schtick-20120229-1u2p7.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/suspended-in-the-time-it-takes-for-a-sound-bite/story-e6frgd0x-1226300897875 | work=The Australian | title=Suspended in the time it takes for a sound bite | date=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In August 2000, [[Government of New Zealand|New Zealand]] opposition parties National and ACT delayed the voting for the Employment Relations Bill by voting slowly, and in some cases in [[Māori language|Māori]] (which required translation into English).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=147731 |title =Bill debate goes to rare Monday |first=Vernon |last=Small |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=2000-08-21 |accessdate=2017-12-16}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, several parties staged a filibuster of the Local Government (Auckland Reorganisation) Bill in opposition to the government setting up a new [[Auckland Council]] under urgency and without debate or review by select committee, by proposing thousands of [[wrecking amendments]] and voting in Māori as each amendment had to be voted on and votes in Māori translated into English. Amendments included renaming the council to "Auckland [[Katchafire]] Council" or "[[Rodney Hide]] Memorial Council" and replacing the phrase "powers of a regional council" with "power and muscle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=157300 |title="Melissa Lee Memorial Council" mooted |publisher=Newstalk ZB |accessdate=2010-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519190937/http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=157300 |archivedate=2009-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/2415569/Labour-filibuster-on-Supercity-bills |title=Labour filibuster on Supercity bills |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=2010-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The [[Rajya Sabha]] (Council of states) – which is the upper house in the Indian bicameral legislature – allows for a debate to be brought to a close with a simple majority decision of the house, on a closure motion so introduced by any member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Government of India|title=Handbook for Members of Rajya Sabha|date=January 2010|page=60 |chapter= 2: General Matters|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/handbook/hand_book_2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the [[Lok Sabha]] (Council of the people) – the lower house – leaves the closure of the debate to the discretion of the speaker, once a motion to end the debate is moved by a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Government of India|title=Handbook for Members of Lok Sabha (Fifteenth Edition)|page=67|chapter=2: General|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/members/membersbook/Chapter2.pdf|access-date=2014-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813162644/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/members/membersbook/chapter2.pdf|archive-date=2014-08-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In 2014, Irish Justice Minister Alan Shatter performed a filibuster; he was perceived to "drone on and on" and hence this was termed a "Drone Attack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/bizarre-story-defies-shatter-s-drone-attack-1.1697923 |title=Bizarre story defies Shatter’s drone attack | date=February 20, 2014 |work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

====Federal====
A dramatic example of filibustering in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] took place between Thursday June 23, 2011 and Saturday June 25, 2011. In an attempt to prevent the passing of Bill C-6, which would have legislated the imposing of a four-year contract and pay conditions on the locked out [[Canada Post]] workers, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) led a filibustering session which lasted for fifty-eight hours. The NDP argued that the legislation in its then form undermined collective bargaining. Specifically, the NDP opposed the salary provisions and the form of binding arbitration outlined in the bill.&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The House was supposed to break for the summer Thursday June 23, but remained open in an extended session due to the filibuster. The 103 NDP MPs had been taking it in turn to deliver 20 minute speeches – plus 10 minutes of questions and comments – in order to delay the passing of the bill. MPs are allowed to give such speeches each time a vote takes place, and many votes were needed before the bill could be passed. As the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] held a majority in the House, the bill passed.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Another example of filibuster in Canada federally came in early 2014 when NDP MP and Deputy Leader [[David Christopherson]] filibustered the government's bill C-23, the [[Fair Elections Act]] at the Procedure and House Affairs Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=6427238&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1|title=House of Commons Committees – PROC (41-2) – Minutes of Proceedings – Number 016|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His filibuster lasted several meetings the last of which he spoke for over 8 hours and was done to support his own motion to hold cross country hearings on the bill so MPs could hear what the Canadian public thought of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1190246/the-art-of-the-filibuster-preparation-focus-and-a-hardy-bladder/|title=The art of the filibuster: preparation, focus and a hardy bladder|first=Laura|last=Stone|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, given that the Conservative government had a majority at committee, his motion was defeated and the bill passed although with some significant amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/05/13/conservatives_pass_fair_elections_act.html|title=Conservatives pass Fair Elections Act |publisher= Toronto Star|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Provincial====
The [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislature]] of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]] has witnessed several significant filibusters,&lt;ref name="cpsa-acsp.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2006/Locke.pdf |title=Obstruction in the Ontario Legislature: The struggle for power between the government and the opposition |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; although two are notable for the unusual manner by which they were undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thoughtundermined.com/2011/01/26/on-filibusters/ |title=On Filibusters |accessdate=2012-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803022656/http://thoughtundermined.com/2011/01/26/on-filibusters/ |archive-date=2012-08-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was an effort on May 6, 1991, by [[Mike Harris]], later premier but then leader of the opposition [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservatives]], to derail the implementation of the budget tabled by the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|NDP]] government under premier [[Bob Rae]]. The tactic involved the introduction of Bill 95, the title of which contained the names of every lake, river and stream in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/hansardeissue/35-1/l028.htm |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Hansard. Monday, 6 May 1991 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the reading of the title by the proposing [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]], and the subsequent obligatory reading of the title by the clerk of the chamber, this filibuster occupied the entirety of the day's session until adjournment. To prevent this particular tactic from being used again, changes were eventually made to the [[Parliamentary procedure|Standing Orders]] to limit the time allocated each day to the introduction of bills to 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="cpsa-acsp.ca"/&gt;

A second high-profile and uniquely implemented filibuster in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario Legislature]] occurred in April 1997, where the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]], then in opposition, tried to prevent the governing [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservatives']] [[Common Sense Revolution#Bill 103|Bill 103]] from taking effect. To protest the Tory government's legislation that would [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamate]] the municipalities of [[Metro Toronto]] into the "megacity" of [[Toronto]], the small NDP caucus introduced 11,500 [[Bill (proposed law)|amendments]] to the megacity bill, created on computers with [[mail merge]] functionality. Each amendment would name a street in the proposed city, and provide that public hearings be held into the megacity with residents of the street invited to participate. The [[Ontario Liberal Party]] also joined the filibuster with a smaller series of amendments; a typical Liberal amendment would give a historical designation to a named street. The NDP then added another series of over 700 amendments, each proposing a different date for the bill to come into force.
The filibuster began on April 2 with the Abbeywood Trail amendment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/house-proceedings/house_detail.do?locale=en&amp;Date=1997-04-02&amp;Parl=36&amp;Sess=1&amp;detailPage=/house-proceedings/transcripts/files_html/1997-04-02_L176b.htm |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

On April 4, exhausted and often sleepy government members inadvertently let one of the NDP amendments pass, and the handful of residents of Cafon Court in [[Etobicoke, Ontario|Etobicoke]] were granted the right to a public consultation on the bill, although the government subsequently nullified this with an amendment of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/house-proceedings/house_detail.do?locale=en&amp;Date=1997-04-04&amp;Parl=36&amp;Sess=1&amp;detailPage=/house-proceedings/transcripts/files_html/1997-04-04_L176h.htm |title=Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

An ironic example of filibustering occurred when the [[Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador]] reportedly had "nothing else to do in the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]" and debated between only themselves about their own budget after both the Conservative and New Democratic Parties indicated either their support for the bill or intent to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetelegram.com/news/local/2017/3/14/liberal-government-filibusters-its-own-budget-debate.amp.html|title=Liberal government filibusters its own budget debate|last=McLeod|first=James|date=March 14, 2017|website=The Telegram|access-date=November 5, 2017|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315024711/http://www.thetelegram.com/news/local/2017/3/14/liberal-government-filibusters-its-own-budget-debate.amp.html|archive-date=March 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 1897, Dr. [[Otto Lecher]], Delegate for [[Brno|Brünn]], spoke continuously for twelve hours before the  ''Abgeordnetenhaus'' ("House of Delegates") of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|''Reichsrat'']] ("Imperial Council") of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], to block action on the "''[[Ausgleich]]''" with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], which was due for renewal.

In the [[Southern Rhodesia]] Legislative Assembly, Independent member Dr [[Ahrn Palley]] staged a similar filibuster against the Law and Order Maintenance Bill on 22 November 1960, although this took the form of moving a long series of amendments to the Bill, and therefore consisted of multiple individual speeches interspersed with comments from other Members. Palley kept the Assembly sitting from 8 PM to 12:30 PM the following day.

In the [[Senate of the Philippines]], [[Roseller Lim]] of the [[Nacionalista Party]] held out the longest filibuster in Philippine Senate history.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} On the election for the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines]] in April 1963, he stood on the podium for more than 18 hours to wait for party-mate [[Alejandro Almendras]] who was to arrive from the United States. The Nacionalistas, who comprised exactly half of the Senate, wanted to prevent the election of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to the Senate Presidency. Prohibited from even going to the comfort room, he had to relieve himself in his pants until Almendras' arrival. He voted for party-mate [[Eulogio Rodriguez]] just as Almendras arrived, and had to be carried off via stretcher out of the session hall due to exhaustion. However, Almendras voted for Marcos, and the latter wrested the Senate Presidency from the Nacionalistas after more than a decade of control.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

On December 16, 2010, [[Werner Kogler]] of the Austrian Green Party gave his speech before the budget committee, criticizing the failings of the budget and the governing parties ([[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Austrian People's Party]]) in the last years.

==United States==

===Senate===
{{Main|Filibuster in the United States Senate}}
The filibuster is a powerful legislative device in the [[United States Senate]]. [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate|Senate rules]] permit a senator or senators to speak for as long as they wish and on any topic they choose, unless "three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn"&lt;ref name=rule22&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXXII |title=Precedence of motions (Rule XXII) |work=Rules of the Senate |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=January 21, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (usually 60 out of 100 senators) bring debate to a close by invoking cloture under [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule XXII|Senate Rule XXII]].  Even if a filibuster attempt is unsuccessful, the process takes floor time.&lt;ref name=crs&gt;{{cite book |last=Beth |first=Richard |author2=Stanley Bach |title=Filibusters and Cloture in the Senate |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |date=March 28, 2003 |pages=4, 9 |url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30360.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Defenders call the filibuster "The Soul of the Senate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard A.

It is not part of the US Constitution, becoming theoretically possible with a change of Senate rules only in 1806, and never being used until 1837.&lt;ref name=Binder&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/testimony/2010/04/22-filibuster-binder |title=The History of the Filibuster |last=Binder |first=Sarah |work=Brookings |date=April 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely used for much of the Senate's first two centuries, it was strengthened in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Backer|title=Brennan Center for Justice: A Short History on the Constitutional Option|url=http://fixthesenatenow.org/news/entry/brennan-center-for-justice-a-short-history-on-the-constitutional-option/#.UPXgdY44S21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221012437/http://fixthesenatenow.org/news/entry/brennan-center-for-justice-a-short-history-on-the-constitutional-option|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in recent years, the majority has preferred to avoid filibusters by moving to other business when a filibuster is threatened and attempts to achieve [[cloture]] have failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gregory John Wawro|author2=Eric Schickler|title=Filibuster: Obstruction And Lawmaking in the U.S. Senate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCrtXipvJigC|year=2006|publisher=Princeton U.P.|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, in recent decades this has come to mean that all major legislation (apart from budgets) now requires a 60% majority to pass.

[[File:Senator Murphy gun control filibuster.webm|thumb|US Senator [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] engaging in a filibuster]]

Under current Senate rules, any modification or limitation of the filibuster would be a rule change that itself could be filibustered, with two-thirds of those senators present and voting (as opposed to the normal three-fifths of those sworn) needing to vote to break the filibuster.&lt;ref name=rule22/&gt;  However, under Senate precedents, a simple majority can (and has) acted to limit the practice by overruling decisions of the chair.  The removal or substantial limitation of the filibuster by a simple majority, rather than a rule change, is called the constitutional option by proponents, and the [[nuclear option]] by opponents.

On November 21, 2013, the Democratic controlled Senate voted 52 to 48 to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of all executive and judicial nominees, excluding Supreme Court nominees, rather than the 3/5 of votes previously required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/us/politics/reid-sets-in-motion-steps-to-limit-use-of-filibuster.html?hpw&amp;rref=us&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Jeremy W. | last=Peters | title=In Landmark Vote, Senate Limits Use of the Filibuster | date=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2017, the Republican controlled Senate voted 52 to 48 to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of Supreme Court nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-approves-nuclear-option-fight-gorsuch-supreme-court/story?id=46608672|title=Senate OKs ‘nuclear option,' clears path for high court nomination vote|last=News|first=A. B. C.|date=2017-04-06|website=ABC News|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 3/5 supermajority is still required to end filibusters on legislation.

=== House of Representatives ===
In the [[United States House of Representatives]], the filibuster (the right to unlimited debate) was used until 1842, when a permanent rule limiting the duration of debate was created. The [[disappearing quorum]] was a tactic used by the minority until [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Thomas Brackett Reed]] eliminated it in 1890. As the membership of the House grew much larger than the [[United States Senate|Senate]], the House had acted earlier to control floor debate and the delay and blocking of floor votes. On February 7, 2018, [[Nancy Pelosi]] set a record for the longest speech on the House floor (8 hours and 7 minutes), in support of [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-surpasses-hour-immigration-speech-house-floor/story?id=52904794|title=Pelosi ends immigration speech after more than 8 hours, setting record|first=A.

==France==
In France, in August 2006, the left-wing opposition submitted 137,449 amendments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=TIMELINE: Key dates in Gaz de France-Suez merger |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL0257250120070902 |agency=Reuters |date=2 September 2007 |accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the proposed law bringing the share in [[Gaz de France]] owned by the French state from 80% to 34% in order to allow for the merger between Gaz de France and Suez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/19/business/worldbusiness/19iht-gdf.2868154.html |title=Plan for Gaz de France advances toward a vote |last=Kanter |first=James |date=19 September 2006 |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal parliamentary procedure would require 10 years to vote on all the amendments.

The French constitution gives the government two options to defeat such a filibuster. The first one was originally the use of the [[Article 49 of the French Constitution|article 49]] paragraph 3 procedure, according to which the law was adopted except if a majority is reached on a non-confidence motion (a reform of July 2008 resulted in this power being restricted to budgetary measures only, plus one time each ordinary session – i.e. from October to June – on any bill. Before this reform, article 49, 3 was frequently used, especially when the government was short a majority in the [[Assemblée nationale]] to support the text but still enough to avoid a non-confidence vote). The second one is the article 44 paragraph 3 through which the government can force a global vote on all amendments it did not approve or submit itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/fr00000_.html |title=France – Constitution |publisher=International Constitutional Law |accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the government did not have to use either of those procedures. As the parliamentary debate started, the left-wing opposition chose to withdraw all the amendments to allow for the vote to proceed. The "filibuster" was aborted because the opposition to the privatisation of Gaz de France appeared to lack support amongst the general population. It also appeared that this privatisation law could be used by the left-wing in the presidential election of 2007 as a political argument. Indeed, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], president of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]] (UMP – the right wing party), Interior Minister, former Finance Minister and former [[President of France|President]], had previously promised that the share owned by the French government in Gaz de France would never go below 70%.

==Hong Kong==
The first incidence of filibuster in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) after [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|the Handover]] occurred during the second reading of the Provision of Municipal Services (Reorganization) Bill in 1999, which aimed at dissolving the partially elected [[Urban Council, Hong Kong|Urban Council]] and [[Regional Council (Hong Kong)|Regional Council]]. As the absence of some [[Pro-Beijing camp|pro-Establishment]] legislators would mean an inadequate support for the passing of the bill, the Pro-establishment Camp filibustered along with [[Michael Suen]], the then-[[Secretary for Constitutional Affairs]], the voting of the bill was delayed to the next day and that the absentees could cast their votes. Though the filibuster was criticised by the [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy camp]], [[Lau Kong-wah]] of the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong]] (DAB) defended their actions, saying "it (a filibuster) is totally acceptable in a parliamentary assembly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr99-00/english/counmtg/hansard/991201fe.pdf Official Record of Proceedings, Legislative Council, 1 December 1999], p. 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislators of the Pro-democracy Camp filibustered during a debate about financing the construction of the [[Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link]] by raising many questions on very minor issues, delaying the passing of the bill from 18 December 2009 to 16 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126315844550823775 Hong Kong Opposition to Rail Holds Off Vote], Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt; The Legislative Council Building was surrounded by thousands of [[Guangzhou-Hong Kong high-speed rail controversy|anti-high-speed rail protesters]] during the course of the meetings.

In 2012, [[Albert Chan]] and [[Wong Yuk-man]] of [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] submitted a total of 1306 amendments to the Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill, by which the government attempted to forbid lawmakers from participating in by-elections after their resignation. The bill was a response to the so-called '[[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|Five Constituencies Referendum]], in which 5 lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp resigned and then joined the by-election, claiming that it would affirm the public's support to push forward the electoral reform. The pro-democracy camp strongly opposed the bill{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}, saying it was seen a deprivation of the citizens' political rights. As a result of the filibuster, the LegCo carried on multiple overnight debates on the amendments. In the morning of 17 May 2012, the President of the LegCo ([[Jasper Tsang]]) terminated the debate, citing Article 92 of the Rules of Procedure of LegCo: ''In any matter not provided for in these Rules of Procedure, the practice and procedure to be followed in the Council shall be such as may be decided by the President who may, if he thinks fit, be guided by the practice and procedure of other legislatures.'' In the end, all motions to amend the bill were defeated and the Bill was passed.

To ban filibuster, [[Ip Kwok-him]] of the DAB sought to limit each member to move only one motion, by amending the procedures of the Finance Committee and its two subcommittees in 2013. All 27 members from pan-democracy camp submitted 1.9 million amendments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legco.gov.hk/yr12-13/english/fc/fc/papers/fc0222fc-104-1-e.pdf Paper for the Finance Committee Meeting on 22 February 2013: Members' motions that seek to amend the procedures of the Finance Committee and its two subcommittees], Legislative Council of Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretariat estimated that 408 man-months (each containing 156 working hours) were needed to vet the facts and accuracy of the motions, and, if all amendments were admitted by the Chairman, the voting time would take 23,868 two-hour meetings.

{{as of|2017}}, filibustering is still an ongoing practice in Hong Kong by the pan-democratic party, but at the same time, the pan-democratic party are undergoing huge amounts of fire from the pro-Beijing camp for making filibustering a norm in the Legislative Council.

== Italy ==

In Italy, filibustering has ancient traditions and is expressed overall with the proposition of legal texts&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.goleminformazione.it/commenti/italicum-legge-elettorale-emendamenti-canguro-scavalco.html#.VslgJa_YOrU Pacuvio Labeone, {{lang|it|Italicum, canguri e scavalchi: gli emendamenti azzeccagarbugli}}], Goleminformazione, 22 gennaio 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; on which interventions take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/11429380/Tumulto_in_aula_ghigliottina_e_tagliola {{lang|it|I tre giorni della supercazzola}}], L’Ago e il filo, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iran==
In [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company#Nationalisation|Iranian oil nationalisation]], the filibustering speech of [[Hossain Makki]], the [[Iranian National Front|National Front]] deputy took four days&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Iranica 1901"&gt;{{cite web | title=Oil Agreements in Iran | website=Encyclopædia Iranica | date=1901-05-28 | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/oil-agreements-in-iran | accessdate=2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that made the pro-British and pro-royalists in [[Majlis (Iran)]] inactive. To forestall a vote, the opposition, headed by Hossein Makki, conducted a filibuster. For four days Makki talked about the country's tortuous experience with [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|AIOC]] and the shortcomings of the bill. Four days later when the term ended the debate had reached no conclusion. The fate of the bill remained to be decided by the next Majlis.&lt;ref name="Elm 1994 p. 56"&gt;{{cite book | last=Elm | first=M. | title=Oil, Power, and Principle: Iran's Oil Nationalization and Its Aftermath | publisher=Syracuse University Press | series=Contemporary issues in the Middle East | year=1994 | isbn=978-0-8156-2642-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VoU4AI-yq7UC&amp;pg=PA56 | accessdate=2015-09-01 | page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Korea==
South Korean opposition lawmakers started a filibuster on February 23, 2016 to stall the Anti-Terrorism bill, which they claim will give too much power to the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]] and result in invasions of citizens' privacy.  As of March 2, the filibuster completed with a total of 193 hours, and the passing of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thestack.com/security/2016/03/02/south-korea-breaks-filibuster-record-fighting-new-surveillance-bill/|title=South Korea breaks record trying to block surveillance|date=2 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korean legislative election, 2016|South Korea's 20th legislative elections]] were held 2 months after the filibuster, and the opposite party the [[Minjoo Party of Korea]] won more seats than the ruling party, the [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]].

'''''Fortunate Son''''' is a controversial [[biography]] of the former [[American president]] [[George W. Bush]] by [[J.H. Hatfield]].  The book was published in 1999 during the run-up to Bush's candidacy in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|United States 2000 presidential election]] by [[St. Martin's Press]],  and retracted by the publisher.

The book alleges that [[George W. Bush|Bush]] received preferential treatment throughout his life, from his early schooling at [[Phillips Academy|Andover]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Harvard]], to his business connections in [[Midland, Texas]], and his personal ownership interest in the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] baseball team, to his candidacy for Governor and President. Hatfield argues that Bush succeeded in life not on merit, but on family connections alone, as a member of a modern [[oligarchy]].

Soon after the book's release, ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' reported that Hatfield was a paroled felon who had been convicted in 1988 of paying a hit man $5,000 to murder his former boss with a car bomb. It was also revealed that Hatfield pleaded guilty to [[embezzlement]] in 1992. Hatfield at first denied the allegations when his publisher confronted him, but he eventually owned up to his criminal history.

Bush stated, regarding Hatfield:
{{cquote|Obviously if he's a convicted felon, his credibility is nothing, but his credibility was nothing with me to begin with because his story was totally ridiculous...}}

Hatfield stated in a later interview that the book had been "carefully fact-checked and scrutinized by lawyers" before the Bush campaign brought pressure to bear, as publicly stated by [[St. Martin's Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/21/hatfield/index.html "Publisher halts George W. Bush bio"] by Daryl Lindsey, Salon.com, October 21, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the revelations of Hatfield's criminal past, and the damage to his credibility, in October 1999, Hatfield's publisher, [[St. Martin's Press]], recalled 70,000 copies of ''Fortunate Son'' and left an additional 20,000 books in storage. Even so, the book had already reached the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller list. The book was later republished by [[Soft Skull Press]].

Hatfield died on July 18, 2001, in what was apparently a [[suicide]], dying of an [[drug overdose|overdose]] of [[prescription drugs]]. Police reports cited the events occurring in the aftermath of ''Fortunate Son''{{'}}s publication as a reason for taking his own life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8401">'''George Vicesimus Wigram''' (28 March 1805 – 1 February 1879) was an English biblical scholar and theologian.

==Early life==
He was the 20th child (hence his middle name) of [[Sir Robert Wigram, 1st Baronet]], a famous and wealthy merchant, and the 14th child of Lady Eleanor Wigram, Robert's 2nd wife (an aunt to [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]). His family were all capable and several of his siblings became illustrious in their own field. [[James Wigram (judge)|Sir James Wigram]] became a judge and Vice-Chancellor; [[Joseph Cotton Wigram]] became [[Bishop of Rochester]], [[Loftus Wigram]] was a barrister and politician, and [[Octavius Wigram]] was prominent as an insurance underwriter in the [[City of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Courthope (officer of arms)|William Courthope]], ''Debrett's complete peerage of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'' (1838), p. 605&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man George Wigram obtained a commission in the army. One of his postings was to [[Brussels]]. He spent an evening exploring the [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] battlefield and it was here he had a religious experience that changed his life. He wrote of it thus, "suddenly there came on my soul a something I had never known before. It was as if some One, Infinite and Almighty, knowing everything, full of the deepest, tenderest interest in myself, though utterly and entirely abhorring everything in, and connected with me, made known to me that He pitied and loved myself".&lt;ref&gt;D[ennett], E[dward], ed., ''Memorials of the Ministry of G. V. Wigram'', vol. 1 (Broom, London, 1880), p. iii&lt;/ref&gt; This led to his resigning his commission in the army and in 1826 he entered [[Queens College, Oxford]], with the intention of becoming an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman.

==Christian career==

At Oxford he met [[John Nelson Darby]] and [[Benjamin Wills Newton]]. Dissatisfied with the established church, Wigram and his friends left the Anglican church and helped establish non-denominational assemblies which became known as the [[Plymouth Brethren]].
He had considered joining [[Anthony Norris Groves]] and his mission to [[Baghdad]] in June 1829, but changed his mind just prior to the faith mission set off. 
After leaving Oxford University, Wigram, using his family wealth, in 1831 bought church premises in Plymouth and there established a Brethren assembly. During the 1830s Wigram also financed the establishment of assemblies in London.

Wigram had a keen interest in the original Hebrew and Greek texts of the Bible, which was of great interest to the emerging Brethren assemblies. In 1839, after years of work and financial investment, he published ''The Englishman's Greek and English Concordance to the New Testament'', followed in 1843 by ''The Englishman's Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance to the Old Testament''. He also edited the influential Brethren periodical ''Present Testimony and Original Christian Witness'' for many years (from 1849 to his death with posthumous issues running to 1881). This periodical superseded the Brethren's first magazine, ''The Christian Witness''.
Besides his literary work his oral ministry was considered to be marked by an attractive freshness: a contemporary remarked that his "very face became radiant as he spoke".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall, E.E. (1932/33). [http://www.stempublishing.com/hymns/biographies/wigram.html ''Songs of Pilgrimage and Glory: Notes on the Hymns of Certain Hymn-Writers'']. Central Bible Truth Depot, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his addresses have been preserved and published in the two volumes ''Memorials of the Ministry of G.V. Wigram'' and ''Gleanings from the Teaching of G.V. Wigram''. These were collected by the erstwhile Lewisham Road [[Baptist]] Church Minister, [[Edward Dennett]].

With Wigram's help, Darby became the most influential personality within the Brethren movement. Wigram is often referred to as being Darby's lieutenant&lt;ref&gt;Neatby, William Blair (1901). ''A History of the Plymouth Brethren'', p. 60. Hodder and Stoughton, London.&lt;/ref&gt; as he firmly supported Darby during moments of crisis. In 1845 he supported Darby in his doctrinal differences with Benjamin Wills Newton in the Brethren assembly at Plymouth. In Darby's 1848 dispute with [[George Müller]], Wigram again sided with Darby in relation to the reception of believers who had previously been in fellowship with Newton, and on Müller's reluctance to publicly denounce errors by Newton in regards to the sufferings of Christ (errors which Newton had already retracted). He also helped Darby fend off accusations of heresy, also in regards to the sufferings of Christ, in articles written in 1858 and 1866, which some considered were very similar to Newton's errors two decades earlier.

==Married life==
Wigram married Fanny Bligh in 1830, the daughter of Thomas Cherburgh Bligh whom Wigram had known as a girl in Ireland; she died in 1834. His second marriage was to Catherine, the only daughter of [[Charles_Stewart_Parnell#Family_background_and_early_life|William Parnell of Avondale]]. Their London home was 3 Howley Place, Harrow Road, London. In 1867, Wigram visited Canada. His wife Catherine joined him there two months later, but became ill and died after a short illness in Canada. The family physician was Limerick-born Dr [[Thomas Mackern]]. Wigram was 62 years old. Four years later his daughter Fanny Theodosia, child of his first wife, died.

==Travels==
Wigram travelled in the UK preaching and teaching in large Brethren assemblies. He visited [[Switzerland]] in 1853 and again in [[Vaud]] Canton in 1858. In later life he went abroad to minister to the many overseas assemblies of the Brethren, including [[Boston]] and Canada in 1867. Writing in November 1871, from [[Demerara]], [[British Guiana]], he said, "I came out in my old age, none save Himself with me". He visited Jamaica in 1872. This led to further travel, visiting Australia and [[New Zealand]] in 1873-75 and again in 1877-78.

Besides travel he maintained a wide correspondence with labourers in emerging Brethren assemblies. Among these were Louis Favez of [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;D[ennett], E[dward] (Ed., 1881). ''Memorials of the Ministry of G.V. Wigram'', vol. 3, p. 4 (26 April 1856). Broom, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hymnology==
Wigram contributed to the [[hymnology]] of the Brethren assemblies in a number of ways. He edited the anthology ''Hymns for the Poor of the Flock'' (1838). This collection contained hymns by [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]], [[Thomas Kelly (hymnwriter)|Thomas Kelly]] and others; and an appendix was added, chiefly to include a number of hymns by [[Sir Edward Denny, 4th Baronet|Sir Edward Denny]] that had just been written. The four earliest of [[John Nelson Darby]]'s were also inserted. 18 years later (1856) Wigram compiled ''[[Little Flock hymnbook|A Few Hymns and some Spiritual Songs for the Little Flock]]'' to replace the previous collection. This hymnbook was revised by Darby in 1881, [[William Kelly (Bible scholar)|William Kelly]] in 1894 and again by [[T.H. Reynolds]] in 1903.

Wigram also wrote a number of hymns and these include the following
* Well may we sing, with triumph sing
* Oh, what a debt we owe
* The Person of the Christ
* What raised the wondrous thought

==Death==
Wigram died in 1879 at the age of 74 and was buried with his daughter in [[Paddington Cemetery]] by the side of Sir Edward Denny. It has been said that the large concourse of people there sang a hymn in deference to his wish expressed in his lifetime, so that all might understand that he owed all to the sovereign mercy of God. The hymn sung was: "Nothing but mercy'll do for me, / Nothing but mercy – full and free, / Of sinners chief – what but the blood / Could calm my soul, before my God".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall, E.E. (1932/33). [http://www.stempublishing.com/hymns/biographies/wigram.html ''Songs of Pilgrimage and Glory: Notes on the Hymns of Certain Hymn-Writers'']. Central Bible Truth Depot, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Golden Bull of Sicily''' ({{lang-cs|Zlatá bula sicilská}}, {{lang-lat|Bulla Aurea Siciliæ}}) was a decree issued by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[Basel]] on 26 September 1212 that confirmed the royal title obtained by [[Ottokar I of Bohemia]] in 1198, declaring him and his heirs [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Kings of Bohemia]].{{sfn|Merinsky|Meznik|1998|p=51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psp.cz/cgi-bin/eng/docs/guide/bul2.html |title=Guide to the Chamber of Deputies: The Golden Bull of Sicily |work=Parliament of the Czech Republic |accessdate=8 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222004725/http://www.psp.cz/cgi-bin/eng/docs/guide/bul2.html |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The kingship signified the exceptional status of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Ottokar's [[Přemyslid dynasty|Přemyslid]] ancestor [[Vratislaus II of Bohemia|Vratislaus II]] had already been elevated to a Bohemian king by Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] in 1085, in return for his support during the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] revolt and the [[Investiture Controversy]]. He was crowned at [[Prague]] by Archbishop [[Egilbert]] of [[Electorate of Trier|Trier]] the next year, the title however was not hereditary and upon his death in 1092, his brother [[Conrad I, Duke of Bohemia|Conrad I]] succeeded him again as Bohemian duke. In 1158 Vratislaus' grandson [[Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Vladislaus II]] achieved kingship again, bestowed by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]], whom he had accompanied on his Italian campaign against [[Milan]], but failed to secure the succession of his eldest son [[Frederick, Duke of Bohemia|Frederick]].

In September 1198 Frederick's younger half-brother Ottokar I made use of the rivalry among [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]] from the [[House of Welf]] and the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] duke [[Philip of Swabia]], youngest son of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who both had been elected [[King of the Romans]]. He received the hereditary royal title by Philip for his support and, maneuvering between both sides, achieved the acknowledgement by Otto IV as well as by [[Pope Innocent III]]. After the assassination of Philip and the papal [[Excommunication|ban]] imposed on Otto IV in 1210, Ottokar again switched sides, when he and several [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] in 1211 convened at [[Nuremberg]] and elected the young Hohenstaufen scion [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] ''alium imperatorem'' ("Other Emperor"). Frederick, then [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]], left for his coronation in Germany, reaching [[Basel]] in September 1212. Here he issued the Golden Bull that confirmed the kingship of Ottokar I and his heirs in Bohemia.

According to the Golden Bull of Sicily, the estates of Bohemia and [[Moravia]] were an autonomous and undivisible constituent of the Holy Roman Empire. The King of Bohemia was no longer subject to appointment by the Emperor, and was only required to attend [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] diets close to the Bohemian border.  Although a subject of the Holy Roman Empire, the Bohemian king was to be the premier [[Prince-elector]] (''Kurfürst'') of the Empire and to furnish all subsequent Emperors with a bodyguard of 300 knights when they went to Rome for their coronation.  By this act Frederick II also declared that he and the Empire will give the investiture for Bohemia only to a ruler approved by the people of the country.

When in 1346 King [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] united the rule over Bohemia and Germany in his hands, he established the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]], which remained beyond the Empire's suzerainty and were not considered [[Imperial State]]s.

As part of the 800th anniversary of the document's signature, the document was put on public display at the National Archive for four days in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praguemonitor.com/2012/09/25/armoured-vehicle-drives-rare-medieval-bull-prague-exhibition |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140208224045/http://praguemonitor.com/2012/09/25/armoured-vehicle-drives-rare-medieval-bull-prague-exhibition |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 February 2014 |title=Golden Bull of Sicily goes on display at National Archive |work=[[Czech News Agency]] |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=8 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] edited by [[John Alexander Hammerton|John Hammerton]] and published in [[London]], England by [[The Education Book Co. Ltd]] in 1921/22.

Aimed at a middle-income market around the world, the main encyclopaedia is prefaced with a series of "New Horizons" articles penned by 'eminent publicists'. These include
* "Where we Stand" by [[John Galsworthy]]
* "The Nations and the New Era" by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil MP]]
* "Science and the Future" by [[Lord Moulton]]
* "The Aerial Age" by [[Viscount Northcliffe]]
* "Industry and the Future" by [[Lord George Ranken Askwith|Lord Askwith]]
* "The Future of Labour" by [[George Nicoll Barnes]].

== Editions ==
# 1920-22 was initially published as a fortnightly series in 1920-22 and sold twelve million copies throughout the English-speaking world.

The subscriber could have the fortnightly magazines bound into volumes at a bookbinder's shop. There were several binding and decorative options according to how much the subscriber wished to pay:  leather, cloth-covered board or plain board.  The bookbinder marked the page numbers on the spine of each volume.   This means sets are variable in binding and even in the number of volumes.  The following have been noted:

# Nine volumes bound in brown leather (a more expensive binding)
# Nine volumes bound in red board with corrections (a cheaper binding)
# Twelve volumes bound in brown board (a cheaper binding), 23,500 illustrations

=== The ''New Universal Encyclopedia'' ===
* 1949/50 First edition Ten volumes;  John Hammerton was the editor of the first volume, but died a couple of weeks after it was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to the revised ''New Universal Encyclopedia'' edition&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1959 Revised edition Fifteen volumes, published by [[The Caxton Publishing Company Limited]]; revising editor: [[Gordon Stowell]].

The '''Historical Records Survey''' ('''HRS''') was a project of the [[Works Progress Administration]] [[New Deal]] program in the [[United States]]. Originally part of the [[Federal Writers' Project]], it was devoted to surveying and indexing historically significant records in state, county and local [[archive]]s. The official mission statement was the "discovery, preservation, and listing of basic materials for research in the history of the United States."

==Organization==

Organized on November 15, 1935 under the direction of [[Luther H. Evans]] with a budget of $1,195,800, the Survey began life under the [[Federal Writers' Project]]. It became an independent division of [[Federal Project Number One]] in October 1936 within the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s Women's and Professional Division. In 1939, with more artistic federal programs under attack from Congress, partly because they employed suspected Communists, the less controversial HRS was moved to the [[Work Projects Administration]] Research and Records Program, Professional and Service Division.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=C.D.|date=1985|title=Microfilming Activities of the Historical Records Survey, 1935-42|url=|journal=American Archivist|volume=48|pages=45–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was shut down February 1, 1943.

In 1939 the federal government handed off the program's activities to willing state governments; each state had its own supervisor co-ordinating the Survey's activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The HRC, headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], was organized into subdivisions (regional, state, district) and much of the work was done at the behest of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] or state archive agencies. The HRS sometimes cooperated with the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] and other volunteer groups with an interest in local history and genealogy.

The HRS was generally considered the most efficient and inexpensive of the Federal One projects. However, because of the program's short lifespan, many of the indexes were not published and remain in only piecemeal form in local and state record repositories.

==Achievements==

According to Clifton Dale Foster,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|sign=|source=|In most states, several diverse projects were operating simultaneously. Its largest project was the Survey of County Records, which located, identified, arranged, and described massive amounts of public records found in county archives. The result was the publication of some 628 volumes of inventories. Other programs of major importance included the Survey of Federal Archives, directed by Philip M. Hamer; the Survey of Church Records; and the American Imprints Inventory.}}

Other accomplishments included the [[soundex]] indexes for several of the states for several of the late 19th-century [[U.S. Census]]es (1880, 1900, 1910, 1920), indexes of vital statistics, book indexes, bibliographies, cemetery indexes and newspaper indexes, the ''Atlas of Congressional Roll Calls Project'', a historical index of American musicians, surveys of portraits in public buildings, maritime records, a history of grazing, a food history project called ''America Eats'', and a necessary survey of the federal Archives&amp;mdash;NARA itself had been established only in 1934.

The Survey also innovated in archival practice. For example, it made use of new [[Microform|microfilm]] technology, experimented with its use in archiving, and advanced on previously existing practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''How to Cook in Palestine''''' ({{lang-he-n|איך לבשל בארץ ישראל}}, lit. "How to Cook in Eretz Israel") is a 1936 cookbook written by Dr. Erna Meyer and published by the [[Women's International Zionist Organization]] (WIZO),&lt;ref&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1sx2m3bc]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/food/134843/lessons-from-the-first-israeli-cookbook/|title=Lessons From the First Israeli Cookbook|author=Katherine Martinelli|date=January 20, 2011|access-date=May 6, 2017|website=Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely considered the first Jewish cookbook printed in Palestine during the British Mandate.&lt;ref name=Kessler &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/211631/an-early-taste-of-zionism|title= An early taste of Zionism|author=Dana Kessler|website=Tablet Magazine|date= August 31, 2016|access-date=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Falafel Nation|last=Raviv|first=Yael|date=2015|publisher= University of Nebraska Press |isbn=978-0-8032-9017-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book urged immigrant housewives to use local ingredients including eggplant, vegetable marrow, ketchup, and olive oil that were widely available in [[Eretz Israel]]. For example, the book states: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The Palestinian housewife, whose duty is to support home industries, naturally buys [[Tnuva]] butter, but if for reasons of economy she cannot do so, why should the only alternative be to buy foreign butter or margarine when there are such excellent vegetable fats produced locally?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Meyer also encouraged cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking.&lt;ref name=Gur&gt;Gur, ''The Book of New Israeli Food'', pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The book is generally regarded as being influential in the development of a distinctive [[Israeli cuisine]].&lt;ref name=Kessler /&gt;

Hut 7 supplied cryptanalysts and linguists to Bletchley’s front line station the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB) at [[Hong Kong]], then [[Singapore]], then Anderson Station ([[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]], now Sri Lanka), then Allidina School in [[Kilindini]], [[Kenya]] before moving back to Colombo.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Bletchley co-operated with the US Navy Code and Signals Section known as [[OP-20-G]] in [[Washington D.C.]], and with [[FRUMEL]] in [[Melbourne]] (although the reciprocal cooperation from Fabian at FRUMEL was limited and reluctant).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Pre-War origins==
Among the first challenges was overcoming the special [[kana]] and [[romaji]] [[Morse code]] system used by the Japanese.  GC&amp;CS began breaking Japanese diplomatic traffic in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Michael |title=The Emperor's Codes: Bletchley Park and the Breaking of Japan's Secret Ciphers |year=2000 |publisher=[[Bantam Press]] |isbn=0-593-04642-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GC&amp;CS subsequently attacked the Naval Reporting Code, and General Operations Code.

The section was headed by [[William Clarke (cryptographer)|William "Nobby" Clarke]] with Harry Shaw and Ernest Hobart-Hampden.&lt;ref name="FAREAST"&gt;Stripp, Alan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XjNwnBbfkroC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Codebreaker in the Far East''], London, England ; Totowa, NJ : F. Cass, 1989. {{ISBN|0714633631}}.  Cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XjNwnBbfkroC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Ernest+Hobart-Hampden+bletchley+park&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iJXYbOcfj2&amp;sig=WTmeAHLcumpdnVSRoB2mRQbMbfE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a6K8U6_FJImusASIrIGoAg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ernest%20Hobart-Hampden%20bletchley%20park&amp;f=false p.13]&lt;/ref&gt;  These were later joined by [[Eric Nave]], seconded from the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[John Tiltman]], and [[Hugh Foss]].

GC&amp;CS operated the [[Far East Combined Bureau]], the codebreaking and intercept station in [[Hong Kong]] prewar, which during the war moved to [[Singapore]], Colombo and Kilindini.

==WWII expansion==
Potential linguists and cryptographers were recruited from the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Oxford]] by referral through people like the Revd Martin Charlesworth, A.D. Lindsay, Dr [[C. P. Snow]], and Theodore Chaundy. Candidates were interviewed and approved by a board that included Colonel Tiltman.  Successful candidates received a final interview at Bletchley by a senior representative of their section.

At the outset of World War II, Britain had few Japanese linguists and conventional wisdom held that it would require two years to produce qualified linguists for the war effort. In February 1942, an accelerated program was established to train linguists to assist with Japanese signals intelligence.  Candidates were put through an intensive six-month course taught by Captain [[Oswald Tuck]], RN. The course was taught in various locations in Bedford including the Gas Company.  The course produced linguists for the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Foreign Office.  Some of the linguists were sent on to Bletchley, while others were sent to London to work with Captain Malcolm Kennedy.

Later cryptanalysts did not require linguistic training, so could be recruited and put to work directly. Some of these cryptanalysts received a shorter version of the Japanese language course.

The Japanese Naval Section was originally stationed at the Elmer School near Bletchley. By August 1942, the unit consisted of 40 people.  The unit was moved inside Bletchley Park in September and again in February 1943 to Hut 7.  The unit expanded (or moved) later to Block B.

The wooden structure of the hut was demolished sometime between 1948 and 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1534537&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
In addition to code books and manual ciphers, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] also utilized electric cipher machines known as [[JADE (cypher machine)|JADE]] and [[CORAL]] using the same technology as [[Purple (cipher machine)|PURPLE]].  While OP-20-G took the lead on these systems, Bletchley provided some contributions.

In 1921, GC&amp;CS was able to provide insight into the Japanese bargaining position at the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of the nine major powers and limit their ambitions.

Pre-war accomplishments were helped tremendously by the death of [[Emperor Taishō]] in 1926.  The repetition of the formal announcement provided GC&amp;CS with [[Known-plaintext attack|cribs]] into almost every code in use.  Later in 1934, Foss was able to break an early Japanese cipher machine.

Tiltman provided the major break into JN25 in 1939.

In early 1942, decrypts from Anderson gave advance warning of [[Chuichi Nagumo|Vice Admiral Nagumo]]'s [[Indian Ocean raid]] including a planned attack on Colombo.  The warning allowed the British to limit damage, improve opposition, and evacuate the fleet and the cryptanalysts from Colombo to Kilindini.

In May 1945, the team at HMS Anderson successfully broke a message in JN25 that provided details of a supply convoy going from Singapore to the Andaman Islands.  This message provided details that led to the sinking of the [[Japanese cruiser Haguro]] in the [[Battle of the Malacca Strait]].

The '''Index Translationum''' is [[UNESCO]]'s database of book [[translation]]s. Books have been translated for thousands of years, with no central record of the fact. The [[League of Nations]] established a record of [[translation]]s in 1932. In 1946, the [[United Nations]] superseded the League and UNESCO was assigned the Index. In 1979, the records were computerised.

Since the Index counts translations of individual books, authors with many books with few translations can rank higher than authors with a few books with more translations. So, for example, while the [[Bible]] is [[Bible translations|the single most translated book]] in the world, it does not rank in the top ten of the index. The Index counts the [[Walt Disney Company]], employing many writers, as a single writer. Authors with similar names are sometimes included as one entry, for example, the ranking for "Hergé" applies not only to the author of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' ([[Hergé]]), but also to B.R. Hergehahn, Elisabeth Herget, and Douglas Hergert. Hence, the top authors, as the Index presents them, are from a database query whose results require interpretation.

According to the Index, [[Agatha Christie]] remains the [[list of most-translated individual authors|most-translated individual author]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsstatexp.aspx?crit1L=5&amp;nTyp=min&amp;topN=50 |title=Index Translationum - "TOP 50" Author |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) |author=UNESCO Statistics |work=Official website of UNESCO |accessdate=13 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israeli Apartheid Week''' is an annual series of university lectures and rallies. The series is held in February or March. According to the organization, "the aim of IAW is to educate people about the nature of Israel as an apartheid system and to build [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaigns as part of a growing global BDS movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apartheidweek.org/en/about |title=About Israeli Apartheid Week |accessdate=2010-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224200120/http://apartheidweek.org/en/about |archive-date=2009-02-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since IAW began in [[Toronto]] in 2005, it has since spread to at least 55 cities around the world including locations in Australia, Austria, [[Brazil]], [[Botswana]], Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, [[Jordan]], [[South Korea]], [[Malaysia]], Mexico, Norway, [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[South Africa]], the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=1343206 Campuses awash in tension over Israel apartheid week"], ''National Post'', March 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jp2009"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1233050211942&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "Israeli Apartheid Week 2009 may be coming to a campus near you"], ''Jerusalem Post'', January 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2008/02/07/Opinion/How-Did.The.Most.Humane.State.In.History.Become.Demonized-3194623.shtml How did the most humane state in history become demonized? - Opinion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cjn&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14001&amp;Itemid=101 The Canadian Jewish News - Israel Apartheid Week gains momentum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412165651/http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14001&amp;Itemid=101 |date=2009-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishnews.net.au/editorial-april-1-2011/20191 The Australian Jewish News - BDS, bombs and rock ‘n’roll]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=169884 Jerusalem Post] ''"Israeli Apartheid Week" starts today'' (03-03-2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Apartheid Week has garnered much controversy since its inception and has been criticized by some as anti-Semitic.

==Efficacy==
The organizers said the week has "played an important role in raising awareness and disseminating information about [[Zionism]], the Palestinian liberation struggle and its similarities with the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] sovereignty struggle in [[North America]] and the South African [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-Apartheid movement]]." An international [[divestment]] campaign was also said to have gained momentum in response to the 2005 statement by over 170 Palestinian [[civil society]] organizations who called for boycotts, divestments and sanctions. They also claimed that important gains had been made in the campaign in countries like South Africa, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.

The years preceding 2008, a significant year in that it marked the 60th anniversary of the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|establishment of the state of Israel]], had seen a sharp increase of literature and analysis that was said to have sought to document and challenge alleged Israeli apartheid, including reports issued by major international bodies and [[human rights]] organizations and findings published by political leaders, thinkers, academics, and [[activism|activists]]. The efforts were also said to have highlighted the role that people and governments across the world could play in providing "solidarity with the Palestinian struggle by exerting urgent pressure on Israel to alter its current structure and practices as an [[apartheid]] state."&lt;ref name="iaw"&gt;http://www.apartheidweek.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable demonstrations and speakers==
In 2012, the Palestine Society of the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) erected a mock "Israeli Apartheid Wall," which led to a confrontation after Pro-Israel students threw waterballoons at the mock wall in protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/63847/students-clash-israel-apartheid-week Students clash at Israel Apartheid Week] by Marcus Dysch ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'', February 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/153028#.Uwfit5uYZO0 'Apartheid' Week: Mock Check Points and Water Balloons] by Rachel Hirshfeld, ''[[Arutz Sheva]]'', February 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Harvard University]]'s Palestine Solidarity Committee, which organizes Israeli Apartheid Week at Harvard University, posted mock eviction notices on students' dorm room doors.&lt;ref name=evictionflyer&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/5/palestine-eviction-flyer-debate/ Mock Eviction Flyers Incite Debate] by Anneli L.

U.S. scholar and [[MIT]] professor [[Noam Chomsky]] has spoken various times at many university campuses as part of Israeli Apartheid Week.&lt;ref name=evictionflyer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailyfreepress.com/2010/03/02/chomsky-joins-israel-apartheid-debate/ Chomsky joins Israel ‘apartheid’ debate] by Saba Hamedy, ''[[Daily Free Press]]'', March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben White, a freelance journalist and author of two books on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], has also been active speaker during Israeli Apartheid Week both in the United States and the United Kingdom including his alma mater [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="benwhite.org.uk"&gt;http://benwhite.org.uk/events/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="benwhite.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/israel-international/Israeli-Apartheid-Week-Year-by-Year-Report.pdf Israeli Apartheid Week: A Year-by-Year Report], [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the conference and its activities==

===Support===
{{Expand section|date=November 2008}}
Israeli Apartheid Week events are almost always hosted by solidarity societies and organizations associated with [[academic institutions]]. Speakers at the various meetings around the world support the goals of the Week. An Arab citizen of Israel and Member of the [[Knesset]], [[Jamal Zahalka]], spoke in Montréal in 2007. He said: "Calling the occupation apartheid isn’t an overstatement, it’s an understatement. The Israeli occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are worse than apartheid.&lt;ref name="ynetnews"&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3362888,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wits Graffiti Wall Pro Palestine Message.jpg|thumb|left|Pro-Palestine mural on a graffiti wall at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa.]]

In 2014, South Africa's ruling party, the [[African National Congress]], officially endorsed the Israeli Apartheid Week. The ANC, which led the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, said participating in this year's Apartheid Week was part of its commitment to the international anti-apartheid movement and that it remains “unequivocal in its support for the Palestinian people in their struggle for self-determination, and unapologetic in its view that the Palestinians are the victims and the oppressed in the conflict with Israel."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/178039#.UxXta2R_tFd&lt;/ref&gt;

According to IAW organizers, there has been "a sharp increase of literature and analysis that has sought to document and challenge Israeli apartheid, including reports issued by major international bodies and human rights organizations and findings published by political leaders, thinkers, academics, and activists."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/south-african-ruling-party-endorses-israeli-apartheid-week/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction by university administration===
The University of Toronto president, [[David Naylor]], said of the week featuring the events "this isn’t [my] favourite time of year." However, Dr. Naylor responded to objections from the ''Friends of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] for [[Holocaust]] Studies'', in signing a statement that declared, "We do, in fact, recognize that the term Israeli Apartheid is upsetting to many people, [but] we also recognize that, in every society, universities have a unique role to provide a safe venue for highly charged discourse."&lt;ref name="nationalpost"&gt;http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2008/02/14/barbara-kay-on-israeli-apartheid-week.aspx {{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Manitoba]] President David Barnard, in a report to the Board of Governors regarding Israeli Apartheid Week in 2010, that "while he had not personally attended any of the events, the events proceeded as anticipated and were orderly. He added that he had received a lot of communication from the external community regarding this, and that while there were a number of people against the event, there was also support for the University's position in allowing the event to proceed."&lt;ref name="universityofmanitoba"&gt;http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/media/bog-open-apr2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Barnard responded publicly to complaints about IAW, saying "Ultimately, we have an obligation to uphold the right to freedom of expression, and will not censor an individual or group for what has not yet been expressed."&lt;ref name="Winnipeg Free Press"&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/letters_to_the_editor/well-not-censor-what-hasnt-been-said-117787708.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, UC Berkeley spokesperson, Dan Mogulof, stated that the campus agreed to consider clarifying its demonstration policies but would not curtail student speech. The Office for Civil Rights and a federal judge declared that the "university has no right or ability to trample on the constitutional rights of students."&lt;ref name="dailycal.org"&gt;http://www.dailycal.org/2013/08/29/office-of-civil-rights-dismisses-anti-semitism-complaint/&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. investigation===
Two Berkeley students filed charges in July 2012 that the annual apartheid week events on campus has led to more anti-semitism on campus. Federal officials, in 2013, dismissed the claim stating that "the events did not constitute actionable harassment." A UC spokesperson added, criticism of Israel is not necessarily anti-Semitic.&lt;ref name="dailycal.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/10/anti-semitism-claims-uc-berkeley.html Feds investigate claims of anti-Semitism at UC Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
In 2007 the event spread to [[New York University]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Hunter College]] in New York City. [[The David Project]], organized meetings the same week in opposition to the characterization of Israel as an apartheid state, and the [[American Jewish Committee]] Koppelman Institute on American Jewish-Israeli Relations denounced the apartheid week saying "the specter of apartheid should not be raised in any form."&lt;ref name=sun&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/48542 Israel Apartheid Week' Begins, Reigniting Carter-Led Debate] by Gabrielle Birkner, ''[[New York Sun]]'' February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Israel's ambassador to Canada, [[Alan Baker (diplomat)|Alan Baker]], denounced Israeli Apartheid Week as "crude propagandism, pure hypocrisy and cynical manipulation of the student body."&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=33fde202-2d1b-4a6a-b947-809d83ac97d8 Israeli ambassador condemns students for 'celebration of ignorance'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310172135/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=33fde202-2d1b-4a6a-b947-809d83ac97d8 |date=2010-03-10}}, ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers of the counter protest stated that they "want to remove the connection that modern-day students have to the word apartheid and Israel and refocus it to the countries that we think really exemplify the definition of apartheid, being a policy of separation and segregation. Through a week which encompasses the themes of gender, sexual and political apartheid, we hope to get out a new message."&lt;ref name=cjn /&gt;

In February 2010, 30 members of the Ontario Provincial legislature of Ontario voted to condemn IAW as being "odious, hateful and inappropriate." The largely symbolic vote received support from all three of Ontario's political parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2010/02/25/mpps_unite_to_condemn_odious_israeli_apartheid_week.html MPPs unite to condemn “odious” Israeli Apartheid Week] by Robert Benzie, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mitch-wolfe/olivia-chow-israel_b_4694875.html Where Does Olivia Chow Stand on Israel?] by Mitch Wolfe, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', February 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay columnist and pornographic film producer [[Michael Lucas (director)|Michael Lucas]] has called Israel Apartheid Week "a hate group" and "a group of antisemites." In February 2011 he brought about the cancellation of a planned event involving New York's [[LGBT]] Center and Israel Apartheid Week after threatening to organize a boycott of large donors to the center. He said of his achievement that it was a landmark moment in his life, of which he was enormously proud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NY gay center pulls plug on Israel-Apartheid event|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=209714|accessdate=19 March 2011|newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=24 February 2011|author=Gil Shefler|author2=Benjamin Weinthal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In advance of the 2011 IAW, the government of Israel chose a group of Israelis, including Arabs, [[gays]], [[Ethiopian Jews]] and an [[MTV]] "VJ" (presenter) to oppose the apartheid analogy used by going on a speaking tour of the United States;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?ID=209458&amp;R=R1 Arabs, gays and an MTV VJ to fight apartheid analogy]&lt;/ref&gt; an additional group went to Britain "to combat anti-Israel messages students there are receiving from Israel Apartheid Week activities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=212518&amp;R=R2 Israeli students embark on ‘hasbara’ journey to UK campuses] by Joshua Hamerman, ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2011, Historian [[Catherine D. Chatterley|Catherine Chatterley]] wrote an editorial for the ''National Post'' outlining the history of Israel Apartheid Week and its relationship to the BDS movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chatterley|first=Catherine|title=A History of Israeli Apartheid Week|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/03/03/catherine-chatterley-a-history-of-israeli-apartheid-week/|accessdate=February 15, 2012|newspaper=National Post|date=March 3, 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709063703/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/03/03/catherine-chatterley-a-history-of-israeli-apartheid-week/|archive-date=July 9, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same month, various Canadian government and other political figures, including Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], Immigration Minister [[Jason Kenney]] and Liberal Leader [[Michael Ignatieff]] all criticized IAW. Kenney indicated that he was "deeply concerned about the events and activities" associated with IAW and said that the event was "all too often [...] accompanied by anti-Semitic harassment, intimidation and bullying." He further indicated that students participating IAW were "free [...] to speak their mind" but encouraged them to "reflect on whether these activities are beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/statements/2011/2011-03-11.asp Minister Kenney issues statement on ‘Israeli Apartheid Week’], Citizenship and Immigration Canada, March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ignatieff, in condemning the week, said it is a “dangerous cocktail of ignorance and intolerance” that threatens “the mutual respect” of Canadian society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/news/Ottawa%20slams%20Israeli%20Apartheid%20Week/4427045/story.html Ottawa slams Israeli Apartheid Week]{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} by Sarah Boesveld, ''[[National Post]]'', March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenney has also accused the organizers of IAW of using "the cover of academic freedom to demonize and de-legitimize the state of Israel. This week is nothing more than an unbalanced attempt to paint Israel and her supporters as racist. I call on all Canadians to reject anti-Semitism and all forms of racism, discrimination and intolerance." Conservative MP [[David Anderson (Saskatchewan politician)|David Anderson]] has stated that labelling Israel as an apartheid state is "abhorrent," and interim Liberal leader [[Bob Rae]] said the campaign "continues to defy logic. This year the focus continues to be on Israel, rather than on the appalling massacres and human rights violations that have reached intolerable heights in countries such as Syria and Iran."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120415034856/http://www.canada.com/Israeli%2BApartheid%2BWeek%2Bdemonizes%2BJewish%2Bstate%2Bsays%2BKenney/6267567/story.html Israeli Apartheid Week `demonizes' Jewish state, says Kenney] by Lee Berthiaume, ''[[Postmedia News]]'', March 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, 16 African-American members of the Vanguard Leadership Group published full page ads in several U.S. university newspapers, with an "Open Letter to Students for Justice in Palestine" saying that the SJP's use of the word "apartheid" in regards to Israel and Israel Apartheid Week "is not only false, but offensive."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=215811 Black student leaders slam 'apartheid' characterization] by Jordana Horn, ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', April 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart Appelbaum, gay president of the [[Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union]] feels that those groups opposing the New York [[LGBT]] Center’s decision to prohibit an Israel Apartheid Week March 2011 event were intellectually dishonest, saying "This was not a question of free speech. This was hate speech. The center should not be used as a venue for racism, Islamophobia or anti-Semitism. Nor did they even care about free speech. The same groups have consistently sought to ban and prevent supporters of Israel from expressing their views."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?ID=213963&amp;R=R1 Gay opposition rises against Israel Apartheid Week] by Benjamin Weinthal, ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', March 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 the Public Diplomacy Ministry of Israel created the "Faces of Israel" mission to the United States, Canada, Ireland, Spain, Great Britain, and South Africa, comprising 100 Israelis including "settlers, Arabs, artists, experts in national security, gay people, and immigrants from Ethiopia" and actor [[Aki Avni]], in order to "represent and defend the state during Israel Apartheid Week."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?ID=258409&amp;R=R1 100 envoys to fight Israel Apartheid Week on campuses] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219154538/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=258409 |date=2012-02-19 }} By Lahav Harkov, ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', February 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302102138/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/0229/1224312525233.html Young Israelis on mission to improve their country's image] by Alison Healy, ''[[Irish Times]]'', February 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, [[Jonathan Kay]] sharply criticized IAW in the ''[[National Post]]'', stating that "In Syria, the Assad regime continues to rain artillery on rebel positions in the city of Homs, killing journalists and innocent civilians alike. Iran's mullahs are set to execute a Canadian citizen for the crime of operating a website they don't like. The new Libyan regime is torturing Gaddafi loyalists. And Egypt's rulers are prosecuting NGO leaders on trumped up charges. And so next week, Canadian left-wing activists will congregate in Toronto to express their hatred of ... you guessed it: Israel." In the same article, Kay commented that not all IAW activists "seek the outright destruction of Israel—[but] many certainly do. Some are merely naïve undergraduates. ... But all of them should understand that IAW and BDS are not what they seem: As some of Israel's own fiercest critics themselves now admit, these are dishonest cults meant to enlist ill-informed activists in a campaign to destroy the Jewish state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/02/25/jonathan-kay-the-return-of-the-israel-apartheid-week-cult/ Jonathan Kay: The return of the Israel Apartheid Week cult] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411110247/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/02/25/jonathan-kay-the-return-of-the-israel-apartheid-week-cult/ |date=2013-04-11}} by [[Jonathan Kay]], ''[[National Post]]'', February 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the University of Manitoba Students' Union (UMSU) in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, Canada, became the first student government in the world to remove Students Against Israeli Apartheid's student group status and ban it from using student union spaces. The council passed the motion banning the group after hearing evidence that Students Against Israel Apartheid and its "Israel Apartheid Week" violated student union policies by "undermining the dignity and self esteem of students on campus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/04/12/university-of-manitoba-students-union-students-against-israeli-apartheid/ University of Manitoba Students Union Ignores Legal Advice, Votes to Strip Anti-Israel Group of Official Club Status] by [[Tristen Hopper]], ''[[National Post]]'', April 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freddie Joe "Jack" Brisco''' (September 21, 1941 – February 1, 2010) was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He performed for various [[List of NWA territories|territories]] of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), becoming a two-time [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]], and multi-time [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|NWA Tag Team Champion]] with his brother [[Gerald Brisco]]. Brisco is considered one of the top wrestlers of his era; in 2005, [[Don Leo Jonathan]] called him "probably the greatest champion of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

In the late 1970s, the Brisco brothers discovered [[Hulk Hogan|Terry Bollea]], the future wrestling legend best known as Hulk Hogan, whom they introduced to [[Hiro Matsuda]] for training.

==Amateur wrestling career==
Brisco was raised in [[Blackwell, Oklahoma]] with five siblings.&lt;ref name=NWAstory&gt;{{cite book|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|pages=323–326|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up as a fan of professional wrestling, and particularly a fan of NWA World Champion [[Lou Thesz]]&lt;ref name=won/&gt; He was followed by his younger brother, [[Gerald Brisco]], into sport wrestling and turned down a football scholarship at [[University of Oklahoma]] to go to [[Oklahoma State]]. In 1965, he became the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] to win an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA Wrestling]] [[NCAA Wrestling Team Championship|National Championship]]. He won it during his junior year, and wasn't taken down once during the entire season.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early years (1965–1969)===
Brisco's first documented professional wrestling championship reign began on October 16, 1965, when he defeated [[Don Kent (wrestler)|Don Kent]] to win the NWA Missouri Junior Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name=mojr/&gt; He held the belt for less than a month, and regained it in November by defeating Kent again.&lt;ref name=mojr/&gt; Around this time, Brisco also wrestled for [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|NWA Tri-State]]. While there, he won a couple of state titles (the Oklahoma Heavyweight Championship and the Arkansas Heavyweight Championship).&lt;ref name=ok/&gt;&lt;ref name=ark/&gt; He also won his first tag team title in this promotion, teaming with [[William Calhoun|Haystacks Calhoun]] for his first reign as co-holder of the Tri-State version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref name=tritag/&gt; He later held the title again, as he teamed with Gorgeous George, Jr. to win the belts on May 9, 1967.&lt;ref name=tritag/&gt;

===National Wrestling Alliance (1969–1984)===
====Championship Wrestling from Florida (1969–1972)====
Brisco then moved to the Florida area, where he wrestled for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] for several years. His first title there was the [[NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship]], which he won on February 11, 1969 by defeating [[Larry Hamilton|The Missouri Mauler]].&lt;ref name=flshw/&gt; He [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] the title to the Mauler and regained it on July 8.&lt;ref name=flshw/&gt; Two weeks later, he won the first of an eventual ten [[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship]]s, with [[Ciclon Negro]].&lt;ref name=fltag/&gt; Although he and Negro dropped the tag team belts the following month, Brisco held the Southern Heavyweight Title until November 1969, when he left the area to wrestle in Japan and Australia.&lt;ref name=flshw/&gt;

When Brisco returned to Florida, he began teaming with his brother, who he had trained in professional wrestling. He also continued competing as a singles wrestler, winning the [[NWA Florida Television Championship]] on November 27, 1970.&lt;ref name=fltel/&gt; On February 16, 1971, the Briscos teamed up to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref name=fltag/&gt; They dropped the belts the next month to [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] and [[Terry Funk]] and regained them from the Funks in April.&lt;ref name=fltag/&gt; That month, Brisco also beat Terry Funk in a singles match to win the NWA Florida Television Championship again.&lt;ref name=fltel/&gt; Brisco's next major success was regaining the Southern Heavyweight Championship from [[Dick Murdoch]] on June 8, 1971.&lt;ref name=flshw/&gt; The title was later held up after a controversial rematch with Murdoch.&lt;ref name=flshw/&gt;

Brisco then took a short break from Florida wrestling to work for [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]]. While there, he won the [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship|NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Championship]] twice by defeating The Missouri Mauler and Rip Hawk.&lt;ref name=east/&gt;

Upon his return to Florida, he quickly won the [[NWA Florida Brass Knuckles Championship]] from [[Paul Jones (wrestler)|Paul Jones]] on June 13, 1972, and vacated it the same day.&lt;ref name=brass/&gt; He then won his third and final Television Championship on November 7, 1972.&lt;ref name=fltel/&gt; Nine days later, he won the Tag Team Championship, again with his brother.&lt;ref name=fltag/&gt;

==== NWA World Heavyweight Champion (1973–1975)====
Brisco's first [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] win was scheduled to be over [[Dory Funk Jr.]], capping off a multi-year feud. However, Dory claimed to be injured in a truck accident and missed the scheduled date. Brisco and [[Terry Funk]] were sent out to make the bookings that were already scheduled for Brisco, and Dory later lost the title to [[Harley Race]]. Brisco and several others within the NWA power structure always questioned the legitimacy of the accident, claiming Dory Funk Sr. did not want his son to lose to a "pure" wrestler and harm his credibility&lt;ref name=won&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|title=A Definitive Look At Jack Brisco; his life and times|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brisco won the title from Race after a brief reign, in [[Houston, Texas]] on July 20, 1973.&lt;ref name=nwaworld/&gt; He defended the championship in NWA-affiliated promotions across the world facing top names like Johnny Valentine, Stan Stasiak, Abdullah The Butcher, Gene Kiniski, The Sheik and Bobby Shane until losing to [[Giant Baba]] on December 4, 1974. He regained it four days later.&lt;ref name=nwaworld/&gt; Brisco then defended the title until losing it to [[Terry Funk]] on December 10, 1975.  His loss continued the extensive [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between the Briscos and Funks,&lt;ref name=nwaworld/&gt; which went on for several more years.&lt;ref name=won/&gt; During his initial reign as champion, Brisco toured Australia where he successfully defended his title against local favorite, Spiros Arion. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianwrestling.org/index.php/profiles/22-men/240-jack-brisco&lt;/ref&gt;

====Various territories (1976–1977)====
In 1976, Brisco wrestled in several promotions and continued to add to his list of titles. He won the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] version of the [[AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship|NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship]] on August 10, 1976, by defeating local favorite [[Jerry Lawler]].&lt;ref name=nwamemphis/&gt; He won the [[NWA Missouri Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Bob Backlund]] on November 26.&lt;ref name=mo/&gt; At this time, the Briscos were also awarded the [[ESA International Tag Team Championship]], although they did not wrestle as a team in the area.&lt;ref name=esa/&gt;

====Return to CWF (1977–1978)====
Wrestling in Florida again, Brisco teamed with his brother to win several more championships. In 1977, they defeated [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] and [[Bob Roop]] for the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref name=fltag/&gt; They lost the title to [[Ox Baker]] and [[Superstar Billy Graham]] and soon regained it in a rematch.&lt;ref name=fltag/&gt; On January 25, 1978, they won the belts again by defeating [[Ivan Koloff]] and [[Masa Saito|Mr. Saito]].&lt;ref name=fltag/&gt; While holding these belts, they also won the [[NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship]] on February 21, from [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]] and [[Steve Keirn]].&lt;ref name=flustag/&gt; They dropped the United States tag belts back to Graham and Keirn but soon regained them.&lt;ref name=flustag/&gt; They were defeated for the United States title by [[Herb Gerwig|Killer Karl Kox]] and [[Bobby Duncum, Sr.|Bobby Duncum]], and were again successful in regaining it in a rematch.&lt;ref name=flustag/&gt; The same thing happened when the Briscos faced Mr. Saito and [[Great Kabuki|Mr. Sato]] that year: they lost the belts and quickly won them back.&lt;ref name=flustag/&gt; The Briscos also defeated Saito and Sato to regain the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref name=fltag/&gt; The following year, another victory over Saito and Sato earned the Briscos their final United States Tag Team Championship reign.&lt;ref name=flustag/&gt;

====Georgia Championship Wrestling (1978–1980)====
The Briscos also had success in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], where they won the [[NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship]] twice. They competed in a tournament for the tag team belts and finished in second place after a loss to the Funks.&lt;ref name=gatag/&gt; They defeated the Funks for the belts two months later.&lt;ref name=gatag/&gt; On November 25, 1979, the Briscos defeated [[Austin Idol]] and [[Bill Eadie|The Masked Superstar]] to win the belts a second time.&lt;ref name=gatag/&gt; Jack gave up his share of the title, however, to [[Ole Anderson]].&lt;ref name=gatag/&gt; Later that year, Brisco became the first [[NWA National Heavyweight Championship|NWA National Heavyweight Champion]] by defeating Terry Funk in a tournament final.&lt;ref name=nwanat/&gt;

====Second return to CWF (1980–1982)====
In 1980, Brisco resumed wrestling in Florida. He won the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship again, teaming with [[Jimmy Garvin]] this time.&lt;ref name=fltag/&gt; After losing the belts, Brisco teamed with his brother to win them for a final time.&lt;ref name=fltag/&gt;

In 1981, Brisco won his final Southern Heavyweight Championship by defeating [[Bobby Jaggers]].&lt;ref name=flshw/&gt; He finished his time in Florida with two reigns as co-holder of Florida's version of the [[NWA North American Tag Team Championship]]. He and his brother won a tournament to win their first title, defeating Assassin #1 and Bobby Jaggers in the finals.&lt;ref name=namtagfl/&gt; They lost the belts to the Funks on January 9, 1982, and regained them in a rematch one week later.&lt;ref name=namtagfl/&gt;

====Puerto Rico and Mid-Atlantic (1981–1985)====
Brisco also wrestled in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1981, for the [[World Wrestling Council]]. He won the [[WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship]] on May 30, and held it for almost seven months.&lt;ref name=carib/&gt; He teamed with his brother to win the [[WWC North American Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Bushwhackers|Los Pastores]] (better known as The Bushwhackers) on August 8, holding it for six weeks before dropping it to [[The Fabulous Kangaroos]].&lt;ref name=wwctag/&gt; Brisco also returned to Missouri in 1981, defeating [[Ted DiBiase]] to win a second NWA Missouri Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref name=mo/&gt; He held the belt for three weeks before losing it to [[Ken Patera]].&lt;ref name=mo/&gt;

In 1982, Brisco returned to Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. He regained the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship (formerly called the NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Championship) by defeating [[Roddy Piper]] on May 10, 1982.&lt;ref name=midatl/&gt; He dropped the title back to Piper on July 7 and regained it in August.&lt;ref name=midatl/&gt; After his matches with Piper, Brisco traded the title back and forth with Paul Jones several times. He lost the belt to Jones on September 1 and won it back on October 18.&lt;ref name=midatl/&gt; Jones won the belt again a week later, and dropped it back to Brisco in November.&lt;ref name=midatl/&gt;

Brisco teamed with his brother to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|Mid-Atlantic version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship]] three times. As heels, they beat [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Jay Youngblood]] for the belts on June 18, 1983.&lt;ref name=midatltag/&gt; This set up a rivalry in which the belts switched hands several times. Steamboat and Youngblood regained the belts on October 3, but the Briscos won them back on October 21.&lt;ref name=midatltag/&gt; They held the title for a little over a month before dropping it back to Steamboat and Youngblood.&lt;ref name=midatltag/&gt; The Briscos again won the belts the following year, from [[Wahoo McDaniel]] and [[Mark Youngblood]].&lt;ref name=midatltag/&gt; In 1985 he fought Ric Flair for the NWA championship in Toronto.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1984–2009)===
The Briscos acquired minority interests in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] and, in 1984, convinced a majority (52%) of the shareholders to sell their shares to [[Vince McMahon]], enabling him to increase his dominance of the professional wrestling world. The popular story that the Briscos were offered lifetime jobs with the WWF in exchange for selling their interests in Georgia Championship Wrestling was refuted by Jack Brisco in a 1996 interview for Wrestling Perspective.&lt;ref&gt;http://wrestlingperspective.com/issue/60/brisco.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, 1984, the Briscos challenged The North-South Connection ([[Adrian Adonis]] and [[Dick Murdoch]]) for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]] in [[Madison Square Garden]]. The match ended in a double countout, and was Jack Brisco's last high-profile bout.

Jack left the business entirely in February 1985,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cagematch.de/?id=2&amp;nr=843&amp;page=4&lt;/ref&gt; while Jerry transitioned to a behind the scenes-role with the WWF/WWE which he kept until retiring in 2009 due to health problems.

==Post retirement and death==
Brisco was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=pwhof/&gt; Brisco lived in [[Florida]] where he ran the ''Brisco Brothers Body Shop'' with brothers Gerald and Bill for over 30 years.&lt;ref name=NWAstory/&gt; He has also made occasional wrestling appearances such as Florida's ''Wrestle Reunion'' in January 2005.&lt;ref name=slagle&gt;{{cite web|last=Slagle|first=Steve|title=Jack Brisco|work=Professional Wrestling Online Museum|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/halloffame/briscobio.html|accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brisco is considered one of the great legendary wrestlers of the 1970s and has often been cited as such by [[Ric Flair]] during his emotional [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promos]]. Brisco and his brother, Gerald were inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] Class of 2008.

Over the final few years of his life Jack suffered from bouts of pneumonia and back problems. He had been a heavy smoker. On February 1, 2010, Brisco died at the age of 68 from [[complication (medicine)|complication]]s of [[open heart surgery]].&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2010/02/01/12695426.html|title=Jack Brisco dead at 68|author=Oliver, Greg|work=Slam!

The '''Kindler Literature encyclopedia''' (in German: Das Kindler Literatur Lexikon) is an [[encyclopedia]] released in Germany covering information about [[world literature]]. Its first edition was released from 1965 to 1972 (7 volumes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derkindler.de/benutzungshinweise/vorwort-kindler-2009/|title=Vorwort Kindler 2009 - derkindlers Webseite!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its second and third edition were distributed from 1988–1992 (20 volumes) and in 2009 (18 volumes).&lt;ref&gt;
https://www.welt.de/kultur/article4830514/Kindlers-Literatur-Lexikon-schlaegt-locker-Wikipedia.html
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 a CD-ROM version was released.

For the first release the publisher Helmut Kindler started to translate articles from the Italian encyclopedia "Dizionario Letterario Bompiani". Additionally Kindler hired a crew to wrote articles on their own. As the first edition started as a translation, its primary focus was romanesque literature. With the second edition the former translations were to be rewritten. After a lot of nation building in between the 2. and 3. edition, some countries literature were merged (e.g. Russia and Ukraine).

In 2009 the German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' called the Kindler superior to Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article4830514/Kindlers-Literatur-Lexikon-schlaegt-locker-Wikipedia.html|title=Kindlers Literatur-Lexikon schlägt locker Wikipedia: Nachschlagewerk - WELT|website=DIE WELT|access-date=2017-01-22}}
&lt;/ref&gt; From all the articles in the 2009 edition, the half was newly rewritten. An Online version went live at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.literaturblatt.de/heftarchiv/heftarchiv-2009/52009-inhaltsverzeichnis-der-gedruckten-ausgabe/mit-18-baenden-um-die-welt-das-neue-kindlers-literatur-lexikon.html|title=literaturblatt: Mit 18 Bänden um die Welt – das neue Kindlers Literatur Lexikon|last=|first=|date=|website=www.literaturblatt.de|publisher=|language=de|access-date=2017-01-22}}

The '''Liberian Declaration of Independence''' is a document adopted by the [[Liberian Constitutional Convention]] on July 16, 1847 to announce that the [[Commonwealth of Liberia]], a colony founded and controlled by the private [[American Colonization Society]], was now an independent state known as the [[Republic of Liberia]]. The Declaration was written by [[Hilary Teague]] and adopted simultaneously with the first [[Liberian Constitution of 1847|Constitution of Liberia]]. The anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration and accompanying Constitution is celebrated as Independence Day in Liberia.

The Declaration articulates the history of the [[Americo-Liberians]] that settled the Commonwealth and sets out the aspiration of Liberia to be accepted as a free and independent state within the "comity which marks the friendly intercourse of civilized and independent communities." Listing the injustices committed against [[African Americans]] as a result of [[slavery in the United States]], the Declaration notes the foundation of the colony by the American Colonization Society, as well as their gradual withdrawal from governance in favor of increasing self-governance by the immigrated colonists. The noted goal of Liberia is declared to be both to establish a state built upon the structure and principles of the [[law of nations]] and the [[Christianization]] and modernization of the indigenous peoples of the region.

The Declaration partially relied upon the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], in particular its discussion of [[natural law]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We recognize in all men certain inalienable rights; among these are life, liberty, and the right to acquire, possess, enjoy, and defend property.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, its listing of injustices perpetrated by the [[United States]] parallels the charges set forth in the United States Declaration of Independence against [[King George III]]. However, the Liberian Declaration asserts no [[right of revolution]], but instead frames its independence as the inevitable and planned purpose of the colony by the American Colonization Society. The Society, having surrendered all control of the colony in January 1846, had fully encouraged the independence of Liberia. The [[Commonwealth of Liberia]] declared its independence from the American Colonization Society on July 26, 1847 as the [[Republic of Liberia]] and Liberia became the first African nation on the African continent to gain its independence. On January 3, 1848 [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]] an African-American from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[United States of America]], he was elected and became Liberia's first [[Black American]] president.

The Liberian constitution and flag was modeled after the [[Constitution of United States]] and the [[American flag]] because Liberia was the only African nation on the African continent that was a colony for the [[United States]] and Liberia was founded, colonized, established and controlled by freed American slaves and ex-caribbean slaves as settlers from the [[United States]] and the Caribbean islands with the help and support from the American Colonization Society, a private organization establishment.

On February 5, 1862 the [[United States]] finally accepted and recognized Liberia's Independence. From January 7, 1822 until the Liberian Declaration of Independence from the [[American Colonization Society]], Liberia was the only African nation that was a colony for the [[United States]] and a [[protectorate]]. With the backing and support from the [[United States]] Liberia kept its independence during the colonial era. Liberia was never colonized or controlled by European powers making [[Liberia]] Africa's oldest republic nation on the African continent.

==Signatories==
Twelve delegates representing the three counties of Liberia signed the Declaration along with the Constitution of Liberia:

The '''Stone cross in the memory of the people killed by Bolsheviks''' ({{lang-ro|Crucea de piatră de la Rezeni în memoria celor omorâţi de bolşevici}}) is a [[monument]] in [[Răzeni]], [[Moldova]].

==Overview==
The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the [[Răzeni Massacre]]. The massacre took place on June 22, 1941, in [[Răzeni]], when 10 people were killed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities and buried in a [[mass grave]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumitru Lazur, Omorâţi mișelește de bolșevici comuniști, [[Curierul Ortodox]], nr 6 (191), 15 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial was opened on February 21, 2009; Moldovian [[politician]] [[Alexandru Tănase]] was present. 

In 1941 after [[Operation Barbarossa]],  when the area came under the control of the pro-[[Nazi]] [[Ion Antonescu|Antonescu]] regime, a commemorative plaque was installed in Răzeni: "Aici odihnesc robii lui Dumnezeu Diomid, Niculai, Dănila, Nichita, Alexandru, Jurian, Alexandru, Ilie, doi necunoscuţi. Omorâţi mișelește de bolșevici comuniști. 12.VII.1941".&lt;ref&gt;Dumitru Lazur, Omorâţi mișelește de bolșevici comuniști, [[Curierul Ortodox]], nr 6 (191), 15 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mulatto''' ({{IPAc-en|m|j|uː|ˈ|l|æ|t|oʊ}}) is a term used to refer to people born of one [[white people|white]] parent and one [[black people|black]] parent, or from two mulatto parents. In English usage, the term is today generally confined to historical contexts; modern English speakers of mixed white and black ancestry seldom choose to identify themselves as mulatto.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Retrato de Juan Pareja, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumb|''[[Juan de Pareja]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]], 1650]]

The English term "mulatto" is derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mulato''. The origin of ''mulato'' is uncertain.

The term may derive from ''mula'' (current Portuguese word, from the [[Latin]] ''mūlus''), meaning [[mule]], the [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring of a [[horse]] and a [[donkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |encyclopedia=Robert K. Barnhart |page=684 |publisher=Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd. |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|mulatto|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Real Academia Española]] traces its origin to ''mulo'' in the sense of hybridity; originally used to refer to any [[mestizaje|mixed race]] person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mulato|url=http://dle.rae.es/srv/fetch?id=Q2jb9eE|publisher=Real Academia Española|accessdate=14 June 2017|quote=De mulo, en el sentido de híbrido, aplicado primero a cualquier mestizo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dictionaries and scholarly works trace the word's origins to the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term ''[[muwallad]]'', which means "a person of mixed ancestry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack D. Forbes|title=Africans and Native Americans: the language of race and the evolution of Red-Black peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC|year=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06321-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC&amp;pg=PA145 145]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Muwallad'' literally means "born, begotten, produced, generated; brought up", with the implication of being born and raised among Arabs, but not of Arab blood. ''Muwallad'' is derived from the [[Semitic root|root word]] ''WaLaD'' (Arabic: ولد direct Arabic [[transliteration]]: ''waw, lam, dal''), and [[Varieties of Arabic|colloquial Arabic]] pronunciation can vary greatly. ''Walad'' means, "descendant, offspring, scion; child; son; boy; young animal, young one".

In [[al-Andalus]], ''Muwallad'' referred to the offspring of non-Arab/Muslim people who adopted the Islamic religion and manners. Specifically, the term was historically applied to the descendants of indigenous Christian Iberians who, after several generations of living among a Muslim majority, adopted their culture and religion. Notable examples of this category include the famous Muslim scholar [[Ibn Hazm]]. According to [[Lisan al-Arab]], one of the earliest Arab dictionaries (c. 13th century AD), applied the term to the children of Non-Muslim (often Christian) slaves, or Non-Muslim children who were captured in a war and were raised by Muslims to follow their religion and culture. Thus, in this context, the term "Muwalad" has a meaning close to "the adopted". According to the same source, the term does not denote being of mixed-race but rather being of foreign-blood and local culture.

In English, printed usage of ''mulatto'' dates to at least the 16th century. The 1595 work ''Drake's Voyages'' first used the term in the context of intimate unions producing biracial children, with the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defining mulatto here as "one who is the offspring of a European and a Black". This earliest usage regarded "black" and "white" as discrete "species", with the "mulatto" constituting a third separate "species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=David S. Goldstein|editor2=Audrey B. Thacker|title=Complicating Constructions: Race, Ethnicity, and Hybridity in American Texts|date=2007|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=0295800747|page=77|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=9qxlZj8oRrcC&amp;pg=PT105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Julio Izquierdo Labrado,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgar.net/var/esclavos3.htm|title=La esclavitud en Huelva y Palos (1570-1587)|last=Izquierdo Labrado|first=Julio|language=Spanish|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 19th-century linguist Leopoldo Eguilaz y Yanguas, as well as some Arabic sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriatoday.ca/salloum-arab-lan.htm|title=The impact of the Arabic language and culture on English and other European languages|last=Salloum|first=Habeeb|publisher=The Honorary Consulate of Syria|accessdate=2008-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630193414/http://www.syriatoday.ca/salloum-arab-lan.htm|archive-date=2008-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''muwallad'' is the etymological origin of ''mulato.'' These sources specify that ''mulato'' would have been derived directly from ''muwallad'' independently of the related word ''[[muladí]],'' a term that was applied to [[Mozarab|Iberian Christians]] who had [[converted to Islam]] during the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Al-Andalus|governance of Iberia]] in the [[Middle Ages]].

The [[Real Academia Española]] (Spanish Royal Academy) casts doubt on the ''muwallad'' theory. It states, "The term ''mulata'' is documented in our diachronic data bank in 1472 and is used in reference to livestock mules in ''Documentacion medieval de la Corte de Justicia de Ganaderos de Zaragoza,'' whereas ''muladí'' (from ''mullawadí'') does not appear until the 18th century, according to [[Joan Coromines|[Joan] Corominas]]".{{#tag:ref|Corominas describes his doubts on the theory as follows: "[''Mulato''] does not derive from the Arab ''muwállad'', 'acculturated foreigner' and sometimes 'mulatto' (see {{'}}''Mdí''{{'}}), as Eguílaz would have it, since this word was pronounced 'moo-EL-led' in the Arabic of Spain. In the 19th century, [[Reinhart Dozy]] (''Supplément aux Dictionnaires Arabes'', Vol. II, Leyden, 1881, 841a) rejected this Arabic etymology, indicating the true one, supported by the Arabic ''nagîl,'' 'mulatto', derived from ''nagl'', 'mule'."&lt;ref&gt;Corominas, Joan and Pascual, José A. (1981). ''Diccionario crítico etimológico castellano e hispánico'', Vol. ME-RE (4). Madrid: Editorial Gredos. {{ISBN|84-249-1362-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}

Scholars such as [[Werner Sollors]] cast doubt on the mule etymology for mulatto. In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialists]] such as [[Edward Long]] and [[Josiah Nott]] began to assert that mulattoes were sterile like mules. They projected this belief back onto the etymology of the word mulatto. Sollors points out that this etymology is anachronistic: "The Mulatto sterility hypothesis that has much to do with the rejection of the term by some writers is only half as old as the word 'Mulatto.'"&lt;ref&gt;Werner Sollors, ''Neither Black Nor White Yet Both'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]'s 193,413 inhabitants, the largest segment is classified as ''mestiço,'' or mixed race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107943.html|title=São Tomé and Príncipe|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 71% of the population of [[Cape Verde]] is also classified as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107395.html|title=Cape Verde|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of their current populations descend from unions between the Portuguese, who settled the islands from the 15th century onwards, and the black Africans they brought from the [[Africa|African mainland]] to work as slaves. In the early years, mestiços began to form a third-class between the Portuguese colonists and African slaves, as they were usually bilingual and often served as interpreters between the populations.

In [[Culture of Angola#Mestiço|Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], the ''mestiço'' constitute smaller but still important minorities; 2% in Angola&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107280.html|title=Angola|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 0.2% in Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107804.html|title=Mozambique|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulatto and ''mestiço'' are not terms commonly used in Southern Africa to refer to people of mixed ancestry. The persistence of some authors to use this term out of historic context reflects the old-school essentialist views of race as a ''de facto'' biological phenomenon and the 'mixing' of race as legitimate grounds for the creation of a 'new race'. This is in disregard of cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity and/or differences between regions and globally in populations of mixed ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Not White Enough, Not Black Enough: Racial Identity in the South African Coloured Community|last=results|first=search|date=2005-11-17|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=9780896802445|edition= 1st|location=Athens|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Namibia]], a current-day population of between 20,000 and 30,000 people, known as [[Baster|Rehoboth Basters]], descend from liaisons between the Cape Colony Dutch and indigenous African women. The name Baster is derived from the Dutch word for "bastard" (or "crossbreed"). While some people consider this term demeaning, the [[Basters]] proudly use the term as an indication of their history.

In [[South Africa]], [[Coloured]] is a term used to refer to individuals with some degree of sub-Saharan ancestry but subjectively 'not enough' to be considered black-African under the Apartheid era [[law of South Africa]]. Today people self-identify as 'Coloured'. Other [[Afrikaans]] terms used include ''Bruinmense'' (translates to "brown people"), ''Kleurlinge'' (translates to "Coloured") or ''Bruin Afrikaners'' (translates to "brown Africans"  and is used to distinguish them from the main body of ''Afrikaners'' (translates to "African") who are white). Under Apartheid law there were seven categories of Coloured people: Cape Coloured, Cape Malay, Griqua and Other Coloured - the aim of subdivisions was to enhance the meaning of the larger category of Coloured by making it all encompassing. Legally and politically speaking, all people of colour were classified “black” in the non-racial terms of anti-Apartheid rhetoric of the Black Consciousness Movement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/19854/Palmer_indiana_0093A_13466.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=THROUGH A COLOURED LENS: POST-APARTHEID IDENTITY FORMATION AMONGST COLOUREDS IN KZN|last=Palmer|first=Fileve|date=2015|website=Scholarworks.iu.edu|access-date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to European ancestry, Coloured people usually also possess Asian ancestry from immigrants from [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Madagascar]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[China]] and/or [[Saint Helena]]. Based on the Population Registration Act to classify people, laws were put in place prohibiting mixed marriages.  Therefore, many people that were descendants of the "Asian" category were able to legally intermarry with "mixed-race" people because they shared the same nomenclature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There was extensive combining of these diverse heritages in the [[Western Cape]], but in other parts of [[southern Africa]], the coloured usually were descendants of two primary ethnic groups - primarily Africans of various tribes and European colonists of various tribes, with generations of coloured forming families. The use of the term 'Coloured' has changed over the course of history. For instance, in the first census after the South African war (1912) Indians were counted as 'Coloured' whereas before and after, they were counted as 'Asiatic'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christopher|first=A.J.|date=2009|title=Delineating the nation: South African censuses 1865–2007|journal=Political Geography|volume=28|issue=2|pages=101–109|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.12.003|issn=0962-6298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[KwaZulu-Natal]], most Coloureds (that were classified as "other coloureds") had British and [[Zulu people|Zulu]] heritage, while Zimbabwean coloureds were descended from [[Shona people|Shona]] or [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] mixing with British and [[Afrikaner]] settlers.

According to Nurse and Jenkins (1975) the leader of this “mixed” group, Adam Kok I, was a former slave of the Dutch governor who was manumitted and provided land outside Cape Town in the eighteenth century. With territories beyond the Dutch East India Company administration, Kok delivered refuge to deserting soldiers, runaway slaves, and remaining members of various Khoikhoi tribes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the United States, due to the influence and laws making slavery a racial caste and later practices of [[hypodescent]], white colonists and settlers tended to classify persons of mixed African and Native American ancestry as black, regardless of how they identified themselves, or sometimes as [[Black Indians in the United States|black Indians]]. But many tribes had [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] systems and practices of absorbing other peoples into their cultures. Multiracial children born to Native American mothers were customarily raised in her specific tribal culture. Federally recognized Indian tribes have insisted that identity and membership is related to culture rather than race, and that individuals brought up within tribal culture are fully members, regardless of whether they have some European or African ancestry. Many tribes have had mixed-race members who identify primarily as members of the tribes.

If the children were born to slave women, they were classified under slave law as slaves, and more likely raised within the African-American community and considered black. A number of African Americans in contemporary United States have ancestry including some Native American.&lt;ref name=afch/&gt;

According to genetic studies, some of those who identify as [[White Brazilian]]s (48.4%) also have some mixed-race ancestry (both Subsaharan African and Amerindian ancestry). Brazilians who identify as ''de raça negra'' or ''de cor preta'', i.e. Brazilians of Black African origin, make up 6.9% of the population; genetic studies show their average total ancestry is still mixed: 40% African, 50% European, and 10% Amerindian, but they likely grew up within visibly black communities.

Such [[autosomal DNA]] studies, which measure total genetic contribution, continue to reveal differences between how individuals identify, which is usually based in family and close community, with genetic ancestry, which may relate to a distant past they know little about.&lt;ref&gt;White Americans Admixture [http://www.servinghistory.com/topics/white_Americans::sub::Admixture Serving History; "The Ancestry of Brazilian mtDNA Lineages"] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287189/ National Library of Medicine, NIH; "Y-STR diversity and ethnic admixture in White and Mulatto Brazilian population samples"] [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1415-47572006000400004&amp;script=sci_arttext Scielo.]&lt;/ref&gt; Such DNA studies were conducted of students at a school in the poor periphery of [[Rio de Janeiro]].

"The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry", say the researchers. The test results showed that the proportion of European genetic ancestry was higher than students expected.

Mulattoes account for up to 5% of the nation’s population. In [[Haiti]]an history, such mixed-race people, known in colonial times as free people of color, gained some education and property before the Revolution. In some cases, their white fathers arranged for multiracial sons to be educated in France and join the military, giving them an advance economically. Free people of color gained some social capital and political power before the Revolution, were influential during the Revolution and since then. The people of color have retained their elite position, based on education and social capital, that is apparent in the political, economic and cultural hierarchy in present-day Haiti. Numerous leaders throughout Haiti's history have been people of color.&lt;ref&gt;Smucker, Glenn R. "The Upper Class". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/httoc.html A Country Study: Haiti]'' (Richard A.

In a 2002 [[Genealogical DNA test|genetic study]] of maternal and paternal direct lines of ancestry of 800 Puerto Ricans, 61% had mitochondrial DNA ([[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]]) from an Amerindian female ancestor, 27% inherited MtDNA from a female African ancestor and 12% had MtDNA from a female European ancestor.&lt;ref name=Ancestry&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martínez Cruzado |first=Juan C. |year=2002 |title=The Use of Mitochondrial DNA to Discover Pre-Columbian Migrations to the Caribbean:Results for Puerto Rico and Expectations for the Dominican Republic |journal=Kacike |issue=Special |pages=1–11 |issn=1562-5028 |url=http://www.kacike.org/MartinezEnglish.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624204524/http://www.kacike.org/MartinezEnglish.pdf |archivedate=June 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, patrilineal direct lines, as indicated by the [[Y chromosome]], showed that 70% of Puerto Rican males in the sample have Y chromosome DNA from a male European ancestor, 20% inherited Y-DNA from a male African ancestor, and less than 10% inherited Y-DNA from a male Amerindian ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n50/PRGenePool.html |publisher=Puerto Rico Herald |title=Puerto Rican Gene Pool Runs Deep |accessdate=2008-07-14 |last=Gonzalez |first=Juan |date=2003-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these tests measure only the DNA along the direct matrilineal and patrilineal lines of inheritance, they cannot tell what total percentage of European or African ancestry any individual has.

In keeping with Spanish practice, for most of its colonial period, [[Puerto Rico]] had laws such as the ''Regla del Sacar'' or ''Gracias al Sacar.'' A person with African ancestry could be considered legally white if he could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had been legally white. People of black ancestry with known white lineage were classified as white, in contrast to the "[[one-drop rule]]" put into law in the early 20th century in the United States. In colonial and antebellum times in certain locations, persons of three-quarters or more white ancestry were considered legally white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jay |last=Kinsbruner |title=Not of Pure Blood |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=qLSU-SiojsYC&amp;dq=Jay+Kinsbruner,+Not+of+Pure+Blood,&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=utW9BXA--9&amp;sig=Sa7e_6rupXyUWxsgYWC4kL-1pew#PPP13,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If born to slave mothers, however, this status did not overrule their being considered slaves, like [[Sally Hemings]], who was three-quarters white, and her children by Thomas Jefferson, who were seven-eighths white, and all born into slavery.

Historians have documented sexual abuse of slave women during the colonial and post-revolutionary slavery times by white men in power: planters, their sons before marriage, overseers, etc., producing multiracial children born into slavery. But, Paul Heinegg has documented that most of the free people of color in the 1790–1810 censuses in the Upper South were descended from unions and marriages during the colonial period in Virginia between white women, who were free or indentured servants, and African or African-American men, servant, slave or free. In the early colonial years, working-class people lived and worked closely together, and slavery was not as much of a racial caste. Slave law had established that children in the colony took the status of their mothers. This meant that multi-racial children born to white women were born free. The colony required them to serve lengthy indentures if the woman was not married, but nonetheless, numerous individuals with African ancestry were born free, and formed more free families. Many of these free people of color became leaders in the African-American community; others continued to marry into the white community.&lt;ref&gt;http://freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1995–2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Schneider, Carl J.

Accessed November 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian F. James Davis,
{{quote|Rapes occurred, and many slave women were forced to submit regularly to white males or suffer harsh consequences. However, slave girls often courted a sexual relationship with the master, or another male in the family, as a way of gaining distinction among the slaves, avoiding field work, and obtaining special jobs and other favored treatment for their mixed children (Reuter, 1970:129). Sexual contacts between the races also included prostitution, adventure, [[concubinage]], and sometimes love. In rare instances, where free blacks were concerned, there was marriage (Bennett, 1962:243–68).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9d9FC-gcWaAC&amp;pg Floyd James Davis, ''Who Is Black?: One Nation's Definition''], pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some mixed-race persons in the South became slave owners, and many who were accepted in the society supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. For example, [[William Ellison]] owned 60 slaves. Andrew Durnford of New Orleans, which had a large population of [[free people of color]], mostly of French descent and Catholic culture, was listed in the census as owning 77 slaves. In Louisiana [[free people of color]] constituted a third class between white colonists and the mass of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Conlin (2011).

Other multiracial people became [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. For example, [[Mary Ellen Pleasant]] and [[Thomy Lafon]] used their fortunes to support the abolitionist cause. Francis E. Dumas of New Orleans, a free person of color, emancipated all his slaves and organized them into a company in the Second Regiment of the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|Louisiana Native Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Elizabeth Thompson, ''Exiles at Home: The Struggle to Become American in Creole New Orleans'', Harvard University Press, 2009, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically in the [[American South]], the term mulatto was also applied at times to persons with mixed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[African American]] ancestry.&lt;ref name=afch&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpusu6xQq6QC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=afro+cherokee+smallpox#v=onepage&amp;q=afro%20cherokee%20smallpox&amp;f=false |title=Ties that Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom |author=Miles, Tiya |accessdate=2009-10-27 |year=2008 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-25002-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 1705 [[Virginia]] statute reads as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"And for clearing all manner of doubts which hereafter may happen to arise upon the construction of this act, or any other act, who shall be accounted a mulatto, Be it enacted and declared, and it is hereby enacted and declared, That the child of an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] and the child, grand child, or great grand child, of a [[negro]] shall be deemed, accounted, held and taken to be a mulatto."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=General Assembly of Virginia|authorlink1=Virginia|editor1-last=Hening|editor1-first=William Waller|title=Statutes at Large|date=1823|location=Philadelphia|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4i3OAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=30 September 2014|chapter=4th Anne Ch.

In early American history, the term mulatto was also used to refer to persons of Native American and European ancestry. Certain tribes of Indians of the Inocoplo family in [[Texas]] referred to themselves as "mulatto".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmm38 |title=Mulato Indians |work=The Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=2013-01-07}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, Florida's laws declared that a person from any number of mixed ancestries would be legally defined as a mulatto, including White/Hispanic, Black/Indian, and just about any other mix as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8nvkAIulFIC&amp;pg=PA19 |page=19 |title=The Indians of North Florida: From Carolina to Florida, the Story of the Survival of a Distinct American Indian Community |author1=Sewell, Christopher Scott |author2=Hill, S.

Thus, children born to slave mothers were born into slavery, regardless of who their fathers were; children born to white mothers were free, even if mixed-race.

===Contemporary era===
{{Further|Multiracial American}}
Mulatto was used as an official [[United States Census|census]] racial category in the United States until 1930. (In the early 20th century, several southern states had adopted the [[one-drop rule]] as law, and southern Congressmen pressed the US Census Bureau to drop the mulatto category: they wanted all persons to be classified as "black" or "white".) At that time, the term was primarily applied as a category to persons of mixed African and European descent. During the colonial and early federal period, in the Southern colonies and states, it was sometimes applied to persons of any mixed ethnicity, including Native American and European. During the early census years of the [[United States]] beginning in 1790, "mulatto" was applied to persons who were identifiably of mixed [[African-American]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/skillsbuildingresources/g/mulattodef.htm|publisher=About.com|work=Race Rekations|title=Mulatto - An Invisible American Identity|accessdate=2008-07-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310152430/http://racerelations.about.com/od/skillsbuildingresources/g/mulattodef.htm|archivedate=2009-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsawokett.com/Introduction.html |title=Introduction|publisher=Mitsawokett: A 17th Century Native American Community in Central Delaware}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsawokett.com/Plecker.htm |title=Walter Plecker's Racist Crusade Against Virginia's Native Americans |publisher=Mitsawokett: A 17th Century Native American Settlement in Delaware |accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heite.org/Invis.indians1.html|title=Introduction and statement of historical problem|work=Delaware's Invisible Indians|last=Heite|first=Louise|accessdate=2008-07-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724082356/http://www.heite.org/Invis.indians1.html|archivedate=2008-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulatto was also used interchangeably with terms like "[[Turks of South Carolina|Turk]]", leading to ambiguity when referring to [[North Africa]]ns and [[Middle East]]erners, who were of limited number in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/vansallees.html|publisher=PBS Frontline|last=de Valdes y Cocom|first=Mario|work=The Blurred Racial Lines of Famous Families|title=The Van Salee Family|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2000 United States Census]], 6,171 Americans self-identified as having mulatto ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/socdemo/ancestry/ancestry_q_by_DAC_2000.xls|title=Mulatto ancestry in 2000 U.S census|website=Census.gov|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, multi-racial people have been allowed to identify as having more than one type of ethnic ancestry.

'''Multiple Jeopardy''' a term used by scholars such as Deborah K. King and [[Patricia Hill Collins]] describes the way in which oppressive barriers that individuals face contribute to the level of oppression faced due to these factors culminating together to cause further and greater oppression.&lt;blockquote&gt;“The modifier ‘multiple’ refers not only to several, simultaneous oppressions but to the multiplicative relationships among them as well.  In other words, the equivalent formulation is racism multiplied by sexism multiplied by classism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology|last=King|first=Deborah K.|publisher=University Chicago Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  - Deborah K. King &lt;/blockquote&gt;Multiple Jeopardy stems off the term double jeopardy, which when used from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, refers to the additional obstacles individuals face when exposed to multiple disadvantages due to their unique being.  When considering double jeopardy, often times there is an emphasis on just two aspects such as race and gender.  An example of this would be the rights observed by black women.  Not only are these individuals oppressed because they are female, but also because they are black.  These women are a part of a dual oppressive system and are not only hindered by one trait, but by two.   &lt;blockquote&gt;“Not only are colored women . . . handicapped on account of their sex, but they are almost everywhere baffled and mocked because of their race.  Not only because they are women, but because they are colored women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – [[Mary Church Terrell]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“As blacks they suffer all the burdens of prejudice and mistreatment that fall on anyone with dark skin.  As women they bear the additional burden of having to cope with white and black men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female|last=Beal|first=Frances|publisher=|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; -[[Frances M. Beal]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;Multiple jeopardy differs from double jeopardy, by the fact that instead of just two factors playing into the disadvantages of individuals, there are multiple.  Three common factors that are often observed are the factors of race, class, and gender.  In Deborah King’s article, ''Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology'', she recounts the ill treatment of black women during the slavery era. During the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery time period]] in America, all black people were subjected to demanding physical labor and harsh brutal punishments; this was due to their race and their class, or their position in society.  However, what sets black women slaves apart is the fact that they often endured struggles that were only subjected to women, namely rape (King).  As [[Angela Davis]] put it in her book ''Women, Race, and Class'', “If the most violent punishments of men consisted in floggings and mutilations, women were flogged and mutilated, as well as raped."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, Race, and Class|last=Davis|first=Angela|publisher=Vintage|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this scenario, black women could not identify with black males due to their gender and sexuality, nor could they identify with the sexual oppression of white women due to their race and class.

Black women often find it difficult to identify and relate with white women due to the difference of race and class.  One way of viewing the differences between white women and black women would be to examine the way in which they combat the exploitation of women.  Over the years there has been a number of political campaigns emphasizing the reformation of policies and laws involving reproductive rights, domestic violence, equal pay, women’s suffrage, sexual harassment, and other issues that particularly involve women; this movement is widely known as the [[feminist movement]].  Though this movement involves all women, there is a difference between the ways in which white women and black women experience and go about handling the exploitation.  In her article, ''Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female'', [[Frances M. Beal]] expresses thathite women are faced with the sole issue of being considered less than men.  They often blame their issues solely on male chauvinism and the ways in which society is built on male-encouraged values. They do not face issues based on their race, however, this is the case for black and other minority women of color. Black women are not only faced with male-bigoted views, but they also carry the task of finding equality through means of being black as well.  In addition to there being racial differences amongst black women and white women, there are also class differences amongst the two.  The white-woman’s [[feminist movement]] is often geared towards helping and improving the conditions of the middle-class.  This is problematic when referring to the black women.  Many, black women experience economic exploitation that, according to Beal, quite few white women endure or are faced with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female|last=Beal|first=Frances M|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multiple Jeopardy and the Matrix of Domination ==
The topic of multiple jeopardy, relates to the understanding of the concept [[Matrix of domination|Matrix of Domination]].  This term, used by [[Patricia Hill Collins]], refers to the sociological [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] paradigms that describes the overall social organization within which oppressions that are fueled by the [[Intersectionality|intersection]] of multiple disadvantaging factors, originate, develop, and are contained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=227–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;   By [[Intersectionality|intersectional]], it is meant that the disadvantaging factors that are discussed in the explanation of multiple jeopardy, intersect and overlap with one another just as an inseparable link; an interlocking system of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Intersectional Approach|last=Berger|first=Michele Tracy|last2=Guidroz|first2=Kathleen|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press Chapel Hill|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, domination can be seen in institutions such as schools, employment, housing, the government, and other social elements.  The domination of the superior group affects those who are/have been socially oppressed due to the factors that have historically caused them disadvantages.  The idea of multiple jeopardy feeds into the concept of the [[Matrix of domination|Matrix of Domination]] because it is these multiple factors, gender, race, sex, class, religion and other social/cultural identities, that have historically caused many disadvantages for certain groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=227–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For more information on the [[Matrix of domination|Matrix of Domination]], follow the link.

== The Relationship Between Multiple Jeopardy and Multiple Consciousness ==
The concept of multiple consciousness revolves around the idea of being aware of the intersectional factors that contribute to the levels of oppression.  It acknowledges the fact that there are various intersecting, disadvantaging factors that places the odds against certain individuals.  In her article Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology, Deborah King expresses just how multiple consciousness plays a role when considering Black women's position in society: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...a black feminist ideology fundamentally challenges the interstructure of the oppressions of racism, sexism, and classism both in the dominant society and within movements for liberation.  It is in confrontation with multiple jeopardy that black women define and sustain a multiple consciousness essential for our liberation, of which feminist consciousness is an integral part."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multiple jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness:The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology|last=King|first=Deborah K|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Deborah K. King&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''National Film and Sound Archive of Australia''' (NFSA) is [[Australia]]’s audiovisual archive, responsible for developing, preserving, maintaining, promoting and providing access to a national collection of copies of [[film]], [[television]], sound, and [[radio]] audiovisual materials and related items. The collection ranges from works created in the late nineteenth century when the recorded sound and film industries were in their infancy to those made in the present day.

The Archive was formally established as the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (within the then [[National Library of Australia|Commonwealth National Library]]) in 1935, becoming an independent cultural organisation in 1984. On 3 October, Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] officially opened the NFSA’s headquarters in Canberra.

==History of the organisation==

The work of the Archive can be officially dated to the establishment of the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (part of the then [[National Library of Australia|Commonwealth National Library]]) by a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] decision on 11 December 1935.

After being part of the National Library of Australia, and its predecessors, for nearly 50 years, the National Film and Sound Archive was created as a separate [[Commonwealth]] collecting institution through an announcement in Parliament on 5 April 1984 that took immediate effect.&lt;ref name="NAA CA 4123"&gt;{{citation|title=CA 4123: National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+4123|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, an Advisory Committee was established to guide the institution.

On 21 June 1999, the name was changed to ScreenSound Australia, the National Collection of Screen and Sound, and changed again in early 2000 to ScreenSound Australia, National Screen and Sound Archive. It reverted to its original name, National Film and Sound Archive, in December 2004.

Meanwhile,  consequent on amendments to the [[Australian Film Commission]] Act which took effect on 1 July 2003, it ceased to be a semi-autonomous entity within the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and became an integrated branch, later a division, of the Australian Film Commission, a funding and promotional body.

In 2007, the Liberal Government announced the creation of a new agency to be called [[Screen Australia]] which would incorporate the main functions of the Film Finance Corporation, the Australian Film Commission (including the Archive), and [[Film Australia]]. Following elections in November 2007, however, the new Labor Government implemented an election promise to allow the NFSA to become a statutory authority, similar to other major cultural institutions including the [[National Library of Australia]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[National Museum of Australia]]. The NFSA Act became law on 20 March 2008 and came into effect on 1 July 2008, with celebrations held that day.&lt;ref&gt;Massola, James (2008) "Innovative film sets the scene for the Archive's new role", ''[[The Canberra Times]]'', 2008-07-02, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==

The National Collection includes more than 2.8 million items, encompassing sound, radio, television and film. In addition to discs, films, videos, audio tapes, phonograph cylinders and wire recordings, the Collection includes supporting documents and artefacts, such as personal papers and organisational records, photographs, posters, lobby cards, publicity, scripts, costumes, props, memorabilia and sound, video and film equipment.

Notable holdings include:
* The Cinesound [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] Australian Newsreel Collection, 1929-1975: comprehensive collection of 4,000 [[newsreel]] films and documentaries representing news stories covering all major events in Australian history, sport and entertainment from 1929 to 1975. Inscribed on the Australian Memory of the World Register in 2003.
* ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', 1906: directed by [[Charles Tait (film director)|Charles Tait]], is the first full-length narrative [[feature film]] produced anywhere in the world, and was inscribed onto the International [http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22621&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Memory of the World ] Register in 2007.
* the earliest Australian sound recording, [https://www.nfsa.gov.au/collection/curated/hen-convention-thomas-rome 'The Hen Convention'], a novelty song by vocalist John James Villiers, with piano accompaniment, recorded by Thomas Rome in 1896.

A 2010 study compared the curatorial practices of accessioning and cataloging for NFSA collections and for [[YouTube]] with regard to access to older Australian television programs. It found the NFSA to be stronger in current affairs and older programs, and YouTube stronger in game shows, lifestyle programs, and "human interest" material (births, marriages, and deaths). YouTube cataloging was found to have fewer broken links than the NFSA collection, and YouTube [[metadata]] could be searched more intuitively. The NFSA was found to generally provide more useful reference information about production and broadcast dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=Alan|title=YouTube versus the National Film and Sound Archive: Which Is the More Useful Resource for Historians of Australian Television?|journal=[[Television &amp; New Media]]|year=2011|volume=12|issue=2|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the building ==
&lt;!-- This is a SUMMARY. Please don't add new information or details here, but instead at the main article [[Australian Institute of Anatomy]]! --&gt;
{{main|Australian Institute of Anatomy}}
[[File:National Film and Sound Archive viewed near McCoy Circuit.jpg|right|thumb|The National Film and Sound Archive fronts onto McCoy Circuit.]]
The building to which the Archive moved in 1984 was the home of the Australian Institute of Anatomy from 1931-84. Originally it held the anatomy collection of [[William Colin Mackenzie|Sir Colin MacKenzie]]. This collection included the heart of the celebrated Australian racehorse [[Phar Lap]].

The building is often classified as [[art deco]], though its overall architectural style is technically "Late 20th Century Stripped Classical", the style of ancient Greece and Rome but simplified and modernised.  It features a symmetrical façade, a horizontal skyline, classical columns and a central entrance. The decorative foyer features images of native flora, fauna and Aboriginal art and motifs. Face masks of well-known scientists from the late 19th century and early 20th century are featured on the foyer’s walls as a reminder of its previous incarnation as the Institute of Anatomy.

The building also features a landscaped courtyard, theatre and research centre. In 1999, the building was extended to accommodate the Archive's growth. The new wing’s design is in keeping with the Art Deco style of the main structure with details and finishes to match the original.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">The '''Reichsfilmarchiv''' ("Reich Film Archive") was the state film archive of the [[Germany]] of the [[Third Reich]]. The first German national film archive, it was opened in 1935, and based in [[Berlin]]. It ceased to exist in 1945, when its film stock was either destroyed or seized by the [[USSR|Soviet]] army.

== History ==
The ''Reichsfilmarchiv'' was opened on 4 February 1935 in [[Harnack House]], [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]], Berlin, in the presence of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]], with an enormous flurry of propaganda. It soon gained a high international reputation. When the ''Fédération Internationale des Archives du Film'' ([[International Federation of Film Archives|FIAF]]) was established as an international joint film archive in [[Paris]] in 1938, the ''Reichsfilmarchiv'' was one of the four founding members. The [[Independent State of Croatia]] kept copies of its films at the archive, due to the lack of a sufficient archive of its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domovina.110mb.com/kinematografija_u_NDH.htm Kinematografija u NDH]&lt;/ref&gt;

After their arrival in Berlin in April 1945, [[USSR|Soviet]] troops seized the ''Reichsfilmarchiv'' and took possession of all its surviving film material. In 1947 its place was filled in [[West Germany]] by the ''[[Archiv für Filmwissenschaft]]'' ("Archive of Film Science"), set up in [[Marburg]] by Hanns Wilhelm Lavies, while in [[East Germany]] it was succeeded by the ''[[Staatliches Filmarchiv der DDR]]'' ("State Film Archive of the DDR"), established in 1955.

== Collections ==
At the time of its opening the film archive already held more than 1,200 films, some transferred from their previous place of deposit in the ''[[Reichsarchiv Potsdam]]'' ("Imperial Archives, Potsdam"), others provided by the film industry. By the end of the [[World War II|war]] in 1945, not only through the normal channels of acquisition, but also very largely through seizure and confiscation in the occupied territories, the collection had grown to 17,352 films.

After the end of the war most of these films, many of which had been stored in the bell tower of the [[Berlin Olympic Stadium]], were lost.  6,400 selected films eventually found their way into the Soviet film archive in [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogorsk]] near [[Moscow]] and from there into Soviet cinemas, where some of them were still showing up to 1956. When in 1955 the State Film Archive of the DDR was founded, it was permitted to take over a proportion of the collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15883">'''Research data archiving''' is  the [[Computer_data_storage#Volatility|long-term storage]] of scholarly research [[data]], including  the natural sciences, social sciences, and life sciences. The various [[academic journals]] have differing policies regarding how much of their data and methods researchers are required to store in a public archive, and what is actually archived varies widely between different disciplines. Similarly, the major grant-giving institutions have varying attitudes towards public archival of data. In general, the tradition of science has been for publications to contain sufficient information to allow fellow researchers to replicate and therefore test the research. In recent years this approach has become increasingly strained as   research in some areas depends on large datasets which cannot easily be replicated independently.

Data archiving is more important in some fields than others.  In a few fields, all of the data necessary to replicate the work is already available in the journal article.  In drug development, a great deal of data is generated and must be archived so researchers can verify that the reports the drug companies publish accurately reflect the data.

The requirement of data archiving is a recent development in the [[history of science]].  It was made possible by advances in [[information technology]] allowing large amounts of data to be stored and accessed from central locations.  For example, the [[American Geophysical Union]] (AGU) adopted their first policy on data archiving in 1993, about three years after the beginning of the [[WWW]].&lt;ref&gt;”Policy on Referencing Data in and Archiving Data for AGU Publications” [http://www.agu.org/pubs/authors/policies/data_policy.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; This policy mandates that datasets cited in AGU papers must be archived by a recognised data center; it permits the creation of "data papers"; and it establishes AGU's role in maintaining data archives. But it makes no requirements on paper authors to archive their data.

Prior to organized data archiving, researchers wanting to evaluate or replicate a paper would have to request data and methods information from the author.  The academic community expects authors to [[Data sharing (Science)|share supplemental data]].  This process was recognized as wasteful of time and energy and obtained mixed results.  Information could become lost or corrupted over the years.  In some cases, authors simply refuse to provide the information.

The need for data archiving and due diligence is greatly increased when the research deals with health issues or public policy formation.&lt;ref&gt;"The Case for Due Diligence When Empirical Research is Used in Policy Formation" by Bruce McCullough and Ross McKitrick. [http://economics.ca/2006/papers/0685.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gking.harvard.edu/replication.shtml "Data Sharing and Replication" a website by Gary King] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328035546/http://gking.harvard.edu/replication.shtml |date=2007-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected policies by journals==

===''Biotropica''===
{{quote|''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291744-7429 Biotropica]'' requires, as a condition for publication, that the data supporting the results in the paper and metadata describing them must be archived in an appropriate public archive such as [http://datadryad.org Dryad], [http://figshare.com Figshare], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ GenBank], [http://www.treebase.org TreeBASE], or [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra NCBI]. Authors may elect to make the data publicly available as soon as the article is published or, if the technology of the archive allows, embargo access to the data up to three years after article publication. A statement describing Data Availability will be included in the manuscript as described in the instructions to authors. Exceptions to the required archiving of data may be granted at the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief for studies that include sensitive information (e.g., the location of endangered species). Our Editorial explaining the motivation for this policy can be found [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/btp.12318/abstract here]. A more comprehensive list of data repositories is available [http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Data_repositories here].

'''''Promoting a culture of collaboration with researchers who collect and archive data:''''' The data collected by tropical biologists are often long-term, complex, and expensive to collect. The Board of Editors of ''Biotropica'' strongly encourages authors who re-use data archives archived data sets to include as fully engaged collaborators the scientists who originally collected them. We feel this will greatly enhance the quality and impact of the resulting research by drawing on the data collector’s profound insights into the natural history of the study system, reducing the risk of errors in novel analyses, and stimulating the cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural collaboration and training for which the [http://tropicalbiology.org/ ATBC] and ''Biotropica'' are widely recognized.}}

'''NB:''' ''Biotropica'' is one of only two journals that pays the fees for authors depositing data at Dryad.

===''The American Naturalist''===
{{quote|''[[The American Naturalist]]'' requires authors to deposit the data associated with accepted papers in a public archive. For gene sequence data and phylogenetic trees, deposition in [[GenBank]] or [[TreeBASE]], respectively, is required. There are many possible archives that may suit a particular data set, including the [[Dryad (repository)|Dryad]] repository for ecological and evolutionary biology data. All accession numbers for GenBank, TreeBASE, and Dryad must be included in accepted manuscripts before they go to Production. If the data is deposited somewhere else, please provide a link. If the data is culled from published literature, please deposit the collated data in Dryad for the convenience of your readers. Any impediments to data sharing should be brought to the attention of the editors at the time of submission so that appropriate arrangements can be worked out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/an/instruct#data Supporting Data and Material]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Journal of Heredity''===
{{quote|The primary data underlying the conclusions of an article are critical to the verifiability and transparency of the scientific enterprise, and should be preserved in usable form for decades in the future. For this reason, ''Journal of Heredity'' requires that newly reported nucleotide or amino acid sequences, and structural coordinates, be submitted to appropriate public databases (e.g., GenBank; the [[EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database]]; DNA Database of Japan; the [[Protein Data Bank]] ; and [[Swiss-Prot]]). Accession numbers must be included in the final version of the manuscript. For other forms of data (e.g., microsatellite genotypes, linkage maps, images), the Journal endorses the principles of the Joint Data Archiving Policy (JDAP) in encouraging all authors to archive primary datasets in an appropriate public archive, such as Dryad, TreeBASE, or the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity. Authors are encouraged to make data publicly available at time of publication or, if the technology of the archive allows, opt to embargo access to the data for a period up to a year after publication.

The American Genetic Association also recognizes the vast investment of individual researchers in generating and curating large datasets. Consequently, we recommend that this investment be respected in secondary analyses or meta-analyses in a gracious collaborative spirit.|oxfordjournals.org&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/jhered/for_authors/msprep_submission.html#4.%20DATA%20ARCHIVING%20POLICY Data archiving policy]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Data are important products of the scientific enterprise, and they should be preserved and usable for decades in the future. Authors may elect to have the data publicly available at time of publication, or, if the technology of the archive allows, may opt to embargo access to the data for a period up to a year after publication. Exceptions may be granted at the discretion of the editor, especially for sensitive information such as human subject data or the location of endangered species.|Wiley&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/bw/submit.asp?ref=0962-1083&amp;site=1 Policy on data archiving]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Nature''===

Such material cannot solely be hosted on an author's personal or institutional web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/availability.html "Availability of Data and Materials: The Policy of Nature Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nature'' requires the reviewer to determine if all of the supplementary data and methods have been archived.  The policy advises reviewers to consider several questions, including: "Should the authors be asked to provide supplementary methods or data to accompany the paper online? (Such data might include source code for modelling studies, detailed experimental protocols or mathematical derivations.)|[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Publication Policies of the Nature Journals|date=March 14, 2007|url=http://www.nature.com/authors/gta.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Science''===
{{quote|''Science'' supports the efforts of databases that aggregate published data for the use of the scientific community.

"Materials and methods" – ''Science'' now requests that, in general, authors place the bulk of their description of materials and methods online as supporting material, providing only as much methods description in the print manuscript as is necessary to follow the logic of the text. (Obviously, this restriction will not apply if the paper is fundamentally a study of a new method or technique.)|[[Science (journal)|Science]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/about/authors/prep/prep_online.dtl ”Preparing Your Supporting Online Material”]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Journal of Archaeological Science''===

{{quote|The ''[[Journal of Archaeological Science]]'' has had a [https://www.elsevier.com/journals/journal-of-archaeological-science/0305-4403/guide-for-authors data disclosure policy] since at least 2013. Their policy states that 'all data relating to the article must be made available in Supplementary files or deposited in external repositories and linked to within the article. The policy recommends that data are deposited in a repository such as the [[Archaeology Data Service]], [https://www.tdar.org/about/ the Digital Archaeological Record], or [[PANGAEA]]. A 2018 study found a data availability rate of 53%, reflecting either weak enforcement of this policy or an incomplete understanding among editors, reviewers, and authors of how to interpret and implement this policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|last2=Birch|first2=Suzanne E.

==Policies by funding agencies==
In the United States, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) has tightened requirements on data archiving.   Researchers seeking funding from NSF are now required to file a [[data management plan]] as a two-page supplement to the grant application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/05/nsf-to-ask-every-grant-applicant.html ”NSF to Ask Every Grant Applicant for Data Management Plan”]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSF [[Datanet]] initiative has resulted in funding of the '''Data Observation Network for Earth''' ([[DataONE]]) project, which will provide scientific data archiving for ecological and environmental data produced by scientists worldwide. DataONE's stated goal is to preserve and provide access to multi-scale, multi-discipline, and multi-national data. The community of users for DataONE includes scientists, ecosystem managers, policy makers, students, educators, and the public.

'''Sava Savanović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Сава Савановић}}) is one of the most famous [[vampire]]s in [[Serbian folklore]].

== Legend ==

Sava Savanović was said to have lived in an old [[watermill]] on the [[Rogačica]] river, at [[Zarožje]] village in the municipality of [[Bajina Bašta]].&lt;ref name="politika"&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Srbija/Sava-Savanovic-josh-cheka-da-postane-brend.lt.html Politika: Sava Savanović još čeka da postane srpski brend]&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that he killed and drank the blood of the millers when they came to mill their grains. Although he is usually said to have been the first Serbian vampire, there are claims that he was pre-dated in Serbian folklore by [[Petar Blagojevich|Petar Blagojević]] from [[Veliko Gradište]], who died in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zarozje.com/Sava.htm Folklore info about Sava Savanović on Zarozje.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Blagojević and the affair surrounding him came to European attention at the time, under the name Peter Plogojowitz, and represented one of the earliest examples of vampire hysteria.

Still, Sava Savanović remains today as the best known vampire in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Slavica Stuparušić | title = Došlo vreme za ćuvanje prirode | newspaper = [[Politika]]-Magazin No 1024 | pages = 26-27 | language = Serbian | date = 14 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Watermill ==

The watermill is located {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} from the Bajina Bašta-[[Valjevo]] road, in the deep valley of the Rogačica river.&lt;ref name=Politika&gt;{{Citation | author = Branko Pejović | title = Vampiru Savi uređuju vodenicu | trans-title = Watermill of Sava the Vampire has been restored | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 16 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the mill has been described as a "narrow and dark ravine".&lt;ref name=Politika2&gt;{{Citation | author = Branko Pejović | title = Projekat za vodenicu vampira Save | trans-title = Project for the vampire Sava's watermill | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 25 September 2017 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/389450/Projekat-za-vodenicu-vampira-Save }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the last several decades the watermill associated with Savanović has been owned by the Jagodić family, and is usually called "Jagodića vodenica" (''Jagodići's watermill'').&lt;ref name="politika"/&gt; It was in operation until the late 1950s. After its closure, it became a tourist site along with other attractions in [[Valjevo]] and nearby villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Srbija/197791/Antistres-vikend-s-vampirom Antistres vikend s vampirom], [[Blic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 2010s, the ownership problems were resolved and the local administration to reconstruct the watermill made of wood and stone, and adapt it into the proper tourist attraction. Plans also included that the watermill will be operational again, producing the flour named after Sava Savanović while the local farmers would sell honey and [[rakia]]. A construction of the proper road to which would connect it to the main one was also planned.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; Author of the reconstruction project was architect Aleksandar Gavović.&lt;ref name=Politika2/&gt;

The first finished project was the road, but just a month after it was completed, the mill collapsed in 2012.&lt;ref name=Politika1&gt;{{Citation | author = Branko Pejović | title = Srušila se vodenica vampira Save | trans-title = Vampire Sava's watermill collapsed | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 20 November 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/240541/Srusila-se-vodenica-vampira-Save }}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipal authorities issued a [[tongue-in-cheek]] public health warning, advising people that Savanović was now free to look for a new home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Sara C.|title=Vampire Sava Savanovic Is On The Loose, Serbian Village Council Warns (Seriously)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/03/vampire-sava-savanovic-serbian-council-warns-_n_2231171.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it was evident that it may collapse soon, but local authorities hoped it will make it to the reconstruction. The project of recreating the watermill in its authentic form was made, but there was a lack of funding.&lt;ref name=Politika1/&gt; Originally, only the roof collapsed but in the next years the wooden walls buckled, too.&lt;ref name=Politika2/&gt;

== In culture ==

Sava Savanović appears in the story ''Posle devedeset godina'' (''After Ninety Years''), written by the Serbian [[Literary realism|realist]] writer [[Milovan Glišić]], and in the [[horror film]] ''[[Leptirica]]'' inspired by the story. He also appears in the novel ''Strah i njegov sluga'' (''Fear and His Servant'') written by [[Mirjana Novaković]].

In January 2010, city of [[Valjevo]] selected the mythical Sava Savanović as the touristic mascot of the city and the entire [[Kolubara]] region. Zarožje and Valjevo are on the opposing sides of the [[Povlen]] mountain, but both claim Savanović as their brand. Local community of Zarožje threatened to sue the city, but ultimately only reported to the police in Bajina Bašta that Savanović was "stolen from them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/128399/Drustvo/Vampir-Sava-na-sudu | author = Budo Novović | title = Vampir Sava na sudu | trans-title = Sava the vampire at court | date = 21 March 2013 | publisher = Politika | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spirit of Australia''''' is a wooden [[speed boat]] built in a Sydney backyard, by [[Ken Warby]], that broke and set the world [[water speed record]] on 8 October 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenwarby.com/spirit_of_australia.htm |title=Spirit of Australia |website=kenwarby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/spirit_of_australia.htm |title=Spirit of Australia - Ken Warby |website=solarnavigator.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anmm.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1260&amp;c=856 |title=The world's fastest boat...Spirit of Australia |website=anmm.gov.au |publisher=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The record and boat ==

On 8 October 1978, [[Ken Warby]] drove ''Spirit of Australia'' on the [[Tumut River]] near the [[Blowering Dam]] in [[Australia]] to a speed of 317.596&amp;nbsp;mph (511.11&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name=gwr-warby-fastest&gt;{{cite web |title=Water speed record (fastest boat) |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/water-speed-record-(fastest-boat)/ |website=guinnessworldrecords.com |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uimpowerboating.com/vsite/vnavsite/page/directory/0,10853,4916-151354-168570-nav-list,00.html |title=Union of International Motorboating Record |website=uimpowerboating.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was powered by a [[Westinghouse J34]] [[jet engine]]. The engine was developed by the [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] in the late 1940s and was used for [[jet fighters]] and other [[aircraft]]. ''Spirit of Australia'' is displayed permanently at the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] in [[Darling Harbour]], [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].

{{Quote box
 |quote  =Built in a Sydney backyard in the 1970s the world's fastest boat Spirit of Australia is now a permanent feature at the Australian National Maritime Museum.

Ken Warby designed, built and drove Spirit of Australia to a phenomenal 511 km/h in the 1970s...and his world record still stands today.

By 1974 Spirit of Australia was launched and he was ready to start his first trials. Warby climbed into the cockpit and proved he had a great success - setting an Australian record of 267km/h, but a long way short of the 458.98 km/h world record.

Warby continued to trial his boat, gradually increasing his Australian record. On 20 November 1977 he first succeeded in breaking the world record, with a speed of 464.44 km/h, but shy of breaking the 500 km/h barrier he was ultimately seeking.

It wasn't until a year later, on 8 October 1978, that Ken smashed his own world record with an amazing time of 511.11 km/h on Blowering Dam near Tumut, NSW - setting a new world water speed record which has never been beaten.

Since 1978 there have been a number of attempts at breaking Warby's world water speed record. None has succeeded, some have been fatal.

'''''The Nature of Prejudice''''' is a 1954 book by American psychologist [[Gordon Allport]], considered to be a seminal work in [[social psychology]] on the topic of [[prejudice]].

==Impact and significance==
The book was already called a classic a decade after its initial publication, in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Albert I.|date=1965|title=Review of ''The Nature of Prejudice'' by Gordon W. Allport; ''The Religious Factor'' by Gerhard Lenski; ''Protestant, Catholic, Jew'' by Will Herberg; ''Religious Conflict in America'' by Earl Raab; ''American Race Relations Today'' by Earl Raab|journal=American Jewish Historical Quarterly|volume=55|issue=1|pages=107–109|jstor=23873648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irwin Katz, writing in ''[[Political Psychology]]'' in 1991 on the topic of "classics in political psychology", called the book a landmark and "one of the most influential and often-cited publications in the entire field of [[intergroup relations]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2016 Thomas F. Pettigrew and Kerstin Hammann described the book as "probably the most read volume in the history of social psychology", noting that it has received numerous translations and remains influential in the modern study of prejudice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Pettigrew, T. F., &amp; Hammann, K. Gordon Willard. 2016. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Pettigrew/publication/303366079_English_translation_of_Pettigrew_T_F_Hammann_K_Gordon_Willard_Allport_The_nature_of_prejudice_In_S_Salzborn_Ed_Klassiker_der_Sozialwissenshaften_Classics_of_social_science_Pp_174-178_Wiesbaden_Germany/links/573e63b908aea45ee842ec36/English-translation-of-Pettigrew-T-F-Hammann-K-Gordon-Willard-Allport-The-nature-of-prejudice-In-S-Salzborn-Ed-Klassiker-der-Sozialwissenshaften-Classics-of-social-science-Pp-174-178-Wiesbaden Allport: The nature of prejudice.] In S. Salzborn (Ed.), Klassiker der Sozialwissenshaften [Classics of social science]. Pp. 174-178. Wiesbaden, Germany: Springer. [English version].&lt;/ref&gt; In a volume published roughly on the fiftieth anniversary of the book's original debut, ''On the Nature of Prejudice: Fifty Years after Allport'' (2008), the authors referred to Allport's book as "the fundamental work for social psychology of prejudice" and the most widely cited work on the subject, still used in teaching and quoted in modern research.&lt;ref name="DovidioGlick2008"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDSyHPt98E0|title=On the Nature of Prejudice: Fifty Years after Allport|author1=John F.

Describing the book's significance, Katz noted that it "defined the field of intergroup relations for social psychologist as the study of prejudice and its effects on group interactions".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Irwin|date=1991|title=Gordon Allport's "The Nature of Prejudice"|journal=Political Psychology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=125–157|doi=10.2307/3791349|jstor=3791349}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted, however, that Allport's assumption that prejudice causes discrimination has still to be proven beyond doubt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though other scholars also stressed that many of other assumptions Allport expressed in the book have become accepted since its publication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dovidio|first=John F.|date=2001|title=On the Nature of Contemporary Prejudice: The Third Wave|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=829–849|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00244|issn=0022-4537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pettigrew and Hammann selected, as the book's most lasting contribution, its success in redefining the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice: while previously some scholars argued that contact between different groups leads to increased prejudice and conflict, Allport argued to the contrary, a view that Pettigrew and Hammann describe as supported by "literally hundreds of studies from dozens of nations".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another major influence of the book was the later formulation of the [[common ingroup identity]] theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pettigrew and Hammann also credit Allport's ideas with influencing government policies, in the [[United States]] and elsewhere, which have successfully reduced levels of prejudice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another idea introduced in the book became known as [[Allport's Scale]], a measure of prejudice starting from [[antilocution]] and ending up at [[Genocide|genocidal extermination]]. In simpler terms, Allport argued that even simple prejudice, if left unchecked, can develop into an extreme form.&lt;ref name="BrynSteve2017"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CvPBDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|title=Leading Policing in Europe: An Empirical Study of Strategic Police Leadership|author1=Caless, Bryn|author2=Tong, Steve|date=18 January 2017|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=978-1-4473-1574-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being highly influential in the field of social psychology, the revised (and shortened) second edition of the book (''The Nature of Prejudice: Abridged'') published in 1958 was also a success on the mass market, being written in a relatively simple way that was accessible to a general readership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of the reasons for its success, in Pettigrew and Hammann's opinion, was the boldness of its topic: while targeting a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|white, Protestant, American]], and mostly male readership, it discussed numerous examples of anti-African-American, anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic, and anti-female prejudices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">"'''The longest suicide note in history'''" is an [[wiktionary:epithet|epithet]] originally used by United Kingdom [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] [[Gerald Kaufman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3059773.stm | title = Foot's message of hope to left | accessdate = 2008-09-13 | last = Mann  | first = Nyta | date = 2003-07-14 | publisher = [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his party's [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] manifesto, which emphasised [[Socialism in the United Kingdom|socialist]] policies in a more profound manner than previous such documents – and which Kaufman felt would ensure that the Labour Party (then in opposition) would fail to win the election.

==The document==
''The New Hope for Britain''&lt;ref name="ManifestoText"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/lab83.htm | title = The New Hope for Britain: British Labour Party election manifesto, 1983 | accessdate = 2008-09-13 | year = 1983 | publisher = Keele University Political Science Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a 39-page booklet&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WCl6OAAACAAJThe New Hope for Britain: Labour's Manifesto 1983], {{ISBN|0861171047}}&lt;/ref&gt; which called for [[unilateralism|unilateral]] [[nuclear disarmament]]; higher personal taxation for the rich; withdrawal from the [[European Economic Community]]; [[Reform of the House of Lords#Abolition|abolition of the House of Lords]]; and the re-nationalisation of recently [[Privatization|privatised]] industries like [[BT Group|British Telecom]], [[British Aerospace]], and the [[British Shipbuilders|British Shipbuilders Corporation]].  The manifesto was based on an earlier and much longer policy paper with a similar title, ''Labour's Plan: the New Hope for Britain''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Nhq1g1WYmEC&amp;pg=PA613 Britain in Transition: The Twentieth Century], Alfred F. Havighurst, {{ISBN|0226319717}}, p.613&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithet referred not only to the orientation of the policies, but also to their marketing. [[List of United Kingdom Labour Party leaders|Labour leader]] [[Michael Foot]] decided as a statement on internal democracy that the manifesto would consist of all resolutions arrived at in its [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|party conference]].

The document's more left-wing policies, along with the popularity gained by Conservative Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] over the successful outcome of the [[Falklands War]] and the division of the opposition vote between the left-wing Labour Party and the [[centrism|centrist]] [[SDP–Liberal Alliance|Social Democratic Party – Liberal Alliance]], composed of breakaway Labour MPs on the right-wing of the party; contributed to a victory with a substantial majority in Parliament for the [[right-wing]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm|title=1983: Thatcher triumphs again|work=BBC Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defeat was Labour's worst result since [[1918 UK general election|1918]], and led to a turning point in the history of the party- which thereafter gradually moved to the centre under the leadership of [[Neil Kinnock]] then, under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] in the 1990s; rebranded itself as "[[New Labour]]" and [[Third Way]], leading to a landslide victory at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], fourteen years and two general election defeats later.

==Other uses of the phrase==
It has subsequently been used by [[Peter Gutmann (computer scientist)|Peter Gutmann]] in his paper "A Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection" to describe the [[digital rights management]] schemes in the [[Windows Vista]] operating system.&lt;ref name="vista-cost" &gt;{{cite paper

  |authorlink=Peter Gutmann (computer scientist)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch [[VVD]] politician [[Mark Rutte]] used the phrase in reference to the election programme of the [[Dutch Labour Party]], during the [[Dutch general election, 2010|May 2010 parliamentary election campaign]], deliberately echoing Kaufman.&lt;ref name="elsevierrutte" &gt;{{cite paper
  |author=Jeroen Langelaar

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Charles Krauthammer]] compared the 2012 Republican House Budget to the manifesto (in terms of comparable unpopularity) and then remarked about the House Budget, "At 37 footnotes, it might be the most annotated suicide note in history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/after_ryans_leap_a_rush_of_deficit_demagoguery/2011/04/07/AFUfOXxC_story.html?wprss=rss_opinions | work=The Washington Post | date=2011-04-07 | first=Charles | last=Krauthammer|title=After Ryan’s leap, a rush of deficit demagoguery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoconservative]] writer [[David Frum]] compared ''[[The Path to Prosperity]]'' proposed by congressman [[Paul Ryan]] in a similar light, saying "This is how a great political party was impelled to base a presidential campaign on the Ryan plan—a plan that has now replaced the 1983 manifesto of the British Labour Party as 'the longest suicide note in history'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/08/seven-habits-of-highly-ineffective-political-parties-part-one.html | work=The Daily Beast | date=2013-10-08 | first=David | last=Frum|title=Seven Habits of Highly Ineffective Political Parties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour's decision in 2015 to engrave promises for the upcoming election on a large stone monument nicknamed the "[[EdStone]]" was within hours dubbed the "heaviest suicide note in history".&lt;ref name="Ed Miliband's manifesto monolith 'is a Kinnock moment'"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holehouse|first1=Matthew|last2=Rothwell|first2=James|title=Ed Miliband's manifesto monolith 'is a Kinnock moment'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/11580062/Ed-Miliband-will-install-limestone-manifesto-monument-in-Downing-Street.html|website=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tower Hamlets Local History Library and Archives''' is a facility provided by the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] to enable members of the public to consult books and records in their collection. It is located at Bancroft Road Library.

The facility is located in a building which was formerly the Mile End Old Town Vestry Hall built in 1862. The building was converted into a library in 1902 with money from [[Carnegie library|Andrew Carnegie]].&lt;ref name="MD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stepney’s Early Town Halls: ‘fine commodious buildings’ |url=https://municipaldreams.wordpress.com/2015/07/14/stepneys-early-town-halls/ |website=Municipal Dreams |accessdate=1 October 2018 |date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threat of closure in 2008==
In 2008 the Library and Archives were under threat from a proposal to close the library. A community campaign was started to save the library with a meeting held on 27 September 2008 to urge Councillors not to proceed with the plans. This was addressed by [[Stan Newens]] (local historian and former MEP), [[Bernard Kops]] and [[Jerry White (historian)|Jerry White]].&lt;ref name=SBL&gt;{{cite web|title=Save Bancroft Library Latest News |url=http://www.savebancroftlibrary.org.uk/id2.html |website=savebancroftlibrary.org.uk |accessdate=20 December 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106191035/http://www.savebancroftlibrary.org.uk/id2.html |archivedate=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was ultimately successful.

'''''The Tribuna of the Uffizi''''' (1772–1778) by [[Johan Zoffany]] is a painting of the north-east section of the [[Tribuna of the Uffizi|Tribuna]] room in the [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The painting is part of the United Kingdom's [[Royal Collection]].

==Production==
Johan Zoffany was a German-born painter who had become successful in London. One of his principal patrons was the Royal family. In the summer of 1772, Zoffany left London for Florence with a commission from [[Queen Charlotte]] to paint 'the Florence Gallery'.  (Neither she nor her husband [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] ever visited Italy in person.) The agreed price was high and Zoffany was paid £300.&lt;ref name=royal&gt;Royal Collection from Shawe-Taylor 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felton Hervey]], who had a large art collection and who knew the Royal family, met Zoffany in Florence. He was included in a prominent position in the painting by December 1772.&lt;ref name="painting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/851824 |title=The Hon. Felton Hervey (1712-1775) |work=National Trust Collections |publisher=National Trust  |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoffany was still working on the painting late in 1777; he only finally returned to England in 1779.&lt;ref name=royal/&gt; By this time Hervey had died.&lt;ref name="painting"/&gt;

==Artworks shown==
Zoffany has varied the arrangement of the artworks and introduced others from elsewhere in the [[House of Medici|Medici]] collection. He gained special privileges, with the help of [[George Clavering-Cowper, 3rd Earl Cowper|George, 3rd Earl Cowper]], and [[Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet]], such as having seven paintings, including Raphael's Madonna della Sedia, temporarily brought in from the [[Pitti Palace]] so that he could paint them in situ in the Tribuna. In thanks, Zoffany included a portrait of Cowper looking at his recent acquisition,&lt;ref name=key&gt;Farber 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael's [[Niccolini-Cowper Madonna]] (Cowper hoped to sell it on to George III; it is now in the Washington [[National Gallery of Art]]), with Zoffany holding it (to the left of the Dancing Faun).

The unframed ''Samian Sibyl'' on the floor was acquired for the Medici collection in 1777. It was a workshop copy of the pendant to [[Guercino]]'s ''[[Libyan Sibyl]]'', recently bought by George III, and may be intended as a compliment to him.

===Sculptures and other===
Today Medici's Ancient Roman statues are mostly in the main corridors of the Uffizi Gallery, except those which are still in the Tribuna, and except the smaller busts and statuettes (some antique, some pseudo-antique), owned by the [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)|National Archaeological Museum]] and permanently displayed at [[Villa Corsini a Castello]], near Florence. Many of those painted by Zoffany are still to be identified, though. Other antiquities (Etruscan, Egyptian, Greek) are mostly in the National Archaeological Museum. Some very few Renaissance pieces from the Tribuna are now in the [[Bargello Museum]].

All of the connoisseurs, diplomats and visitors to Florence portrayed are identifiable, making the painting a combination of the British 18th-century [[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation piece]] or informal group portrait genre, with that of the predominantly Flemish 17th-century tradition of gallery views and [[wunderkammer]]s. However, this inclusion of so many recognisable portraits led to criticism at the time by Zoffany's royal patrons, and by Horace Walpole, who called it "a flock of travelling boys, and one does not know nor care whom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Yale edition of Horace Walpole's correspondence  |volume=24 |pages=526–7 |chapterurl=http://images.library.yale.edu/hwcorrespondence/page.asp?vol=24&amp;page=526 |chapter=To MANN, Friday 12 November 1779 |editor-first=W.S. |editor-last=Lewis |year=1967|publisher=[[Lewis Walpole Library]] |location=Yale |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first group of people is around the Niccolini Madonna. From left, standing up, there are [[George Clavering-Cowper, 3rd Earl Cowper|George, 3rd earl of Cowper]], Sir [[John Dick (1720-1804)|John Dick]] [[Dick baronets|baronet of Braid]], [[Other Windsor, 6th Earl of Plymouth]], and [[Johann Zoffany]], the painter itself, followed on the other side of the painting by Mr. Stevenson and his companion [[George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth]], while is sitting on a chair [[Charles Loraine Smith]] and behind him, bended, [[Richard Edgcumbe, 2nd Earl of Mount Edgcumbe|Richard Edgcumbe]], later 2nd Earl of Mount Edgcumbe.

Two more connoisseurs are near the ''Satiro''. The first is reported to be [[Joseph Leeson, 2nd Earl of Milltown]], even if his portrait does not match in age and resemblance those in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]] by [[Pompeo Batoni]], and [[Valentine Knightley (painter)|Valentine Knightley]] of Fawsley. 

Further to the center of the painting [[Pietro Bastianelli]], curator of the Uffizi Gallery, shows the Venus of Urbino di Titian to John Gordon,{{#tag:ref|Described in contemporary Italian newspapers as "Mr. Gordon, an English official".&lt;ref name="nicholls152"&gt;Cited in Nicholls 2006, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;[[John Chambers (topographer)|John Chambers]] wrote in 1829 that Rev.

The sitting man, looking back towards, is the Hon. [[Felton Hervey]]. 

The group around the ''Medici Venus'' include [[John Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea]], Mr. Wilbraham (one of the sons of [[Roger Wilbraham]] of Natwich), Mr. Watts, Mr. Doughty and, on the orther side, Thomas Wilbraham (the second son) and [[James Bruce]].

'''United States Ship''' (abbreviated as '''USS''' or '''U.S.S.''') is a [[ship prefix]] used to identify a [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] ship of the [[United States Navy]] and applies to a ship only while it is in commission. Before commissioning, the vessel may be referred to as a "[[pre-commissioning unit]]" (PCU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Navy Christens Guided-Missile Destroyer ''Michael Murphy''

From the early beginnings of the U.S. Navy there had been no standard method of referring to U.S. Navy ships until 1907 when President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 549 on 8 January stating that all US Navy ships were to be referred to as "The name of such vessel, preceded by the words, United States Ship, or the letters U.S.S., and by no other words or letters".&lt;ref Name="USNSN" /&gt;

Today's Navy Regulations define the classification and status of naval ships and craft:

#The Chief of Naval Operations shall be responsible for ... the assignment of classification for administrative purposes to water-borne craft and the designation of status for each ship and service craft. ....
#Commissioned vessels and craft shall be called "United States Ship" or "U.S.S."
#Civilian manned ships, of the [[Military Sealift Command]] or other commands, designated "active status, in service" shall be called "United States Naval Ship" or "U.S.N.S."
#Ships and service craft designated "active status, in service," except those described by paragraph 3 of this article, shall be referred to by name, when assigned, classification, and hull number (e.g., "HIGH POINT PCH-1" or "YOGN-8").
::— United States Navy Regulations, 1990, Article 0406.&lt;ref Name="USNSN" /&gt;
