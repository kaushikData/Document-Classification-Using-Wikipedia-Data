In mid-October 1895, [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[Emperor Franz Joseph]] visited [[Zagreb]], at the time the capital of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], in order to attend the opening of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]]. A group of Croatian students used the visit to protest the rule of the Hungarian [[Károly Khuen-Héderváry]] as Croatian ban. They were led by [[Stjepan Radić]], who would later form the influential [[Croatian People's Peasant Party]].

==Events==
[[File:Slavoluk Zagreb 1895..jpg|thumb|left|The main triumphal arch, erected for the occasion, was decorated with a Hungarian flag, which was widely resented among the Croatian opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Racko|1990|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The emperor arrived in Zagreb by train on October 14, 1895. Upon his arrival a group of students chanted "Slava Jelačiću" ("Glory to Jelačić"), in reference to the former Croatian ban [[Josip Jelačić]] who had risen up against the Hungarians in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848]]. That day the emperor attended the unveiling ceremonial completion of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]].&lt;ref name="HNK"&gt;[http://public.carnet.hr/HNK/sto/txt/1895.html 1895 at the Croatian National Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; Music by [[Ivan Zajc]] was subsequently performed inside the theatre. 

The following day, the emperor attended an honorary dance at the ''Kolo'' building.&lt;ref name="HNK"/&gt; On this day a group of students led by [[Stjepan Radić]] planned a burning of the [[Hungarian flag|Hungarian tricolour]]. 

On October 16, the final day of the imperial visit, the students marched to [[Ban Jelačić Square]] where they chanted "Živio hrvatski kralj Franjo Josip I" ("Long live Croatian king Franz Joseph I"), "Slava Jelačiću" and "Abzug Magjari" ("Away with Hungarians"). They doused the Hungarian tricolour in [[brandy]] and set it on fire. They then marched towards the [[University of Zagreb]]. The city police soon informed ban Khuen-Héderváry of the act and the students were arrested.

==Aftermath==
The students were subsequently charged for the incident. [[Stjepan Radić]] was sentenced to six months in jail, Gjuro Balaško to five, and Milan Dorwald, Osman Hadžić, [[Vladimir Vidrić]], Josip Šikutrić, Vladimir Frank and Ivan Fran to four months. The students were all barred from the University of Zagreb while Stjepan Radić was barred from all universities in the empire. This led him to continue his studies abroad in [[Paris]]. The other students went to the [[Charles University in Prague]] and the [[University of Vienna]]. 

These students would form the basis of the Croatian Moderna, a cultural and political movement active at the turn of the century, characterized by anti-traditionalism, [[cosmopolitanism]], and focus on artistic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=41458|title=moderna|encyclopedia=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography]]|location=Zagreb|language=hr|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, the [[Prague]] group of students began publishing ''Hrvatska misao'', while in 1898 the [[Vienna]] students began publishing ''Mladost''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moje-instrukcije.com/lekcije/hrvatski/Hrvatska%20knjizevnost%20moderne.pdf Croatian literary moderna]{{better source|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag burning also resulted in a split between the [[Party of Rights (1861-1929)|Croatian Party of Rights]] and the [[Croatian Party of Rights (disambiguation)|Croatian Pure Party of Rights]] who disagreed on the flag-burning.{{fact|date=January 2015}}

'''Asher Weisgan''' (1966 – December 22, 2006) was an Israeli bus driver who shot and murdered four [[Palestinians]] and injured two others in the [[Israeli settlement]] of [[Shilo, Mateh Binyamin|Shiloh]] in the [[West Bank]] on 17 August 2005. Weisgan wanted to disrupt the [[Israeli Government]]'s [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|unilateral disengagement plan]] in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] by sparking a Palestinian reaction.&lt;ref name=SENTENCING&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/112738 | title=Court Sentences Samaria Jew To Life In Prison | date=27 September 2006 | publisher=Arutz Sheva 7 | accessdate=3 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LIFE&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5386144.stm | title=Life sentences for W Bank killer | date=27 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=3 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 2006, Weisgan was sentenced by the Israeli court to four consecutive terms of life in prison, for each person he killed, and an additional twelve years in jail. Later that year, he committed suicide by hanging himself in prison.

== Victims ==
Weisgan, who lived in the Israeli settlement of [[Shvut Rachel]], had known two of his targets, Bassam and Usama Tawafsha from the neighbouring Palestinian hillside village of Sanjal, for eight years. The shooting rampage, executed with premeditation and in cold blood, according to the court, occurred while he was giving both them and another victim a lift home from work. He stole a security guard's gun and opened fire, shooting four Palestinians several times, and then reloading to seek out and shoot a fifth victim at his work-place. After the killing spree he either turned himself in to,&lt;ref name=SUICIDE&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel/Jewish-terrorist-commits-suicide-in-jail | title=Jewish terrorist commits suicide in jail | newspaper=Jerusalem Post | date=22 December 2006 | accessdate=3 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or was overpowered by&lt;ref name=COMMUNITY&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4164534.stm | title=Settler shooting shatters community | date=18 August 2005 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=3 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;, security guards at the settlement. He killed four Palestinians: Khalil Muhammad Ra'uf Saleh Wleiwel, Ahmad 'Ali Hassan Mansur, Bassam Mussa Ahmad 'Odeh Tawafshah, and Osama Mussa Ahmad 'Odeh Tawafshah. A fifth was wounded.

In the aftermath, Usama's wife Aisha called for revenge against [[Israel]], the settlers and the then [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]], saying,&lt;blockquote&gt;When one of them kills us they say he is crazy, but if an Arab does that to a settler the whole world is up in arms saying he's a terrorist. They had worked with him (Weisgan) for eight years. They used to say how decent he was, how they used to eat together, how he used to ask them for our food to take to his wife.&lt;ref name="COMMUNITY"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Weisgan worked as a bus-driver, transporting Palestinian labourers to the Shvut Rachel settlement's aluminum factory, where the victims were employed. The ''[[Haaretz]]'' newspaper quoted Weisgan having declared, before entering a courthouse outside of [[Tel Aviv]], 'I'm not sorry for what I did. I hope someone also kills Sharon.'&lt;ref name=NOTSORRY&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtStEng.jhtml?itemNo=613936&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;title='Haaretz%20-%20Israel%20News' Man who killed 4 Palestinians: I hope someone kills Sharon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001131428/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtStEng.jhtml?itemNo=613936&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;title='Haaretz%20-%20Israel%20News' |date=1 October 2007 }}  Haaretz, 18 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and conviction ==
Weisgan was tried in the Jerusalem District Court, and convicted on 11 September 2006. On 27 September 2006, Weisgan was sentenced four consecutive terms of life in prison for each person he killed, an additional 12 years in prison for injuring another Palestinian, and was ordered to pay [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]] 220,000 in damages to the families of each murder victim and an additional NIS 100,000 to the wounded victim.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3343315,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The judges ruled: &lt;blockquote&gt;Every one of the victims had a name and an identity... They were the immediate victims of the convicted man's actions and he must be punished for the murders of each and every one of them. It was a savage murder of innocents, who fell victim to the twisted logic of the accused.&lt;ref name=LIFE/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; Weisgan said he had no regrets about his actions because they were a 'necessary defence' of the Israeli people. He expressed the hope that [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]] would be assassinated.&lt;ref name=SENTENCING/&gt;&lt;ref name=LIFE/&gt;

== Death ==
On December 22, 2006, Weisgan committed suicide by hanging himself in prison.&lt;ref name=SUICIDE/&gt;

'''Andrew Oldcorn''' (born 31 March 1960) is a Scottish [[professional golfer]].

Oldcorn was born in [[Bolton]], Lancashire, England. He was raised in [[Edinburgh]], and represents [[Scotland]]. He represented England as an amateur and won the [[English Amateur]] in 1982, turning professional after playing for Great Britain &amp; Ireland in the [[1983 Walker Cup]].

Oldcorn was medalist at the [[European Tour]] final [[European Tour Qualifying School|Qualifying School]] in 1983. He had a steady start to his career on tour before being struck down with [[Myalgic Encephalomyelitis|ME]] (also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_11-editionID_63-ArticleID_257-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist%5Ccfs.pdf |title=CFS: A suitable case for treatment |date=1 May 1998 |pages=223–6 |volume=11 |issue=5 |last=Spencer |first=P |format=pdf |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ETbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/players/playerid=143/bio/index.html |title=European Tour biography |publisher=PGA European Tour |accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to form in 1993, to claim his first tour victory in the [[Turespana Masters Open de Andalucia]]. Away from the tour he also won the Sunderland of Scotland Masters. Several solid years followed along with another title, the 1995 [[DHL Jersey Open]]. The undoubted highlight of his career came in 2001 when he became the oldest winner in the history of the [[Volvo PGA Championship]] (although [[Miguel Ángel Jiménez]] would later beat that record).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/oldcorn-trades-rags-for-riches-in-inspiring-win-686309.html |title=Oldcorn trades rags for riches in inspiring win |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=29 May 2001 |location=London |first=Andy |last=Farrell |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished that season a career best 26th place on the European Tour Order of Merit.

Since turning 50, Oldcorn has primarily been playing on the [[Senior major golf championships|senior golf]] tours, having won twice on the [[European Senior Tour]].

Her publishing activities helped to establish photography as an art discipline within the country.

== Biography ==
Fárová was born in 1928 in [[Paris]], [[France]], to a Czech diplomat, [[Miloš Šafránek]], and a [[French people|French]] professor, Anne Moussu.&lt;ref name=rp&gt;{{cite news|first=Jan|last=Richter|title=Art historian Anna Fárová dies at 81 |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/125554 |work=[[Radio Prague]]|publisher=|date=2010-03-02 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent a part of her early childhood in Paris, the family moved to [[Plzeň]], [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938)|Czechoslovakia]] only in the middle of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Fárová (2010), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Following her studies at the [[France|French]] [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Prague she continued studying art history and [[aesthetics]] at the Faculty of Arts of the [[Charles University in Prague]].&lt;ref name="mfdnes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kultura.idnes.cz/zemrela-kunsthistoricka-anna-farova-ktera-zila-pro-fotografii-p7o-/vytvarneum.asp?c=A100301_101840_vytvarneum_jaz|title=Zemřela kunsthistorička Anna Fárová, která žila pro fotografii|date=2010-03-01|publisher=Mladá fronta DNES|language=Czech|accessdate=3 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100302205910/http://kultura.idnes.cz/zemrela-kunsthistoricka-anna-farova-ktera-zila-pro-fotografii-p7o-/vytvarneum.asp?c=A100301_101840_vytvarneum_jaz| archivedate= 2 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fárová began her studies at the Charles University in 1948.

==Life==
Benjamin Quartey-Papafio was born into a leading [[Accra]] family: his parents were ''Akwashotse'' {{Clarify|date=March 2010}} Chief William Quartey-Papafio, also known as Nii Kwatei or "Old Papafio", and Momo Omedru, a businesswoman from Gbese (Dutch Accra) and [[Amanokrom]] [[Akuapem]].

He was educated at the [[Church Mission Society|C.M.S.]] Grammar School and [[Fourah Bay College]] in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], before travelling to study in Britain. Gaining a B.A. degree from [[Durham University]], he entered [[Edinburgh University]] as a medical student in 1882, earning his [[Bachelor of Medicine|M.B.]] and [[M.Ch.]] in 1886 and becoming a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]].&lt;ref name=Doortmont/&gt;

He was the first African to receive a medical degree in the Gold Coast

Returning to the Gold Coast, he was a medical officer for the Gold Coast Government Service from 1888 until 1905, and was also in private practice.&lt;ref name=Doortmont/&gt; Quartey-Papafio had three children by Hannah Maria Ekua Duncan, of a [[Cape Coast]]/[[Elmina]] family; on 8 October 1896 at [[St Bartholomew-the-Great]] Church in [[Smithfield, London]], he married Eliza Sabina Meyer,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Green]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=c-Y5CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=Benjamin+Quartey-Papafio&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zZC2KF6NZF&amp;sig=jvihleZs6xjM9IiH14rEAiOUSyc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwD2oVChMI0cbHlqqOyQIVx8AUCh0zEAjE#v=onepage&amp;q=Benjamin%20Quartey-Papafio&amp;f=false ''Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, a Musical Life''], Routledge, 2015, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of Richard Meyer of Accra, and the couple had six children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karin Barber]], ''Africa's Hidden Histories: Everyday Literacy and Making the Self'', Indiana University Press, 2006, p. 316. {{ISBN|978-0253218438}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 19 October 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the Accra Town Council from 1909 to 1912,&lt;ref name=Doortmont/&gt; he was a member of the 1911 deputation to [[London]] that protested the [[Forest Bill]].&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Jeffrey P.

==Family==
Quartey-Papafio's son and five daughters were educated in Britain: Mercy, Ruby and Grace became teachers in the Gold Coast.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; His son, Percy, trained as a doctor but was unable to practise due to failing eyesight caused by [[cataracts]]. Dr. B.W.Quartey-Papafio, Nene Sir Emmanuel Mante-Kole, K.B.E (Konor of Manya Krobo), Dr.F.V.Nanka-Bruce, Hon. Sir Thomas Hutton-Mills, along with Nana Sir Ofori Atta (Omanhene of Akim Abuakwa), Nana Amonoo, F.J.P Brown of Cape Coast, J.Ephraim Casely-Hayford of [[Sekondi]] were architects of founding of [[Achimota College]].
Dr. Ruby directed her efforts and passion into being an Economist and an accomplished Headmistress at Accra Girls High School. In addition to ghost-writing and being of great assistance to the late Kwame Nkrumah and his cohorts/co-nationalists actualization of Ghana's independence,  Mercy's pacesetting genes also resulted in her being appointed as the first Ghanaian headmistress at Achimota. After achieving highly accredited fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons, her only child Nana ffoulkes Crabbe Johnson continued the distinctions of leadership by being the first Ghanaian Professor and Head of Department in a foreign medical institution and female President of the [[West African College of Surgeons]]

'''Bernard Haisch''' is a German-born American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] who has done research in solar-stellar astrophysics and [[stochastic electrodynamics]].&lt;ref name=BHAISCH&gt;{{cite web| title = UFO EVIDENCE: UFO Researchers &amp; People- Bernard Haisch , Ph.D.| url=http://www.ufoevidence.org/researchers/detail76.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has developed with Alfonso Rueda a speculative theory that the non-zero lowest energy state of the [[vacuum]], as predicted by [[quantum mechanics]], might provide a physical explanation for the origin of [[inertia]], and might someday be used for [[spacecraft propulsion]]. Haisch has advocated the serious scientific study of [[fringe science|phenomena outside the traditional scope of science]] and is known for his interest in the [[UFO]] phenomenon as well as a variety of other unorthodox topics.

Since 2002 Haisch has been involved with [[ManyOne Networks]] and related [[Digital Universe]] projects which aim to produce, among other things, a multimedia [[online encyclopedia]]. In 2006 Haisch published a popular book in which he attempted to reconcile modern scientific belief with traditional religious belief. He attributes his spiritual interests to his educational experience at the [[Latin School of Indianapolis]] (a high school affiliated with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]), and at the [[Saint Meinrad School of Theology|St. Meinrad Seminary]] and [[Archabbey]].

==Scientific career==

Haisch was born in [[Stuttgart, Germany]] and earned a Ph.D. in [[Astronomy]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1975 and thereafter spent three years as a postdoctoral fellow at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]].

Haisch has worked at the Solar &amp; Astrophysics Laboratory at [[Lockheed Martin]] in [[Palo Alto, California]] and served as deputy director of the Center for Extreme Ultraviolet Astrophysics Laboratory at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He has been a visiting scientist at the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] in [[Garching]], [[Germany]] and at the [[University of Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]]. His main research from the mid 1970s until the late 1990s was high energy astrophysics, and specifically the [[ultraviolet]] and [[X-ray]] emissions from [[corona]]e and [[solar flares|flares]] on the [[Sun]] and other [[stellar classification|late-type stars]].

Haisch has published more than one hundred research papers on a variety of topics, many in prestigious journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[Physical Review]]'', ''[[Astrophysical Journal]]'', and ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''. He also served for ten years as an editor of the ''Astrophysical Journal''.

===The Quantum Vacuum and the Principle of Inertia===

In an extensive series of papers, Haisch and Alfonso Rueda, a physicist currently teaching in the Department of Electrical Engineering, [[California State University]], [[Long Beach, California]], have developed a controversial hypothesis in the context of [[stochastic electrodynamics]]. In his recent mainstream non-academic book (see section below), Haisch has summarized this "quantum vacuum inertia" hypothesis as follows:
{{quotation|There exists a background sea of quantum light filling the universe and that light generates a force that opposes acceleration when you push on any material object. That is why matter seems to be solid, stable stuff that we, and the world, are made of. So maybe matter resists acceleration not because it possesses some innate thing called mass as Newton proposed and we all believed, but because the [[zero-point field]] exerts a force whenever acceleration takes place.|Bernard Haisch, ''The God Theory''}}

This assertion, that [[Accelerated reference frame|accelerated observers]] experience a [[force (physics)|force]] due to the zero-point field, and that this "electromagnetic reaction force" is responsible for the inertia of material objects, rests upon a computation in which Haisch and Rueda have computed a nonzero ''"zero point field [[Poynting vector]]"''. (See the 1998 ''Foundations of Physics'' paper cited below.)

Computations by other physicists, such as [[Bill Unruh]], apparently contradict this result. The mainstream view is that the zero point field does not give rise to a physical force on observers accelerating with respect to "the vacuum". However, it is known classically that without the zero point field the spin state of all matter would collapse inward almost instantaneously.

===Non-mainstream publications===

Haisch is a former editor of the [[Journal of Scientific Exploration]], which publishes papers on "topics outside the established disciplines of mainstream science" such as [[paranormal]] effects, the UFO phenomenon, and [[cryptid]]s.

In addition to papers in mainstream journals and conference proceedings, Haisch has also published papers in ''[[Science &amp; Spirit]]'' magazine and the ''Journal of Noetic Sciences'', a [[parapsychological]] journal published by the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]].

==Other ventures==

===California Institute for Physics and Astrophysics===

In 1999 Haisch founded the [http://calphysics.org California Institute for Physics and Astrophysics] in [[Palo Alto, California]], an organization mainly devoted to the study of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum and funded by private philanthropic money. The institute formerly employed five full-time physicists doing research on [[string theory]], [[general relativity]] and [[stochastic electrodynamics]]. Haisch served as the institute's director from 1999 until 2002.

===UFO Skeptic===

Haisch has also created a website called [http://ufoskeptic.org UFO Skeptic], which promotes the investigation of the UFO phenomenon by professional scientists.

===''The God Theory''===

In 2006, Haisch published a book entitled ''The God Theory'', in which he writes
{{quotation|I offer a genuine insight into how you can, and should, be a rational, science-believing human being and at the same time know that you are also an immortal spiritual being, a spark of God. I propose a worldview that offers a way out of the hate and fear-driven violence engulfing the planet.|Bernard Haisch, ''The God Theory''}}

Haisch published a follow-up in 2010, 'Purpose Guided Universe'. Both books reject both [[atheism]] and traditional theistic viewpoints, favoring instead a model of [[Pandeism]] wherein our Creator has become our Universe, to share in the actualized experiences therein manifested.  Haisch provides as proof of his views a combination of fine tuning and mystical experiences arguments.
{{quotation|Advances are made by answering questions. Discoveries are made by questioning answers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegodtheory.com/ thegodtheory.com]&lt;/ref&gt;|Bernard Haisch}}

===Digital Universe===

In 2002 Haisch became Chief Science Officer of ManyOne Networks. Since 2004 he also served as president of the now defunct [[Digital Universe Foundation]], which, among other things, aimed to create a peer-reviewed alternative to [[English Wikipedia]], seeking to provide a comprehensive and reliable account of current mainstream scientific theory, evidence, and belief.

Callippus was an Athenian who became a student of [[Plato]].&lt;ref name="Smith p. 574"/&gt;   As the future tyrant of Syracuse, Dion, who was also a student of Plato, recruited Callippus as a member of his army which successfully invaded Syracuse.  The army marched into Syracuse with 800 mercenaries and took control of the city, disposing of the previous tyrant, Dion’s nephew [[Dionysius II of Syracuse|Dionysius II]].

==Assassination and rise to power==
In exile, Dionysius bribed Callippus to kill Dion,&lt;ref name="Plut. Dion. 28-58"&gt;Plut. Dion. 28-58&lt;/ref&gt; and Callippus accepted the offer.  He was in a prime position to assassinate Dion, since most of Dion’s closest friends had been killed by Dionysius the Younger, and Callippus was his closest friend remaining.

Callippus used the money from Dionysius to [[bribe]] some of Dion’s troops to defect to him.&lt;ref name="Plut. Dion. 28-58"/&gt;  He then won Dion’s trust by betraying some of the soldiers to Dion, who then enlisted Callippus’s as a [[secret agent]] to discover further plotters.  In addition, whenever men told Dion that Callippus was maligning him, Dion simply thought that Callippus was acting as a spy.

Shortly afterwards, Dion’s only son fell from a window and died.&lt;ref name="Plut. Dion. 28-58"/&gt;  Callippus spread a rumor saying that Dion had invited Dionysius’s son, [[Apollocrates]] to come to Syracuse as Dion’s successor.  Dion’s wife, Arete, and sister, Aristomache, discovered the Callippus’s plot against Dion, but Dion was still paralyzed with remorse from his son’s death, and refused to take action.

Arete and Aristomache further inquired about the plot against Dion, and when Callippus discovered their inquisitiveness, he approached them and told them that he was loyal, and that he would prove his loyalty.  They told him to take the Great Oath, involving a ceremony in [[Persephone|Persephone’s]] temple, which he took.  Following the ceremony, Callippus broke his vow and stabbed Dion to death, whereupon Callippus took control of Syracuse.

==Rule==
Following Dion’s assassination, Callippus sent a message to Athens bragging of his deeds,&lt;ref name="Plut. Dion. 28-58"/&gt; but despite his bluster, Callippus’s hold on Syracuse was tenuous.  Friends of Dion attempted a revolt against him, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Smith p. 574"/&gt;  Callippus also had Arete and Aristomache thrown in prison, where Arete gave birth to Dion’s son.  But due to his rising unpopularity, Callippus did not have Dion's son killed, despite the danger he posed.

==Fall==
Several different accounts are given of how Callippus fell from power in Syracuse.  According to [[Diodorus Siculus]],&lt;ref&gt;Diod. Sic. xvi. 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hipparinus (Sicilian tyrant)|Hipparinus]], a son of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius the Elder]], a previous tyrant of Syracuse, attacked Syracuse with a fleet and army, after which Callippus fled from the city.  According to [[Polyaenus]],&lt;ref name="Poly v. 4"&gt;Polyaenus v. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparinus was staying in [[Lentini|Leontini]] when Callippus had sent out his army.  Hipparinus attacked while most of the army was gone and secured control of the city.

According to [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref name="Plut. Dion. 28-58"/&gt; Callippus does lose control of the city while he is absent, on an expedition to conquer [[Catania|Catana]].  But in Plutarch’s version Hipparinus is not mentioned, and instead Syracuse revolted against Callippus.

==Mercenary leadership and death==
Callippus then attempted to conquer [[Messina, Italy|Messina]] instead, but his army was defeated. With his remaining troops he wandered around Sicily, but finding himself unable to support himself he traveled to Italy.&lt;ref name="Poly v. 4"/&gt;  There he conquered [[Reggio Calabria|Rhegium]], which had previously been controlled by Dionysius the Younger.  But because he mistreated his mercenaries, his comrades [[Leptines II]] and Polyperchon stabbed him to death with a sword, reputed to be the same sword that killed Dion.&lt;ref name="Plut. Dion. 28-58"/&gt;

'''Carlos Sampayan Bulosan''' (November 24, 1913&lt;ref&gt;There is disagreement over the date of his birth, as his baptismal papers list it as November 2, 1911; see {{cite book|last1=Zhang|first1=Aiping|editor1-last=Huang|editor1-first=Guiyou|title=Asian American Short Story Writers: An A-to-Z Guide|publisher=Greenwood|location=2003|isbn=9780313322297|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skdEeK1SEAQC&amp;lpg=PT56&amp;dq=carlos%20Bulosan%201911&amp;pg=PT56#v=onepage&amp;q=carlos%20Bulosan%201911&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 September 2014}} Some sources say 1914; for a list of references on this problem, see {{cite book|last1=San Juan, Jr|first1=E.|title=Balikbayang Sinta: An E. San Juan Reader|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press and Flipside Publishing|isbn=9789719951551|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xg8ZAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT108&amp;dq=carlos%20Bulosan%201911%201913&amp;pg=PT108#v=onepage&amp;q=carlos%20Bulosan%201911%201913&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 September 2014|chapter=Carlos Bulosan: Critique and Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; – September 11, 1956) was an [[English-language]] [[Filipino people|Filipino]] novelist and poet who spent most of his life in the United States. His best-known work today is the [[autobiography|semi-autobiographical]] ''[[America Is in the Heart]]'', but he first gained fame for his 1943 essay on ''[[Freedom from Want (painting)|The Freedom from Want]]''.

==Early life and immigration==
Bulosan was born to [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]] parents in the Philippines in [[Binalonan, Pangasinan]]. There is considerable debate around his actual birth date, as he himself used several dates, but 1911 is generally considered the most reliable answer, based on his [[baptism]]al records, but according to the late Lorenzo Duyanen Sampayan, his childhood playmate and nephew, Carlos was born on November 2, 1913.  Most of his youth was spent in the countryside as a farmer. It is during his youth that he and his family were economically impoverished by the rich and political elite, which would become one of the main themes of his writing. His home town is also the starting point of his famous semi-autobiographical novel, ''America is in the Heart''.

Following the pattern of many Filipinos during the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American colonial period]], he left for America on July 22, 1930 at age 17, in the hope of finding salvation from the economic depression of his home. He never again saw his Philippine homeland. Upon arriving in [[Seattle]], he met with [[racism]] and was forced to work in low paying jobs.  He worked as a farmworker, harvesting [[grapes]] and [[asparagus]], and doing other types of hard work in the fields of [[California]].  He also worked as a dishwasher with his brother and Lorenzo in the famous Madonna Inn in [[San Luis Obispo]].

==Labor movement work==
Bulosan was active in [[labour movement]] along the Pacific coast of the United States and edited the 1952 Yearbook for [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union]] Local 37, a predominantly Filipino American [[cannery]] [[trade union]] based in Seattle.

==Writing==
There is some controversy surrounding the accuracy of events recorded within ''America Is in the Heart''.  He is celebrated for giving a [[post-colonial]], Asian immigrant perspective to the labor movement in America and for telling the experience of Filipinos working in the U.S. during the 1930s and '40s.  In the 1970s, with a resurgence in Asian/Pacific Islander American activism, his unpublished writings were discovered in a library in the [[University of Washington]] leading to posthumous releases of several unfinished works and anthologies of his poetry.

His other novels include ''[[The Laughter of My Father]]'', which were originally published as short sketches, and the posthumously published ''[[The Cry and the Dedication]]'' which detailed the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the Philippines.

One of his most famous essays, published in March 1943, was chosen by ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' to accompany its publication of the [[Norman Rockwell]] painting ''[[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]],'' part of a series based on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s "[[Four Freedoms]]" speech.&lt;ref name="Vials2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Vials|title=Realism for the Masses: Aesthetics, Popular Front Pluralism, and U.S. Culture, 1935-1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNKyvL7ccB4C&amp;pg=PR21|year=2009|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-349-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Maxim Lieber]] was his [[literary agent]] in 1944.

==Death and legacy==
As a labor organizer and [[socialist]] writer, he was [[blacklist]]ed.  Denied a means to provide for himself, his later years were of flight and hardship, probably including [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campusactivism.org/displayobject.php?giRid=367&amp;gsTable=resource&amp;giPhid=533&amp;gsPhile=bulosan_center_lecture.rtf.&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in [[Seattle]] suffering from an advanced stage of [[bronchopneumonia]].  He is buried at [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Seattle|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]] on [[Queen Anne, Seattle|Queen Anne Hill]] in Seattle.

Bulosan's works and legacy is heralded in a permanent exhibition, "The Carlos Bulosan Memorial Exhibit," at the Eastern Hotel in [[Seattle]]'s [[Seattle Chinatown-International District|International District]]. Its centerpiece [[mural]] is titled "Secrets of History"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mack|first=Kathy|title=Carlos Bulosan Mural|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/80233243@N00/3626780330/|publisher=Pink Chalk Studio-Flickr|accessdate=Nov 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was created by Eliseo Art Silva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Magalong |first1=Michelle |title=My HiFi.Day 16 of #FAHM: Read Carlos Bulosan |url=http://myhifi.tumblr.com/post/33717835933/americasintheheart |website=myhifi.tumblr.com |accessdate=2015-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623212854/http://myhifi.tumblr.com/post/33717835933/americasintheheart |archivedate=2015-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She currently resides in [[Rockland, Maine]]. She is the co-founder and editor of the online literary journal, ''Pulse,'' established in 1997. She has also published several collections of her own poetry, including ''Native Moons, Native Days'', as well as ''Drink from Your Own Wells: a guide to richer writing''.

== Life and career ==
Bachofner recalls first becoming interested in writing poetry when she was six years old. She graduated from [[Vermont College]] with a Masters of Fine Arts in Poetry and has been a professor of college-level English. She previously worked as a midwife; a labor and delivery [[registered nurse|RN]]; and as a freelance writer.

After becoming a runner-up in the 2006 Main Street Rag Poetry Chapbook Award Contest, Bachofner began to publish her poems. Many have appeared literary journals, including [[Prairie Schooner|''Prairie Schooner Journal'']], ''Main Street Rag'', ''The Comstock Review'', and ''[[Naugatuck River Review]]''.

She has been nominated for several literary awards and honors, including Editor of the Year by the [[Native Writers' Circle of the Americas|Wordcraft Circle of Writers &amp; Storytellers]] in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wordcraft Circle Awards Announced Honoring Native Writers and Storytellers|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/367629743?accountid=14612|publisher=Native American Times|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Writer of the Year for her poetry by that same group in 2000.

In 2009, Bachofner was invited to be a presenter of poetry by indigenous writers at the Maine Literary Festival in [[Camden, Maine]]. She was also named in the 2009-10 publication of [[Marquis Who's Who]] and in 2011 made the short list (runner up) for individual works of poetry by the Maine Literary Festival.  
In April 2012, she was named Rockland [[Poet laureate|Poet Laureate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ernest|first=Dagney|title=Laureates Galore|url=http://knox.villagesoup.com/p/laureates-galore/978522|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=The Camden Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by the City of [[Rockland, Maine]]. She launched her latest collection, ''Native Moons, Native Days'' (2012) at the Three Poets Book Launch, hosted by the [[Camden Public Library]]. Bachofner's poem, "We Speak the White Man's Language", will appear in the [[anthology]], ''Unraveling the Spreading Cloth of Time'', edited by [[Marijo Moore|MariJo Moore]] and Trace A. DeMeyer.

== Writing style and themes ==
Bachofner frequently writes themed collections. ''I Write In the Greenhouse'' includes poems about Maine and its people, including [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and [[Andrew Wyeth]]. Her other poems often describe Native American culture and tradition. This is an especially dominant theme in ''Native Moons, Native Days,'' in which she asks what makes poetry "Indian".

==Early life and education==

The daughter of James Sheridan Clarke (September 18, 1912 – January 18, 2009), a veteran of World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Clarke obituary notice|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?pid=123231635|website=legacy.com|publisher=''The Washington Post''|date=January 9, 2009|accessdate= December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Edna Clarke, Cheryl was born and raised in Washington, D.C. at the height of the American [[civil rights movement]], one of four sisters and a brother. The family was Catholic, descended from freed slaves who had emigrated to the nation's capitol after the Civil War. Both parents were civil servants and registered Democrats: James Clarke worked for the National Bureau of Standards for 33 years, and was considered to be the "mayor" of their neighborhood in the NW section of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Clarke Condolences|url=http://www.legacy.com/guestbooks/washingtonpost/james-clarke-condolences/123231635?eid=34617448|website=legacy.com|publisher=''The Washington Post''|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow segregation]] first hand in Washington for much of their lives, James and Edna raised their children with a strong sense of social justice and a belief in the importance of political activism.

When she was 13, Clarke crossed a picket line of African-American activists protesting segregation at [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] on 14th Street, believing that this was a rebellious act. However,when she came home her mother, a staunch union member, told her never to cross a picket line again, educating her about the role of direct action politics in the civil rights movement. At 16, Clarke was allowed by her parents to attend the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] with them, despite their concerns that there might be violence. The day before the march, on the way downtown to acquire information about the route, she ran into [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Potter|first1=Claire|title=We Still Want Jobs and Freedom Now: An Interview with Cheryl Clarke|url=http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/mow-1963/cheryl-clarke|website=OutHistory.org|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke attended parochial schools in the [[District of Columbia]], and matriculated at [[Howard University]] in 1965. She received a B.A. in English literature in 1969. Subsequently, she enrolled at [[Rutgers University]], completing a master's degree in 1974, an MSW in 1980, and a Ph.D in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherylclarkepoet.com/cv/|title=Cheryl Clarke CV|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of this time, she also worked for Rutgers, beginning her employment there in 1970 as an administrator in student services. At Rutgers, Carke was a pioneer in co-curricular programming that made the university more accessible to students of color and [[LGBT]] students. In 1992, she was  the founding Director of Diverse Community Affairs and Lesbian/Gay Concerns, which became the Office for Social Justice Education and LGBT Communities in 2004. She served as the Dean of Students of the [[Livingston Campus (Rutgers University)|Livingston Campus]] at Rutgers University from 2009 to 2013. After 41 years in higher education, Clarke retired from Rutgers in 2013.

==Writing==

Clarke is the author of four collections of poetry: ''Narratives: Poems in the Tradition of Black Women'' (originally self-published in 1981 and distributed by [[Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press]] in 1982); and for [[Firebrand Books]] ''Living as a Lesbian'' (1986), ''Humid Pitch'' (1989) and ''Experimental Love'' (1993).

She also published ''After Mecca — Women Poets and the Black Arts Movement'' (Rutgers University Press, 2005), the first study of its kind that made more visible the contributions of black women to a field that traditionally recognized black men, and ''Days of Good Looks: Prose and Poetry, 1980–2005'' (Carroll &amp; Graf Publishing, 2006), a collection that represented 25 years of published writing.

Clarke has served on the editorial collective of ''[[Conditions (magazine)|Conditions]]'', an early lesbian publication, and has been published in numerous anthologies, journals, magazines, and newspapers, including ''[[Conditions (magazine)#The Black Women's Issue|Conditions 5, The Black Women's Issue]]'' (1979), ''[[This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color]]'' (1982), ''[[Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology]]'' (1984), ''[[The Black Scholar]]'', ''[[The Kenyon Review]]'', ''[[Feminist Review|Feminist Review of Books]]'', ''[[Belles Lettres]]'', ''[[The Gay Community News]]''. Clarke's iconic articles, "Lesbianism: an act of resistance" and "The Failure to Transform: Homophobia in the Black Community", published in ''This Bridge'' and ''Home Girls'', respectively, are often included in women studies, black studies, and English studies curricula.

Clarke's fifth book of poetry, ''By My Precise Haircut'' (2016), is published by The Word Works Books of Washington, D.C., a press committed to the publication of contemporary poetry.

=="Lesbianism: an Act of Resistance"==

Cheryl Clarke is the author of "Lesbianism: an Act of Resistance," originally published in 1981 in the feminist anthology ''This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color.'' The essay's main intervention is to expand the categories of who counts as a lesbian and what lesbianism is. Rather than defining a lesbian only as a woman who has sex with other women, Clarke insists that "there is no one kind of lesbian, no one kind of lesbian behavior, and no one kind of lesbian relationship.&lt;ref name="Lesbianism: an Act of Resistance p129"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=Cheryl|title=Lesbianism: an Act of Resistance|journal=This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color|date=1981|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Thinking of "lesbian" as a continuum, she makes space for women who may have sexual and emotional relationships with women but identify with other labels (bisexual, for instance). In the same way, she redefines lesbianism "as an ideological, political, and philosophical means of liberation of all women from heterosexual tyranny."&lt;ref name="Lesbianism: an Act of Resistance p129" /&gt; Because she imagines lesbianism to be in opposition to male tyranny and coerced heterosexuality, she defines it as resistance, no matter how a woman is actually practicing it in her personal life.

==Community==
Clarke has served on a number of boards and community organizations, including New York Women Against Rape (1985), New Jersey Women and AIDS Network, Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies at the CUNY Graduate Center, and the [[Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice]]. Currently, she is a member of the Board of Directors of the Newark Pride Alliance, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to LGBTQ advocacy and programming in the city of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], New Jersey. She lives and writes in Jersey City, New Jersey.

==Investigation==
Jessie is one of four sex-workers who disappeared in Las Vegas between 2003 and 2006. The bodies of the other three have been found. The Las Vegas Police Department launched an investigation of a person in question, bringing in a forensic scientist to spray luminol onto surfaces at crime scenes to detect invisible blood stains; but found nothing at his property, nor has he been interrogated on her disappearance.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;  [[Benjamin Perrin]] of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], received a [[George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature]] nomination for having written ''[[Invisible Chains]]'', a book that prominently deals with human trafficking, and includes the disappearance of Jessie Foster.&lt;ref name="KTW" /&gt;  The documentary "Trafficked No More", features her story and led to some tips to her whereabouts.&lt;ref name="LG" /&gt;

On July 26, 2015, the ''[[Calgary Sun]]'' reported police are investigating if a man killed on July 18, 2015 in [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]], [[West Virginia]] may be responsible for the four Las Vegas killings, including Foster.&lt;ref name="BP" /&gt;

==Aftermath==

Her mother, Glendene Grant (born 1957) founded Mothers Against Trafficking in Humans following her daughter's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='She Has A Name' Production|date=September 10, 2012|publisher=New Life Church|url=http://newlife.bc.ca/2012/09/she-has-a-name-production/|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hosts an [[internet radio]] show on [[BlogTalkRadio]] through Dreamcatchers for Abused Children, and has hosted such guests as [[Member of Parliament#Canada|Member of Parliament]] [[Joy Smith]] and Bobby Brown of ''[[Dog the Bounty Hunter]]'' fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Kamloops Daily News]]|author=Mike Youds|title=Bondsman Bobby Brown to guest on blog show about human trafficking|date=December 30, 2011|url=http://www.kamloopsnews.ca/article/20111230/KAMLOOPS0101/312309983/-1/KAMLOOPS/bondsman-bobby-brown-to-guest-on-blog-show-about-human-trafficking|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[The Province]]|title=Mother's hunt for missing daughter blocked at border|date=June 3, 2007|url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=81ba9427-58f0-4b0b-a30a-001976ea9933|accessdate=October 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117064312/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=81ba9427-58f0-4b0b-a30a-001976ea9933|archivedate=November 17, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a [[common-law marriage]] with Dwight Foster, but they separated.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The last time that Grant saw her daughter was [[Christmas]] 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Kamloops Daily News]]|title=Residents come through for mom|date=December 24, 2009|url=http://www.kamloopsnews.ca/article/20091224/KAMLOOPS0101/312249977/-1/KAMLOOPS01/residents-come-through-for-mom|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant believes that Jessie became an unwilling victim of [[human trafficking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|title=Captive victims' cries go unheard|date=October 31, 2008|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/columnists/story.html?id=6e431ca3-3484-4a67-84ac-cfe962fec0a9|accessdate=October 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015456/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/columnists/story.html?id=6e431ca3-3484-4a67-84ac-cfe962fec0a9|archivedate=November 17, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Jessie thereby became a [[Sexual slavery|sexual slave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[The Province]]|title=$40,000 boost in reward raises hopes of missing woman's mom|date=December 27, 2007|url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=0e639b6f-05f1-4459-a9e1-8f0b8e0c0e28|accessdate=October 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117064153/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=0e639b6f-05f1-4459-a9e1-8f0b8e0c0e28|archivedate=November 17, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant therefore created almost a dozen websites advertising the disappearance of her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|author=Sherri Zickefoose|title='The most well-known, unknown missing person'|date=October 24, 2009|url=http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/observer/story.html?id=e91aa294-32a7-4fea-9714-dde8bbfaca3e|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to find her daughter, Grant has gotten in touch with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[bounty hunter]]s, [[Prostitution|prostitutes]], [[police officer]]s, [[psychic]]s, and [[private investigator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Calgary Sun]]|author=Sarah Kennedy|title=Woman missing a year after Las Vegas trip|date=March 28, 2007|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2007/03/28/3853525-sun.html|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Joshua Abraham Norton]]''' (c.1818 &amp;ndash; January 8, 1880), also known as Norton I or '''Emperor Norton''', was a celebrated citizen of [[San Francisco]] who in 1859 proclaimed himself "Emperor of these United States and Protector of Mexico." Though he was generally considered insane, or at least highly [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], the citizens of San Francisco in the mid to late nineteenth century celebrated Norton's regal presence and his deeds. He continues to be a patron saint of the unusual and of eccentrics, and he is recognized as a Saint in the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' (1970), the main text of the [[Discordianism|Discordian]] religion.

===Comic book series===

Gaiman's Norton is a victim of [[Despair (DC Comics)|Despair]] until Despair's brother, [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]], gives him the dream of royalty. Dream's sister [[Delirium (DC Comics)|Delirium]] notes that Norton's fantasy of Imperial power keeps him from true insanity, observing that "he should belong to me, but he doesn't ... his madness keeps him sane." In later issues collected in ''[[The Sandman: Worlds' End|Worlds' End]]'', it is mentioned that a movement started in [[San Francisco]] sought to declare [[Prez (DC Comics)|Prez Rickard]] Emperor of the United States, and a figure resembling Norton appears in one of the later stories marching in a procession.
* The character of "His Imperial Highness Smith" in the Belgian Comic "[[Lucky Luke]]: L'empereur Smith" (1976), by [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] and [[René Goscinny]], is loosely based on Norton. In contrast to the historical Norton, at the time that he declared himself emperor, the fictional Smith remains a successful businessman. In fact it is becoming fabulously rich that gave him his delusions of grandeur. He is capable of maintaining his own private army which an outlaw manipulates him into using to "reconquer" the United States before Lucky Luke stops him. In spite of the drama arising from the manipulations, Smith is never described as malicious, probably in respect of the "real" emperor. At the end of the comic book, a page is devoted to a short biography of the real Emperor Norton.
* [[Ted Naifeh]]'s fantasy comic ''[[Polly and the Pirates]]'' features an Emperor Joshua who is modeled after Norton.

===Role-playing games===

Talsorian Games]]' [[Castle Falkenstein (role-playing game)|Castle Falkenstein]] series of [[role-playing game]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4129">[[File:Gabriele Paolini Roma 20-9-2015 2.jpg|thumb|right|Gabriele Paolini in [[Rome]]]]
'''Gabriele Paolini''' (born [[Milan]], 12 October 1974) is a famous Italian [[television]] prankster and [[condom]] advocate. He calls himself the "prophet of the condom" and "the prophylactic prophet." In [[Italy]] he is also referred to as a ''disturbatore televisivo'', which means a television disturber. His antics usually involve exhibiting condoms in the background behind interviews or other unwitting live reporters. He has also been involved with singing contests and sporting events.

==Overview==
Gabriele Paolini began his career as a "television polluter" when a friend of his died of [[AIDS]] at age 22, contracting the disease some years before as a result of unprotected sex with a [[prostitute]]. Paolini's reaction was to invade TV news reports wearing or waving chains of condoms. Sometimes Paolini also uses a photo of a politician or of the [[Pope]].

The son of a retired general and of a singer, Paolini is in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] for his more than 30,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielepaolini.com/html/images/scansione0004.jpg Guinness 2010 certificate]&lt;/ref&gt; very short appearances, waving over the shoulders of hundreds of displeased TV journalists.

Over the years, Paolini has angered many in the media. During one interrupted TV report, journalist [[Paolo Frajese]] kicked Paolini away and then resumed his report as if nothing had happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://video.repubblica.it/cronaca/il-precedente-frajese-prende-a-calci-paolini/79798/78188|title=Il precedente: Frajese prende a calci Paolini|publisher=La Repubblica|date=2011-11-02|accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists have asked the legal office of [[RAI TV]] in Saxa Rubra for a legal injunction to "eliminate the disturber." In response, Gabriele Paolini showed the media a list of interviewers who had in fact requested his presence. However, Italy's Supreme Court upheld a three-month suspended sentence against him.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7456040.stm|title=Court warns Italian TV prankster|publisher=BBC|date=2008-06-16|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TG5]] editor-in-chief [[Salvo Sottile]] and communications expert [[Enrico Mieli]] launched a petition on [[Facebook]] to "abolish" Paolini from the Italian television due to his insensitivity.&lt;ref name="Adnkronos"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/Spettacolo/?id=3.0.2690448470|title=Via Il 'Disturbatore' Paolini, 1.300 'Firmano' Petizione Su Facebook|publisher=[[Adnkronos]]|date=2008-11-09|accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 1995, Paolini personally disguised a condom as a request in a paper and gave it to [[Pope John Paul II]] at a church in Rome.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In 2008, Paolini was sentenced to a 5-month prison term for offenses against the Pope, stemming from his actions in 2005 when he interrupted a live TV show of RAI TV insulting the Pope and the Italian premier.&lt;ref name="Il Giornale"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=261040|title=Offese il Papa: cinque mesi a Paolini|publisher=[[Il Giornale]]|date=2008-05-12|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2013, Paolini has been arrested in Rome for underage prostitution and pedopornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastampa.it/2013/11/11/italia/cronache/le-vittime-di-paolini-e-anni-LSQpeXKbZyIx8EuFknKFdP/pagina.html La Stampa, 10.11.2013, "Vittime di Paolini 2 studenti di 16 anni"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genesis Breyer P-Orridge''' (born '''Neil Andrew Megson'''; 22 February 1950) is an English singer-songwriter, musician, poet, [[performance art]]ist, and [[occultism|occultist]]. After rising to notability as the founder of the [[COUM Transmissions]] artistic collective and then fronting the [[industrial music|industrial]] band [[Throbbing Gristle]], P-Orridge was a founding member of [[Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth]] occult group, and fronted the experimental band [[Psychic TV]]. P-Orridge identifies as [[third gender]].{{efn|In accordance with their work on the Pandrogyne Project, P-Orridge now identifies using the pronouns "s/he", "h/er", and "h/erself".&lt;ref name=homepage&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.genesisbreyerporridge.com/genesisbreyerporridge.com/Genesis_BREYER_P-ORRIDGE_Home.html | title=Genesis Breyer P-Orridge Home | accessdate=19 May 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528050638/http://www.genesisbreyerporridge.com/genesisbreyerporridge.com/Genesis_BREYER_P-ORRIDGE_Home.html | archivedate=28 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pronouns have been used when discussing P-Orridge in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref name="Battaglia"/&gt; and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Reinventions"/&gt; However, P-Orridge is still referred to using male pronouns in older sources, such as those of journalist Erica Orden,&lt;ref name="orden"/&gt; the historian Dave Evans,{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=98&amp;ndash;102}} and the religious studies scholar Christopher Partidge.{{sfn|Partridge|2013}} Alternately, the journalist Camille Dodero used female pronouns when referring to P-Orridge.&lt;ref name="Cam"/&gt; According to Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Identity|manual of style on identity]], it is the encyclopaedia's policy to "give precedence to self-designation as reported in the most up-to-date reliable sources, even when it doesn't match what's most common in reliable sources... Any person whose gender might be questioned should be referred to by the pronouns, possessive adjectives, and gendered nouns (for example "man/woman", "waiter/waitress", "chairman/chairwoman") that reflect that person's latest expressed gender self-identification. This applies in references to any phase of that person's life, unless the subject has indicated a preference otherwise."}}

&lt;!--Early years and Throbbing Gristle--&gt;
Born in [[Manchester]], P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the [[avant-garde]] while at [[Solihull School]]. After dropping out of studies at the [[University of Hull]], they moved into a counter-cultural commune in [[London]] and adopted ''Genesis P-Orridge'' as a [[nom-de-guerre]]. On returning to Hull, P-Orridge founded COUM Transmissions with [[Cosey Fanni Tutti]], and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM's confrontational [[performance art|performance work]], dealing with such subjects as [[sex work]], [[pornography]], [[serial killers]], and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM's 1976 ''Prostitution'' show at London's [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the "wreckers of civilization". P-Orridge's band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of [[acid house]].

&lt;!--Temple ov Psychick Youth--&gt;
In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by [[Chaos Magic|chaos magic]] and experimental music. P-Orridge was often seen as the group's leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] hysteria, a 1992 [[Channel 4]] documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. P-Orridge left the United Kingdom as a result of the incident and settled in New York City. There, P-Orridge married Jacqueline Mary Breyer, later known as Lady Jaye, in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Genesis Breyer P-Orridge|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/genesis-breyer-p-orridge-71075|website=A.V.Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a "pandrogyne", or single entity, through the use of surgical [[body modification]] to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye's 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, P-Orridge retired from music to focus on other artistic mediums in 2009. P-Orridge is credited on over 200 releases.

&lt;!--Reception, legacy, and influence--&gt;
A controversial figure with an anti-establishment stance, P-Orridge has been heavily criticised by the British press and politicians. P-Orridge has been cited as an icon within the avant-garde art scene, accrued a [[cult following]], and been given the moniker of the "Godperson of Industrial Music."

}}
Genesis P-Orridge was born Neil Andrew Megson on 22 February 1950 in [[Victoria Park, Manchester|Victoria Park, Longsight]] (part of the city of [[Manchester]]), to Ronald and Muriel Megson.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.4}} Ronald was a travelling salesman who had worked in [[repertory theatre]] and who played the drums in local [[jazz]] and dance bands.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.4}} Muriel was from [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] and had first met Ronald after he had returned to England after being injured with the British Army at the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] in 1940.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.4}} As a child, P-Orridge had a good relationship with their parents, who did not interfere with their artistic interests.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.4}}

Due to Ronald's job, the family moved to [[Essex]], [[East of England|Eastern England]], where P-Orridge attended Staples Road Infant School in [[Loughton]], and for a time lived in a [[Travel trailer|caravan]] near to [[Epping Forest]] while the family house was being completed.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.4}} The family then moved from Essex to [[Cheshire]], [[North West England]], where P-Orridge attended Gatley Primary School. Passing the [[11-plus]] exam, P-Orridge won a scholarship to attend [[Stockport Grammar School]], doing so between 1961 and 1964.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.5}}

===1964–1968: Solihull School and Worm===
After their father gained employment as the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] area manager of a cleaning and maintenance business, P-Orridge was sent to the privately run [[Solihull School]] in Warwickshire from 1964 through to 1968; a period they would refer to as "basically four years of being mentally and physically tortured", but also a time when he developed an interest in art, occultism and the avant-garde.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.5}} Unpopular with other students, P-Orridge was bullied at the school, finding comfort in the art department at lunch-time and in the evenings.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.5}} They befriended Ian "Spydeee" Evetts, Barry "Little Baz" Hermon and Paul Wolfson, three fellow students who shared their interest in art, literature and poetry.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.5}} They regularly discussed books and music, developing an interest in the writings of [[Aleister Crowley]], [[William S Burroughs]], [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] and the music of [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Fugs]] and [[The Velvet Underground]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.5}} P-Orridge became interested in [[occultism]],{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=193}} and has also asserted that their grandmother was a [[Medium (spirituality)|medium]].&lt;ref name="assoc content"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Life of Genesis P-Orridge: Father of Industrial Music | author=Forish, E. Jayne | publisher=[[Associated Content]] | date=29 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, P-Orridge founded their first band, Worm, with school friends Peter Winstanley, Evetts and P-Orridge's girlfriend Jane Ray, which was influenced by [[John Cage]]'s 1961 book ''[[Silence: Lectures and Writings]]''.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.7}} In 1966, P-Orridge, Evetts, Hermon, Wolfson, and Winstanley began production of an [[underground magazine]], entitled ''Conscience''. Forbidden from selling it on school grounds, they sold copies outside the school gates.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.6}} Included in ''Conscience'' were various articles criticising the school's administration, leading to proposed changes regarding such issues as [[school uniform]]s and benchers'{{clarify|date=December 2017|reason=This has no clear referent; the British English term [[bencher]] refers to a senior judge in the English/Welsh and Irish legal systems, and appears to have no relevance to this school context.}} privileges.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.6}} That same year, influenced by newspaper accounts of "[[Swinging London]]", P-Orridge organised the first [[happening]] at the school, doing so under the auspices of organising a [[Dance party#School dances|school dance]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.6}}

[[File:Solihull School Chatwin.jpg|left|thumb|250px|P-Orridge despised their studies at Solihull School (pictured)]]

Brought up in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] denomination of Christianity, P-Orridge became secretary of the school [[sixth form]]'s Christian Discussion Circle, in this position inviting members of other ideological positions – including a [[Marxism|Marxist]] from the [[British Communist Party]] – to speak to the group.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.6}} Aged 18, P-Orridge began helping to run the local [[Sunday School]] classes, but came to reject organised Christianity.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.6}} Afflicted with [[asthma]] throughout childhood, P-Orridge had to take [[cortisone]] and [[prednisone]] [[steroids]] to control the attacks. The latter of these drugs caused his [[adrenal glands]] to atrophy as a side-effect, and so the doctor advised P-Orridge to stop taking them. As a result, aged 17 P-Orridge suffered from a serious [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]; while in hospital recovering he decided to devote his life to art and writing.{{sfnm|1a1=Ford|1y=1999|1pp=1.6–1.7|2a1=Wilson|2y=2002|2pp=51–52}}

With Hermon and Wolfson, P-Orridge founded a group called the Knights of the Pentecostal Flame.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.8}}&lt;ref name=wolfson-telegraph&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3587289/Naughty-but-nice.html | author=Wolfson, Richard | title=Naughty but Nice | work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | date=19 December 2002 | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Knights undertook a happening on 1 June 1968 which they titled ''Beautiful Litter''. Taking place in Mell Square, [[Solihull]], it involved the three students handing out cards to passersby that had a series of words written onto them; "fleece", "rainbow", "silken", "white", "flower" and "dewdrops".{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=1.8–1.9}} Ensuring that the local ''[[Solihull Times|Solihull News]]'' was informed of the event, P-Orridge told reporters that the Knights wanted to ignite "an artistic revolution in Solihull, by making people aware of the life around them, its essential beauty and tranquility."{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=1.8–1.9}} In the summer of 1968, Worm recorded their first and only album, entitled ''Early Worm'', in P-Orridge's parents' attic in Solihull. It was pressed onto [[vinyl record|vinyl]] in November at Deroy Sound Services in Manchester, but only one copy was ever produced.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=1.7–1.8}} A second album, ''Catching the Bird'', was recorded but never pressed.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=1.7–1.8}}

=== 1968–1969: Hull University and Transmedia Explorations===
In September 1968, P-Orridge began studying for a degree in Social Administration and Philosophy at the [[University of Hull]]. Hull was chosen in an attempt to study at "the most ordinary non-elitist, working-class, red brick university", but P-Orridge disliked the course and unsuccessfully tried to transfer to study English.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.10}} With a group of friends, he founded a 'free-form' student magazine entitled ''Worm'' which waived all editorial control, publishing everything placed into the magazine's [[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeonhole]], including instructions on how to build a [[molotov cocktail]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.10}} Three issues were published between 1968 and 1970 before the Hull Student's Union banned the publication, considering it [[Obscene Publications Act 1959|legally obscene]] and fearing prosecution.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.10}} Developing a keen interest in poetry, P-Orridge won the 1969 Hull University Needler Poetry Competition, judged by Compton lecturer Richard Murphy and the poet [[Philip Larkin]], who was then Chief Librarian at the university.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.11}} P-Orridge became involved in radical student politics through their friendship with Tom Fawthrop, a member of the Radical Student Alliance who had led a student occupation of the university's administrative buildings as a part of the [[Protests of 1968|worldwide student protests of 1968]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.12}} In 1969, P-Orridge attempted to reconstruct the occupation for a film, in the hopes that it would itself become a genuine protest occupation, but this venture failed due to a lack of participants.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.12}}

In 1969, P-Orridge dropped out of university and moved to London,{{sfnm|1a1=Ford|1y=1999|1pp=1.12, 1.14|2a1=Wilson|2y=2002|2p=58}} and joined the [[David Medalla|Transmedia Explorations]] commune, who were then living in a large run-down house in [[Islington|Islington Park Street]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.12}} The group, initiated by the artist [[David Medalla]] and initially named the Exploding Galaxy, had been at the forefront of the London [[hippy]] scene since 1967, but had partially disbanded after a series of police raids and a damaging court case.{{sfnm|1a1=Ford|1y=1999|1p=1.12|2a1=Wilson|2y=2002|2p=58}} Moving into their commune, P-Orridge was particularly influenced by one of the founding members of the group, Gerald Fitzgerald, a [[kinetic art]]ist, and would recognise Fitzgerald's formative influence in P-Orridge's later work.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=1.12&amp;ndash;1.14}} The commune members adhered to a strict regime with the intention of [[deconditioning]] its members out of their routines and conventional behaviour; they were forbidden from sleeping in the same place on consecutive nights, food was cooked at irregular times of the day and all clothing was kept in a communal chest, with its members wearing something different on each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Ford|1y=1999|1pp=1.14&amp;ndash;1.15|2a1=Wilson|2y=2002|2p=58}} P-Orridge stayed there for three months, until late October 1969. They left after becoming angered that the commune's leaders were given more rights than the other members and believing that the group ignored the counter-cultural use of music, something he took a great interest in.{{sfnm|1a1=Ford|1y=1999|1p=1.15|2a1=Wilson|2y=2002|2p=58}} Julie Wilson later stated that although P-Orridge's time at the Transmedia Explorations commune had been brief, "the experiences he had there proved to be seminal" to their artistic development.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=58}}

==COUM Transmissions==

===1969–1970: Founding COUM Transmissions===

Leaving London, P-Orridge hitch-hiked across Britain before settling down in the Megson family's new home in [[Shrewsbury]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.15}} Here, P-Orridge volunteered as an office clerk in Ronald Megson's new business.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.15}} On one family trip to Wales, P-Orridge was sitting in the back of the car, then "became disembodied and heard voices and saw the COUM symbol and heard the words '[[COUM Transmissions]]{{'"}}.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.15}}  Returning home that evening, P-Orridge filled three notebooks with artistic thoughts and ideas, influenced by the time spent at Transmedia Explorations.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.15}}

In December 1969, P-Orridge returned to Hull to meet up with friend John Shappero, who partnered with P-Orridge to turn COUM Transmissions into an avant-garde artistic and musical troupe. They initially debated as to how to define "COUM", later deciding that like the name "[[dada]]" it should remain open to interpretation.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.16}} P-Orridge designed a logo for the group, consisting of a semi-erect penis formed out of the word COUM with a drip of [[semen]] coming out of the end, while the motto "Your Local Dirty Banned" (a pun on "band") was emblazoned underneath.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.16}} Another logo designed by P-Orridge consisted of a hand-drawn seal accompanied by the statement "COUM guarantee disappointment"; from their early foundation, the group made use of [[wordplay]] in their artworks and adverts.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.16}}

COUM's earliest public events were impromptu musical gigs performed at various pubs around Hull; titles for these events included ''Thee Fabulous Mutations'', ''Space Between the Violins'', ''Dead Violins and Degradation'', and ''Clockwork Hot Spoiled Acid Test''.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.16}} The latter combined the names of [[Anthony Burgess]]' dystopian science-fiction novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1962) with [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'' (1968), a work of literary journalism devoted to the [[Merry Pranksters]], a US communal counter-cultural group who advocated the use of [[psychedelic drugs]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.16}} COUM's music was anarchic and improvised, making use of such instruments as broken violins, prepared pianos, guitars, bongos and talking drums. As time went on, they added further theatrics to their performances, in one instance making the audience crawl through a polythene tunnel to enter the venue.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.20}}

In December 1969, P-Orridge and Shapiro moved out of their flat and into a former fruit warehouse in Hull's docking area, overlooking the [[Humber]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.17}} Named the Ho-Ho Funhouse by P-Orridge, the warehouse became the communal home to an assortment of counter-cultural figures, including artists, musicians, fashion designers and underground magazine producers.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.17}} At Christmas 1969, a woman named Christine Carol Newby moved into the Funhouse after being thrown out of her home by her father. Having earlier befriended P-Orridge at an [[Acid Tests|acid test]] party, Newby became P-Orridge's roommate at the Funhouse, first taking the name Cosmosis, but latterly adopting the stage name [[Cosey Fanni Tutti]] after the title of [[Amadeus Mozart]]'s 1790 opera ''[[Così fan tutte]]''.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=1.17–1.19}} Joining COUM, Tutti initially helped in building props and designing costumes, and was there when the group began changing its focus from music to performance art and more theatrical happenings; shortly after Evetts, after being expelled from Solihull School joined COUM.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.20}} The three of them lived in a derelict Georgian warehouse in Prince Street, Hull.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.20}} An example performance involved the group turning up to play a gig but intentionally not bringing any instruments, something P-Orridge considered "much more theatrical, farcical and light-hearted" than their earlier performances.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=1.20}}

=== 1971–1973: Activities in Hull===
On 5 January 1971, P-Orridge underwent a legal name change to Genesis P-Orridge by [[deed poll]], combining the adopted nickname Genesis with an altered spelling of ''[[porridge]]'', the foodstuff which P-Orridge had lived off as a student. The new name was intentionally un-glamorous, and P-Orridge hoped that it would trigger a personal "genius factor".{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.4}} In February, COUM caught the attention of the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'', which featured an article on them that led to further media attention from national newspapers.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.4}} They also featured in an article in ''Torch'', the publication of the University of Hull's student union, entitled "God Sucks [[Virgin Mary|Mary]]'s Hairy Nipple"; the article's author, Haydn Robb, subsequently joined COUM,{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.8}} as did maths lecturer [[Tim Poston]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.11}} In April 1971, COUM broadcast their first live radio session, for the ''On Cue'' programme for [[Radio Humberside]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.6}} Following up the press attention they received, they performed further happenings, including their first street action, ''Absolute Everywhere'', which brought problems with the police.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.6}}

After performing another set, ''Riot Control'', at Hull's Gondola Club, the premises was raided by police and closed soon after; most local clubs blamed COUM and unofficially banned them. COUM drew up a petition to gain support for the group, attaining a booking at the local Brickhouse; their first performance in which the audience applauded and called for an encore. The petition had contained their phallic logo, and the police charged P-Orridge and Nobb with publishing an obscene advert, although the charges were later dropped.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.7}} As they gained coverage in the music press, interest in the band grew, and they supported [[Hawkwind]] at St. George's Hall in [[Bradford]] in October 1971, where they performed a piece called ''Edna and the Great Surfers'', where they led the crowd in shouting "Off, Off, Off".{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.7}} The following month, the band attracted the interest of music journalist [[John Peel]], who publicly remarked that "[s]ome might say that Coum were madmen but constant exposure to mankind forces me to believe that we need more madmen like them."{{sfnm|1a1=Ford|1y=1999|1p=2.8|2a1=Partridge|2y=2013|2p=190}}

Gaining an Experimental Arts Grant from the publicly funded Yorkshire Arts Association,{{sfnm|1a1=Ford|1y=1999|1p=2.9|2a1=Wilson|2y=2002|2p=60}} COUM described themselves as performance artists, being inspired by the Dadaists and emphasising the amateur quality of their work.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=2.10–2.11}} They entered the National Rock/Folk Contest at Hull's New Grange Club with a set titled ''[[this machine kills fascists|This Machine Kills Music]]'',{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.22}} and organised events for [[Hull City Council]]'s celebrations to mark the UK's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=3.3–3.6}} P-Orridge had also worked on solo projects, generating controversy in the local press over a [[conceptual art]]work the artist entered at a local exhibition.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=3.3–3.6}} Taking an increasing interest in [[Infantilism (physiological disorder)|infantilism]], P-Orridge founded the fictitious L'ecole de l'art infantile and co-organised the "Baby's Coumpetition" {{sic}} at [[Oxford University]]'s 1973 May Festival, also producing material as the fictitious Ministry of Antisocial Insecurity, a parody of the [[Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance|Ministry of Social Security]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=2.13–2.14}} Meanwhile, P-Orridge created the character of Alien Brain, and in July 1972 performed the ''World Premiere of The Alien Brain''{{clarify|date=November 2017|Which was what? A play? A song? A performance art piece? A speaking engagement? A dance?}} at Hull Arts Centre.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.18}} COUM also began publishing books; in 1972, they brought out the first volume of ''The Million and One Names of COUM'', part of a proposed project to release 1001 slogans (such as "A thousand and one ways to COUM" and "COUM are Fab and Kinky"),{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.19}} while in 1973 P-Orridge published ''Copyright Breeches'', which explored an ongoing personal fascination with the [[copyright symbol]] and its implications for art and society.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=2.21}}

===1973–1975: London and growing fame===
Following continual police harassment, P-Orridge and Tutti relocated to London, moving into a squat and obtaining a basement studio in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] which they named the "Death Factory".{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=3.7–3.9}} After a brief correspondence, P-Orridge met American novelist and poet [[William S. Burroughs]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ford|1y=1999|1pp=3.9–3.10|2a1=Wilson|2y=2002|2pp=60–61}}&lt;ref name="metzger"&gt;Metzger, Richard (31 December 2009).

Exhibiting alongside the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]], P-Orridge came under increasing influence from these Austrian performance artists, adopting their emphasis on using shock tactics to combat conventional morality.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=3.14–3.17}}  P-Orrdige's first film, ''Wundatrek Tours'', was released in September 1973, and documented a day out to Brighton. Throughout the year the artist sent personally designed postcards to mail-art shows across the world.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=3.17–3.18}}

In January 1974, COUM returned their attention to music, collaborating with the Canadian artist [[Clive Robertson (artist)|Clive Robertson]] to produce ''Marcel Duchamp's Next Work'', which they premiered at an arts festival in the [[Zwaarte Zaal]] in [[Ghent]], Belgium.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.5}} COUM's next major work was ''Couming of Age'', performed in March 1974 at the [[Oval House]] in [[Kennington]], [[South London]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.9}} After the show, they were approached by an audience member, [[Peter Christopherson]], who shared many of their interests; P-Orridge and Tutti nicknamed him "Sleazy" because of his particular interest in the sexual aspects of COUM's work.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.9}} He began to aid them using his skills as a photographer and graphic designer, and would first perform with them in their March 1975 work ''Couming of Youth''.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.10}} In May 1974, COUM issued a manifesto published on an [[A3 paper|A3]] double-sided sheet titled ''Decoumpositions and Events''.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=4.10&amp;ndash;4.11}}

In April 1974 the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] gave COUM the first half of a £1,500 grant.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.11}} The money stabilised the group, which now included P-Orridge and Tutti as directors, John Gunni Busck as technical director, and Lelli Maull as musical director.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.11}} During that year, they made use of various artist-run venues in London, most notably the Art Meeting Place (AMP) in [[Covent Garden]], where they regularly performed during 1974.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.12}} A number of these works entailed P-Orridge and Tutti exploring the gender balance, including concepts of gender confusion.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=4.13&amp;ndash;4.15}} In one performance at the AWB, which was titled ''Filth'', P-Orridge and Tutti performed sexual acts using a double-ended [[dildo]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.12}} COUM were frustrated with the restrictions imposed on them by the Arts Council as a prerequisite for receiving funding; rather than performing at Council-accredited venues, they wanted to perform more spontaneously.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.18}} In August 1974 they carried out a spontaneous unauthorised piece of performance art in [[Brook Green]], [[Hammersmith]]; during the performance, police arrived and put a stop to the event, deeming it obscene.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=4.18&amp;ndash;4.21}}

In September 1974, COUM were invited to attend the [[Stadfest]] in [[Rottweil]], [[West Germany]], and they proceeded with a travel grant from the [[British Council]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.22}} There, they published two performance art actions in the street, earning them praise from [[Bridget Riley]] and [[Ernst Jandl]], both of whom were present.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=4.22&amp;ndash;4.25}} The acclaim that COUM received at Rottweil established the group's reputation as "one of the most innovative performance art groups then on the London art scene", convincing the Arts Council and British Council to take them more seriously and offer them greater support.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=4.25}}

In February 1975, P-Orridge gained his first full-time job, working as an assistant editor at [[St. James' Press]], in which he helped to compile the ''Contemporary Artists'' reference book. The work meant that he had less time to devote to COUM but gained a wide range of contacts in the art world.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=5.4}} During that year, COUM embarked on a series of five performance pieces which it termed ''Omissions''; these were performed across Europe.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=5.4, 5.6&amp;ndash;5.7}} In March 1975, COUM performed ''Couming of Youth'' at the [[Melkweg]] in Amsterdam. Adopting a more violent stance than their previous work &amp;ndash; in this reflecting an influence from the Viennese Actionists &amp;ndash; the performance involved self-mutilation, Cosey inserting lighted candles into her vagina, P-Orridge being crucified and whipped, and P-Orridge and Cosey having sexual intercourse.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=5.7&amp;ndash;5.9}} At [[Southampton]]'s [[Nuffield Festival]] in July 1975, COUM performed ''Studio of Lust'', where P-Orridge publicly masturbated and all of the members undressed and adopted sexual poses.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=5.10&amp;ndash;5.11}}

===Establishing Throbbing Gristle and the Prostitution show: 1975&amp;ndash;1976===

COUM were introduced to [[Chris Carter (British musician)|Chris Carter]] in the summer of 1975 through their mutual friend John Lacey. Lacey believed that Carter would be interested in COUM as a result of his particular interest in the experimental use of light and sound.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=5.15}} Together, Carter, Christopherson, Cosey and P-Orridge founded a musical band, Throbbing Gristle, on 3 September 1975; they had deliberately chosen that date for it was the 36th anniversary of the United Kingdom joining the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=5.16}} The term "throbbing gristle" was deliberately chosen for it was a Yorkshire slang term for an erect penis.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=5.16}} Throbbing Gristle, or TG as it was widely known, was aimed at a wider audience than COUM, thereby aiming to work within [[popular culture]] rather than the elite realm of the art scene.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=5.17}} COUM and TG were largely treated as distinct entities; the music press ignored COUM and saw TG as experimental [[art rock]], while the arts press ignored TG, viewing COUM as performance artists.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=5.17}} Despite their intention of operating within the realms of popular culture, TG never had chart success, and remained a [[cult band]]; their audience was however far larger than COUM.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=5.18}}

COUM continued to operate alongside TG, and in October 1975 they performed ''Jusquà la balle crystal'''' at the Ninth Paris Biennale at the Musée d'art modern. The prestige of being invited to such an event led to the Arts Council awarding them a grant for £1,600, although only the first half of this was ever paid out.{{sfn|Ford|1999|pp=5.19&amp;ndash;5.21}} COUM's [[mail art]] had taken on an increasingly pornographic dimension, and in November 1975 the police charged P-Orridge with distributing obscene material via in the postal system under the [[1953 Post Office Act]]; this trial was set for February 1976.{{sfn|Ford|1999|p=5.21}}

[[Throbbing Gristle]] was formed in the autumn of 1975&lt;ref name=allmusictg&gt;{{Allmusic | class=artist | id=p5651 | tab=biography | label=Throbbing Gristle Biography | first=Jason | last=Ankeny | accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a four-piece band, consisting of P-Orridge, [[Cosey Fanni Tutti]], [[Peter Christopherson|Peter "Sleazy" Christopherson]] and [[Chris Carter (British musician)|Chris Carter]].&lt;ref name=allmusictg/&gt;
The name "Throbbing Gristle" was adopted after a Northern English slang term for an erect penis.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=99}} P-Orridge's involvement in Throbbing Gristle led to the artist being regularly cited as the "Godfather of [[Industrial Music]]",{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=179}} or in some later sources, "godparent".&lt;ref name="Reinventions"/&gt;

The first Throbbing Gristle performance was held at the Air Gallery in London in July 1976.&lt;ref name=devolution/&gt; At that point, Throbbing Gristle's headquarters was located at 10 Martello Street, [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney, East London]], the address of an artist collective. P-Orridge and Tutti's living and work space was the mailing address of [[Industrial Records]] (IR). Throbbing Gristle released "[[Discipline (Throbbing Gristle song)|Discipline]]" in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;S. Alexander Reed, ''Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music'' (2013, {{ISBN|0199832609}})&lt;/ref&gt; TG came to be identified as the founders of [[industrial music]],{{sfn|Daniel|2008|p=2}} although at the same time the academic Drew Daniel asserted that as a result of its eclecticism, their music resists clear analysis.{{sfn|Daniel|2008|pp=1–2}}

Throbbing Gristle's best-selling single was "[[Zyklon B Zombie]]" (1978), the title being a reference to the [[Zyklon B]] poison gas used at [[Auschwitz extermination camp]].{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=208}} With their album ''[[20 Jazz Funk Greats]]'' they attempted to move away from their industrial sound, and produced songs in a variety of different musical genres.{{sfn|Daniel|2008|p=2}} P-Orridge received a number of threatening phone calls, proceeding to record them and use them as a backing track for the TG song "Death Threats".{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=100}}

The final IR release was called ''[[Nothing Here Now But the Recordings]]'', a best-of album taken from the archives of [[William S. Burroughs]], who provided P-Orridge and Christopherson with access to his reel-to-reel tape archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=CIea5OniG30C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%22Nothing+Here+but+the+Recordings%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nothing%20Here%20but%20the%20Recordings%22&amp;f=false | author=Kansa, Spencer | title=William S. Burroughs: Rock God | work=Beatdown | issue=7 |date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final Throbbing Gristle live event, ''[[Mission of Dead Souls]]'', occurred in May 1981 at the [[Kezar Pavilion]] in San Francisco, US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=4WM6Cb1z-PwC&amp;pg=PA577&amp;lpg=PA577&amp;dq=Mission+of+Dead+Souls,+May+1981+San+Francisco#v=onepage&amp;q=Mission%20of%20Dead%20Souls%2C%20May%201981%20San%20Francisco&amp;f=false | author=Gimarc, George | title=Punk Diary: The Ultimate Trainspotter's Guide To Underground Rock, 1970–1982 | page=577 | publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |date=July 2005 | isbn=9780879308483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the San Francisco event, P-Orridge and [[Paula P-Orridge]] (née Alaura O'Dell) were married.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

During this period, P-Orridge befriended an English musician named David Bunting; P-Orridge already knew another man named David, so coined the moniker [[David Tibet]],{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=210}} which Bunting adopted as a stage name. Through an introduction provided by Burroughs, P-Orridge met [[Brion Gysin]] in Paris, probably in 1980, coming to be deeply influenced by Gysin's [[Cut-up technique|cut-up method]]; P-Orridge understood this to be a revolutionary method of escaping current patterns of thought and developing something new.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|pp=198–199}}

==Psychic TV and Thee Temple Ov Psychic Youth==
[[File:Genesis P. Orridge.jpg|thumb|Genesis P-Orridge posing in Japan]]
{{main|Psychic TV|Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth}}
Following the break-up of Throbbing Gristle, in 1981 P-Orridge founded a band with [[Peter Christopherson]] and [[Alex Fergusson (musician)|Alex Fergusson]] that they named Psychic TV.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=202}} Involved in video art, they also performed psychedelic, punk, electronic and experimental music.&lt;ref name=allmusicptv&gt;{{Allmusic | class=artist | id=p5194 | tab=biography | label=Psychic TV Biography | first=Steve | last=Huey | accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to name the band "Psychic TV" stemmed from P-Orridge's belief that while mainstream television was a form of mass indoctrination and mind control, it could be used as an "esoterrorist" form of magick to combat the establishment's control.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=203}} Historian Dave Evans described Psychic TV as "a band dedicated to musical eclecticism and magical experiment, their performances being in part ritual (ab)use of sound samples, the creation of 'auditory magical sigils' and the destruction of consensus language in order to find meaning".{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=99}}

The band's first song, "Just Drifting", was based on a poem by P-Orridge.&lt;ref name="porridge2002"&gt;P-Orridge, Genesis, Douglas Rushkoff (foreword), and Carl Abrahamsson (introduction). ''Painful but Fabulous: The Life and Art of Genesis P-Orridge''. Soft Skull Press, 2002. {{ISBN|1-887128-88-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their first album, ''Force the Hand of Chance'' (1982), P-Orridge used a [[kangling]], or Tibetan trumpet made out of a human thigh-bone; the instrument had been introduced to P-Orridge by [[David Tibet]], and attracted attention to their music.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=203}} P-Orridge had become acquainted with [[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]] and ideologue of [[LaVeyan Satanism]],{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=158}} with LaVey making an appearance on the Psychic TV song "Joy", in which he recites the [[Lord's Prayer]] backwards.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=179}} From 1988, the band came under the increasing influence of the [[acid house]] genre of dance music,{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=179}} and were responsible for helping the popularisation of acid house music in Europe.{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=156}}

Psychic TV made its debut in 1982 at an event organised by P-Orridge, David Dawson, and Roger Ely, called ''The Final Academy''. It was a 4-day multimedia celebratory rally held in Manchester and at the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton, South London. It brought performers and audience together with literature, performance, film and music. PTV, [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]], [[Z'EV]], [[John Giorno]], William S. Burroughs, [[Brion Gysin]], Terry Wilson, [[Jeff Nuttall]], and The Last Few Days participated to honour the cut-up techniques and theories of [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Ian Sommerville (technician)|Ian Sommerville]], [[Antony Balch]] and Gysin. Video projection and early [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] were used here, as well as whispered utterances by P-Orridge reprocessed as a soundtrack to Gysin's [[Dreamachine|Dreammachine]] by the [[Hafler Trio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=pq_o5ky6MiYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=genesis+p-orridge+hafler+trio+dreamachine#v=onepage&amp;q=genesis%20p-orridge%20hafler%20trio%20dreamachine&amp;f=false | author=Klarion | title=Dream On | work=Headpress 25 |date=October 2003 | publisher=Headpress| isbn=9781900486262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-eighties, Psychic TV aimed to release a live album on the 23rd of each month for 23 months&lt;ref name=allmusicptv/&gt; in recognition of [[the 23 enigma]]. The group didn't reach its goal but still managed fourteen albums in eighteen months, thus earning them an entry in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]].&lt;ref name=allmusicptv/&gt; Following the culmination of Psychic TV but before embarking on Thee Majesty, P-Orridge and several Psychic TV musicians formed Splinter Test, a name adopted from one of P-Orridge's essays on sampling.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=201}}

In 1981,{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=156}} P-Orridge also founded a loosely organised network of occultists named [[Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth]] (TOPY), with the aid of Balance, Tibet, and a number of members of the [[Process Church of the Final Judgement]], a group which had exerted an influence on P-Orridge's occult thought.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=202}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Greer, John Michael | title=The New Encyclopedia of the Occult | page=474 | publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide | year=2003 | isbn=978-1-56718-336-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; TOPY was conceived not as an occult order of teaching, but a forum to facilitate discussions on occult ideas by like-minded people, and from its beginnings was understood by its founders to be a successor to the late 19th and early 20th century [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO), especially as the latter had been run under Crowley's leadership.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=204}} Evans described TOPY as "a 'fusion' organisation, creating a crossover of punk/experimental music with [[chaos magic]]al thinking and practice", making particular use of the sigilisation practices of occult artist [[Austin Osman Spare]].{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=358}} Journalist Gavin Baddeley described TOPY as "perhaps the most influential new occult order of the 1980s".{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=156}} P-Orridge had never wanted to be seen as the leader of an occult order, although many of those involved in TOPY were frustrated that outsiders regularly described P-Orridge as the group's leader. Accordingly, P-Orridge separated from TOPY in 1991, although it continued as a fan community after the departure.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=358|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=157|3a1=Partridge|3y=2013|3p=202}}

Having been encouraged by Christian groups involved in propagating the [[moral panic]] about alleged [[Satanic ritual abuse]],{{sfn|Baddeley|2010|p=157}} the [[Channel 4]] 1992 documentary show ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' claimed to have discovered videotapes depicting P-Orridge sexually abusing children in a ritual setting.{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=100–101}} Police from the [[Obscene Publications Squad]] subsequently raided P-Orridge's home, and confiscated several tonnes of art work.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=101|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=157}} At the time, P-Orridge was in Thailand undertaking famine-relief work; fearing arrest and loss of child custody upon return to the UK, P-Orridge stayed out of the country for several years, settling in the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Evans|1y=2007|1p=101|2a1=Baddeley|2y=2010|2p=157}} P-Orridge believed that the negative press and police attention were the result of a vendetta conceived by a right-wing fundamentalist Christian group.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=101}} It was subsequently revealed that the footage obtained did not depict child abuse. Instead, it was a video artwork titled ''First Transmissions'' that had been made in the early 1980s, partially funded by Channel 4 themselves; the footage depicted [[Sex magic|sex-magic]] rites between adults, blood-letting performances, and scenes of the filmmaker [[Derek Jarman]] reading passages from the work of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. Embarrassed by these revelations, Channel 4 retracted their initial accusations.{{sfn|Evans|2007|p=101}}

In June 2010, P-Orridge sold the Ridgewood property, holding a [[garage sale]] in the basement of a local art gallery to sell off a range of personal items, in addition to an array of [[dildo]]s.&lt;ref name="Cam" /&gt; This accomplished, P-Orridge moved to a one-bedroom apartment in New York's [[Lower East Side]],&lt;ref name="Cam" /&gt; and continued producing art in this home.&lt;ref name="Reinventions"/&gt; P-Orridge returned to touring with Psychic TV in 2016 with the release of their album ''[[Alienist (album)|Alienist]]''. The tour lasted from mid-September to early December, with concerts in Greece, Israel, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=23 August 2016 |title=Psychic TV "Alienist" Fall Tour Dates Announced! |website=P-Orridge Shoppe |url=https://porridgeshoppe.myshopify.com/blogs/frontpage/psychic-tv-alienist-fall-tour-dates-announced|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, P-Orridge gained publicity for an interview critical of [[Caitlyn Jenner]]'s self-description as a "spokesperson" for the transgender community, stating that Jenner was "clueless" and did not know what life was like for the majority of transgender people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=27 August 2016 |title=Genesis P-Orridge: Caitlyn Jenner should 'stop being a spokesperson' |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/27/genesis-p-orridge-caitlyn-jenner-transgender-spokesperson |accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the summer of 2016, P-Orridge's artwork was the subject of an exhibition, "Try to Altar Everything", at the [[Rubin Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. The exhibition contained paintings, sculptures, and installations inspired by the [[Hindu mythology]] that P-Orridge had encountered in Kathmandu.&lt;ref name="Battaglia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Battaglia |first=Andy |date=1 July 2016 |title=Could it be magick?

This was occultural direct action – esoterrorism!"

Influenced by concepts from both [[Western esotericism]] and [[Modern paganism|contemporary Paganism]], P-Orridge's work is designed to confront the audience with ways of thinking alien to the mainstream values of Western society.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=190}} The [[religious studies]] scholar [[Christopher Partridge]] characterised P-Orridge's work as being a "confluence of pornography, violence, death, degradation, the confrontation of taboo subjects, noise and Paganism", deliberately courting controversy and expressing an anti-establishment stance.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|pp=189–190}} Partridge suggested that this intent to shock emerged both out of a serious attempt to highlight the mechanisms of [[social control]] in Western society and also out of "a juvenile delight gained from extreme behaviour and the offence caused".{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=190}}

P-Orridge's work was particularly influenced by the early 20th-century English artist and occultist [[Austin Osman Spare]], who shared his disdain for mainstream morality and fascination with sexuality and the human body.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=195}} P-Orridge adopted Spare's views on [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]], coming to see their own work as a form of sigil magic.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|pp=196–197}} Spare's sigilisation process entailed writing down one's desires, before crossing out any letters that are repeated and then combining the remaining letters into an abstract design, or sigil; the magician must then focus on that sigil and mentally absorb it, and – according to Spare's claims – psychic energies operating on the subconscious ensure that the original desire is manifested in reality. P-Orridge adopted this theory, believing that their work operates according to its principles.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|pp=196–197}}

A further element of P-Orridge's work is their common use of idiosyncratically use of grammar and spelling, such as "Thee" in place of "the", "ov" in place of "of" and (especially in early writings) "butter" in place of "but". The purpose of this is to challenge thought and established ways of reading.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=201}}

P-Orridge has two daughters, Caresse and Genesse, with former wife [[Paula P-Orridge]] (born Paula Brooking). An interview with Genesis and Paula P-Orridge appeared in the book ''[[Modern Primitives (book)|RE/Search: Modern Primitives]]'' in 1989,&lt;ref name="Modern Primitives"&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Primitives |author1-link=V.

On a religious or spiritual level, Christopher Partridge described P-Orridge as representing "a particularly interesting, influential and subversive example of contemporary Paganism."{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=190}} Asserting that P-Orridge's "Industrial Paganism" was different from most forms of contemporary Paganism, Partridge described it as "confrontational, subversive, experimental and, to a large extent, dystopian", with it serving as "an ideological tool" with which to analyse society "from its underbelly; an immersion in the dark side; the subversion of Christian hegemony, conservative politics and what nowadays might be described as [[neoliberalism]]".{{sfn|Partridge|2013|pp=192–193}}
P-Orridge is devoted to the deity [[Eshu|Eshu Elegguá]], an entity from the Afro-Caribbean syncretic religion of [[Santería]].{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=189}} However, P-Orridge has also stated a disbelief in the literal existence of [[Deity|gods]], deeming such entities to instead be "early attempts at psychology, trying to understand the light and dark side of human nature".&lt;ref name="P-Orridge 2011 37"/&gt;

P-Orridge has vociferously criticized contemporary Christianity, describing it as "an incredibly sick social pseudo-religion", and arguing that it was based upon the tenet of "Be good now, agree, or else we will punish you forever and ever when you're dead. And we may punish you while you're alive&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="P-Orridge 2011 37"/&gt;  P-Orridge maintains that such an attitude was established in Christianity by [[St. Paul]] and the early Roman Catholic Church, and that it differed from the "ecstatic mysticism of the original Christianity, the [[Christian Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]]".&lt;ref name="P-Orridge 2011 37"/&gt;

P-Orridge was diagnosed with [[chronic myelomonocytic leukemia]] in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farley|first1=Donovan|title=Throbbing Gristle &amp; Psychic TV founder Genesis Breyer P-Orridge announces leukemia diagnosis|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/10/throbbing-gristle-psychic-tv-founder-genesis-breyer-p-orridge-announces-leukemia-diagnosis/|website=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence their scheduled appearance at the [[Hobart]]/[[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] Mofo Festival, 20–21 Jan 2018, (with Edley O'Dowd), was cancelled.

==Reception and legacy==

According to ''New York'' magazine, P-Orridge became "an icon of the London avant-garde" in 1976.&lt;ref name="orden"/&gt;
Writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 2016, the reporter Hermione Hoby described P-Orridge as a "cult figure"&lt;ref name="Reinventions"/&gt; considered to be "a treasure of the avant-garde by global art institutions".&lt;ref name="Reinventions"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">'''Guerrard Samuel Perrottet''' (23 February 1790 – January 13 (?), 1870) was a Swiss-born, [[botany|botanist]] and [[horticulture|horticulturalist]] who was a native of Praz, in the commune of Vully-le-Bas, today Bas-Vully, canton [[Fribourg]] Switzerland.

He worked as a [[gardening|gardener]] at the [[Jardin des Plantes]], and in 1819–21 was as a [[natural history|naturalist]] on an expedition commanded by Naval Captain Pierre Henri Philibert. Perrottet's duties on the journey involved collecting plants in [[Réunion]], [[Java]], and the [[Philippines]] for re-plantation and cultivation in [[French Guiana|Guyane]]. 

From 1824 to 1829 he performed explorations in Senegambia (region of the present-day nations of [[Senegal]] and the [[The Gambia|Gambia]]), where he served as administrator of "Sénégalaise", a government outpost and trading company. Prior to returning to France in 1829, he explored [[Gorée|Gorée Island]] and [[Cape Verde]]. With [[Jean Baptiste Antoine Guillemin]] (1796–1842) and [[Achille Richard]] (1794–1852), he published a work on the flora of Senegambia called ''Florae Senegambiae Tentamen'' (1830–1833), with its illustrative work being done by [[Joseph Decaisne]] (1807–1882).

In 1832 Perrottet was appointed correspondent of the [[Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in [[Paris]], and from 1834 to 1839 was assigned to the [[botanical garden]] in [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]]. In 1839 he returned to France, where he became involved with [[bombyx mori|silkworm]] cultivation. From 1843 until his death in 1870, he headed and established the botanical gardens in Pondicherry as they are known today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000006449 JSTOR Global Plants] (biography)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustave Moreau''' ({{IPA-fr|mɔʁo|lang}}; 6 April 1826 – 18 April 1898) was a major figure in French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painting]] whose main emphasis was the illustration of [[Bible|biblical]] and [[mythological]] figures. As a painter, Moreau appealed to the imaginations of some [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] writers and artists.  
He is recognized for his works that are influenced by the [[Italian Renaissance]] and exoticism. His art work was preserved in Paris at the [[Musée national Gustave Moreau|Musée Gustave Moreau]].

== Biography ==
He was born in Paris, France, at 6 Rue des Saints-Peres. He came from a middle-class family. His father, Louis Jean Marie Moreau, was an architect for the city of Paris and his mother, née Adele Pauline Desmoutier, was an accomplished musician. Gustave Moreau lived a sheltered life growing up. Having visited Italy at age 15 he began his love for art. At age 18 he entered [[École des Beaux-Arts]] to study under the guidance of [[François-Édouard Picot]] and left in 1850.&lt;ref name="Gustave Moreau: His Life and Work"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paladilhe|first1=Jean|title=Gustave Moreau: His Life and Work|date=1972|publisher=Praeger Publishers|lccn=71-151833}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then began to study art under his new mentor [[Théodore Chassériau]], whose work strongly influenced his own. Moreau participated in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] for the first time in 1852.

Moreau had a 25-year personal, possibly romantic relationship, with Adelaide-Alexandrine Dureux (b.Guise, 8 November 1835), a woman whom he drew several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Julius Kaplan|Kaplan]] | first = [[Julius Kaplan|Julius]] | title = Gustave Moreau | publisher = Little Brown &amp; Company | year = 1974 | pages = 7, 55 | isbn = 0-8212-0628-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first painting was a ''[[Pietà]]'' which is now located in the cathedral at [[Angoulême]]. He showed ''A Scene from the Song of Songs'' and ''The Death of Darius'' in the Salon of 1853. In 1853, he contributed ''Athenians with the Minotaur'' and ''Moses Putting Off his Sandals within Sight of the Promised Land'' to the Great Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/M/moreau.html|title=Artchive Gustave Moreau|publisher=www.artchive.com|access-date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Oedipus and the Sphinx]]'', one of his first Symbolist paintings, was exhibited at the Salon of 1864. Moreau quickly gained a reputation for eccentricity. One commentator said Moreau's work was "like a pastiche of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] created by a German student who relaxes from his painting by reading [[Schopenhauer]]."&lt;ref name=ELS&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward.]] (1972) ''Symbolist Art''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 63. {{ISBN|0500201250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting currently resides in the permanent collection at the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winkfield|first=Trevor|title=A Letter to Bryan Osburn from Trevor Winkfield|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=April 2012|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2012/04/artseen/a-letter-to-bryan-osburn-from-trevor-winkfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 1890, Alexandrine Dureux died. Her death affected Moreau greatly, and his work after this point contained a more melancholic edge. She was buried at the same cemetery that Moreau himself would be laid to rest (see below).

Moreau became a professor at Paris' École des Beaux-Arts in October 1891. Among his many students were [[Fauvism|fauvist]] painters [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Georges Rouault]].  [[Jules Flandrin]], [[Theodor Pallady]] and [[Léon Printemps]] also studied with Moreau.

Moreau died of stomach cancer and was buried at the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]] in [[Paris]] in his parent's tomb.

He was made a Chevalier de la Legion d'honneur in 1875 and was promoted to an Officier de la Legion d'honneur in 1883.

==Style of art==
=== Influence of the Italian Renaissance ===

The death of Chasseriau in 1856 caused Moreau in his grief to stop painting and withdraw from public life. Concerned about his condition, Moreau's parents suggested he travel to Italy again. Living in Italy from 1857 to 1859 he found a new love for art.&lt;ref name="Gustave Moreau: His Life and Work"/&gt; He gained inspiration from the artists of the Italian Renaissance, such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref&gt;Moreau's interest in Leonardo was conditioned by the fact that French historians claimed Leonardo died in France in the hands of King Francois I, according to {{Cite book|title=Les Peintres celebres|last=Valentin|first=Robert Francois|publisher=Tours|year=1841|isbn=|location=|pages=50|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 Moreau won a medal at the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] with his painting ''Oedipus and the Sphinx'', the style of which revealed his close study of the work of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan_Oxford"&gt;Julius Kaplan. "Moreau, Gustave". ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Its firm outlines and detailed modeling are typical of the works that brought him success with critics and the public for the remainder of the decade.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_Oxford"/&gt; In the 1870s, disturbed by criticism that his work had become formulaic, he stopped exhibiting for a few years while he concentrated on renewing his art. In 1876 he completed ''Salome Dancing Before Herod'', which announced a more painterly style that would characterize his later works.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_Oxford"/&gt;

=== Exoticism ===
Gustave Moreau's education in classical drawing did not stop him from experimenting with different styles of art. By traveling to other countries such as Italy or Holland and reading publications Moreau was able to develop his unique form of art. The most important publications Moreau owned were ''The Grammar of Ornament'' by Owen Jones, ''Le costume historique'' by August Racinet, and ''Le Costume'' by Frederick Hottenroth.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Jones, ''Grammaire de l'ornement'' (London, 1865; first ed., London 1856), pl. 28, no.22 (MGM, Inv. 14806); Auguste Racinet, ''Le Costume hisetorique'', 6 vols. (Paris, 1888) (MGM Inv. 10387); Frederick Hottenroth, Le Costume les armes, ustensiles, outils des peuples anciens et modernes (Paris, [1885-99]), p. 17, fig. 7 (MGM Inv. 10391)&lt;/ref&gt; All these influences led Moreau to draw not only humans, but animals and architectural monuments. Moreau started his career drawing classical art, but by incorporating exotic images he developed a mysterious and unique form of art.

==Legacy==
During his lifetime, Moreau produced more than 8,000 paintings, watercolors and drawings. His work influenced the next generation of Symbolists, particularly [[Odilon Redon]] and [[Jean Delville]], a leading figure in Belgian Symbolism in the early part of the twentieth century. Many of Moreau'e works are on display in Paris' [[Musée national Gustave Moreau]] at 14 rue de la Rochefoucauld ([[9th arrondissement of Paris|9th arrondissement]]). The [[museum]] is in his former workshop, and began operation in 1903. [[André Breton]] famously used to "haunt" the museum and regarded Moreau as a precursor of [[Surrealism]].

The Japanese artist [[Yoshitaka Amano]], known for works such as ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Angel's Egg]]'', and ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]'', was inspired by Moreau's style. Amano said in an interview that when he was first experimenting with styles to try to find his own, he would try to mimic the works of Moreau.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.destructoid.com/this-mini-documentary-makes-me-love-yoshitaka-amano-even-more-469313.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gunabhadra''' (394–468) ({{zh|p=Qiúnàbátuóluó|w=Ch'iu-na-pa-t'o-lo|s=求那跋陀罗|t=求那跋陀羅}}) was a [[bhikkhu|monk]] of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] from [[Magadha]], [[India]]. He travelled to China by sea with [[Gunavarma]] in 435. They were both treated as honored guests by [[Emperor Wen of Liu Song]], the ruler of [[Northern and southern China|South China]] at the time. In China, he translated one of the key [[Mahayana sutras]], the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'', from [[Sanskrit]] to [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and the sutra “Bimashōkyō”, which forms "a volume from the Issaikyō (a Buddhist corpus), commonly known as Jingo-ji kyō," as it was handed down at the [[Jingo-ji]] temple.&lt;ref name=bimashokyo&gt;{{cite web|last=Guṇabhadra, 394-468|title=Buddhist Sutra “Bimashōkyō”|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11846/|work=[[World Digital Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Before translating the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'', he translated another important sutra, the ''[[The Collation and Annotation of Saṃyuktāgama|Saṃyuktāgama]]'' into Chinese. He continued to be active in other translations and preaching.

==Early life==
José Luis de Jesús was born in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]] to parents Antonio de Jesús and Ana Luisa Miranda. He claimed that during his youth, he served stints in prison for [[petty theft]] because of the poor conditions that he was living on, and that he was already addicted to [[heroin]] at age 14.&lt;ref name="abc2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="local62007" /&gt; He stated that it was the "power of [[God]] what took me out of my drug addiction" and he soon joined a [[Baptist Church]] in his city.

==Creciendo en Gracia==
José Luis was promoted to [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] after serving several years in the church. Miranda claims that in 1973, he had a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] in which he maintains that he was visited by a pair of [[angel]]s. The impact on Miranda was significant; as he later told ABC News: "The same spirit that was in Jesus of Nazareth, and the same spirit is in me. He came to me. He [integrated] with my person in 1973."&lt;ref name="abc2007" /&gt; It was not long before Miranda started preaching his own ideals and teachings. José Luis moved his then-wife Nydia and five children to South Florida, where he secured a 15-minute time slot from the radio station WVCG-AM to begin preaching.&lt;ref name="newtimesredux2006" /&gt; 

He started to assemble a select number of followers which culminated in the forming of ''Ministerio Creciendo en Gracia'' (Spanish for ''Growing in Grace'') in 1988.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} At first, José Luis was only preaching according to the [[Gospel|Four Gospels]] that narrate the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, but in 1998, he claimed that he was the reincarnation of [[Paul the Apostle]] and changed his focus into reading and preaching about Paul's gospel.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Movement Outreach===
''Creciendo en Gracia'' first started in [[Miami, Florida]] and soon expanded into different places in the [[United States]] and [[Latin America]]. On April 22, 2002, he married Josefina Torres, a woman that he met during one of his trips to Bogotá in 1999. In 2005, he announced that he was the next phase of Jesus Christ on [[Earth]] and self-proclaimed ''Jesus Christ Man''. In 2007, the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' reported that de Jesús "preaches to followers in some 35 nations, mostly in Latin America, and has 287 radio programs and a 24-hour Spanish and English-language TV-network ."&lt;ref name="dallasnews2007" /&gt; He claimed to have two million followers in 30 countries by 2008.&lt;ref name="timefollowing" /&gt;

==Death==
On August 8, 2013, Miranda’s ex-wife, Josefina Torres, claimed that Miranda had died in [[Sugar Land, Texas]] on August 8, 2013, apparently of [[cirrhosis]] of the liver. However, on September 11, Miranda reappeared in public, proclaiming himself in good health. On November 15, Miranda actually died in [[Orlando, Florida]], with his death  confirmed by both his movement and his family.&lt;ref name="VCU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="post2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tesis" /&gt; Miranda's death has remained controversial among his followers. Publicly, his church has continued to insist that Miranda has not "died" and that he is immortal.&lt;ref name="VCU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="post2013" /&gt; He was buried on November 22, 2013 in a ceremony in which only his family and certain followers assisted.&lt;ref name="AcontecerCristianoMuerte" /&gt;

==Beliefs==

===Antichrist===
In late 2006, he claimed that he was the [[Antichrist]]. He stated that the term was appropriate because people are no longer required to follow the "Jewish teachings" of Jesus of Nazareth, but rather to follow the apostle Paul's teachings through De Jesús. According to de Jesús, "Antichrist" means "no longer following Jesus of Nazareth as he lived in the days of his flesh".&lt;ref name="CALLS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fox2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs42007" /&gt; Followers showed their support by getting "[[Number of the Beast|666]]" [[tattoo]]s on their bodies. One of Miranda's followers in Havana, Cuba tattooed the symbol on her three-year-old son. A YouTube video of the mother holding the child as he was tattooed was widely circulated in January 2013.&lt;ref name="hufftattoo" /&gt; "666", de Jesús said, is not a sign of the [[devil]] (he preaches that the devil was destroyed) but instead is the number of the Antichrist and that the number is "a number of wisdom and it displays who is really following the truthful words of Jesus Christ".&lt;ref name="cnnvideo2007" /&gt;

===Christmas===
His followers celebrate Christmas each year on April 22, as this is the day de Jesús was born and therefore they claim it is the "real" Christmas.&lt;ref name="houstonpress2009" /&gt;

===Transformation===
According to his followers, there was to have been a [[Spiritual transformation|Transformation]] day in which members would have supposedly been able to walk through walls and go through fire and not get burned, this because they would have been "fully enlightened and living with an immortal body". José Luis stated that his transformation and that of his followers would occur between June 30, 2012 and July 1, 2012 (sources [[Huffington Post]] and [[Miami New Times]] dispute the exact hour).&lt;ref name="huffcotroneo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miaminewtimes2010" /&gt;

==Controversies==

===Divorce===
José Luis de Jesús Miranda separated from his wife in 2007 because, according to her, "he started to say that he was God; I was not comfortable with that, so he threatened me by sending death-angels to my sons if I didn't do whatever he wanted". She also alleged that he liked to send her far away from home for long periods of time because "he was seeing other women, some of them from ''Creciendo en Gracia''".&lt;ref name="AcontecerCristiano2011" /&gt;

Documents provided to the court by Josefina's attorney demonstrated that José Luis spent extravagantly during the time of the marriage, and used church funds to maintain his lifestyle. One gambling debt to Hard Rock Casino was over $46,000 dollars. Jo-Ann De Jesús, José Luis' daughter and Church treasurer, testified that de Jesús' first wife, Nydia Vélez, receives $12,000 in monthly alimony paid for by the church. Finally, the church bought multiple properties for José Luis in Florida, Texas and Colombia using Church funds and signing the title over to José Luis or Jo-Ann De Jesús.&lt;ref name="cnndivorce" /&gt;

Roberto Piñeiro, the judge in charge of the divorce case, gave an unfavorable verdict towards de Jesús in 2008 and, according to the [[Miami Herald]], Josefina Torres received $2.2 million in properties and estates as compensation.&lt;ref name="miamiherald2007" /&gt; José Luis stated afterwards that he sent "angels of fair retribution to seek for justice" against the judge. Roberto Piñeiro died on December 9, 2010 of a stroke, much to the delight of Miranda's followers.&lt;ref name="noticiacristiana2010" /&gt; {{Dubious |reason=Roberto Piñeiro died on December 9, 2010 of a stroke, much to the delight of Miranda's followers. The subject has a large number of followers. The citation fails to prove their feelings for Piñeiro and his death; I find it difficult to conceive of how any citation could. At the very least, we need to qualify as "some" and provide direct quotes and citations for those followers. If we do not, we enter libel territory. |date=March 2014}}{{Disputed inline|Dubious|for=Roberto Piñeiro died on December 9, 2010 of a stroke, much to the delight of Miranda's followers|date=March 2014}}

==Disappearance of  "Creciendo en Gracia" and groups emerged from this sect==
After the death of José Luis de Jesús Miranda, the great majority of the followers did not want anything more to do with the sect, but some decided to remain united. However, because of the internal struggles for leadership and rival ambition of their leaders, after six months the group had already divided into four factions with different doctrinal positions and social agendas. As a result, it can be said that the sect really ended with the death of José Luis de Jesús Miranda, and that the four factions, which have only retained a meager influence, constitute new movements.&lt;ref name="Tesis" /&gt; These are:

(1°) "La Amada de Jesucristo" ("The Beloved of Jesus Christ") or "Paloma" ("Dove"), directed by [[Andrés Cudris]] [Already deceased],

(2°) "La Ciencia de JH" ("The Science of JH"), [[directed by Emilio Gramajo]],

(3°) "TV Gracia" ("Grace TV") directed by [[Luis Martín Guío]], and

(4 °) "Rey de Salem, El Gobierno de Dios, Melquisedec-Lisbeth" ("King of Salem, The Government of God, [[Melchizedek|Melchizedec]]-Lisbeth"), directed by [[Lisbeth García]] (Widow of José Luis de Jesús Miranda).&lt;ref name="Tesis" /&gt;

'''Mark E. Eaton''' (born January 24, 1957) is an American retired professional [[basketball]] player who was a member of the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Utah Jazz]] from 1982 to 1993, with one [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] selection in 1989, and two [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|NBA Defensive Player of the Year]] awards in 1985 and 1989. Though limited offensively, Eaton's {{height|ft=7|in=4}} height helped him become one of the best defensive centers in NBA history.  Eaton holds the NBA record for most blocks in a season (456) and career average blocked shots per game (3.50).

==Early life and college career==
Eaton was born in [[Inglewood, California]] and grew up in [[Southern California]]. Despite his height, as a youth he was more interested in playing [[water polo]] than basketball. After graduating from [[Westminster High School (Westminster, California)|Westminster High School]], Eaton attended the Arizona Automotive Institute in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and graduated as a service technician. He worked as an auto mechanic for about three years, and was eventually discovered by Tom Lubin while repairing cars in Anaheim in April 1977. Lubin, a chemistry professor, was an assistant basketball coach at Cypress Junior College, and his encouragement led Eaton to enroll at Cypress and try out for the basketball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1187806/1/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Larger Than Real Life | date=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton developed into a solid junior college player. He averaged 14.3 points per game in two seasons at Cypress, and led the school to the California State Title as a sophomore.

After his freshman year at Cypress, he was drafted by the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the [[1979 NBA draft]] with the 107th pick in the 5th round. He was eligible to be drafted because he was already four years out of high school in 1979. However, he opted to return to college basketball.

Eaton transferred to [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) in 1980, but did not see much action in his two seasons with the Bruins. In his senior season, he played just 42 total minutes, averaging 1.3 points and 2.0 rebounds in 11 games.  Eaton was initially disappointed with his inability to play effectively as a Division 1 collegiate player.  [[Wilt Chamberlain]], who frequently attended UCLA practices after his retirement from the NBA, saw Eaton's frustration and, on one occasion, personally took him under a basket to explain that Eaton needed to focus on protecting the basket, getting rebounds, and passing the ball to quicker guards, rather than trying to compete with smaller, quicker players in scoring.  Eaton has cited Chamberlain's advice as the turning point in his basketball career.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|RERLqgpY_K4|Mark Eaton – NBA All-Star}}, motivational speech given by Mark Eaton.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
Because of his lack of playing time at UCLA, few [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] teams had interest in Eaton after he finished his college career. However, the Utah Jazz saw him as a potentially dominant defender and selected him with the 72nd pick in the fourth round of the [[1982 NBA draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/eatonma01.html|
title= Mark Eaton|publisher= Basketball-Reference.Com|accessdate= November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utah coach [[Frank Layden]] would later explain his choice by quoting [[Red Auerbach]]'s old axiom, "you can't teach height".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Howard Fendrich| title=7-Foot-9 Player Joins ABA Club| agency=Associated Press| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/31/AR2007013101778_pf.html| date=2007-01-31| accessdate = 2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his rookie season, Eaton made an immediate impact. He replaced [[Danny Schayes]] as Utah's starting center early in the year, and finished the season with 275 blocked shots (a franchise record) in 81 games. His 3.40 blocks per game ranked third in the NBA, behind [[Atlanta Hawks|Atlanta]]'s [[Tree Rollins|Wayne "Tree" Rollins]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers|San Diego]]'s [[Bill Walton]].

Eaton continued to improve in his second season with the Jazz. In 82 games, he grabbed a team-leading 595 rebounds and blocked 351 shots (breaking his own franchise record). His 4.28 blocks per game led the NBA, well ahead of Rollins (who finished second with 3.60 blocks per game). Eaton's strong defense helped the Jazz make their first-ever playoff appearance. Incidentally, one shot he failed to block during the 1983–84 season was the skyhook which gave [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] his 31,421st point and the NBA's all-time scoring record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121962/index.htm A Sky Hook That Was For The Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eaton's third season (1984–85) was spectacular. He blocked 456 shots, shattering the NBA record for most blocked shots in a single season set during the [[1973–74 NBA season|1973–74 season]] by [[Elmore Smith]] who had blocked 393 shots for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Eaton averaged 5.56 blocks per game, more than double the league's second ranked blocker ([[Houston Rockets|Houston]]'s [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] with 2.68 blocks per game). In addition, Eaton averaged 11.3 rebounds per game, ranking fifth in the league in that category. For his efforts, he was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team and was honored as the NBA's [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]].

Although he was not a significant offensive contributor, the Jazz relied heavily on Eaton for his shot-blocking, rebounding, and occasional "tippy toe" dunks. With the emergence of superstars [[Karl Malone]] and [[John Stockton]], the Jazz became one of the best teams in the NBA. Eaton's stifling defense was a major factor in Utah's success. He continued to rank among NBA leaders in blocked shots, leading the league in 1986–87 and 1987–88. In 1988–89, he averaged 10.3 rebounds per game (seventh in the NBA) and 3.84 blocks per game (second behind [[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]]'s [[Manute Bol]]). He was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year for the second time in his career, and was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team (for the third time in his career). In addition, he was chosen to play in the [[1989 NBA All-Star Game]], joining teammates Malone and Stockton on the Western Conference team.

In his last few years with the Jazz, Eaton was slowed by knee and back injuries. He remained an imposing defensive presence, but his rebounding and shot-blocking abilities slowly declined. In his last season (1992–93), he played in only 64 games, averaging just 17.3 minutes per game.

==Legacy==
His entire NBA career was spent with the Utah Jazz. In 875 games, he scored 5,216 points, grabbed 6,939 rebounds, and blocked 3,064 shots. At the time of his retirement, he ranked second all-time in league history in total blocked shots, behind [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]'s career total of 3,189.  Abdul-Jabbar played 1,560 games to Eaton's 875. (However, statistics for blocked shots were not kept until the [[1973–74 NBA season|1973–74 season]], missing the first four seasons of Abdul-Jabbar's career.) Eaton is currently the NBA's all-time leader in blocks per game, with a career average of 3.50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/blogs/Off-Track/nba-big-man-eaton-meets-nascars-biggest-track.html|title=NBA big man Eaton meets NASCAR's biggest track|work=[[NASCAR]]|date=2013-06-20|accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To honor his contributions to the team, the Utah Jazz retired Eaton's number 53 during the [[1995–96 NBA season|1995–96 regular season]]. In 2010, Eaton was inducted into The [[Utah Sports Hall of Fame]].

==Retirement==
Mark now spends most his time teaching "The Four Commitments of a Team" to corporations nationwide through his company 7ft4.com. 
Since his retirement, Eaton has worked for [[KJZZ-TV]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], providing color commentary and analysis for television broadcasts of Utah Jazz and [[University of Utah]] basketball games.&lt;ref&gt;Torre, Pablo S., "Larger Than Real Life", ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 4 July 2011, pp. 108-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eaton is a partner in a Salt Lake City-area restaurant named Tuscany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Owner Bios| url=http://www.tuscanyslc.com/owner_bio.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070212082013/http://www.tuscanyslc.com/owner_bio.htm &lt;!-- Bo  t retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a president/board member of the [[National Basketball Retired Players Association]] (NBRPA) from 1997 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eaton|first1=Mark|title=Mark Eaton on LinkedIn|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/markeaton7ft4|publisher=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2005 NBA All - Star Technology Summit|url=http://d24wuq6o951i2g.cloudfront.net/img/events/2358586/assets/072d.2005nbatechnologysummit.pdf|publisher=NBA|date=February 18, 2005|quote=Mark Eaton (President, National Basketball Retired Players Association)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Retirees: Slick NBA still short on skills|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/allstar/2006-02-20-roundtable_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=2006-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded and served as chairman of the Mark Eaton Standing Tall for Youth organization, which provided sports and outdoor activities for at-risk children in [[Utah]]. He is a motivational speaker.

In the 2013 [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest]], Jazz player [[Jeremy Evans]] jumped over a seated Eaton to dunk the ball.

In 2014, Eaton had his high school jersey retired at Westminster High School and at Cypress College along with [[Swen Nater]] and head coach Don Johnson.

'''Mary Cary Rand''' (or '''Rande'''&lt;ref name="Manganiello2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen C. Manganiello|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of the Revolutions and Wars of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1639-1660|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=an-eXXA3DBMC&amp;pg=PA96|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5100-9|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (ca. 1621-1653) was an English writer, prophetess and [[pamphleteer]] supporting the [[Fifth Monarchist]]s during the [[English Civil War]].

==Work==

During the English Civil War, Cary resided in London. A [[Presbyterian]], she became a [[Fifth Monarchist]] and started having prophecies and writing about church reform, equality for women, and poverty.&lt;ref name="Encyc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cary, Mary (c. 1621–after 1653) {{!}} Encyclopedia.com |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/cary-mary-c-1621-after-1653 |website=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=26 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a follower of [[Thomas Brightman]] and [[Henry Archer (Fifth Monarchist)|Henry Archer]].&lt;ref name="LevinBertolet2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carole Levin|author2=Anna Riehl Bertolet|author3=Jo Eldridge Carney|title=A Biographical Encyclopedia of Early Modern Englishwomen: Exemplary Lives and Memorable Acts, 1500-1650|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDglDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA440|date=3 November 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-315-44071-2|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believed the [[New Model Army]] was a sign of the arrival of the [[Two witnesses]] and that [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was the little horn found in [[Daniel 7]].&lt;ref name="Manganiello2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LevinBertolet2016"/&gt; She believed Charles I's death to be the sign of the impending return of Christ.&lt;ref name="Manganiello2004"/&gt; Her prophecies focused around Parliamentarian victory, believing it would result in the building of [[Kingship and kingdom of God|God's kingdom on earth]] in 1701.&lt;ref name="Manganiello2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LevinBertolet2016"/&gt; This would be summarized in her first phamphlet, ''The Resurrection of the Two Witnesses'' in 1648.&lt;ref name="Manganiello2004"/&gt; 

Her major works, ''The Little Horns Doom and Downfall'' and ''A New and Exact Mappe or Description of New Jerusalems Glory'', were released in 1651. [[Hugh Peters]] and [[Christopher Feake]] wrote introductions to the books. The books were dedicated to [[Elizabeth Cromwell]], [[Bridget Ireton]] and Margaret Rolle. In her many additional works, she expressed interest in Parliament providing more support to the poor, including ending [[tithing]], and universities providing scholarships to fund impoverished preachers and scholars.&lt;ref name="Manganiello2004"/&gt; 

Her last work, published in 1653, was ''The Resurrection of the Witnesses and England's Fall''. The work stated that Christianity would spread across Europe in the wake of England losing the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]].&lt;ref name="LevinBertolet2016"/&gt;

Until 1651, she wrote under the moniker "M.C." It wasn't until 1651 that her gender identity was revealed to be a woman.&lt;ref name="LevinBertolet2016"/&gt;

==Personal life==

Little is known of Cary's personal life. She is believed to have started developing her theories and prophecies in the wake of studying the Bible starting at the age of 15.&lt;ref name="Hartley2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cathy Hartley|title=A Historical Dictionary of British Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uY2B224NwmYC&amp;pg=PA180|date=15 April 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-35534-0|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born Mary Cary around 1621 and died in 1653. She was married to a man with the surname "Rand" or "Rande."&lt;ref name="Manganiello2004"/&gt;

== Career ==
Froman, a former [[Paratroopers Brigade (IDF)|Israeli paratrooper]] who took part in the 1967 capture of the [[Western Wall]], was a student at the [[Mercaz haRav]] and [[Yeshivat HaKotel]] [[yeshiva]]s. He was among the founders of the Gush Emunim settlement movement, and supported the establishment of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He obtained [[Semicha|rabbinical ordination]] from Rabbis [[Shlomo Goren]] and [[Avraham Shapira]], and then became the rabbi of [[Migdal Oz]], a settlement in the Gush Etzion area. He was Chief Rabbi of the [[Knesset]]. He taught at several yeshivas, including [[Ateret Cohanim]] and [[Machon Meir]], and was a lecturer at the Tekoa Yeshiva and [[Otniel (village)|Otniel]] [[hesder]] Yeshiva.

== Views and ideologies ==

=== Interfaith meetings and dialogue ===
Rabbi Froman was involved in interfaith dialogue with Palestinians and Muslims, and participated in informal negotiations with many Palestinian leaders as he argued that peacemaking efforts between Israelis and Palestinians must include the religious sectors of both societies. Rabbi Froman conducted meetings with controversial Palestinian leaders, including with the late PLO Chairman and President of [[Palestinian National Authority]] [[Yasser Arafat]], and the [[Hamas]] leaders [[Sheikh Ahmad Yassin]] and [[Mahmoud Al-Zahar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/971009/1997100911.html| title= Sheikh Yassin, Rabbi Menachem Froman to meet| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930205848/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/971009/1997100911.html| archivedate= 30 September 2007| df= dmy-all}} (''www.arabicnews.com'', 9 October 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/rabbi-menachem-froman-of-west-bank-settlement-tekoa-dies-at-68.premium-1.507248&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Froman had close ties with Palestinian leaders, as evidenced by a letter he sent to Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] about his last conversation with Yasser Arafat:
{{Cquote|
I remember my last conversation with him, close to his death, when he answered me with emotion: "You are my brother!" and of course it is possible to explain his emotion, that he wanted to tell me, close to his death, that the two nations&amp;nbsp;– the Israelis and the Palestinians&amp;nbsp;– are brothers, that if the fate of one improves so does the fate of its double. The president customarily would thank me for these blessings and would order that these blessings be publicized in the Palestinian newspapers so that the Palestinian nation will know that there are Jewish rabbis who are blessing them with blessings of peace.&lt;ref name="letter-Jan2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to Abu Mazen |publisher=www.jerusalempeacemakers.org |date=2005-02-25 |url=http://www.jerusalempeacemakers.org/froman/let-AbuMazen.html |accessdate=2008-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122001458/http://www.jerusalempeacemakers.org/froman/let-AbuMazen.html |archivedate=22 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the election of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, Rabbi Froman stepped up his efforts to organize meetings between Israeli and Palestinian religious leaders. He met and conducted negotiations with current Hamas leader [[Mahmoud al-Zahar]] and Hamas's Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, Sheikh Mahmoud Abu Tir, with the goal of drafting a ceasefire agreement that will end the killings in Gaza and the West Bank and lift the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jerusalempeacemakers.org/peacemakers/rabbi-menachem-froman/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126112712/http://jerusalempeacemakers.org/peacemakers/rabbi-menachem-froman/ |archivedate=26 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Froman–Amayreh Agreement (2008) ===
In February 2008, Rabbi Froman reached an agreement proposal with Khaled Amayreh, a journalist close to Hamas, for an Israeli-Hamas ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that would put an immediate end to all Palestinian attacks against Israeli civilians or soldiers, facilitate the release of abducted Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]], and end the Israeli siege of the Gaza Strip. Senior Hamas officials have endorsed the agreement proposal. The Israeli government, however, has not responded to this initiative, effectively rejecting it.&lt;ref name="ettinger" /&gt;

Froman drafted the agreement proposal with Amayreh after meeting with him over the course of several months. The paper was finalized and shown to Hamas leaders in Gaza and Hamas leader-in-exile [[Khaled Meshal]] who approved of it (see [[Menachem Froman#External links|External links section]]). The agreement proposal was also submitted to the [[Israeli government]] but according to Rabbi Froman, the Israeli government never responded to it.&lt;ref name="ettinger" /&gt; The efforts of Rabbi Froman and Amayreh to meet with Israeli government officials were rebuffed.

The agreement proposal called for Israel to lift economic sanctions imposed on the Gaza Strip and open all border crossings. The cease-fire agreement included the release of abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and a gradual release of Palestinian prisoners. The Israel Defense Forces would end "all hostile activities toward the Gaza Strip, including [[targeted killing]]s, the setting of ambushes, aerial bombardments and all penetrations into Gazan territory, in addition to ending the arrest, detention and persecution of Palestinians in the Strip."&lt;ref name="ettinger" /&gt;

The Palestinians would be obligated "to take all the necessary steps to completely end the attacks against Israel," including stopping "indefinitely all rocket attacks on Israel," assaults "on Israeli civilians and soldiers" and "to impose a cease-fire on all groups, factions, and individuals operating in the Strip."&lt;ref name="ettinger" /&gt;

Along with Amayreh, Rabbi Froman said that even if the attempt turned out to be merely an academic exercise, its elements could be used by the Jerusalem and Gaza governments. It does not, for example, include the recognition by Hamas of the State of Israel, instead "recognizing that there are Jews living in the Holy Land," according to Froman, thus overcoming an obstacle that has long been a deal-breaker.

=== The importance of religion in the peace process ===
Rabbi Froman lamented the early 21st century violence in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and laid partial blame for the failure of the [[Oslo Accords]] on the tendency of Israeli and Palestinian secular negotiators to ignore and marginalize religion and religious leaders in the peace process:
{{Cquote|[[Ahmad Yassin]] told me about the Oslo Accords that they were an agreement between our heretics and your heretics to subdue religion. The Oslo Accords collapsed because the PLO could not control the other forces. Hamas has the power to enforce agreements to end violence. Even Arafat could not control and enforce agreements on murderous units in his organization and in Hamas. But if Hamas has a strong enough interest for a ceasefire, they can enforce it. It's not easy, because in the Palestinian society there are many groups and resistance committees, and also plain underworld figures. But if there will be a coalition with the PLO and Hamas to achieve a ceasefire, the chances of ending the shooting of [[Qassam rocket]]s on [[Sderot]] are much better. Our primary goal should be achieving a ceasefire, and to reach that goal the politicians need to negotiate with politicians, and the rabbis negotiate with the religious leaders.&lt;ref name = "ettinger2006"&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Jerusalem – a shared capital ===
Rabbi Froman supported making [[Jerusalem]] (the capital of Israel, also claimed by the Palestinians as their capital) the religious capital of all three [[monotheistic]] faiths. In November 1999, he participated in a conference with dozens of international religious leaders, including the [[Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/wtnarchive/1999/11/28_3.html |title=Religious leaders meet in Israel, urge peace}}, by Elaine Ruth Fletcher (''World Tibet Network News '', 28 November 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2005 letter to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Froman cited examples from Jewish tradition of the importance of sharing Jerusalem between all 3 religions and turning it into a city of peace:
{{Cquote|From the difficult experience of the shared history of the two nations – the Israel nation and the Palestinian nation – we can learn one important thing – between two brothers – when one's fate is bad, the fate is also bad of the second. Only when it is good for one, it will be, with God's help, good for its double. Little Jewish children know the famous story (the ''[[hadith]]'') of the man who came to the head of the Jewish Sages and asked him to teach him the principle of the Jewish religion while he was standing on one foot (in one sentence). The Sage taught him, "Love your neighbor exactly how you would love yourself...From this ''hadith'', which summarized the main principle of our religion, it's possible to learn that just as Jews have obtained a free and thriving state from Allah the Exalted, respected in the world, and just as we obtained from Allah the Exalted a state with Jerusalem as its capital, our neighbor will also obtain a state with its capital as Jerusalem. If both nations will be fortunate to stone the Cursed Satan who stimulates war and hate, and establish Jerusalem as a capital of peace of Israel and Palestine, there will be, God willing, Jerusalem the Capital of Peace for the whole world!&lt;ref name = "letter-Jan2005"/&gt;}}

=== Coexistence under Palestinian sovereignty ===
Rabbi Froman opposed the forced eviction of Jewish settlers from their homes in the settlements in the West Bank, and advocated that the State of Israel withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, yet leave the settlements and Israeli/Jewish residents in place under Palestinian sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kibush.co.il/show_file.asp?num=12986 |title= Next in line}}, by Meron Rapoport (''[[Haaretz]]'', 30 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that, if Israel withdraws from Tekoa and most residents leave, he will nonetheless stay because of his love of the [[Land of Israel]]:
{{Cquote|"But what matters is the holiness of this land. I prefer to live here in a [[Palestinian State|future Palestine]] than leave to live in an Israeli state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/03/08/wmid08.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/03/08/ixworld.html |title=Rabbi Froman will not be moving an inch |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph}}, by Harry de Quetteville (''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', March 8, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was a strong opponent of [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza]]. In August 2005, prior to the implementation of the disengagement plan, he moved with his family to [[Ganei Tal, Hof Aza|Ganei Tal]] in [[Gush Katif]] in order to show support for the residents being evicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtDisengagement.jhtml?itemNo=612884&amp;contrassID=23&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0 |title=Ganei Tal / For Rabbi Froman, God was 'in the computer.' But is he in Ganei Tal?}}, by Yoav Stern (''[[Haaretz]]'', August 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Froman supported the Palestinian Authority's efforts to attain statehood recognition at the United Nations on 20 September 2011, and said that the establishment of the Palestinian state will benefit the peace process and Israel.&lt;ref name=jpFroman&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=236201 |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |title=Rabbi Froman meets Abbas, pledges support for UN bid |date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal ==

'''Namora''' ({{IPAc-en|n|eɪ|ˈ|m|ɔr|ə}}) is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is from [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] and is the daughter of an Atlantean father and a human mother. She is the cousin of [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]].

==Publication history==
Namora first appeared in the 12-pages comics "The Coming of Namora!" published in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #82 (May 1947), pencilled by [[Ken Bald]] and inked by [[Syd Shores]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/issue/5896/ GCD]&lt;/ref&gt;. Namora also featured on the cover drawn by [[Bob Powell]]. She had her own comic book series, ''Namora'', which ran from August–December 1948. While this title lasted only three issues, she regularly appeared with Namor in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' and also in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' until that series ended in the mid-1950s.

The character was not seen again for some time until her first modern appearance in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] ''Sub-Mariner'' series, in ''Sub-Mariner'' #33 (January 1971). She made an appearance in ''Marvel Feature'' #2 (March 1972), but was killed off in flashback in ''Sub-Mariner'' #50 (June 1972).

Over the next 30 years, Namora appeared in a number of flashbacks and alternate reality stories, including ''What If?'' #9 (June 1978), ''The New Warriors Annual'' #1 (1991), ''What If?'' #47 (March 1993), ''The New Warriors'' #44 (February 1994), ''Avengers: Forever'' #4-5 (March–April 1999), and ''Marvel: The Lost Generation'' #3-2 (December 2000-January 2001).

Namora eventually reappears, alive, in the ''Agents of Atlas'' series, in issues #1-6 (October 2006-March 2007). She also appears in ''Incredible Hulk'' #107-112 (August–December 2007), ''Giant-Size Marvel Adventures: Avengers'' #1 (September 2007), ''World War Hulk'' #2 (September 2007), ''Spider-Man Family'' #4 (October 2007), and ''Incredible Hercules'' #121-122 (November–December 2008).

Namora received an entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Golden Age 2004''.

She was ranked 76th in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 49| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Namora is a character that originated in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. Her original name was Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, but she was nicknamed "Namora" in honor of her cousin [[Namor]]. Like Namor, she is a hybrid mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the wings on her ankles. When her father was killed by treasure-hunting surface-dwellers, she fully changed her name to Namora, the Atlantean term for "Avenging Daughter", as Namor means "Avenging Son".  She was Namor's cousin (though not by blood), and became his companion for a period of several years.

Namora was ultimately shown to have been fatally poisoned by the Lemurian terrorist [[Llyra]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sub-Mariner'' #50&lt;/ref&gt;  She was survived by her [[cloning|clone]], [[Namorita]], whom she had passed off as her birth daughter because of Atlantian taboos against cloning.  ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]'' revealed that she had been a member of The [[Monster Hunters]] in 1956.

===Agents of Atlas===
{{main|Agents of Atlas}}
Some time later, the [[Agents of Atlas]] find a damaged coffin, which appears to contain the mummified corpse of Namora.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Upon closer inspection, [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]] disables a holographic display creating the corpse image, revealing a well-preserved, alive Namora inside the coffin. When awakened, Namora joins in a fight against underwater sea creatures and displays just how powerful she is, shown to be equal in power to her cousin [[Namor]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Jimmy Woo]] offers her a spot, and Namora joins the [[Agents of Atlas]], where she leads [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]] to recover all memories of her past life as a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]], almost driving her mad in the process. It is then revealed by the enhanced bliss inducing powers of the naiad that Namora's innermost desire is to sleep with her cousin Namor.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the team manages to reach the [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]], revealed as the mastermind behind the Atlas Foundation, and willing to give his leading role to Jimmy Woo. Woo accepts, and Namora, as the other Agents, are employed to travel the world in Marvel Boy's spaceship to shut down any rebellious cell still pursuing criminal objectives.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point in her career as an Agent of Atlas she takes an extended leave, or leaves the role altogether, to join [[Amadeus Cho]]'s group during the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' event.&lt;ref name="ih107"&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' #107&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War Hulk===
{{main|World War Hulk}}
Angry over the death and subsequent vilification of her daughter at the onset of the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] over government registration, Namora joins [[Amadeus Cho]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]] to aid the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].&lt;ref name="ih107"/&gt; During the crisis, Hercules ends up holding the entire locality of Manhattan on his shoulders.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

===Amazon-Atlantean War===
In the course of her membership in Cho's group, she shares a genuinely romantic kiss with Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk #111&lt;/ref&gt;  Some time later, following the [[Secret Invasion]], Hercules and Amadeus Cho vacation near an Atlantean city, and she and Hercules have a romantic fling.  This is interrupted by an [[Amazons|Amazon]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hercules'' #121&lt;/ref&gt; Namora aids Hercules in repelling the Amazons and rescuing Cho from their amorous and ultimately fatal attentions.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hercules'' #124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark Reign===
The Agents of Atlas decide to oppose Osborn's agenda by taking on the role of "supervillains", in order to form close ties to Osborn. After some time, the group becomes aware of Norman's [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] to find out that a member of the group is none other than Namora's cousin, [[Namor]]. Upon finding this out, the Agents confront Namor for his involvement in the group. Initially at odds with each other for their recent decisions, Namora and Namor end up kissing and beginning a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''Agents of Atlas'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Namora contemplates staying with Namor until it is revealed that it was Atlantean elders that plotted for them to start a relationship and mate a long time ago as human/Atlantean hybrids are so powerful. Namor and Namora decide to part ways as they were unsure how much of their feelings for each other were genuine and how much was due to the secret plotting of the elders.&lt;ref&gt;''Agents of Atlas'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinity===
During ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'', Namora's Atlantean School is chosen as one of the institutions set to do battle in the new [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]. However, Atlantis is attacked and decimated by the forces of [[Thanos]] before the competition can begin. Namora sends a desperate plea for help to [[Hank Pym]], but the kingdom is destroyed before action can be taken.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity: The Hunt'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Namora possesses [[superhuman]] strength and can fly. She is nearly invulnerable as bullets and other missiles cannot penetrate her extremely tough skin. She can swim at superhuman speeds, breathe underwater, and is immune to the cold and pressures of the depths. She can also see better underwater than a normal human. Namora must periodically immerse herself in water to retain her powers and her health.

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
The second Namora  first appeared in ''[[Exiles (comic book)|Exiles]]'' #46, and was created by [[Tony Bedard]] and [[Mizuki Sakakibara]], and was associated with the multiversal travelers called the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]. She is an alternate-Earth counterpart of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], rather than of Aquaria Nautica Neptunia, the [[Earth-616]] Namora. She is a mutant with superhuman strength and the power of flight by using the ankle wings on her feet. Unlike the Marvel Universe Namor and Namora, she has the blue skin of most Atlanteans.

In Namora's universe, she became an early ally of [[Charles Xavier]] who convinced her to not attack the surface world. She would later do so, after anti-mutant hysteria led to the imprisonment of most mutants. Namora killed all of her Earth's superheroes, having the most difficulty with the [[Fantastic Four]], and she conquered the world and ruled it for decades, before becoming 'unhinged' in time and forced to join the Exiles, much to her chagrin.  Having a haughty attitude, she acted like she was superior to the other members. Still, she has shown that she did care for them, as evidenced when she thought that [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] had killed [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]]. She lashed out at Hyperion, breaking his neck. However, it was for naught. Hyperion recovered quickly and blasted Namora with his "flash vision", killing her. The Exiles later sent her body back to her home reality ([[Marvel Multiverse#Known alternate universes|Earth-2189]]) for burial.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
Namora appeared in the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] series. In the  story, "Eternity Twilight", Namora rescued Bruce Banner, who suffered temporary amnesia and have fallen for him not before Banner regained his memory involving the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] (a [[Godzilla]]-like beast accidentally summoned by Banner). Afterwards, Banner and Namora went back to the surface and helps Earth's heroes battle not only the Hulk, but also the demon-god [[Dormammu]].

===Marvel Her-oes===
A teenaged version of Namora appears as one of the main protagonists in the all-ages ''Marvel Her-oes'' series, which was written by [[Grace Randolph]]. She attends the same high school as [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]] and [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], and hides her Atlantean heritage by claiming to be an exchange student from Greece under the name of "Namora Aquarius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.12082.marvel_hotline~colon~_grace_randolph |title=Marvel Hotline: Grace Randolph &amp;#124; Marvel Heroes &amp;#124; Comic News &amp;#124; News |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
During the ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' storyline, Thing, Invisible Woman, and Dr. Arthur Molekevic fight Doctor Dorcas alongside Namora and a Tiger Shark in Atlantis and defeat him.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #60&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcus Aurelius Nigrinianus''', known in English as '''Nigrinian''' (d. 284/285), was probably the son of Roman Emperor [[Carinus]] and an heir to the throne, and grandson of the Roman Emperor [[Carus]] who founded his royal family. Not much is known about him. It is assumed that Carinus' wife [[Magnia Urbica]] was his mother, but it has been proposed that he was actually the son of [[Aurelia Paulina]], Carinus' sister and thus the Emperor's nephew. Nigrinian died in infancy in late 284 or early 285. After his death he was given divine status.&lt;ref&gt;David L.

{{nihongo|'''Roy Mustang'''|ロイ・マスタング|Roi Masutangu}} is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'' [[manga]] series and its adaptations created by [[Hiromu Arakawa]]. In the series, Mustang is a State Alchemist of Amestris' [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#State Military|State Military]], as well as the superior of the series' [[protagonist]], [[Edward Elric]]. Mustang holds the title of {{nihongo|"Flame Alchemist"|焔の錬金術師|Honō no Renkinjutsushi}} for his ability to create fire with alchemy, and he ambitiously strives to become the next leader of Amestris. Despite his ambition, as the series continues, Mustang decides to overthrow the State Military after his best friend, [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Maes Hughes|Maes Hughes]], is killed by the [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Homunculi|homunculi]], who are controlling the Military.

Besides his appearances in the manga and the anime, Mustang has also been featured in other media for the series, such as Makoto Inoue's [[light novel]]s, the [[original video animation]]s and the ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' [[video game]]s. Since his introduction in the manga series, Mustang has been well received by readers, appearing second in each popularity poll for the series. His character has also received praise in various outside media, with many of them focusing on his character and development in both manga and anime.

==Appearances==
Roy Mustang is introduced in ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' as a 29-year-old State Alchemist working for Amestris' State Military and as [[Edward Elric]]'s superior. Outwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and adaptable.&lt;ref name="ch4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 1|chapter=Chapter 4|year=2005|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-59116-920-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the series, he appears as a ruthless careerist and a womanizer. However, he is known to bear strong feelings towards [[Riza Hawkeye]], although he seldom shows it. He is also eventually shown to be a rather paternal commander who greatly cares for the emotional and physical well-being of his men, which earns him the fierce loyalty of his subordinates.&lt;ref name="ch24"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 6|chapter=Chapter 24|year=2006|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-0319-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paternal nature stems from his experience in the Ishbal Civil War, where he was forced to kill using his flame alchemy, despite having learned it to help people. Angered with how he was used in the war, Mustang resolved to become the country's next leader.&lt;ref name="ch59"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 14|chapter=Chapter 59|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-1380-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extremely powerful alchemist in his own right, Mustang wears gloves made from "ignition cloth" with transmutation circles that create sparks or flames when he rubs his fingers together. By adjusting the oxygen densities in the surrounding atmosphere through alchemy, he can create flames anywhere in the surrounding area at will and manipulate them as he desires with "pinpoint accuracy".&lt;ref name="ch5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 2|chapter=Chapter 5|year=2005|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-59116-923-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is often commented that Mustang is unable to produce fire with his gloves wet,&lt;ref name="ch7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 2|chapter=Chapter 7|year=2005|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-59116-923-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; he can as long as he has some way to call up flame.&lt;ref name="ch38"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 10|chapter=Chapter 38|year=2006|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-0461-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of his best friend, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Maes Hughes|Maes Hughes]], Mustang investigates the incident in secret despite the military closing the case after convicting [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Denny Brosh and Maria Ross|Maria Ross]]. Trusting in Ross's innocence, Mustang fakes Ross's death and engineer her escape from Amestris.&lt;ref name="ch35"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 9|chapter=Chapter 35|year=2006|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-0460-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ch40"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 10|chapter=Chapter 40|year=2006|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-0461-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While breaking into a military laboratory, Mustang kills [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Lust|Lust]], an immortal creature known as a homunculus, who was investigating his actions and was going to kill subordinates.&lt;ref name="ch39"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 10|chapter=Chapter 39|year=2006|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-0461-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovering from his wounds, Mustang learns that the [[Führer]] [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#King Bradley|King Bradley]] is also a homunculus and tries to expose him to the top echelons of the military.&lt;ref name="ch48"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 12|chapter=Chapter 49|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-0839-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move costs Mustang and deprives him of his subordinates - Bradley places Hawkeye under his command and authorizes the transfer of Mustang's remaining personnel to the far reaches of Amestris.&lt;ref name="ch56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 14|chapter=Chapter 56|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-1379-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mustang is later contacted by General [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Olivier Armstrong|Olivier Armstrong]], who is intending to join forces with various troops to attack Central City, the capital of Amestris. He then meets up with his subordinates, and the four attack Central's military while Bradley is gone.&lt;ref name="ch74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 19|chapter=Chapter 74|year=2008|publisher=Square Enix|isbn=978-4-7575-2237-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustang later confronts the homunculus [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Envy|Envy]] after learning that he was Hughes' true murderer; fueled by rage, Mustang easily defeats Envy. As Mustang prepares to finish Envy off, he is convinced by Hawkeye, Edward, and Scar not to kill him and allow his own thirst for vengeance to consume him.&lt;ref name="ch95"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 23|chapter=Chapter 95|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-3630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the homunculi attack Mustang, forcing him to use alchemy to become the fifth human sacrifice needed for their leader.&lt;ref name="ch101"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 25|chapter=Chapter 101|year=2011|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-3924-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in Mustang losing his eyesight as part of the sacrifice, although he continues to fight with Hawkeye to help him direct his attacks.&lt;ref name="ch102"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 25|chapter=Chapter 102|year=2011|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-3924-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the final fight is over, a former comrade, [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Tim Marcoh|Tim Marcoh]], offers to use a Philosopher's Stone to restore Mustang's eyesight on the condition that he promises that he will be a part of a movement to restore Ishbal. Mustang accepts and is put in charge of the East region as [[brigadier general]].&lt;ref name="ch108"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arakawa, Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 27|chapter=Chapter 108|year=2011|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-3984-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the first anime===
During the first anime, Mustang remains at Eastern Headquarters for the early portions of the series until he is transferred back to Central after Hughes' death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Words of Farewell|airdate=April 30, 2005|number=25|credits=Director: Seiji Mizushima|series=Fullmetal Alchemist|network=Cartoon Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pursuing the Elrics after the Stone's creation in Liore, Mustang learns that the Führer is a homunculus, and tries to expose him to the top brass of the military by revealing the truth about the Führer's [[secretary]], [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Sloth|Juliet Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=A Rotted Heart|airdate=February 4, 2006|number=45|credits=Director: Seiji Mizushima|series=Fullmetal Alchemist|network=Cartoon Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bradley intends for him to die in combat during the Northern Campaign, Mustang instead stays in Central, making his move to avenge Hughes. Mustang then moves on to the Führer's mansion and stages his fight.&lt;ref name="fifty"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Death|airdate=2006-03-18|number=50|credits=Director: Seiji Mizushima|series=Fullmetal Alchemist|network=Cartoon Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustang is able to defeat Bradley when his son, Selim, unwittingly brings the skull of the man from which the Führer was created and weakens Bradley. As Mustang escapes the Führer's mansion, he is confronted by a maniacal [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Frank Archer|Frank Archer]], who shoots him. Hawkeye arrives in time to save Mustang and kills Archer.&lt;ref name="last"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Laws and Promises|airdate=2006-03-18|credits=Director: Seiji Mizushima|series=Fullmetal Alchemist|network=Cartoon Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa]]'', Mustang resigns from both alchemy and his rank to become an ordinary enlisted man in a remote outpost. However, when Central is under attack by armies and airships from a parallel universe, Mustang steps up and takes command, using his alchemy to defend Central. Mustang and his comrade [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Alex Louis Armstrong|Alex Louis Armstrong]] are able to find a hot-air balloon to reach the airships, where he is reunited with the Elric brothers, and helps them gain entry into the airship.

Besides his appearances in the manga and the anime, Mustang also appears in most of the [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist episodes#OVAs|''Fullmetal Alchemist'' original video animations]], which are [[omake]] of the first anime and the film sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date = 2009 |title = Fullmetal Alchemist: Premium OVA Collection|type=[[DVD]] |publisher = Funimation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth light novel of the series written by Makoto Inoue, ''Fullmetal Alchemist: Under the Faraway Sky'', Mustang, Hughes, and Armstrong find a village populated by children while they are on holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Inoue, Makoto|title=Fullmetal Alchemist: Under the Faraway Sky|chapter=Roy's Holidays|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-1397-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following title, Mustang appears investigating a case involving chimeras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Inoue, Makoto|title=Fullmetal Alchemist: The Ties That Bind|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-1431-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In video games of the series, Mustang commonly appears as a supporting character in the Elric brothers' investigation of the Philosopher's Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/hagaren3/|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|title=Fullmetal Alchemist 3: Kami o Tsugu Shōjo official website|accessdate=2008-03-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327102322/http://www.square-enix.co.jp/hagaren3/|archivedate=2008-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also featured in several cards of the ''Fullmetal Alchemist Trading Card Game''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ARTBV2/|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|title=Fullmetal Alchemist Booster Box|accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustang's character is featured in the second volume of the character CDs series from ''Fullmetal Alchemist''. The CD was published on December 15, 2004 under the name of ''Hagaren Song File - Roy Mustang''. The tracks were composed by Kazuya Nishioka and performed by [[Toru Okawa]], Mustang's Japanese voice actor in the first ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B000666WQE/|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|title=HAGAREN SONG FILE-ROY MUSTANG- Maxi (Soundtrack)|accessdate=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Mustang is portrayed by [[Dean Fujioka]] in the live-action film based on the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/04/03-1/dean-fujioka-and-others-join-live-action-fullmetal-alchemist-film|title=Dean Fujioka and Others Join Live-Action "Fullmetal Alchemist" Film|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=April 3, 2016|date=April 3, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024335/http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/04/03-1/dean-fujioka-and-others-join-live-action-fullmetal-alchemist-film|archivedate=April 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and conception==
Before ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' started publication, Arakawa had already thought that during the series, Mustang and his soldiers would fight against the antagonist [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Lust|Lust]]. She wanted that fight to be one of Mustang's most impressive scenes in the series, so she decided to give him calmer situations before writing such a scene. Having had only one important scene before his fight against Lust made readers of the series criticize Mustang's appearances; in order to change the readers' opinions about him before the outcome, Arakawa set up the sub-plot of how Maria Ross was accused of killing [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Maes Hughes|Maes Hughes]] and Mustang would intervene there. When [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#King Bradley|King Bradley]] was revealed to be an antagonist, Arakawa wanted to differentiate the two characters via their treatment of their subordinates, with Mustang being unwilling to sacrifice them, unlike Bradley. Arakawa had trouble depicting this, feeling it was an important part of the series, and was unsure whether the result was good.&lt;ref name="guide2"&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=鋼の錬金術師 パーフェクトガイドブック 2| year=2005 | publisher=Square Enix|pages=168–172| isbn=978-4-7575-1426-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the first guidebook of the series was released, Arakawa was surprised by the large number of images featuring Mustang and supposed he was a character "that's easy to mess with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=Fullmetal Alchemist Profiles| year=2006 | publisher=Viz Media |pages=100–105| isbn=1-4215-0768-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Mustang's popularity within fans, Arakawa stated that while some consider him good-looking, it is still above average and that he was not too tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=鋼の錬金術師 CHRONICLE| year=2011 | publisher=Square Enix|pages=| isbn=978-4-7575-3249-6  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While checking sketches she made before the series, Arakawa commented that most featuring Mustang are comical, with few of them showing him with a serious expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=Fullmetal Alchemist Rough Sketch Gallery|trans-title=| year=2006 | publisher=Square Enix|page=25| isbn=978-4-7575-1695-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After ending the series, Arakawa was asked by several fans if Mustang and Riza Hawkeye ever married; she replied that they could not marry as it would result in Hawkeye not being able to continue serving Mustang due to military regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Arakawa | first=Hiromu | title=荒川弘イラスト集 FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST 3

In the first ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' anime series, Mustang was voiced by [[Toru Okawa]],&lt;ref name="twojap"&gt;{{cite episode|title=おかあさん......|airdate=October 18, 2003|credits=Director: Seiji Mizushima|series=Fullmetal Alchemist|network=Tokyo Broadcasting System}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the second anime, Okawa was replaced by [[Shin-ichiro Miki]].&lt;ref name="hood"&gt;{{cite episode|title=鋼の錬金術師|airdate=April 5, 2009|credits=Director: Yasuhiro Irie|series=Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood|network=Tokyo Broadcasting System}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English dub of the first and second anime, Mustang was voiced by [[Travis Willingham]]. Willingham first auditioned for the part of Mustang after [[Justin Cook]] said he would be just right for the role. He also auditioned for Armstrong, which was cast to [[Christopher Sabat]]. Willingham also stated that during production, he and [[Vic Mignogna]] re-recorded several parts as he was not satisfied with the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/aug05/fullmetal.shtml|author=O'Connell, Margaret|title=Sequential Tart - The Fullmetal Interview Part 1|publisher=Sequentalart.com|date=2007-01-08|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Travis Willingham by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Travis Willingham]], who provided the English voice of Mustang, received praise and the character was noted to have launched his voice acting career.]]
During January from 2007, [[Oricon]] made a poll in which they asked Japanese fans which characters from any series they would most like to see in spin-off series.

Publications of manga, anime, and other media have commented on Mustang's character in both the manga and anime. While reviewing the first volume of the manga, Manga Life found that Mustang's character was more mature in the manga than in the anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= |first= |url=http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/FullMetalAlchemistv1II.htm |title=Full Metal Alchemist v1 &amp;#x5B;II&amp;#x5D; |work=Manga Life |date= |accessdate=2009-07-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219051700/http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/FullMetalAlchemistv1II.htm |archivedate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the review from the first anime's last episodes, Lori Lancaster from Mania Entertainment enjoyed Mustang's relationship with Edward, comparing him to a "teasing and protective older brother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Fullmetal Alchemist Set 4| author=Lancanster, Lori| url=http://www.mania.com/fullmetal-alchemist-set-4_article_80078.html| publisher=Mania Entertainment| date=2008-07-18| accessdate=2009-07-07| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523173528/http://www.mania.com/fullmetal-alchemist-set-4_article_80078.html| archivedate=2009-05-23| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakura Eries from the same site noted that Mustang "steals the show" in Volume 10 of the manga, praising his fighting skills during his battle against Lust and Gluttony. Additionally, when Maria Ross was revealed in the same volume to be alive and that she was not killed by Mustang, Eries remarked on his work as leader, taking back her negative comments regarding Mustang when she thought that Mustang really killed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Fullmetal Alchemist Vol. #10| author=Eries, Sakura| url=http://www.mania.com/fullmetal-alchemist-vol-10_article_82820.html| publisher=Mania Entertainment| date=2007-07-27| accessdate=2009-07-07| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706073515/http://www.mania.com/fullmetal-alchemist-vol-10_article_82820.html| archivedate=2010-07-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sub-plots were also commented by [[IGN]]'s D.

In an analysis of the series, Fetch Amber, a writer from [[Bowling Green State University]], noted that while Mustang is the one that encounters Lust in the series and kills her, the fight does not mean there was a poor characterization of the homunculus' sexualization based on how different both Mustang and Lust are: while Mustang is always in one area, Lust takes a more active role in the story to the point of seeing the former as a less masculine person. While noting that Mustang is a brave man based on his actions and powers, Amber noted that there are multiple parts of the story where Mustang loses control of himself, such as when he tries to avenge the wound Jean Havok suffered in combat. A similar scene is noted in his fight against Envy where the Colonel incinerates Envy multiple times before Envy ends up killing himself, leading Amber to question whether Arakawa was reaffirming the superiority between a male and a female character based on the fact that while Envy has no gender, he is still referred as a male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Amber |first=Fetch |year=2014 |title=More than Alchemic Reactions: Playing with Gender Norms in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood |work= |publisher=Bowling Green State University |publication-place= |page= |url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:bgsu1395617137 |accessdate=July 9, 2018 |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710001954/https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:bgsu1395617137 |archivedate=July 10, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth A. David''' (born 1953) is an American [[engineer]]. While at the [[CIA]], David was responsible for encouraging the agency to pursue partnerships with the private sector and designed a proposal to procure technology at the stage of development from the private sector. She has been awarded the [[Awards and decorations of the United States government#Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director's Award]], the [[Awards and decorations of the United States government#Defense Intelligence Agency|Defense Intelligence Agency Director's Award]], the CIA [[Distinguished Intelligence Medal]], the [[Awards and decorations of the United States government#National Reconnaissance Office|National Reconnaissance Officer's Award for Distinguished Service]], and the [[National Security Agency]] Distinguished Service Medal.

==Early life==
Ruth A. David was born on May 13, 1953, in Arkansas City, Kansas.{{sfn|Synergy|2000}} After attaining a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Wichita State University]] in 1975, she went on to earn a [[Master's degree|master's]] in 1976 and [[PhD]] in 1981 in electrical engineering from [[Stanford University]].{{sfn|Bloomberg|2016}}

==Career==
David began her career in 1975 holding several positions at the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].{{sfn|Bloomberg|2016}} She served as an adjunct professor at the [[University of New Mexico]] teaching adaptive and digital signal, digital and microprocessor system design, and linear least-squares estimation.{{sfn|Synergy|2000}} In 1986, she was employed as the supervisor of the Data Systems Development Organization, responsible for developing a remote controlled digital system for deployment of underground nuclear tests at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. Three years later she transferred to the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] managing the Department of Non-Destructive Test, Electromagnetic Test and Optics program on aging aircraft.{{sfn|Society of Women Engineers|1998|p=2}}

Between 1991 and 1994, David was Director of the Development Testing Center, supervising a broad spectrum of engineering test facilities.{{sfn|Bloomberg|2016}} In 1995, she was appointed Deputy Director for Science and Technology of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and became responsible for advising the agency on science and technology.{{sfn|Society of Women Engineers|1998|p=2}} In this capacity, she proposed a radical new approach for the agency to deal with the swift growth in information with the internet revolution. Rather than procuring technology after it was developed, David and her deputy, [[Joanne Isham]] recognized and pushed for the agency to pursue partnerships within the private sector. As technology was advancing far faster than the government bureaucracy procurement program could secure new innovation, they proposed that technology be obtained at the stage of development from the private sector.{{sfn|Vankin|2001}}{{sfn|Ackerman|1996}} She recommended utilizing technology to streamline processes and move away from simply collecting data toward a more analytical and leveraged position of disseminating and exploiting information.{{sfn|Ackerman|1996}}

In 1998, when David left the CIA, she was awarded the [[Awards and decorations of the United States government#Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director's Award]], the [[Awards and decorations of the United States government#Defense Intelligence Agency|Defense Intelligence Agency Director's Award]], the CIA [[Distinguished Intelligence Medal]], the [[Awards and decorations of the United States government#National Reconnaissance Office|National Reconnaissance Officer's Award for Distinguished Service]], and the [[National Security Agency]] Distinguished Service Medal.{{sfn|MIT|2004}}{{sfn|National Science Foundation|2016}} That same year, David joined [[ANSER]] (formerly Analytic Services, Inc.) as its President and Chief Executive Officer. At ANSER, she provided analysis and research as a public service for national and transnational security issues. In 1999, she developed Homeland Defense Strategic Thrust to focus research into internal and external terrorist entities and hostile nations and expanded the department to the ANSER Institute of Homeland Security in 2001 to provide public awareness and education on national security.{{sfn|MIT|2004}}

'''Saint Govan''' ({{lang-cy|Gofan}}) (died 586) was a [[hermit]] who lived in a fissure on the side of coastal cliff near [[Bosherston]], in the [[Pembrokeshire Coast National Park]], [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="manners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/09/25/the-holy-wells-of-wales-91466-21895824/ |title=The holy wells of Wales |last=Manners |first=Sarah |date=25  September 2008|work=Western Mail |accessdate=19 December 2009|location=Wales }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Govan's Chapel|St. Govan's Chapel]] was built in the fissure in the 14th century on what is now known as [[St. Govan's Head]].&lt;ref name="manners"/&gt;

==Legends==
One story says Govan was an [[Celtic Christianity|Irish monk]] who travelled to Wales late in life to seek the friends and family of the [[abbot]] who had trained him, variously identified as [[Saint David]]&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf"/&gt; or Saint [[Ailbe of Emly]].&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=3604 |title=St. Govan |work=Saints &amp; Angels |publisher=Catholic Online |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another story identifies Govan with [[Gawain]], one of [[King Arthur]]'s [[Knights of the Round Table]];&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf"/&gt; another that he was originally a thief.

Govan was set upon by [[pirate]]s, from [[Ireland]]&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf"/&gt; or the nearby [[Lundy Island]]. The cliff opened up and left a fissure just big enough for him to hide in until the pirates left.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxchurch.co.uk/occwv.htm |title=Pilgrimage to Saint Govan's Chapel, South Wales |last=Holden |first=Luke |publisher=Orthodox Christian Contact Wales|accessdate=19 December 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[gratitude]], he decided to stay on along the cliff,&lt;ref name="Holden"/&gt; probably to help warn the locals of the impending pirate attack if they were to return.

St Govan lived within a small cave in the fissure of the cliff. This is now reached by a long flight of stone steps, the number of which is said to vary depending on whether one is ascending or descending.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gwyndaf |first=Robin |title=Welsh folk tales |edition=2nd |publisher=National Museum Wales |year=1989 |page=84 |chapter=Capel Sant Gofan (Saint David's Chapel), ''Dyfed'' |isbn=0-7200-0326-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present small vaulted [[chapel]] of local limestone was built over the cave and dates from the 13th century although the site may have been of monastic importance since the 5th century. St Govan may be identified with Sir Gwaine, one of [[King Arthur]]'s knights, who entered into a state of retreat in his later years.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Keen and Ian Burgum, pg. 111, ''Wales''. Orion Publishing Group (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Originally St Govan caught fish and took water from two nearby springs. Both are now dry; one was where the medieval chapel now stands, the other, which was lower down the cliff, later became a [[holy well]].&lt;ref name="manners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf"/&gt; A legend says St Govan's hand prints are imprinted on the floor of his cave &lt;ref name="manners"/&gt; and his body is buried under the chapel's [[altar]]. The cave was once a popular place for making [[wish]]es.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf"/&gt;

===The Bell Rock===
Another legend regarding St Govan concerns his silver bell. He is supposed to have kept the bell in the tower of the chapel. When the bell pealed, its sound was of perfect tone and clarity. But pirates who heard the sound left St Govan desolate when they stole the bell. Angels flew in and took it from the pirates and returned it to the hermit. To stop the pirates returning and taking it again, the angels encased the bell in a huge stone, that is, the Bell Rock which is found at the water's edge. The legend said that when St Govan "rang" the stone, its vigour had become a thousand times stronger.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf"/&gt;

'''Sir Lionel''' is the younger son of King [[Bors]] of Gaunnes (or [[Gaul]]) and [[Evaine]] and brother of [[Bors the Younger]] in [[Arthurian legend]] since the [[Launcelot-Grail]] cycle. He is a [[double cousin]] of [[Launcelot]] and cousin of Launcelot's younger half-brother [[Ector de Maris]] (not to be confused with the older Sir Ector, who was [[King Arthur]]'s foster-father).

==Arthurian legend==
When their father dies in battle against King [[Claudas]], Lionel and [[Sir Bors|Bors]] are rescued by the [[Lady of the Lake]] and raised in her underwater kingdom alongside her foster-son [[Lancelot]]. Like all his family, Lionel becomes a [[Knight of the Round Table]].

[[Image:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|Bors chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother Lionel]]

While traveling with Lancelot as a young man, Lionel is captured by the rogue knight Turquine, who whips him with [[briar (thicket)|briars]] and throws him in the dungeon. The scenario repeats itself later while he is on the [[Holy Grail|Quest for the Holy Grail]], where he proves very unworthy of the blessed object by trying to kill his brother for not rescuing him. Bors had seen Lionel getting beaten and led away, but had to make a decision to save either him or a young girl being dragged in the opposite direction. He saves the girl, and fears Lionel dead. But Lionel escapes, and attacks Bors the next time they meet. Bors proves himself worthy of the Grail when he refuses to fight back, and Lionel kills a religious hermit and [[Calogrenant|Sir Calogrenant]], a fellow Knight of the [[Round Table]], when they try to protect Bors from his wrath. Before Lionel can strike his brother, however, God intervenes and immobilizes him.

Lionel and the rest of his family follow Lancelot into exile when the affair with Queen [[Guinevere]] is exposed. Lionel participates in the battles against [[King Arthur]] and becomes King of Gaunnes. After the [[Battle of Camlann]], Lancelot's family returns to Britain to defeat the remainder of [[Mordred]]'s forces. Lionel is slain by Mordred's son Melehan; Bors avenges his death.

Sir Lionel is the subject of the late-medieval [[folk song|folk ballad]] "Sir Lionel", recorded as [[Child Ballads|Child Ballad]] 18 and [[Roud Folk Song Index|Roud]] #29, in which he slays a giant [[wild boar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis James Child]], ''English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/child/ch018.htm "Sir Lionel"]&lt;/ref&gt; This song has much in common with a medieval tale about a knight who slays a terrifyingly fiendish boar in [[Sidon]], in the fourteenth century [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] of ''[[Sir Eglamour of Artois]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 209, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; The terrible swine is a frequent foe in romantic tales, for instance the beast [[Twrch Trwyth]] in ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 209-10, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; The song was recorded in [[Appalachia]] as late as the early 20th century. Popular variants include "Old Bangum" and "Wild Hog".

==Modern works==
*In the musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', Lionel is the knight brought back to life by Launcelot after he accidentally kills him in a joust.
*Lionel appears in the 1998 animated film ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'' as the father of the protagonist, Kayley, who wished to follow her father's footsteps. During the beginning of the film, Lionel is killed by the main antagonist, Sir Ruber, who intends to claim the throne of Camelot for himself, while trying to kill King Arthur, whom Lionel defended before he died.

He was given the name of St Leger Aldworth at birth, but he legally changed his surname to St Leger on 9 May 1767,{{cn|date=January 2016}} when he succeeded to the Doneraile estates upon the death of his uncle, Hayes St Leger, 4th Viscount Doneraile (1702–1767).&lt;ref name="Brydges1817p271"/&gt; Like several other members of his family, he served in the [[Irish House of Commons]] as the Member of Parliament for [[Doneraile (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Doneraile]], sitting between 1749 and 1776.&lt;ref name="Brydges1817p271"/&gt; 

On 2 July 1776, St Leger was created '''Baron Doneraile''' in the [[Peerage of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Brydges1817p271"/&gt; On 5 January 1785, he was created '''Viscount Doneraile''', of Doneraile in County Cork, the title previously held by his maternal relations.&lt;ref name="Brydges1817p271"/&gt;

'''Amma Syncletica of Alexandria''', a [[Christian]] [[saint]] and [[Desert Mother]] of the 4th century, was of a wealthy background and is reputed to have been very beautiful.  From childhood, however, Syncletica was drawn to [[Trinity|God]] and the desire to dedicate her life to him.

From the time she gained responsibility for her family's affairs, after the death of her parents, she gave all that had been left her to the poor.  With her younger sister Syncletica abandoned the life of the city and chose to reside in a [[crypt]] adopting the life of a [[hermit]].  Her holy life soon gained the attention of locals and gradually many women came to live as her [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] in [[Christ]].

St. Syncletica is regarded as a "Desert Mother" and her sayings are recorded with those of the [[Desert Fathers]].  She is believed to have died in her eightieth year, around 350 AD.

Amma Syncletica is commemorated 5 January in the [[Orthodox Church]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

'''''The Banger Sisters''''' is a 2002 American [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Bob Dolman]], and produced by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]. The film stars [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Susan Sarandon]] as two middle-aged women who used to be friends and [[groupie]]s when they were young.

It was released on September 20, 2002. The film was Hawn's last acting role until the release of ''[[Snatched (2017 film)|Snatched]]'' in 2017, fourteen and a half years after the release of ''The Banger Sisters''.

==Plot==
When Suzette (Hawn) is fired from her job as bartender at the [[Whisky A Go-Go]] in [[Los Angeles]], she decides, on the spur of the moment, to travel all the way to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] to see her old friend Vinnie (Sarandon). Stranded at a service station without any money to buy some gasoline, she picks up Harry Plummer (Rush), a neurotic, middle-aged author who is on his way to Phoenix to once and for all come to grips with the negative influence his father has had over his life.

On arriving in Phoenix, Suzette has a chance to meet with Vinnie's 17-year-old daughter Hannah ([[Erika Christensen]]) who, after some [[recreational drug use]], starts throwing up in Harry's hotel room. When she drives her back to her parents' elegant suburban home Suzette at first cannot believe what she sees: Vinnie, who now calls herself Lavinia Kingsley, leads the more [[conservative]] life of the perfect wife and mother—a life which at one point prompts one of her daughters to ask Suzette, "Did she ''ever'' do ''anything'' wrong?" Raymond, Vinnie's lawyer husband and an aspiring politician, has no idea about his wife's past either.

However, Suzette's sudden appearance brings back all those memories for Lavinia. Down in the basement she retrieves some of the memorabilia of their previous life as groupies, including a collection of [[Instant film|Polaroids]] of the penises of numerous "musicians and a few [[roadie]]s". She cuts her hair and throws off her expensive but boring clothes and, just for one night, relives the old days by going dancing with Suzette. In the end, both her husband and her two daughters have understood that Lavinia is only human after all. In her graduation speech, Hannah speaks out against anything that is "fake" and urges her schoolmates, teachers and the parents present to "do it true".

On the following day, Suzette returns to Los Angeles together with Harry, who has come to consider her his muse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2051">'''Victor Biaka Boda''' (February 25, 1913 – January 28, 1950) was an [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] politician. Originally a [[shaman]], he adopted the name Victor and ventured into politics as a member of the [[Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire - African Democratic Rally]], and in 1948 was elected to the [[Senate of France|French Senate]].

He is best known for the unusual circumstances of his death.  His death took place at the end of a [[Rassemblement Démocratique Africain#Chaos in the Ivory Coast: 1949|year of severe repression]] of his political party in the colony. In January 1950, while touring [[Bouaflé]], his car broke down. As his chauffeur repaired it, he strolled off into the jungle, never to return. His charred bones were recovered the following November. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] reported in July 1951 that the most popular belief among French politicians was that "the Senator had been eaten by his constituents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889084,00.html#ixzz1BXU8TGwC "FRANCE: Tabled?"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 1951-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
''Stade Victor Biaka Boda'', a stadium in [[Gagnoa]], is named in his honor.

'''William Alexander Morgan''' (April 19, 1928 – March 11, 1961) was a United States citizen who fought in the [[Cuban Revolution]], leading a band of rebels that drove the Cuban army from key positions in the central mountains as part of [[Second National Front of Escambray]], thereby helping to pave the way for Fidel Castro's forces to secure victory. Morgan was one of about two dozen U.S. citizens to fight in the revolution and one of only three foreign nationals to hold the rank of [[Commandant#Latin America|comandante]] in the rebel forces.&lt;ref&gt;The others were [[Che Guevara]], an Argentine citizen, and [[Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo]], a Spanish citizen.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned against Castro after the revolution when Castro began to show Communist leanings, and was one of the leaders of the CIA supplied [[Escambray rebellion]].

==Life before Cuba==
Morgan was born in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, to Alexander Morgan and [[German-American]] Loretta Morgan (née Ruderth).&lt;ref name=grann /&gt;  Raised in an affluent [[Toledo, OH|Toledo]] neighborhood, he dropped out of high school and was often in trouble with the law.&lt;ref name=sallah&gt;Micheal Sallah, "The Yankee Comandante," ''The Toledo Blade", March 3-4-5, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan joined the [[United States Army]] after [[World War II]] and married Darlene Edgerton in 1946. The marriage was annulled after a year and a half.  He was stationed with Company B, 35th Infantry, in Japan, where he fathered a son with a German-Japanese hostess named Setsuko Takeda. He went [[AWOL]], was arrested, and escaped from custody by overpowering a guard. Recaptured, he was [[court-martialed]] in 1948, received a [[dishonorable discharge]], and spent over two years in a federal prison.&lt;ref name=grann &gt;{{cite news|last1=Grann|first1=David|title=The Yankee Comandante|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/28/the-yankee-comandante?currentPage=all|accessdate=23 July 2014|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is said to have been skilled with firearms and was rumored to have been a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operative, though there are no public records or witness interviews to support the claim.&lt;ref name=sallah /&gt;  After his discharge from the Army, Morgan apparently also worked for a local crime syndicate.

On May 11, 1954, Morgan married Ellen Theresa May Bethel, a [[Snake charming|snake charmer]], in Miami. They had two children, Anne Marie (1955) and William A. Morgan Jr. (1957).&lt;ref name=grann /&gt;&lt;ref name=plot /&gt;

==Cuban Revolution==
 [[File:CheLaCoubreMarch.jpg|thumb|left|300px|From left to right: [[Fidel Castro]], [[Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado]], [[Che Guevara]], [[Augusto Martínez Sánchez]], [[Antonio Núñez Jiménez]], '''William Alexander Morgan''''and [[Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo]].]] 
Opposed to the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]], Morgan abandoned his wife and children and  went to Cuba in 1957, joining a guerrilla force of the Second National Front of the Escambray (Segundo Frente Nacional de Escambray or SFNE)&lt;ref name=grann /&gt; that operated against [[Batista]]'s soldiers in the [[Escambray Mountains]] in central Cuba.&lt;ref name=sallah /&gt;

After distinguishing himself in a series of battles, he was promoted to the rank of [[comandante]], leading his own column. In 1958, he wrote a statement that appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]'' to explain his participation in Castro's revolution, "Why I Am Here". It said in part:&lt;ref name=plot /&gt;
{{quote|I am here because I believe that the most important thing for free men to do is to protect the freedom of others. I am here so that my son, when he is grown, will not have to fight or die in a land not his own, because one man or group of men try to take his liberty from him. I am here because I believe that free men should take up arms and stand together and fight and destroy the groups and forces that want to take the rights of people away.}}

In December 1958, [[Che Guevara]] joined forces with Morgan's group and the ''[[Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil]]'' guerrillas of the Escambray mountains. Together they captured the city of [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] on December 31. Twelve hours later, Batista fled Cuba. Morgan and his men occupied the city of [[Cienfuegos]] on January 1–2, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel A. Faria Jr., ''Cuba in Revolution—Escape from a Lost Paradise'' (2002), 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1959, he told a reporter that "all I'm interested in is settling down to a nice peaceful existence" but worried how U.S. authorities would respond to his military activities in Cuba. In March 1959, officials of the U.S. embassy in Havana warned Americans that participation in foreign military service could jeopardize their citizenship.&lt;ref name=plot /&gt;

In August 1959, Morgan gained international attention when he helped smash a coup attempt orchestrated by [[Dominican Republic]] strongman [[Rafael Trujillo]] and others by pretending to lead the takeover while quietly divulging the plot to Fidel Castro in order to help the fledgling government.&lt;ref name=plot&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/08/15/80598611.pdf "A Fighter with Castro," August 15, 1959], accessed June 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/08/16/88809825.pdf "Trouble for Castro," August 16, 1959], accessed June 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1959, the U.S. State Department revoked his citizenship, a move that was prompted by members of Congress who had supported Trujillo. Morgan promised to contest the action.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/09/06/89235171.pdf "Castro's U.S. Aides Out," September 6, 1959], accessed June 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-revolution activities and execution==
Morgan married a Cuban, Olga María Rodríguez Farinas, also a [[revolutionary]], they had two daughters.&lt;ref name=sallah /&gt; In August 1959, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and American authorities revoked Morgan's U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Americano: Fighting with Castro for Cuba's Freedom|last=Shetterly|first=Aran|publisher=Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill|year=2007|isbn=9781565124585|location=Chapel Hill, N.C.|pages=209-254}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 1959, Morgan renounced his U.S. citizenship publicly on a Havana radio station.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the revolution, Morgan developed a business of frog farming; with the legs being sold to restaurants, the skin for fashion accessories, and what remained for cattle feed. During this venture, Morgan would employ around 600 workers and ship an average of 50,000 pounds of frozen frog legs to the U.S. every month.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On March 6, 1960, the French freighter [[La Coubre explosion|La Coubre]] exploded in [[Havana Harbor]] killing around 100 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cuban-exile.com/doc_151-175/doc0166.html|title=La Coubre: Explodes in Havana 1960|last=|first=|date=|website=Cuban Information Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An American named Jack Lee Evans, who was in Cuba at the time of the explosion with Morgan, left for Miami a few days after the incident. While in Miami, he gave an interview with the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' suggesting that Morgan had been involved with the sabotaging of the ship, which Morgan adamantly denied. A memorial for the explosion was held a few days later. Morgan would be pictured arm and arm walking through the streets of Havana during this memorial with prominent Cuban leaders including Castro and Che.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Throughout the struggle against Batista, Morgan was vocal about Castro's supposed [[anti-communist]] beliefs. When asked during interviews about Castro's political beliefs and where the new Cuban government was leaning, he remained firm in his belief that Castro was not a communist and that Cuba would become a capitalist [[parliamentary democracy]].

As Castro began to reveal his socialist leanings, Morgan became disenchanted with the revolutionary government, as did other members of the SFNE, who wanted Cuba to restore elections. In the middle of June 1960, Morgan and a select few former Escambray leaders met to discuss Castro's turn towards socialism and protecting the Revolution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the arrests of Morgan's former rebel comrades for counterrevolutionary activities started to increase, Morgan organized weapons to be smuggled to the counterrevolutionaries in the Escambray.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/28/the-yankee-comandante|title=The Yankee Comandante|last=Grann|first=David|date=May 28, 2012|website=The New Yorker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Arrest and Execution==
[[File:William Alexander Morgan in prison, Havana, Cuba. 1961.jpg|thumb|300px|left|William Alexander Morgan in prison, Havana, Cuba. 1961]]
On October 16, 1960, Castro ordered Morgan's arrest due to counterrevolutionary activities. Three days later, Morgan was arrested while attending a meeting for the National Institute for Agrarian Reform, to which he had been summoned. Morgan was formally charged with plotting to join and lead the [[counter-revolutionaries]] who were active in the Escambray Mountains.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecubanhistory.com/2012/05/william-morgan-a-rebel-americano-in-cuba/|title=The American Comandante in the Cuban Revolutionary Forces: William Morgan|last=Varona|first=Arnoldo|date=May 16, 2012|website=The Cuban History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 1961, shortly after a military trial at La Cabana prison, Morgan, then 32 years old, was shot by firing squad with Fidel and Raul Castro in attendance.&lt;ref name=grann /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One month later, 1,500 [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] trained counterrevolutionaries would unsuccessfully invade Cuba at the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]] resulting in Castro officially declaring the Revolution a Socialist endeavor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

His wife was tried with him ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]''. She was found guilty of co-conspiracy and sentenced to 30 years in prison.&lt;ref name=sallah /&gt; She was released after 10 years. She left for the United States in 1980 during the [[Mariel boatlift]]. In a series of interviews with ''[[The Toledo Blade]]'' in 2002, she admitted that she and her husband had begun running guns to anti-Castro [[guerrilla]]s because he was opposed to Castro's pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leanings. She also said she wanted Morgan's U.S. citizenship restored and his remains returned to the United States for reburial.&lt;ref name=sallah /&gt; The newspaper stories prompted two Democratic members of the [[United States House of Representatives]], [[Charles Rangel]] and [[Marcy Kaptur]], to travel to Cuba in April 2002 to meet Fidel Castro and ask him to return Morgan's body, and Castro agreed.&lt;ref name=sallah /&gt;
 
In April 2007, nearly 50 years after the government stripped him of his rights in 1959 for serving in a foreign country's military, the [[US State Department]] declared that Morgan's [[US citizenship]] was effectively restored.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Driscoll, "U.S. reclaims citizen who led Cuban rebel fighters," ''Miami Herald'', April 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morgan in pop culture ==
Morgan's story remained largely out of the American eye until the 21st century when articles, documentaries, and films introduced his story. In 2012, [[George Clooney]] planned to buy the rights and direct a film based on [[David Grann]]'s 2012 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article on Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/George-Clooney-Direct-Biopic-Yankee-Comandante-31300.html|title=George Clooney to Direct Biopic the Yankee Comandante|last=Puchko|first=Kristy|date=November 2012|website=Cinema Blend|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulitzer prize-winning reporters [[Michael Sallah]] and [[Mitch Weiss]] authored the book, "The Yankee Comandante: The Untold Story of Courage, Passion and One American's Fight to Liberate Cuba."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7627-9287-0|title=The Yankee Comandante: The Untold Story of Courage, Passion, and One American's Fight to Liberate Cuba |access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan was featured in 2015 on the [[PBS]] documentary series ''[[American Experience]]'' with the episode titled American Comandante.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/comandante/|title=American Comandante|last=|first=|date=November 17, 2015|website=PBS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
