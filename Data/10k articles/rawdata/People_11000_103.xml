'''Antonio Bardellino''' ([[San Cipriano d'Aversa]], May 4, 1945 – [[Armação dos Búzios]], May 26, 1988) was a powerful [[Naples|Neapolitan]] ''[[Camorra|Camorrista]]'' and [[crime boss|boss]] of the [[Casalesi clan]], having a prominent role in the organized crime in the province of [[Caserta]] during the 1980s. He was one of the last of the old-style Camorra godfathers.

==Powerful Camorrista==
Originally from [[San Cipriano d'Aversa]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] province of [[Province of Caserta|Caserta]], Bardellino was an important ''[[Cosa Nostra]]'' affiliate in the region of [[Campania]]. "Bardellino was the reference point of all Camorra clans, even the ones that could not stand him. With his charisma he managed to maintain a certain equilibrium in Campania", according to the ''[[pentito]]'' [[Pasquale Galasso]].&lt;ref name=galasso&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.liberliber.it/biblioteca/i/italia/verbali_antimafia_xi_legislatura/html/violante02/51_00.htm Audizione  del  collaboratore di giustizia  Pasquale Galasso], Verbali della Commissione Parlamentare Antimafia, presidenza [[Luciano Violante]], July 13, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of the [[Casalesi clan]], around which for almost a decade moved a united confederation of families ([[Francesco Schiavone|Schiavone]], [[Francesco Bidognetti|Bidognetti]], [[Michele Zagaria|Zagaria]], [[Antonio Iovine|Iovine]], Venosa) rooted in a large territory which extended from southern [[Lazio]] through the ''agro aversano'' (countryside near [[Aversa]]), to [[Naples]].

==Ties with Cosa Nostra==
Bardellino had close and powerful contacts within the [[Sicilian Mafia]], initially with the Porta Nuova family of [[Pippo Calò]].&lt;ref name=shawcross135&gt;Shawcross &amp; Young, ''Men Of Honour'', p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the few Camorra bosses who were also initiated into ''Cosa Nostra''. Together with [[Lorenzo Nuvoletta]] and [[Michele Zaza]], he was sworn in to seal a pact on [[cigarette smuggling]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=sterling269&gt;Sterling, ''Octopus'', p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=behan51&gt;Behan, ''The Camorra'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the [[Nuvoletta clan|Nuvoletta brothers]], who were allied with the [[Corleonesi]] headed by [[Luciano Leggio]] and [[Salvatore Riina]], Bardellino was allied with [[Rosario Riccobono]], [[Stefano Bontade]], [[Gaetano Badalamenti]], and [[Tommaso Buscetta]], all heads of fallen [[Palermo]] families which were defeated by the Corleonesi in the [[Second Mafia War]] and forced to flee.

==Underworld Rackets==
It is believed that Bardellino was the initiator of the Casalesi clan in the area of [[Casal di Principe]] and San Cipriano d'Aversa, especially due to the transformation he implemented within the clan. The rituals of affiliation remained as well as the rate of murders, but the leap in quality was the continued infiltration of the legitimate economy with the proceeds of illicit [[drug trafficking]]. This was favoured by the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake]] and the subsequent reconstruction, which prompted the families to create a consortium for their companies that performed the work of earth-moving and construction. Another factor was the great entrepreneurial ability of Bardellino himself. He owned an fish flour import-export business together with other clans, which in fact covered up a [[Brazil]]ian [[cocaine]] smuggling operation. Besides trafficking cocaine, he was involved in the [[heroin]] trade with Lorenzo Nuvoletta and [[Ciro Mazzarella]], supplying the Sicilian Mafia.&lt;ref name=jacquemet42&gt;Jacquemet, ''Credibility in Court'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Bardellino realized that cocaine, not heroin, would become the more profitable drug and organized a trafficking operation smuggling it from Latin America to [[Aversa]] via his front business. Heroin was smuggled as well, and shipments to the [[Gambino crime family]] were concealed inside espresso filters. When one shipment was intercepted by the authorities, Bardellino reportedly called [[John Gotti]] and told him; "Don't worry, now we're sending twice as much the other way".&lt;ref name=saviano189&gt;Saviano,''Gomorrah'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuova Famiglia==
Bardellino was the main exponent of the [[Nuova Famiglia]] (NF), a confederation of clans that was formed to contrast the growing power of the predominant [[Nuova Camorra Organizzata]] (NCO), led by [[Raffaele Cutolo]]. The NF consisted of Bardellino, Michele Zaza (a Camorra boss with strong ties with [[Cosa Nostra]]), the [[Gionta clan]] (from [[Torre Annunziata]]), the [[Nuvoletta clan]] from [[Marano]], the [[Alfieri clan]] of [[Saviano]] led by [[Carmine Alfieri]], the [[Galasso clan]] of [[Poggiomarino]] (led by [[Pasquale Galasso]]), the [[Giuliano clan]] from [[Naples]]' quarter [[Forcella]] (led by [[Luigi Giuliano]] and the [[Vollaro clan]] from [[Portici]] (led by [[Luigi Vollaro]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.napolionline.org/wiki/doku.php?id=camorra:i_clan:alfieri Alfieri clan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629170655/http://www.napolionline.org/wiki/doku.php?id=camorra%3Ai_clan%3Aalfieri |date=2008-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting war between the NF and the NCO resulted in a large number of victims from both sides, and ended with the NCO's defeat and the victory of the NF. However, with Cutolo and the NCO out of the picture, the NF alliance soon disintegrated, with a war breaking out between the Bardellino and Nuvoletta clans towards the end of 1983.

==War with the Nuvolettas==
While the [[Second Mafia War]] between the Corleonesi and the Bontade-Buscetta-Inzerillo-Badalamenti faction was being fought in [[Sicily]], its effects were being felt on the Campanian underworld. The Corleonesi boss, Salvatore Riina, mandated [[Lorenzo Nuvoletta]] to order the murder of Tommaso Buscetta. Nuvoletta, in turn, passed the order to Bardellino. The order was not brought to an end, because Bardellino had been good friends with Buscetta in Sicily, and had once shared the same house with Buscetta in Brazil when the latter was absconding. He also deeply distrusted the Nuvolettas and was unwilling to accept the supremacy of the Nuvoletta brothers with the interference of the Corleonesi. Bardellino's attitude soon marked him for death, and he would spend the last years of life in hiding outside Italy, including Spain, Brazil and [[Santo Domingo]].

Towards the end of 1982, thanks to a tip off from the local police, Antonio Bardellino managed to evade capture in his Rio de Janeiro apartment. Despite this setback, a meeting was soon arranged between Bardellino and the Nuvolettas in [[Zurich]], but Aniello Nuvoletta was arrested at the rendezvous. Many other leaders of the Nuvoletta clan would have been arrested had they not suffered a chance accident in northern Italy, near the Swiss border. Bardellino was arrested in [[Barcelona]] in Spain in November 1983,&lt;ref name=pai041183&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ITALIA/ESPAnA/ITALIA/italiano/detenido/Barcelona/acusado/distribuir/droga/latinoamericana/Europa/elpepiesp/19831104elpepinac_4/Tes El italiano detenido en Barcelona, acusado de distribuir la droga latinoamericana en Europa], ''El País'', November 4, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;  but he was inexplicably released on bail and disappeared soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=behan91&gt;Behan, ''The Camorra'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pai120188&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/VARON_COBOS/_RICARDO/BARDELLINO/_ANTONIO/RODRiGUEZ_HERMIDA/_JAIME/ITALIA/TRIBUNAL_SUPREMO/Supremo/permite/Varon/Cobos/volver/carrera/judicial/confirma/expulsion/Rodriguez/Hermida/elpepisoc/19880112elpepisoc_2/Tes/#despiece1 El 'caso Bardellino'], ''El País'', January 12, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victory==
The clash with the Nuvoletta clan resulted in Bardellino's victory. An attack was made at the Nuvoletta family's farm in Marano which resulted in the death of Ciro Nuvoletta, one of the brothers. Two months later, events culminated with an attack at [[Torre Annunziata]], an area infamous for its illegal activities, which led to the massacre of eight members of the [[Gionta clan]] allied with the Nuvolettas at the Circolo dei Pescatori (fisherman's club). Another twenty four were wounded. This episode was known as the [[Torre Annunziata massacre]] in the local press, and is perhaps the worst gangland massacre to ever take place in Italy.

This victory further allowed Antonio Bardellino to expand his sphere of control and influence to include almost the entire province of [[Caserta]] and Naples. In spite of being a fugitive sought by [[Interpol]], Bardellino could exercise his power and coordinate criminal activities unhindered, but the disagreements came with the Casalesi itself.

==Assassination==
According to the official version of the story, on May 26, 1988, Antonio Bardellino was murdered by his right-hand man, [[Mario Iovine]] in his Brazilian home at [[Búzios]], a beach side resort for the rich and famous in the State of Rio de Janeiro, as part of an internal feud within the Casalesi.&lt;ref name=rep250789&gt;{{it icon}} [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1989/07/25/dopo-un-anno-la-conferma-bardellino.html Dopo un anno la conferma 'Bardellino e' stato ucciso'], ''La Repubblica'', July 25, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; However, this story has never been verified because his body was never found and the alleged assassin, Iovine, was himself murdered in Portugal in 1991 while using a phone booth. These circumstances have fuelled a legend that Bardellino is still alive,&lt;ref name=rep220688&gt;{{it icon}} [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/06/22/la-grande-beffa-bardellino-vivo.html La grande beffa, Bardellino e' vivo...], ''La Repubblica'', June 22, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and has left power in the hands of the other families within the Casalesi clan in order to ensure the survival of his family.

When his old friend, Tommaso Buscetta who later became a ''pentito'' was asked about the status of Bardellino during a testimony before the [[Antimafia Commission]], he replied: "Is it already obvious that Bardellino died? I do not know, but I do not believe that he is dead."&lt;ref name=buscetta&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.liberliber.it/biblioteca/i/italia/verbali_antimafia_xi_legislatura/html/violante01/12_00.htm Audizione del collaboratore della giustizia Tommaso Buscetta], Verbali della Commissione Parlamentare Antimafia, presidenza [[Luciano Violante]],  November 16, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  After the news of Bardellino's death spread, his family left their homes and native areas to take refuge in [[Formia]] where they still reside. After the disappearance of Antonio Bardellino, the five families (Schiavone, Iovine, Bidognetti, De Falco and Zagaria) took control, each with their own army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gangstersinc.tripod.com/CasalesiClan.html The Casalasi clan of the Camorra] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805194528/http://gangstersinc.tripod.com/CasalesiClan.html |date=August 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His former ally [[Umberto Ammaturo]], who turned state witness ([[pentito]]), also said Bardellino was still alive when he gave a rare interview to [[La Repubblica]] newspaper in May 2010.&lt;ref name=rep250510&gt;{{it icon}} [http://napoli.repubblica.it/cronaca/2010/05/25/news/boss_ammaturo-4312237/ "Tagliai io la testa a Semerari; aveva tradito un nostro accordo"], La Repubblica, May 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13666">{{Book of Mormon}}
The '''Book of Mormon witnesses''' are a group of contemporaries of [[Joseph Smith]] who saw the [[golden plates]] from which Smith translated the [[Book of Mormon]]. The most significant witnesses are the [[Three Witnesses]] and the [[Eight Witnesses]], all of whom allowed their names to be used on two separate statements included with the Book of Mormon. Each of the witnesses never denied what they saw.

==Three Witnesses==
{{Main|Three Witnesses}}

The '''Three Witnesses''' were a group of three early leaders of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] who wrote in a statement of 1830 that an [[angel]] had shown them the [[golden plates]] from which [[Joseph Smith]] translated the [[Book of Mormon]] and that they had heard God's voice testifying that the book had been translated by the power of God.

The Three Witnesses were [[Oliver Cowdery]], [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], and [[David Whitmer]], whose joint testimony, in conjunction with a separate statement by [[Eight Witnesses]], has been printed with nearly every edition of the Book of Mormon since its first publication in 1830. All three witnesses eventually broke with Smith and were excommunicated from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|church]].&lt;ref&gt;"All three witnesses eventually quarreled with Joseph and left his church. At their going he heaped abuse upon them, but none ever denied the reality of his vision, and Cowdery and Harris eventually were rebaptized. Joseph had no fear in vilifying them; he neither expected nor received reprisals. For he had conjured up a vision they would never forget." {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, Joseph Smith called Cowdery, Harris, and Whitmer "too mean to mention; and we had liked to have forgotten them."&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Roberts, ed. ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1905), 3: 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839 Cowdery published a tract rejecting the Latter Day Saints and in 1840 become a member of the Methodist Protestant Church.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Shook. [http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs2/1914Shk1.htm#pg039a The true origin of the Book of Mormon] (Cincinnati: Standard Pub. Co., 1914), 49–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, all three testified to the divine origin of the Book of Mormon,{{fact|date=April 2017}} and near the end of their lives rejoined one denomination or another of the Latter Day Saint movement.{{fact|date=April 2017}} Harris and Cowdery rejoined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] shortly before their deaths,{{fact|date=April 2017}} and Whitmer founded the [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)]].{{fact|date=April 2017}}

==Eight Witnesses==
{{Main|Eight Witnesses}}
The '''Eight Witnesses''' were the second of the two groups of "special witnesses" to the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon's]] [[golden plates]]. They were all members of the Whitmer or Smith families: [[Christian Whitmer]], [[Jacob Whitmer]], [[Peter Whitmer, Jr.]], [[John Whitmer]], [[Hiram Page]], [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], [[Hyrum Smith]], and [[Samuel Harrison Smith]].  Joseph Smith Sr. was Joseph's father, and Hyrum and Samuel H. Smith were his brothers.  Christian, Jacob, Peter Jr. and John were David Whitmer's brothers, and Hiram Page was his brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Lyman Bushman]], ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 79: "Critics pointed out how many of the witnesses were members of the Smith and Whitmer families, implying that they signed out of loyalty or from a self-serving motive....The witnesses were no substitute for making the plates accessible to anyone for examination, but the testimonies showed Joseph—and God—answering doubters with concrete evidence, a concession to the needs of post-Enlightenment Christians."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified that they both saw and handled the plates. Another difference is that the Eight testified they were shown the plates by [[Joseph Smith]] rather than by an angel as had the Three Witnesses. Christian Whitmer died in 1835 and his brother Peter Whitmer, Jr. died the following year. In 1838, the surviving Whitmers became estranged from Joseph Smith during a leadership struggle in [[Far West, Missouri]], and all were excommunicated with other dissenters,&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 337,339, 350–51. On June 17, [[Sidney Rigdon]] "preached a vitriolic sermon based on the theme of salt losing its savor and being cast out and trodden underfoot....Soon after the sermon, eighty-three prominent members in Far West, many of them probably [[Danites]] by then, signed an ultimatum demanding the departure of the offenders....Fearing for their property and perhaps their lives, the dissenters fled." (355–51) In 1847, David, John, and Jacob Whitmer and Hiram Page were baptized into the newly formed [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)|Church of Christ]] founded by [[William E. M'Lellin]]. In 1831, Joseph Smith received a revelation from God that John Whitmer should "write and keep a regular history" of the church (D&amp;C 47). Whitmer did eventually write such a history, but one which concluded with a detailed description of what Whitmer considered the mistreatment that he and his family had received in Caldwell County. See Bruce N. Westerngren, ''From Historian to Dissident: The Book of John Whitmer'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; never to rejoin Smith's church. None of the Eight Witnesses is known to have denied his testimony to the authenticity of Book of Mormon or the golden plates.

==Another witness==
{{main|Mary Whitmer}}

[[Mary Whitmer|Mary Musselman Whitmer]] (1778–1856), the mother of five Witnesses who took care of the household in [[Fayette, New York]], where much of the translation occurred, said that an angel showed her the plates and thus made her more content to continue her daily labors.&lt;ref&gt;"David Whitmer Interview with Edward Stevenson, 9 February 1888,"in [[Dan Vogel]], ''Early Mormon Documents'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2003), 5: 160–61; John C. Whitmer Interview with Andrew Jenson and Edward Stevenson, 11 October 1888," in ''EMD'' 5: 260–62.  John Whitmer said that his grandmother always referred to the supernatural visitor as "Brother Nephi."&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph Smith made no mention of this visitation in his journal.

==Responses==
===Criticism===

Critics of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]—from late nineteenth-century clergymen to [[Mark Twain]] to modern agnostics, evangelical Christians, and even some unorthodox ("Big Tent") Mormons—argue that the testimonies of the witnesses cannot be taken at face value.

* According to [[Grant Palmer]], the Book of Mormon witnesses had a "nineteenth-century magical mindset" rather than "a rationalist perspective." They believed in what was called "second sight.  Traditionally, this included the ability to see spirits and their dwelling places within the local hills and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;[[Grant H. Palmer]], ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 175. Palmer devotes an entire chapter to the magical mindset of the Book of Mormon Witnesses.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of the witnesses possessed and used [[Scrying|seer stone]]s; Oliver Cowdery was a [[Dowsing|rodsman]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Michael Quinn, ''Early Mormonism and the Magic World View'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1998), rev. ed., 239-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Tufts University professor [[John L. Brooke]] has observed, many of the earliest Mormons were "very much attuned to the supernatural powers of witchcraft."&lt;ref&gt;John L. Brooke, ''The Refiner's Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644–1844'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Far removed from our own modern empiricism, the world view of the witnesses is difficult for us to grasp," and thus it is less impressive that "three signatories to the Book of Mormon saw and heard an angel."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 194-95.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the witnesses were family, close friends, or financial backers of Joseph Smith. Cowdery, Page, and the five Whitmers were related by marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] later joked, "I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Fawn Brodie, ''No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1986), second ed., 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although Harris continued to testify to the truth of the [[Book of Mormon]] even when he was estranged from the church, at least during the early years of the movement, he "seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience."&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, ''Early Mormon Documents'', 2: 255. The foreman in the Palmyra printing office that produced the first Book of Mormon said that Harris "used to practice a good deal of his characteristic jargon and 'seeing with the spiritual eye,' and the like." [[Pomeroy Tucker]], ''Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism'' (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1867), 71 in ''EMD'', 3: 122. John H. Gilbert, the typesetter for most of the book, said that he had asked Harris, "Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?" According to Gilbert, Harris "looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, 'No, I saw them with a spiritual eye." John H. Gilbert, "Memorandum," 8 September 1892, in ''EMD'', 2: 548. Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with "the eye of faith" or "spiritual eyes." Martin Harris interviews with John A. Clark, 1827 &amp; 1828 in ''EMD'', 2: 270; Jesse Townsend to Phineas Stiles, 24 December 1833, in ''EMD'', 3: 22. In 1838, Harris is said to have told an Ohio congregation that "he never saw the plates with his natural eyes, only in vision or imagination." Stephen Burnett to Lyman E. Johnson, 15 April 1838 in ''EMD'', 2: 291. A neighbor of Harris in Kirtland, Ohio, said that Harris "never claimed to have seen [the plates] with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision." Reuben P. Harmon statement, c. 1885, in ''EMD'', 2: 385.&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Smith's death, [[James Strang]], claiming to be Smith's chosen successor, also produced [[Voree plates|buried plates]] and the testimony of eleven witnesses to their authenticity. All living witnesses to the Book of Mormon (except possibly Cowdery)—three of the Whitmers, Martin Harris, and Hiram Page—accepted at least briefly Strang's "leadership, angelic call, metal plates, and his translation of these plates as authentic."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 212-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apologetics===
* LDS church leaders and student manuals note that none of the witnesses ever denied his testimony as it was printed in the Book of Mormon nor denied that Smith was a true prophet at the time he translated the book.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Dallin H. Oaks]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1999/05/the-witness-martin-harris "The Witness: Martin Harris"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign'']], May 1999; [[James E. Faust]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/11/a-growing-testimony "A Growing Testimony"], ''Ensign'', November 2011; [[Henry B. Eyring]], [http://www.lds.org/liahona/2003/11/an-enduring-testimony-of-the-mission-of-the-prophet-joseph "An Enduring Testimony of the Witness of the Prophet Joseph"], ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', November 2003;[http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-4-remember-the-new-covenant-even-the-book-of-mormon "Lesson 4: Remember the New Covenant, Even the Book of Mormon"], ''Doctrine and Covenants and Church History: Gospel Doctrine Teacher's Manual (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apologists note that after being excommunicated, Harris and Cowdery later returned to the church.&lt;ref&gt;A list of articles is available in the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research|FAIR]] Topical Guide, under [http://www.fairlds.org/apol/ai109.html ''Book of Mormon Witnesses''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072851/http://www.fairlds.org/apol/ai109.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}.

'''Buyeo Yong''' (扶餘勇, 623 – 668) was a prince of [[Baekje]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. He was a son of the last king, [[Uija of Baekje]].

In September, 663 in the [[Battle of Baekgang]] he led the Baekje Revival Army and was defeated by the forces of the [[Silla-Tang alliance]] and forced into exile in [[Goguryeo]] with his brother, [[Buyeo Pung]]. In April, 664 he was captured and sent to [[Ungjin Commandery]] and the Baekje Revival Movement was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Samguk Sagi | language = Korean | url = http://www.koreandb.net/sam/bon/samkuk/04_280_2001521.htm | quote = 王子扶餘豊 嘗質於倭國者 立之爲王 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000151/http://www.koreandb.net/sam/bon/samkuk/04_280_2001521.htm | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His later life and activities are unknown but he was probably exiled to China along with his father and other siblings.

One of his brothers, Zenkō (善光 or 禅広), settled in Japan and was given the family name [[Kudara no Konikishi]] (百濟王; king of Baekje) by the emperor of Japan.

'''Charles-François Galand''' (1832–1900) was a [[France|French]] gunsmith who worked in [[Liège (city)|Liege]] and [[Paris]], [[France]].  He manufactured many revolvers for civilian and military use, including the '''Galand Revolver''' (also called the '''Galand-Sommerville''' or '''Galand-Perrin'''), the '''Tue Tue''', and the tiny '''Le Novo'''.  The '''[[Velo-dog]]''', developed from the Tue Tue and the Novo, was designed by Charles-François' son René in 1904.

The original Galand revolver was a [[trigger (firearms)|double-action]], open frame (no strap across the top of the cylinder) revolver patented in 1868.  Military versions were produced in 9&amp;nbsp;mm while civilian versions were made in 12&amp;nbsp;mm.  The gun is easily recognizable due to its long extraction lever, which stretches under the gun to form the trigger guard. Pulling the lever forward separates the barrel and cylinder from the rest of the gun.  At the same time the extractor plate is blocked which catches any cartridges in the cylinder, thereby extracting them.

}}

The first model was manufactured both in Liege and in [[Gun Quarter, Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[England]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] arms firm Braendlin and Sommerville, and is therefore sometimes referred to as the Galand-Sommerville.  Sommerville shared the patent for the case extracting system with Galand.  The Galand-Perrin is an identical model which uses the Perrin cartridge (7&amp;nbsp;mm, 9&amp;nbsp;mm, and most famously 12&amp;nbsp;mm).

The Galand's double-action mechanism allowed for rapid firing but the longer trigger pull made this less accurate than single-action fire.  The Galand's self-extracting system made loading the revolver much faster than contemporary gate-loaded pistols such as the [[Colt Peacemaker]].

First distributed in October 1868, the Galand revolver sold briskly in France, at least in part due to fears over the looming [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870.

Despite France's loss to the Germans the Galand performed successfully and the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] [[Navy]] adopted the Galand model 1870 revolver in 1871.  This revolver was manufactured under contract by [[Fabrique d'armes Émile et Léon Nagant|Nagant]] and Goltiakoff in Russia in 1878. The [[Romania]]n Army also adopted the Galand.

In 1872 Galand improved the design with a closed frame, but failed to win a French military contract and began aiming most of his production at the civilian market.  In 1893 Galand introduced the 8&amp;nbsp;mm Tue Tue (kill kill) hammerless pocket revolver, which continued in production until about 1935. Later versions were also sold in [[.32 S&amp;W]] and .38 ACP, and some had an external hammer.  The tiny Le Novo revolver, with a hinged trigger and no trigger guard, also featured a folding grip.

After Charles-François Galand's death in 1900 his son, René, continued the business until 1942.  He created the [[Velo-dog]], a truly peculiar conceit in personal defence weapons.  The name is a contraction of ''vélocipède'' (bicycle) and dog. The weapon was originally marketed as a defence for bicyclists during the bicycle craze which started at the end of the 19th century. Like the Le Novo the Velodog originally used a [[5.75mm Velo-dog|5.5&amp;nbsp;mm center fire cartridge]]; it was also available in .22 caliber and 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm.

'''Dipygus''' is a severe [[congenital deformity]] where the body axis forks left and right partway along the [[torso]] with the posterior end ([[human pelvis|pelvis]] and legs) duplicated.

In human cases, the inner two of the four hindquarters develop much smaller than normal. This is a type of "teras catadidymum" ("[[Teratology|monster]] twinned below"). Another sort of deformity with extra legs can happen from a degenerated conjoined twin, as may have happened with [[Frank Lentini]] with his third leg.

== Signs ==
Dipygus manifests as duplicated lower limbs and could include additional organs or bodily structures.

== Causes ==
Dipygus is caused by genetic, environmental, or [[teratogenic]] factors. It occurs early in intrauterine life.

A '''dog whipper''' was a church official charged with removing unruly dogs from church grounds during services. They were most prominent in areas of England and continental Europe between the 16th and 19th centuries.

Those employed for the position were given a three-foot-long whip and a pair of dog tongs with which to remove the animals. They were given the task of keeping stray animals away from the church and preventing communion bread and priests from being assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3QsamB5onwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dog]&lt;/ref&gt; The whip was utilized both for enforcement and as a deterrent while the tongs enabled the whipper to clasp a problematic animal from a safe distance.

It was not uncommon for household dogs to accompany — or at least follow — their owners to church services at this time. If at any point they became loud, fought with other animals, attacked congregation members, or were otherwise disruptive, it was the job of the dog whipper to remove them from the church as well to allow the service to continue in peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mccomberfamily.com/2012/04/jobs-your-ancestors-had-dog-whipper.html Genealogy Addict]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dog whippers were generally paid for their services, and records of payments to the local dog whipper exist in old parish account books in many English churches. In some areas a portion of village land was made available for the use of the dog whipper, the small park named 'Dog Acre' in [[Birchington-on-Sea]] is the remnant of such a grant.

Some villages employed dog whippers in a more general capacity, dealing with stray and disruptive dogs throughout the village. In this sense dog whippers were precursors of modern [[animal control officer]]s, much like church 'bang beggars' were to today's [[police officer]]. In addition, churches that found their coffers lacking had the option of hiring out their services or giving their staff other tasks to complete. The role was similar to the 'Sluggard Waker' that entailed poking or hitting drowsy members of the congregation on the head with a long, outfitted pole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mccomberfamily.com/2012/04/jobs-your-ancestors-had-dog-whipper.html Genealogy Addict]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dog whippers became less common from the late 18th century onwards, presumably because animals were increasingly unwelcome at church services. One of the last recorded dog whippers to perform the original function was one John Pickard, who was appointed to [[Exeter Cathedral]] in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/index-n.html Infoplease]&lt;/ref&gt; A small room in Exeter Cathedral is still known as the Dog Whipper's Room. Exeter still has a Dog Whipper, now a purely ceremonial role, for processions and other significant occasions. 

A dog whipper's whip survives in [[St. Anne's Church, Baslow]], [[Derbyshire]] and a dog whipper's pew is preserved in St. Margaret's Church in [[Wrenbury|Wrenbury, Cheshire]]. A notable carving of a dog whipper removing a dog with his whip can be seen in the [[Sint-Bavokerk|Great Church of St. Bavo]] in [[Haarlem]].

With the advent of animal shelters, this job became largely obsolete.

'''Frank Inn''', born '''Elias Franklin Freeman''' (May 8, 1916 – July 27, 2002), was an [[United States|American]] [[animal training|animal trainer]]. He trained several animals for [[movies]], including the dogs in the [[Benji]] series and the cat [[Orangey]]. He also trained the dog in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

==Personal life==
Elias Franklin Freeman was born in [[Decatur Township, Marion County, Indiana|Camby]], [[Indiana]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0409146/ "Frank Inn"]. ''IMDb''.&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[Quaker]] family. He left home at age 17, changed his name to Frank Inn, and sought his fortune in [[Hollywood]]. He learned to train animals while recovering from a serious automobile accident in [[Culver City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Angielyn Hamilton-Lowe (July 27, 2012) [https://www.npr.org/2012/07/27/155949615/the-trainer-who-created-four-legged-stars "The Trainer Who Created Four-Legged Stars"]. npr.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inn was married to the former Juanita Heard for 50 years, from 1946 until her death in 1996. They had three children. After Juanita's death, Inn retired and devoted his time to writing poetry, assembling a museum of memorabilia from his long career, and training a new generation of animal wranglers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050308174105/http://petticoat.topcities.com/frankinn.htm Frank Inn]. Hooterville Petticoat Junction&lt;/ref&gt;

Inn died on July 27th, 2002 at the age of 86 after a brief illness.  He kept the ashes of many of his beloved animals after they had died, and it was his wish to have these buried with him at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 23007). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a special coffin made to accommodate the animal urns. Unable to be interred with him, the animal ashes remain with his daughters.

==Career==
Inn's career as an animal trainer spanned more than 50 years. His first professional work was as an assistant trainer of [[Skippy (dog)|Skippy]], the dog who played Asta in the ''[[The Thin Man (film)|Thin Man]]'' movie series.

In 1943, he assisted [[Rudd Weatherwax]] in the training of [[Pal (dog actor)|Pal]], the dog who originated the movie role of [[Lassie]]. 
[[File:Orangey with Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffanys.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[Orangey]] with [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961)]]
In the early 1950s, Inn left the Weatherwax animal training organization and began to work as an independent trainer. His animal stars included [[Orangey]], a cat who was in the films ''[[Rhubarb (1951 film)|Rhubarb]]'' (1952), ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'' (1957), ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959), and ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961), and appeared in the television series ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' with [[Eve Arden]]; Cleo, a [[Basset Hound|basset hound]] who was in the film ''[[Bell, Book and Candle (film)|Bell, Book and Candle]]'' (1957) and in [[Jackie Cooper]]'s 1950s television show, ''[[The People's Choice (TV series)|The People's Choice]]''; [[Arnold Ziffel]], the [[pig]] from ''[[Green Acres]]''; the [[Chimpanzee|chimps]] from ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]'', the dog and two cats from ''[[The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty]]'', Tramp the dog of ''[[My Three Sons]]'' and many of Elly May Clampett's exotic "critters" on ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.

Possibly his most famous animal was [[Higgins (dog)|Higgins]], a fluffy brown mutt he rescued from an animal shelter in [[Burbank, California]]. The dog, which Inn believed to be a cross between a miniature [[poodle]], a [[cocker spaniel]], and a small [[terrier]] (either a [[miniature Schnauzer]] or a [[Border terrier]]), starred in ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' in the 1960s, and in the feature films ''[[Mooch Goes to Hollywood]]'' (1971) and ''[[Benji (1974 film)|Benji]]'' (1974). A sequel, ''[[For the Love of Benji]]'' (1977), starred Higgins's daughter Benjean, also trained by Inn. Benjean portrayed the title role in the following three Benji movies.

In addition to his assistant trainers Gerry Warshauer and Karl Miller, Juanita Inn also helped Frank with animal training; she was listed in the opening credits of ''Benji'' and given credit as an animal trainer in ''[[Oh! Heavenly Dog]]'', a 1980 movie starring Benjean.

Frank Inn also took on small character roles in films that featured his trained animals. He portrayed a studio security guard (uncredited) in ''Mooch Goes to Hollywood'' in 1971, appeared as himself in ''[[Benji the Hunted]]'' in 1987, and played a cook in the 1976 camel comedy ''[[Hawmps!]]''. He can also be seen working as Benjean's trainer in the 1980 documentary ''Benji at Work'', and the voice of Juanita Inn can be heard calling Benjean from off-camera during the behind-the-scenes description of a complex multi-part stunt that required the dog to approach a building, try to enter, and then run away as if driven off.

A true animal lover, Inn could not bear to see healthy animals [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]], so he took them in. Those with acting ability he and his assistants kept and trained; the others he gave to friends and admirers as pets. Inn said that at one time he and his helpers had one thousand animals under their care, and the feeding bills alone came to $400 per day.

==Honors==
The International Association of Canine Professionals honored Frank Inn as their first inductee into the IACP Hall of Fame.

The [[Patsy Award]] (Picture Animal Top Star of the Year) was originated by the Hollywood office of the [[American Humane Association]] in 1939 to honor animal performers in four categories: canine, equine, wild and special. During his career, Inn's animals won 40 Patsy Awards, two of them multiple times: Orangey the cat won three times, for ''Rhubarb,'' ''The Incredible Shrinking Man,'' and ''Breakfast at Tiffany's''; and Arnold the Pig won for three successive years on ''Green Acres'' from 1966 to 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050311030138/http://petticoat.topcities.com/patsyletter.htm 1967 Patsy Award Nominations for Arnold and Higgins].

}}'''Guerrilla Girls''' is an anonymous group of feminist, female artists devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the [[art world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/guerrilla-girls-6858 Guerrilla Girls in Tate Modern Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; The group formed in New York City in 1985 with the mission of bringing [[gender inequality|gender]] and [[racial inequality]] into focus within the greater arts community. The group employs [[culture jamming]] in the form of posters, books, billboards, and public appearances to expose discrimination and corruption. To remain anonymous, members don [[gorilla suit|gorilla masks]] and use pseudonyms that refer to deceased female artists. According to GG1, identities are concealed because issues matter more than individual identities,  "[M]ainly, we wanted the focus to be on the issues, not on our personalities or our own work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Guerilla Girls Bare All| url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113012650/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml| archivedate=2014-01-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the spring of 1985, seven women launched the Guerrilla Girls in response to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s exhibition "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture" [1984), whose roster of 165 artists included only 13 women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/d/c/press_releases/W1siZiIsIjMyNzM2OSJdXQ.pdf?sha=6bd28a21a15dd204 MoMA Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Inaugurating MoMA's newly renovated and expanded building, this exhibition claimed to survey that era's most important painters and sculptors from 17 countries.&lt;ref name=Brenson&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenson|first=Michael|title=A Living Artists Show at the Modern Museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/21/arts/a-living-artists-show-at-the-modern-museum.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of artists of color was even smaller, and none of them were women. [[File:Guerrilla Girls - V&amp;A Museum, London.jpg|thumb|400x400px|Guerrilla Girls at the V&amp;A Museum, London|left]]
 
A comment by the show's curator, [[Kynaston McShine]], further highlights that era's explicit art world gender bias: "Kynaston McShine gave interviews saying that any artist who wasn't in the show should rethink '''his''' career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guerrilla Girls|title=Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls, with an essay by Whitney Chadwick|date=1995|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=9780060950880|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In reaction to the exhibition and McShine's overt bias, they protested in front of MoMA. Thus, the Guerrilla Girls were born.

When the protests yielded little success, the Guerrilla Girls wheat-pasted posters throughout downtown Manhattan, particularly in the [[SoHo]] and [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Cooper1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Ashton Cooper | year=2010 | title=Guerrilla Girls speak on social injustice, radical art | work=A&amp;E | publisher=Columbia Spectator | url=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/09/22/guerrilla-girls-speak-social-injustice-radical-art | accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, the group expanded their focus to include racism in the art world, attracting artists of color. They also took on projects outside of New York, enabling them to address sexism and racism nationally and internationally. Though the art world has remained the group's main focus, the Guerrilla Girls' agenda has included sexism and racism in films, mass and popular culture, and politics. [[Tokenism]] also represents a major group concern.&lt;ref name="Cooper1"/&gt;

During its first years, the Guerrilla Girls conducted "weenie counts," such that members visited institutions like the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and counted artworks' male-to-female subject ratios. Data gathered from the Met's public collections in 1989 showed that women artists had produced less than 5% of the works in the Modern Art Department, while 85% of the nudes were female.
[[File:Guerrilla Girls!.jpg|thumb|Guerrilla Girls wear gorilla masks whenever making public appearances.|left]]

Early organizing was based around meetings, during which members evaluated statistical data gathered regarding gender inequality within the New York City's art scene. The Guerrilla Girls also worked closely with artists, encouraging them to speak to those within the community to bridge the [[sex ratio|gender gap]] where they perceived it.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;

When asked about the masks, the girls answer "We were Guerrillas before we were Gorillas. From the beginning the press wanted publicity photos. We needed a disguise. No one remembers, for sure, how we got our fur, but one story is that at an early meeting, an original girl, a bad speller, wrote 'Gorilla' instead of 'Guerrilla.' It was an enlightened mistake. It gave us our 'mask-ulinity.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |title=Interview |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113012650/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |archivedate=2014-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Interview Magazine|New York Times]] the Guerrilla Girls were quoted, "Anonymous free speech is protected by the Constitution. You'd be surprised what comes out of your mouth when you wear a mask."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/info/interview%20mag.shtml |title=Interview Magazine |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805212205/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/info/interview%20mag.shtml |archivedate=2014-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1985, the Guerrilla Girls have worked for an increased awareness of sexism and greater accountability on the part of curators, art dealers, collectors and critics.&lt;ref name="guerrillagirls.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |title=Guerrilla Girls Bare All: An Interview |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113012650/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/interview/index.shtml |archivedate=2014-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is credited, above all, with sparking dialogue, and bringing national and international attention to issues of sexism and racism within the arts.

== Influences ==
Many feminist artists in the 1970s dared to imagine that female artists could produce authentically and radically different art, undoing the prevailing visual paradigm. The pioneering feminist critic, [[Lucy Lippard]] curated an all-women exhibition in 1974, effectively protesting what most deemed a deeply flawed approach, that of merely assimilating women into the prevailing art system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Chave, Anna C. "The Guerrilla Girls' Reckoning." ''Art Journal'' 70.2 (2011): 102-11. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaped by the 1970s women's movement, the Guerrilla Girls resolved to devise new strategies. Most noticeably, they realized that 1970s-era tools such as pickets and marches proved ineffective, as evidenced by how easily MoMA could ignore 200 protestors from the [[Women's Caucus for Art]]. "We had to have a new image and a new kind of language to appeal to a younger generation of women," recalls one of the founding Guerrilla Girls, who goes by "Liubov Popova."&lt;ref&gt;"Oral history interview with Guerrilla Girls Elizabeth Vigée LeBrun and Liubov Popova." January 19, 2008. ''Archives of American Art''. Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guerrilla Girls sought an alternative approach, one that would defeat views of the 1970s Feminist movements as man-hating, anti-maternal, strident, and humorless:&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Versed in poststructuralist theories, they adopted 1970s initiatives, but with a different language and style. Earlier feminists tackled grim and unfunny issues such as sexual violence, inspiring the Guerrilla Girls to keep their spirits intact by approaching their work with wit and laughter, thus preventing a backlash.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Work: actions, posters and billboards==
===Art world===
[[File:La Barbe et les Guerrilla Girls sous l'oeil d'Alice Coffin.jpg|thumb|French feminist group [[La Barbe]] (Beard) meets the Guerrilla Girls at the Palais de Tokyo (Paris, 2013).]]
Throughout their existence, the Guerrilla Girls have gained the most attention for their bold [[protest art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/guerrilla-girls|title=Brooklyn Museum: Guerrilla Girls|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Guerrilla Girls' projects (mostly posters at first) express observations, concerns, and ideals regarding numerous social topics. Their art has always been fact-driven, and informed by the group's unique approach to data collection, such as "weenie counts." To be more inclusive and to make their posters more eye-catching, the Guerrilla Girls tend to pair facts with humorous images.&lt;ref&gt;"We use facts, humor and outrageous visuals to expose sexism, racism and corruption in politics, art, film and pop culture."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Guerrilla Girls gained fame for wheat-pasting provocative campaign posters around New York City, the group has also enjoyed public commissions and indoor exhibitions.

In addition to posting posters around downtown Manhattan, they passed out thousands of small [[handbills]] based on their designs at various events.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt; The first posters were mainly black and white fact-sheets, highlighting inequalities between male and female artists with regard to number of exhibitions, gallery representation and pay. Their posters revealed how sexist the art world was in comparison to other industries and to national averages. For example, in 1985 they printed a poster showing that the salary gap in the art world between men and women was starker than the United States average, proclaiming "Women in America earn only 2/3 of what men do. Women artists earn only 1/3 of what men do." These early posters often targeted specific galleries and artists. Another 1985 poster listed the names of some of the most famous working artists, such as [[Bruce Nauman]] and [[Richard Serra]]. The poster asked "What do these artists have in common?" with the answer "They allow their work to be shown in galleries that show no more than 10% of women or none at all."
 
The group were also activists for equal representation of women in institutional art, and highlighted artist [[Louise Bourgeois]] in their "Advantages to Being a Women artist," poster in 1988 as one line read, "Knowing your career might not pick up till after you're 80."&lt;ref&gt;Louise Bourgeois; The Spider, The Mistress &amp; The Tangerine. Directed by Marian Cajori and Amei Wallach. 2008. New York, NY: Zeitgeist Films, 2009. DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Their pieces are also notable for their use of combative statements such as "When racism and sexism are no longer fashionable, what will your art collection be worth?"&lt;ref name="Cooper1" /&gt;''

Dearest Art Collector (1986)
Dearest Art Collector is a 560x430 mm screen-print on paper. This is one of thirty posters published in a portfolio entitled Guerrilla Girls Talk Back. This print is unusual in the portfolio in that it takes the form of an enlarged handwritten letter on baby pink paper. The extremely rounded cursive script crowned with a frowning flower exudes femininity, symbolizing the biting sarcasm for which the Guerrilla Girls were known for. The Guerrilla Girls sent this poster to well- known art collectors across the United States, pointing out how few works they owned by women artists. This send up of femininity is aimed at the expectation that, even when presenting a serious complaint, women should do so in a socially acceptable 'nice' way. "We know that you feel terrible about this" appeals to the feelings of the recipient. This piece was a commentary on how hard it is for female artists, and what lengths they must go through in order to be recognized and taken seriously. Women are constantly expected to perform a certain way and this print is the embodiment of how tumultuous it is for women all around the world to be recognized in the eyes of men with power.  The group later transcribed it into other languages and sent it to collectors outside the U.S. A practical joke with serious implications, this poster is now (somewhat ironically) a collector's item.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The posters were rude; they named names and they printed statistics (and almost always cited the source of those statistics at the bottom, making them difficult to dismiss). They embarrassed people. In other words, they worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tallman|first=Susan|title=Guerrilla Girls|journal=Arts Magazine|year=1991|volume=65|issue=8|pages=21–2|url=http://www.susan-tallman.com/guerilla-girls.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702074700/http://www.susan-tallman.com/guerilla-girls.pdf|archivedate=2 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Guerrilla Girls' first color poster, which remains the group's most iconic image, is the 1989 Metropolitan Museum poster, which used data from the group's first "weenie count." In response to the overwhelming amount of female nudes counted in the Modern Art sections, the poster asks, sarcastically, ''"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?"''. Next to the text is an image of the [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] painting [[La Grande Odalisque]], one of the most famous female nudes in Western art history, with a gorilla head placed over the original face.

In 1990, the group designed a [[billboard]] featuring the [[Mona Lisa]] that was placed along the [[West Side Highway]] supported by the New York City public art fund. For one day, New York's [[MTA Bus Company]] also displayed bus advertisements with Met. Museum poster. [[Stickers]] also became popular [[Business card|calling cards]] representative of the group.

The Guerrilla Girls infiltrated the bathrooms of the newly opened [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Soho]], placing stickers regarding [[Gender inequality|female inequality]] on the walls.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt; 
In 1998, Guerrilla Girls West protested at the [[San Jose Museum of Art]], over low representation of women artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.23.98/guerrillagirls-9816.html| title=Masking for Art | work=Metro| date=April 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to researching and exposing sexism in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have received commissions from numerous organizations and institutions, such as [[The Nation]] (2001),&lt;ref name="thenation.com"&gt;https://www.thenation.com/issue/april-2-2001/&lt;/ref&gt; Fundación Bilbao Arte (2002), [[Istanbul Modern]] (2006) and [[Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art]] (2007). They have also partnered with [[Amnesty International]], contributing pieces to a show under the organization's "Protect the Human" initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=16632 |title=Press releases in 2014 |publisher=Amnesty International UK |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213002545/http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=16632 |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public commissions===
In 2005, the group exhibited large-format posters ''Welcome to the Feminist Biennale'' at the [[Venice Biennale]] (the first in 110 years to be overseen by women), scrutinizing 101 years of Biennale history in terms of diversity. ''Where Are the Women Artists of Venice?'' explored the fact that most works owned by Venice's historical museums are kept in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Walter|title=Festive Venice|url=http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/reviews/walrobinson/robinson6-10-05.asp|work=Artnet|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/4032689 "Girl Power." ''The Economist''. June 2, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel. "Subdued Biennale forgoes shock factor." ''The New York Times''. June 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to produce special projects for international institutions, sometimes for the very institutions they have criticized. Offers that pose a dilemma are carefully considered, so as to avoid censure, since one way to improve institutions is to criticize them from inside.&lt;ref&gt;"Guerrilla Girl Gig," SUNY Stony Brook, NY, October, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Their 2006 poster ''The Future For Turkish Women Artists as Revealed by the Guerrilla Girls'', commissioned by [[Istanbul Modern]], demonstrated that the status of women artists in Turkey was better than in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;
http://vis129f.wikifoundry.com/page/Guerrilla+Girls%3A+"The+Future+for+Turkish+Women+Artists"-+Nicole+Young&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the [[Washington Post]] published their ''Horror on the National Mall!'', a one-page newspaper spread attacking the absence of diversity among tax-payer supported museums on the Mall in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/artsandliving/museums/features/2007/feminism-and-art/guerrilla_girls.html&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2007 ART-ATHINA, the Guerrilla Girls projected "Dear Art Collector" in Greek onto the entrance's façade. In 2015, they projected their "Dear Art Collector" animation onto a museum façade, taking on collectors who fail to pay employees a living wage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/your-art-fair-antidote-the-guerrilla-girls-turn-30/&lt;/ref&gt;
To commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the [[École Polytechnique massacre]], the University of Quebec commissioned their ''Troubler Le Repos'' (Disturbing The Peace) poster, whose texts addressed anti-women [[hate-speech]] since [[Ancient Greece]] to [[Rush Limbaugh]].

In 2009, they launched ''I'm not a feminist, but If I were this is what I'd complain about ... '', an interactive graffiti wall that enables women who don't see themselves as feminists the means to target gender issues with the hope that active participation will broaden their perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwci.ie/?/news/article/guerrilla_girls_take_on_irish_arts_exclusion_of_women&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, this traveled to Krakòw's Art Boom Festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/julian-vigo/guerrilla-girls-plant-a-b_b_3462596.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, an advertising truck towed ''Do women Have To Be Naked To Get Into Boston Museums?'' around Boston.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2012/09/22/guerrilla-girls-launch-art-protest-targeting-museum-fine-arts/953Q0IyP3H9WxrWIcUhXUJ/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Invited by Yoko Ono to participate in the 2013 [[Meltdown Festival]], the Guerrilla Girls updated their 2003 ''Estrogen Bomb'' poster, which had premiered in [[The Village Voice]] in 2003.

During Winter 2016, they participated in "Twin City Takeover," art exhibitions and art projects organized by a consortium of local art organizations sited around Minneapolis and St. Paul.&lt;ref&gt;https://wedompls.org/urban-projects/guerrilla-girls/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walkerart.org/magazine/2015/guerrilla-girls-30th-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film world===
[[File:Guerrilla Girls Billboard.jpg|thumb|right|Guerrilla Girls billboard in Los Angeles protesting white male dominance at the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] in 2002.]]

To protest the dearth of female directors, the Guerrilla Girls distributed stickers during the 2001 [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/west-indies/&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Nation]] invited them to 
present ''Birth of Feminism'',&lt;ref name="thenation.com"/&gt; which they updated and presented in 2007 as a banner outside Witte de With Center for Contemporary Arts. Since 2002, Guerrilla Girls Inc. have designed and installed billboards during the Oscars that address white male dominance in the [[film industry]], such as: "Anatomically Correct Oscars," "Even the Senate is More Progressive than Hollywood," "The Birth of Feminism,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliethebolt.net/page/page/319287.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325230231/http://www.juliethebolt.net/page/page/319287.htm |date=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Unchain the Women Directors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-for-a-change.com/blog/2006/02/guerrilla-girls-vs-king-kong.html |title=» Guerrilla Girls vs. King Kong |publisher=Art-for-a-change.com |date=2006-02-05 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2015 Reykjavik Arts Festival, the Guerrilla Girls displayed ''National Film Quiz'', a billboard criticizing the fact that 87% of national funding for films goes to men, despite women playing an important part of Iceland's public and private sectors.&lt;ref&gt;http://grapevine.is/culture/movies-theatre/2015/06/24/the-boys-club-men-are-strong-and-carry-around-big-cameras/&lt;/ref&gt; 
In light of 2016's #Oscarssowhite campaign, the Guerrilla Girls updated the above billboards, presenting them on downtown Minneapolis streets for "Twin City Takeover."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guerrillagirls.com/exhibitions/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and social issues===
Although the Guerrilla Girls' protest art directed at the art world remains their most well-known work, throughout their existence the group has periodically targeted politicians, specifically conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Those criticized have included [[George H.W. Bush|George Bush]], [[Newt Gingrich]], and most recently [[Michele Bachmann]]. In 1991, the Artist and Homeless Collaborative invited them to work with homeless women to create posters in response to homelessness and the first Gulf War. 
Between 1992 and 1994, Guerrilla Girl posters addressed the 1992 Presidential election, reproductive rights (done for march on Washington in 1992), gay and lesbian rights, and the LA riots.  During the 2012 election, they displayed their ''Even Michele Bachman believes. ...   '' on a billboard adjacent a football stadium to advertise her plan to: ban same-sex marriages, require Voter Id Checks, and spend money implementing statewide voter IDs.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/19/entertainment/la-et-cm-guerrilla-girls-use-twist-to-make-bachmann-a-gay-marriage-booster-20121019&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2013 posters discussed the Homeland Terror Alert system and Arnold Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial campaign.

In 2016, the Guerrilla Girls launched the "President Trump Announces New Commemorative Months" campaign in the form of stickers and posters, which they distributed during the "Women's March on Washington" in LA and NYC, as well as the J20 event at the Whitney Museum of Art&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnews.com/2017/01/20/speak-out-on-inauguration-day-words-at-the-whitney-museum-take-aim-at-trump/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fire Fink protest at MoMA.&lt;ref&gt;https://hyperallergic.com/360236/protesters-demand-moma-drop-trump-advisor-from-its-board/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work: publications and merchandise==

To shed light on inequality in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have published numerous books. In 1995, they published their first book, ''Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls,'' a compilation of 50 works plus a self-interview.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Guerrilla-Girls-Guerilla/dp/0060950889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dery. "Art Attack." ''The New York Times Book Review''. July 30, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, they published ''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'', a consciousness-raising comic book that sold 82,000 copies, as it explores how art history's male domination constrained several female artists' careers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Guerrilla-Bedside-Companion-History-Western/dp/014025997X&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, they published ''Bitches, Bimbos and Ballbreakers'', a down and dirty catalogue of "The Top Stereotypes from Cradle to Grave." Offering thumbnail histories for cultural clichés ranging from "Daddy's Girl," "the Girl Next Door," "the Bimbo/Dumb Blonde" to "the Bitch /Ballbreaker", each is given "trademark Guerrilla Girl treatment: pointed factoids and cool graphics."&lt;ref&gt;Hoban, Phoebe (January 4, 2004). [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/theater/art-masks-still-in-place-but-firmly-in-the-mainstream.html "Masks Still in Place but Firmly in the Mainstream"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/media/2004/01/bitches-bimbos-and-ballbreakers&lt;/ref&gt;

Their 2004 book ''The Guerrilla Girl's Museum Activity Book'' (reissued in 2012) parodies children's museum activity books. Meant to teach children how to both appreciate and critique museums, this book provides activities that reveal the problematic aspects of museum culture and major museum collections. In 2009, they published a history of hysteria, ''The Hysterical Herstory Of Hysteria And How It Was Cured From Ancient Times Until Now''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/books |title=Books by the Guerrilla Girls |publisher=Guerrilla Girls |accessdate=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; MFC-Michèle Didier reprinted it in 2011 and 2016.

==Presentations==
An important part of Guerrilla Girls' outreach since 1985 has been presentations and workshops at colleges, universities, art organizations and sometimes at museums. The presentations, known as "gigs", attract hundreds and sometimes thousands of attendees. In the gig, they play music, videos, show slides and talk about the history of their work, how it has evolved. At the end the GGs interact with audience members. New work is always included and gig material changes all the time. They have done hundreds of these events and have travelled to nearly every state as well as Europe, South America and Australia.

In recognition of their work, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to give talks at world-renowned museums, including a presentation at the MoMA's 2007 "Feminist Futures" Symposium. They have also been invited to speak at art schools and universities across the globe, and gave a 2010 commencement speech at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].
To mark the 30th anniversary of the Guerrilla Girls, [[Matadero Madrid]] hosted "Guerrilla Girls: 1985-2015," an exhibition featuring most of the collective's production accompanied by a series of events including a talk/performance by Guerrilla Girl members Frida Kahlo and Käthe Kollwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mataderomadrid.org/ficha/4093/guerrilla-girls.html|title=Guerrilla Girls 1985-2015|website=MataderoMadrid|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/119127188|title=GUERRILLA GIRLS CONFERENCIA / PERFORMANCE|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also showed the 1992 documentary "Guerrilla in Our Midst" by Amy Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guerrillasinourmidst.com/|title=Guerrillas In Our Midst|website=guerrillasinourmidst.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Diversity===
Despite having routinely challenged art institutions to display more artists of color, both members and critics want the Guerrilla Girls to be more diverse. Zora Neale Hurston recalls Guerrilla Girl membership as "mostly white" and largely mirroring the art world demographics that they critiqued.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-guerrilla-girls-zora-neale-hurston-and-agnes-martin-15840|title=Oral history interview with Guerrilla Girls Zora Neale Hurston and Agnes Martin, 2008 May 17 - Oral Histories {{!}} Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|last=Richards|first=Judith Olch|last2=Hurston|first2=Zora Neale|date=2008-05-17|website=www.aaa.si.edu|access-date=2016-06-07|last3=Martin|first3=Agnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite sporting gorilla masks to downplay personal identity, some members attribute Guerilla Girl interests to the fact that de facto leaders "Frida Kahlo" and "Kathe Kollwitz" are both white.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; ("Frida Kahlo" has also been criticized for her appropriation of a Latina artist's name.)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=No No's: Guerrilla Girls at the State Theatre|last=Lodu|first=Mary|date=March 2016|work=INREVIEW|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, any precise information on the demographics of the Guerrilla Girls is impossible, for they have "staunchly, and problematically, resisted being surveyed as to the makeup of their own membership."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Several Guerrilla Girls who are people of color have faced numerous challenges. Despite the Guerrilla Girls' stance against tokenism, some artists of color abandoned Guerrilla Girl membership due to [[tokenism]], silencing, disrespect, and [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; As a woman of color, "Alma Thomas" describes having felt uncomfortable wearing the Guerrilla Girls' signature gorilla mask.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-guerrilla-girls-jane-bowles-and-alma-thomas-15838|title=Oral history interview with Guerrilla Girls Jane Bowles and Alma Thomas, 2008 May 8 - Oral Histories {{!}} Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|last=Richards|first=Judith Olch|last2=Bowles|first2=Jane|date=2008-05-08|website=www.aaa.si.edu|access-date=2016-06-07|last3=Thomas|first3=Alma}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Thomas" recalls little effort being devoted to understanding the challenges of artists of color. "Their whiteness was such that they. ...   didn't understand that blacks were being put in a completely separate world in the art world, that black male artists and black female artists are completely separated, completely segregated to this day."&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Ultimately, this widespread antagonism led to many "artists of color [leaving] after a few meetings because they could sense the unspoken hierarchy in the group."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stein|first=Gertrude|date=Summer 2011|title=Guerrilla Girls and Guerrilla Girls BroadBand: Inside Story|jstor=41430727|journal=Art Journal|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-wave feminism and essentialism ===
[[File:Good Luck getting that estrogen bomb.jpg|thumb|Anonymous MCAD student protest against the Guerrilla Girls]]Emerging at the tail end of the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist movement]], the Guerrilla Girls navigated the differences between established and emerging feminist theory during the 1980s. "Alma Thomas" describes this grey-area that the Guerrilla Girls occupied as "universalist feminism," bordering on [[Gender essentialism|essentialism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Art Historian Anna Chave considers the Guerrilla Girls' essentialism much more profound, leading the group to be "assailed by ... a rising generation of women wise in the ways of poststructuralist theory, for [their] putative naiveté and susceptibility to essentialism."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Essentialist views are most clearly exhibited in two Guerrilla Girl books:''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'' (1998) and the controversial ''Estrogen Bomb'' (2003–13) campaign. Regarding the former, "Alma Thomas" worried that ''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'' "was so embedded in that second-wave feminist and even pre-second-wave essentialism" that it fulfilled some assumption that all women artists are feminist artists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Students at [[Minneapolis College of Art and Design]] criticized their ''Estrogen Bomb'' poster campaign, describing it as insensitive towards transgender people since it ties the female gender to estrogen, the same sort of essentialist link the Guerilla Girls aim to critique.&lt;ref&gt;Cherneff, Lila, 2015-12-28, "Guerrilla Girls Stumble at MCAD," Radio Program, https://soundcloud.com/minneculture/guerrilla-girls-stumble-at-mcad, 2016-05-31, KFAI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/guerrilla-girls-exclusionary-feminism/|title=The Guerrilla Girls, 'estrogen bombs' and exclusionary feminism|last=Jones|first=Hannah|date=2016-04-20|website=Twin Cities Daily Planet|publisher=Adaobi Okolue|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from essentialism, the Guerrilla Girls have also been critiqued for failing to integrate [[intersectionality]] into their work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Internal disputes ===
Leading up to a highly publicized 2003 lawsuit, there was increasing animosity toward "Frida Kahlo" and "Käthe Kollwitz." Despite founding members' initial intention to create a non-hierarchal, equitable power structure, there was an increasing sense that two people were making "the final decisions no matter what you said."&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Several Guerrilla Girls felt that their second book, ''The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art'', primarily represented the views of "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz". Some even felt that "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" completely controlled the book, despite their having selected material created collectively by all Guerrilla Girls. There was even suspicion that these two not only claimed all the credit, but took all of the profits. Some members condemned the book as "undemocratic and ... against the spirit of the [Guerrilla] Girls."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As the Guerilla Girls gained in popularity, tensions led to what the Girls later called the "banana split," as five members actually split from the collective. Soon after several members stepped aside to form Guerrilla Girls Broadband, "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" moved to trademark the name "Guerrilla Girls, Inc." to distinguish their realm from those of Guerrilla Girls BroadBand and [[Guerrilla Girls On Tour|Guerrilla Girls On Tour!]], whose focus is discrimination in the theater world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even though their former colleague "Gertrude Stein" was in the on-tour group, "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" charged them with copyright and trademark infringement and unjust enrichment. Many members of the group felt especially betrayed that "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" had launched their lawsuit under their real names, Jerilea Zempel and Erika Rothenberg.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Toobin 2005"&gt;Jeffrey Toobin. "Girls Behaving Badly."''New Yorker''. May 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

This prompted negative reactions from both current and former Guerrilla Girls, who objected to "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" claiming responsibility for having created the collective effort, as well as the flippancy with which they exchanged their anonymity for legal standing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Louis L. Stanton|Judge Louis L. Stanton]], who handled the case, rejected the "bizarre" suggestion that defendants sporting gorilla masks be allowed to testify in his courtroom. He also stated that "Mundane court procedures for adjudicating legal rights and the ownership of property require direct and cross-examination of real persons with real addresses and attributes."&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Toobin 2005"/&gt;

In their forty-five page complaint, "Kahlo" and "Kollwitz" described themselves as the group's "guiding forces," even though the Guerrilla Girls were "informally organized, [and] had no official hierarchy." Initially, they asked the court to stop Guerrilla Girls Broadband from calling themselves Guerrilla Girls and sought millions of dollars in damages. In 2006, they settled with the theatre group who agreed to go by Guerrilla Girls on Tour.

=== Selling-out ===
Upon their 1985 debut, the Guerrilla Girls were "lauded by the very establishment they sought to undermine." They have since exhibited at Tate Modern, Venice Biennale, Centre Pompidou, MoMA, which additionally grants them a broader audience for their concerns.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/guerrilla-girl-power-have-americas-feminist-artists-sold-out-1666140.html|title=Guerrilla girl power: Have America's feminist artists sold out?|last=Adams|first=Guy|date=2009-04-08|website=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print Limited|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this relationship has only intensified, as the Guerrilla Girls presented their exhibitions in museums and even allowed their works to be collected by hegemonic institutions. Although some have questioned the efficacy, if not hypocrisy, of the group's working within the system that they originally denigrated, few would challenge their decision to let the Getty Institute house their archives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Members and names==
[[File:2016GuerrillaGirlsRochesterArtCenter.jpg|thumb|left|Two members of the Guerrilla Girls join a panel discussion at the Rochester Art Center in 2016 in Rochester, Minnesota]]

Membership in the New York City group is by invitation only, based on relationships with current and past members, and one's involvement in the [[contemporary art]] world. A [[mentoring]] program was formed within the group, pairing a new member with an experienced Guerrilla Girl to bring them into the fold. Due to the lack of formality, the group is comfortable with individuals outside of their base claiming to be Guerrilla Girls; Guerrilla Girl 1 stated in a 2007 interview: "It can only enhance us by having people of power who have been given credit for being a Girl, even if they were never a Girl." Men are not allowed to become Guerrilla Girls, but may support the group by assisting in promotional activities.&lt;ref name="Oral1" /&gt;

Guerrilla Girls names are [[wikt:pseudonym|pseudonyms]] generally based on dead female artists. Members goes by names such as [[Kathe Kollwitz]], [[Alma Thomas]], [[Rosalba Carriera]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Julia de Burgos]], and [[Hannah Höch]]. Guerrilla Girls' "Carriera" is credited with the idea of using pseudonyms as a way to not forget female artists. Having read about Rosalba Carriera in a footnote of ''Letters on Cézanne'' by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], she decided to pay tribute to the little-known female artist with her name. This also helped to solve the problem of media interviews; the group was often interviewed by phone and would not give names, causing problems and confusion amongst the group and the media. Guerrilla Girl 1 joined in the late 1980s, taking on her name as a way to memorialize women in the art community who have fallen under the radar and did not make as notable as an impact as the names takes on by other members.&lt;ref name="Oral1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Judith Olch Richards | year=2007 | title=Interview with Guerrilla Girls Rosalba Carriera and Guerrilla Girl 1  | work= | publisher=Archives of American Art | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-guerrilla-girls-rosalba-carriera-and-guerrilla-girl-1-15843 | accessdate=10 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gorilla symbolism==
[[File:Kingkongposter.jpg|thumb|270x270px|The 1933 film ''King Kong'' was influential to the concept of a Guerilla Girl.]]
The idea to adopt the gorilla as the group's symbol stemmed from a spelling error. One of the first Guerrilla Girls accidentally spelled the group's name at a meeting as "gorilla."&lt;ref name="guerrillagirls.com" /&gt; Despite the fact that the idea of using a gorilla as group symbol might have been accidental, the choice is nevertheless pertinent to the group's overall message in several key ways.

To begin with, the gorilla in popular culture and media is often associated with [[King Kong]], or other images of trapped and tamed apes. In the 2010 SAIC Commencement, the comparison between institutionalized artists and tamed apes was explicitly made:

&lt;blockquote&gt; And last, but not least, be a great ape. In 1917, Franz Kafka wrote a short story titled ''A Report to An Academy'', in which an ape spoke about what it was like to be taken into captivity by a bunch of educated, intellectual types. The published story ends with the ape tamed and broken by the stultified academics. But in an earlier draft, Kafka tells a different story. The ape ends his report by instructing other apes NOT to allow themselves to be tamed. He says instead: break the bars of your cages, bite a hole through them, squeeze through an opening ... and ask yourself where do YOU want to go&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guerrillagirls.com/books/images/SAICcommencement5%2022%2010.pdf |title=School of the Art Institute of Chicago Commencement Address |publisher=Guerrillagirls.com |date=May 22, 2010 |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005181705/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/books/images/SAICcommencement5%2022%2010.pdf |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Guerillagirlad.png|left|thumb|210x210px|This is Guerrilla Girl ad using an Ingres image with the trademark gorilla mask with facts about gender inequality in the art industry.]] --&gt;
The gorilla is also typically associated with masculinity. The Met. Museum poster is in part shocking because of its juxtaposition of the eroticized female [[odalisque]] body, and the large, snarling gorilla head. The addition of the head detracts from the male [[gaze]] and changes the way in which viewers are able to look at or understand the highly sexualized image. Further, the addition of the gorilla questions and modifies stereotypical notions of female beauty within Western art and popular culture, another stated goal of the Guerrilla Girls. [[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, La Grande Odalisque, 1814.jpg|thumbnail|The original image by Ingres without the addition of the gorilla head represents the kind of art that the Guerrilla Girls take issues with, like the common issues of exoticism and sexualization of women.|left|199x199px]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Guerrilla Girls, who wear the masks of big, hairy, powerful jungle creatures whose beauty is hardly conventional ... believe all animals, large and small, are beautiful in their own way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girls|first=Guerrilla|title=Bitches, Bimbos, and Ballbreakers: The Guerrilla Girls' Illustrated Guide to Female Stereotypes'|year=2003|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-200101-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though this goal has never been explicitly stated by the group, in the history of Western art, primates have often been associated with the visual arts, and with the figure of the artist. The idea of ''ars simia naturae'' ("art the ape of nature") maintains that the job of art is to "ape", or faithfully copy and represent nature. This was an idea first popularized by Renaissance thinker [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] who alleged that "the artist in imitating nature only follows Nature's own command."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jason|first=H.W.|title=Apes and Ape Lore in the Renaissance and Middle Ages|year=1952|publisher=The Warburg Institute, University of London|location=London|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești''' (January 1, 1868 – December 14, 1946) was a Romanian short story writer and politician. The scion of a minor aristocratic family from [[Târgoviște]], he studied law and, as a young man, drew close to the ''[[Junimea]]'' circle and its patron [[Titu Maiorescu]]. He began publishing fiction as an adolescent, and put out his first book of stories in 1903; his work centered on the fading provincial milieu dominated by old class structures. Meanwhile, after a break with Maiorescu, he drew toward ''[[Viața Românească]]'' and [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]]. In 1907, Brătescu-Voinești entered the Romanian parliament, where he would serve for over three decades while his written output declined. In his later years, he became an outspoken anti-Semite and fascist, a stance that, following his country's defeat in World War II, gave way to anti-communism near the end of his life.

==Biography==

===Literary work===
Born in [[Târgoviște]], his parents were Alexandru Brătescu, a low-ranking ''[[Wallachian boyars|boyar]]'' and the son of a ''[[Pitar (rank)|pitar]]'' (bread supplier), and Alexandrina, daughter of Ion Voinescu, a major in the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]]. He was the second of four children. His childhood took place amidst the traditional environment of old Târgoviște and at the [[Văcărești, Dâmbovița|Brătești]] estate. He attended primary school in his native town from 1875 to 1879, then at the Cocorăscu boarding school and finally at [[Saint Sava High School]] in [[Bucharest]] from 1879 to 1883. One theory, unsupported by documentary evidence, is that his literary debut occurred with a poem in Târgoviște's ''Armonia'' magazine in 1883; a likelier scenario is that it took place in ''România'' magazine in 1887, when he published the short story "Dolores" with the help of [[Alexandru Vlahuță]]. He attended the medical faculty of [[Bucharest University]] from 1889 to 1890, but switched to law. At the same time, he audited the logic and history of philosophy course taught by [[Titu Maiorescu]], entered Bucharest's ''[[Junimea]]'' circle, and in 1890 began contributing to its ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; His father died in 1890, and Maiorescu took on the role of father figure in the young man's life.&lt;ref&gt;Mănucă, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in 1892,&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; he was appointed a judge through his mentor's intervention,&lt;ref name="n112"/&gt; serving at Bucharest, [[Pitești]], [[Craiova]] and Târgoviște.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; Living in his native town for nearly two decades after arriving there in 1896,&lt;ref&gt;Mănucă, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; he practiced as a lawyer after leaving the bench.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; Brătescu-Voinești found life there rather constraining: he had to sell the Brătești property at a loss, and lived on the irregular income earned from lawyer's fees. He lacked a literary discussion circle, largely editing his own work, and would eventually enter politics out of boredom.&lt;ref name="m11"/&gt;

He married [[Brăila]] native Penelope Popescu, who was beautiful but poor;&lt;ref&gt;Mănucă, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; the couple had two children.&lt;ref name="m11"/&gt; His choice of wife perturbed Maiorescu, who surmised the union would reduce the social standing of Brătescu-Voinești, and in 1896 invited him on a trip to Great Britain (the two had already journeyed to Switzerland and twice to Italy, on Maiorescu's money). While abroad, the younger man engaged in bizarre behavior; upon his return home, the critic asked his brother whether he had not lost his mind.&lt;ref&gt;Mănucă, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; He also steadfastly refused to marry the niece of Maiorescu's wife.&lt;ref name="n112"&gt;Lucian Nastasă, ''Intelectualii și promovarea socială'', p. 112. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Limes, 2004. {{ISBN|978-973790-755-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cumulative effect of these transgressions was to prompt the mentor to cut off ties that were never renewed, in spite of the younger man's attempts to restore relations.&lt;ref name="n112"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mănucă, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; A postscript took place in 1903, when Brătescu-Voinești submitted the short story "Neamul Udreștilor" (later published in ''Voința națională'') for Maiorescu's review. Although some critics have speculated that the changes suggested by the latter caused their break, the writer in fact accepted nearly all of them.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m11"&gt;Mănucă, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, after that date, he split with ''Junimea'' and became affiliated with the ''[[Viața Românească]]'' group.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; Alongside [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], he was one of the magazine's most valued contributors, and entered the public eye thanks to his appearance in its pages.&lt;ref name="m11"/&gt; Moreover, its patron [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] somewhat filled in the gap left by the break with Maiorescu.&lt;ref&gt;Mănucă, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

His first book was the 1903 ''Nuvele și schițe'', enlarged and re-edited as ''În lumea dreptății'' (1906), followed by ''Întuneric și lumină'' (1912), after which his fiction gave way to opinion journalism, collected as ''În slujba păcei'' (1919).&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; In 1912, he served as interim director of the [[National Theatre Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Barbu, ''Momente din istoria teatrului românesc'', p. 149. Bucharest: Editura Eminescu, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, he served as a platoon commander in the [[Second Balkan War]]; he was amused by the respect his troops showed due to his white hair, but also became a vehement pacifist thanks to the experience. This caused a break with ''Viața Românească'', which he believed was leading public opinion in the wrong direction.&lt;ref&gt;Mănucă, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He was credited with co-writing the 1915 play ''Sorana'' alongside [[A. de Herz]], but later claimed the latter had not contributed a single line.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Ghițulescu, ''Istoria literaturii române: dramaturgia'', p. 852. Bucharest: Editura Academiei Române, 2007. {{ISBN|978-973-271-616-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reissued the play in 1920 without Herz' name on the cover, prompting the latter to sue and win the case.&lt;ref name="m16"&gt;Mănucă, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; From 1918 to 1919, he worked on ''Dacia'' and ''Lamura'', magazines he headed together with Vlahuță and, following the latter's death, alone from 1919 to 1922.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; His task at ''Dacia'', communicated from government sources, was to discredit those who had collaborated with the country's German occupiers [[Romania during World War I|during World War I]] (of which Herz was emblematic). Brătescu-Voinești and his chief declined to do so, but nevertheless received warnings from potential targets such as [[Tudor Arghezi]].&lt;ref name="m16"/&gt;

Brătescu-Voinești evoked the medium of the crumbling ancient ''boyar'' class and its uncomplicated structure, of small-time provincial clerks; his characters are unable to adapt to the modern world, their souls filled with candor, hurt when they come into contact with the brutal bourgeois world, incapable of withstanding the impact of lies and injustice. Although romantic, his material is handled using a classic, direct, simple, often confessional tone. His sympathetic participation in the destinies he narrates gives his prose an intensely lyrical flavor, which helps account for its charm and popularity.&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', vol. I, p. 215. Pitești: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move toward politics===
After entering political life, he was a member of parliament continuously from 1907 until 1940,&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumitru Micu, ''Început de secol, 1900–1916: curente și scriitori'', p. 318. Bucharest: Editura Minerva, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and served as secretary of the [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies|Assembly of Deputies]] from 1914 to 1940.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; He was a member of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] from 1907 to 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Mănucă, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Mănucă, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; he advanced to titular member in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=B Membrii Academiei Române din 1866 până în prezent] at the Romanian Academy site&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1920 and 1940, he published only sporadically: ''Rătăcire'' (1923), ''Firimituri'' (1929), ''Cu undița'' (1933) and ''Din pragul apusului'' (1935). Between 1920 and 1932, he wrote school textbooks in collaboration with other authors.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;

Starting in 1937, he veered toward fascism, setting forth his theories in programmatic pamphlets: ''Huliganism?'' (1938), ''Strigăte de alarmă în chestia evreiască'' (1940) and ''Germanofobie?'' (1942).&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; His transition was somewhat surprising: other than his pacifist essays of 1919, Brătescu-Voinești had heretofore not made waves within his conservative circles. But beginning with an anti-Semitic press campaign of 1937, he passed through all the stages of Romanian anti-Semitism, from "popular" and traditional form to the politically and ideologically radical variant. A declared follower of [[Mihail Eminescu]]'s nationalism and an unreserved admirer of [[A. C. Cuza]], he proudly called himself a "hooligan", praised Hitlerism and stood beside [[Ion Antonescu]] during World War II, backing [[Anti-Jewish laws|racial laws]] and deportation of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Volovici]], ''Ideologia naționalistǎ și "problema Evreiascǎ"'', p. 178. Bucharest: Editura Humanitas, 1995. {{ISBN|978-973-280-577-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brătescu-Voinești was friends with Antonescu, who in March 1943 granted him an interview in which he thanked Germany for supporting his efforts to rid the country of parasites and internal enemies, and pledged to continue the fight until [[Jewish Bolshevism]] was eradicated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Ancel]], "Romania: Annihilation Aborted", in Peter Hayes (ed.), ''How Was It Possible?: A Holocaust Reader'', p. 563. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2015. {{ISBN|978-080-327-491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1942 ''Originea neamului românesc și a limbii noastre'', he built on discredited pre-World War I theories of [[Nicolae Densușianu]] to claim that all [[Romance languages]] were of [[Dacian language|Dacian origin]], that the Romans were descended from Geto-Dacians, with Latin a literary form of Dacian, and that Italian, French and Spanish had "Romanian" roots.&lt;ref&gt;Tchavdar Marinov, "Ancient Thrace in the Modern Imagination: Ideological Aspects of the Construction of Thracian Studies in Southeast Europe (Romania, Greece, Bulgaria)", in Roumen Daskalov, Alexander Vezenkov (eds.), ''Entangled Histories of the Balkans'', vol. III, pp. 31–2. Leiden: Brill, 2015. {{ISBN|978-90042-9036-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his life, he engaged in a polemic against the rising [[Romanian Communist Party]]: eschewing the invective and incitement of other Romanian fascists, he adopted a feeble biologism, claiming that Marxist doctrine is contradicted by the example of wasps, bees, ants and termites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radu Ioanid]], ''The Sword of the Archangel: Fascist Ideology in Romania'', p. 101. Boulder, Colorado: East European Monographs, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0880-33189-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, ''[[Scînteia]]'' and other newspapers affiliated with the party hurled copious epithets at the aging figure, denouncing his wartime collaborationism and printed output.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Selejan, ''Trădarea intelectualilor: Reeducare și prigoană'', p. 41-2. Bucharest: Editura Cartea Românească, 2005. {{ISBN|978-973-231-618-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eino Jaakko Untamo Hallama''' (until 1934 ''Airaksinen''; 28 March 1917 [[Kuopio]] – 11 February 1996 [[Helsinki]]) was a Finnish diplomat and a longtime Ambassador of Finland to Moscow,&lt;ref name="KB"&gt;{{cite book |author=Talvitie, Heikki |title=Hallama, Jaakko (1917–1996). |url= |location= |publisher=Kansallisbiografia  |pages= |date= |isbn=}} {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs]] in the [[Lehto Cabinet|Lehto caretaker government]] between 1963 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vn.fi/tietoa-valtioneuvostosta/hallitukset/vuodesta-1917/tulokset/fi.jsp?report_id=M2&amp;selectedCriterion.ministeri_henkilo_id=14 | title=Ministerikortisto | publisher=Valtioneuvosto (Finnish Government) | accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Hallama's parents were a lawyer, Eino Arvid Airaksinen, a lawyer and a kindergarten teacher, Inga Kajsi Hallman. He spent some of his childhood and youth in [[Vyborg|Viipuri]].After divorcing his parents, Jaakko took up his mother's maiden name when he was 16 years old. He translated it from Hallman to Hallama.

He graduated from [[Kuopio Lyceum High School|Kuopio lyceum]] in 1936, studied at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1938 and graduated in Finland as a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1941. In 1960 he received a [[Envoy (title)|Special Envoy and a Plenipotentiary Minister]].&lt;ref name="facta"&gt;''Facta 2001'', osa 5, p. 438. WSOY 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuka78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="teronen"&gt;Arto Teronen ja Jouko Vuolle: ''Syntymälahjana Suomi: Itsenäisyyden lapsia'', s. 37–49. Helsinki: Kirjapaja, 2016. {{ISBN|978-952-288-249-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hallama has been employed by the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] since 1941. He served as Assistant to the Ministry from 1941 to 1943, Assistant to [[Bern]] in 1943-1945 and as a Chamber Secretary in 1945-1948.

Hallama served as Secretary of State in [[Brussels]] from 1948 to 1949 and in Washington from 1949 to 1952 and then as a Division Officer in 1952-1954 and as Counselor in [[Moscow]] 1954-1958.

He served as Director General for Political Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1959 to 1962, Secretary of State (Secretary of State) from 1962 to 1967, Ambassador to [[Moscow]] in 1967-1970 and 1974-1982 and [[Copenhagen]] (1970-1974).&lt;ref name="facta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kuka78"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/kuka/1978/0172.html ''Kuka kukin on 1978'', s. 172.] Projekt Runeberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Hallama was forced into resign at the middle of a [[Note Crisis|Note crisis]] in the fall of 1961, and his role in the settlement was later a huge controversy. Hallama first visited with Foreign Minister [[Ahti Karjalainen]] in Moscow and eventually with President [[Urho Kekkonen]] in [[Novosibirsk]].Hallama received in Novosibirsk information about the ousting of  Chancellor of Justice [[Olavi Honka]] from candidate in  [[Presidential nominee|presidential nomination]].

According to the history of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by historian Timo Soikkanen, Hallama would immediately have turned to the US Embassy in Helsinki to inform [[NATO]]   in order to receive moral support to Finland. According to Soikkanen, Hallama secured the matter from the president and the government and thus took a huge risk for his career.

Most other historians, however, have considered Soikkanen's views of Hallama's action as unfounded and imaginative. Among other things, Ilkka Pastinen, who has acted as UN ambassador to Finland, said that, on the contrary, Hallama was extremely cautious.&lt;ref name="teronen" /&gt;  
   
At about 40 years of age, Hallama became ill with [[Parkinson's disease]], which was attempted in 1963 to improve her condition at the [[Karolinska University Hospital|Karolinska Hospital]] in [[Stockholm]] by surgery by the world-famous Swedish brain surgeon [[Herbert Olivecrona]]. However, the operation did not succeed, as a result of which Hallama lost his speech almost completely. Despite his illness, Urho Kekkonen relied on his Soviet knowledge so much that he named Hallama as an important ambassador to Moscow in 1967.

After four years as an ambassador in [[Copenhagen]], Hallama returned to Moscow as Ambassador in 1974. When [[Mauno Koivisto]] became a new president in 1982, Hallama was called home from Moscow and moved from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to retire in 1983 after working for more than 40 years.&lt;ref name="teronen" /&gt;

Jaakko Hallama was married since 1947 with Anita Hallama (''née''. Weber) and had two sons. Anita Hallama became known for her long-term relationship with President Urho Kekkonen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uppslagsverket.fi/sv/sok/view-103684-HallamaJaakko |title= Hallama, Jaakko |last=|first= |date=|website=|publisher=Uppslagsverkets Finland|access-date=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="kuka78" /&gt; According to Kauko Jämsén, who has been a secretary in Moscow under the auspices of Hamaam, Kekkonen has appointed an already seriously ill Jaakko Hallama Ambassador to Moscow in 1974, specifically from Anita Hallama's will, even though the Soviet people had been told that Hallama was a less desirable person because of his unclear speech.&lt;ref name="teronen" /&gt;

'''Jaishankar Bhudhardas Bhojak''', (30 January 1889 – 22 January 1975) better known by his theatre name '''Jaishankar 'Sundari' ''', was an Indian actor and director of [[Gujarati theatre]]. Starting at the young age, he rose to fame for his roles of female impersonator in early Gujarati plays. He retired from acting in 1932 but returned to theatre direction in 1948. He directed and acted in several successful plays. He was awarded [[Padma Vibhushan]] in 1971.

==Early life==
He was born in the family of [[Bhojak]], the performing caste of [[Brahmin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People of India By Herbert Risley, William Crooke|page=457|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QA2OKK0-bdcC&amp;pg=PA457&amp;lpg=PA457&amp;dq=BHOJAK+CASTE&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jMD8mxef5i&amp;sig=EfBJAZqWCP4Ruy3f1IWUATilEfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7D_9U6WcDIeUuATGp4L4Cg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBw#v=snippet&amp;q=BHOJAK%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tribes and Castes of Bombay, Volume 1 By Reginald E.

==Language==
{{Main|Japanese language}}
The Japanese language is a [[Japonic languages|Japonic language]] that is related to the [[Ryukyuan languages]] and was treated as a [[language isolate]] in the past. The earliest attested form of the language, [[Old Japanese]], dates to the 8th century. [[Japanese phonology]] is characterized by a relatively small number of [[Vowels|vowel phonemes]], frequent [[gemination]], and a distinctive [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch accent]] system. The modern Japanese language has a tripartite [[Japanese writing system|writing system]] using [[hiragana]], [[katakana]], and [[kanji]]. The language includes native Japanese words and a large number of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|words derived from the Chinese language]]. In Japan the adult literacy rate in the Japanese language exceeds 99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html#People|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of [[Japanese dialects]] are spoken in regions of Japan.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Japan}}
[[File:Ōmiya_Hachiman_Shrine_Mikoshi.JPG|thumb|left|A Shinto festival in [[Hyōgo Prefecture]]]]
Japanese religion has traditionally been [[syncretic]] in nature, combining elements of [[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] ([[Shinbutsu-shūgō]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://k-amc.kokugakuin.ac.jp/DM/detail.do?class_name=col_eos&amp;data_id=23041|website=Kokugakuin University Encyclopedia of Shinto|title=Shinto and Buddhism|author=Satō Makoto|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shinto, a [[polytheistic]] religion with no book of religious canon, is Japan's native religion. Shinto was one of the traditional grounds for the right to the throne of the Japanese imperial family, and was codified as the state religion in 1868 ([[State Shinto]]), but was abolished by the [[Occupation of Japan|American occupation]] in 1945. [[Mahayana Buddhism]] came to Japan in the sixth century and evolved into many different sects. Today, the largest form of Buddhism among Japanese people is the [[Jōdo Shinshū]] sect founded by [[Shinran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00401101&amp;kikan=00401&amp;tstat=000001018471&amp;cycle=0&amp;tclass1=000001111515&amp;stat_infid=000031662957|title=宗教統計調査 / 平成２９年度 (Japanese government statistics on total religious followers for 2017)|website=e-stat.go.jp|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{Main|Japanese literature}}
[[File:Momotaro2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|[[Bisque doll]] of [[Momotarō]],&lt;br/&gt;a character from [[Japanese literature]] and [[Japanese folklore|folklore]]]]
Certain genres of writing originated in and are often associated with Japanese society. These include the [[haiku]], [[Waka (poetry)|tanka]], and [[I Novel]], although modern writers generally avoid these writing styles. Historically, many works have sought to capture or codify traditional Japanese cultural values and aesthetics. Some of the most famous of these include [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (1021), about [[Heian period|Heian]] court culture; [[Miyamoto Musashi]]'s ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'' (1645), concerning military strategy; [[Matsuo Bashō]]'s ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (1691), a [[Travel literature|travelogue]]; and [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]]'s essay "[[In Praise of Shadows]]" (1933), which contrasts Eastern and Western cultures.

Following the [[Black Ships|opening of Japan]] to the West in 1854, some works of this style were written in English by natives of Japan; they include ''[[Bushido: The Soul of Japan]]'' by [[Nitobe Inazō]] (1900), concerning ''[[samurai]]'' ethics, and ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' by [[Okakura Kakuzō]] (1906), which deals with the philosophical implications of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]. Western observers have often attempted to evaluate Japanese society as well, to varying degrees of success; one of the most well-known and controversial works resulting from this is [[Ruth Benedict]]'s ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' (1946).

Twentieth-century Japanese writers recorded changes in Japanese society through their works. Some of the most notable authors included [[Natsume Sōseki]], [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]], [[Osamu Dazai]], [[Fumiko Enchi]], [[Akiko Yosano]], [[Yukio Mishima]], and [[Ryōtarō Shiba]]. Popular contemporary authors such as [[Ryū Murakami]], [[Haruki Murakami]], and [[Banana Yoshimoto]] have been translated into many languages and enjoy international followings, and [[Yasunari Kawabata]] and [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

==Arts==
{{Main|Japanese art|Japanese architecture}}
[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|The print ''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning|Red Fuji]]'' from [[Hokusai|Katsushika Hokusai]]'s series, ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'']]
Decorative arts in Japan date back to prehistoric times. [[Jōmon pottery]] includes examples with elaborate ornamentation. In the [[Yayoi period]], artisans produced mirrors, spears, and ceremonial bells known as ''[[dōtaku]].'' Later burial mounds, or ''[[kofun]],'' preserve characteristic clay ''[[haniwa]],'' as well as wall paintings.

Beginning in the [[Nara period]], painting, [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]] flourished under strong Confucian and Buddhist influences from [[Japanese missions to Tang China|China]]. Among the architectural achievements of this period are the [[Hōryū-ji]] and the [[Yakushi-ji]], two [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples in [[Nara Prefecture]]. After the cessation of official relations with the [[Tang dynasty]] in the ninth century, Japanese art and architecture gradually became less influenced by China. Extravagant art and clothing was commissioned by nobles to decorate their court, and although the aristocracy was quite limited in size and power, many of these pieces are still extant. After the [[Tōdai-ji]] was attacked and burned during the [[Genpei War]], a special office of restoration was founded, and the Tōdai-ji became an important artistic center. The leading masters of the time were [[Unkei]] and [[Kaikei]].

Painting advanced in the [[Muromachi period]] in the form of [[ink wash painting]] under the influence of [[Zen Buddhism]] as practiced by such masters as [[Sesshū Tōyō]]. Zen Buddhist tenets were also elaborated into the [[tea ceremony]] during the [[Sengoku period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the polychrome painting screens of the [[Kanō school]] were made influential thanks to their powerful patrons (including the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawas]]). Popular artists created ''[[ukiyo-e]]'', woodblock prints for sale to commoners in the flourishing cities. Pottery such as [[Imari ware]] was highly valued as far away as Europe.

In theater, [[Noh]] is a traditional, spare dramatic form that developed in tandem with [[kyōgen]] farce. In stark contrast to the restrained refinement of noh, [[kabuki]], an "explosion of color", uses every possible stage trick for dramatic effect. Plays include sensational events such as suicides, and many such works were performed in both kabuki and [[bunraku]] puppet theaters.

Since the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan has absorbed elements of Western culture and has given them a "Japanese" feel or modification into it. Its modern decorative, practical and performing arts works span a spectrum ranging from the traditions of Japan to purely Western modes. Products of popular culture, including [[J-pop]], [[Japanese rock|J-rock]], [[manga]] and [[anime]] have found audiences and fans around the world.

In the 18th century, [[Arai Hakuseki]] suggested that the ancient [[stone tool]]s in Japan were left behind by the [[Mishihase|Shukushin]]. Later, [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] argued that the [[Ainu people]] were [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to northern Japan.&lt;ref name="tokyo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.um.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publish_db/2000dm2k/english/02/02-02.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927190954/http://www.um.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publish_db/2000dm2k/english/02/02-02.html|archivedate=2011-09-27|title=Archaeological Research of the Jomon Period in the 21st Century|first=Keiji|last=Imamura|publisher=The University Museum, The University of Tokyo|year=2000|accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iha Fuyū]] suggested that Japanese and [[Ryukyuan people]] have the same ethnic origin, based on his 1906 research on the [[Ryukyuan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-165373-storytopic-1.html |script-title=ja:伊波普猷の卒論発見　思想骨格 鮮明に |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Ryūkyū Shimpō]] |date=July 25, 2010 |accessdate=March 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722123804/http://ryukyushimpo.jp/news/storyid-165373-storytopic-1.html |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Taishō period]], [[Torii Ryūzō]] claimed that [[Yamato people]] used Yayoi pottery and Ainu used Jōmon pottery.&lt;ref name="tokyo" /&gt;

After [[World War II]], Kotondo Hasebe and Hisashi Suzuki claimed that the origin of Japanese people was not newcomers in the [[Yayoi period]] (300 BCE – 300 CE) but the people in the [[Jōmon period]].&lt;ref name="postcolonical"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Arnaud|last=Nanta|year=2008|title=Physical Anthropology and the Reconstruction of Japanese Identity in Postcolonial Japan|journal=[[Social Science Japan Journal]]|volume=11|issue=1|pages=29–47|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|doi=10.1093/ssjj/jyn019|url=http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/1/29.full|accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kazuro Hanihara announced a new [[racial admixture]] theory in 1984&lt;ref name="postcolonical" /&gt; and a "dual structure model" in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanihara | first1 = K | year = 1991 | title = Dual structure model for the population history of the Japanese | url = | journal = Japan Review | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hanihara, modern Japanese lineages began with [[Jōmon people]], who moved into the [[Japanese archipelago]] during [[Paleolithic]] times from their homeland in [[southeast Asia]], followed by a second wave of immigration, from [[northeast Asia]] to Japan during the Yayoi period. Following a population expansion in [[Neolithic]] times, these newcomers then found their way to the Japanese archipelago sometime during the Yayoi period. As a result, admixture was common in the island regions of [[Kyūshū]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Honshū]], but did not prevail in the outlying islands of [[Okinawa]] and [[Hokkaidō]], and the Ryukyuan and Ainu people continued to dominate there. [[Mark J. Hudson]] claims that the main ethnic image of Japanese people was biologically and linguistically formed from 400 BCE to 1,200 CE.&lt;ref name="postcolonical" /&gt; Currently, the most well-regarded theory is that present-day Japanese are descendants of both the indigenous Jōmon people and the immigrant Yayoi people.

===Jōmon people===
Some of the world's oldest known [[pottery]] pieces were developed by the [[Jōmon people]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, dating back as far as 16,000 years. The name "Jōmon" (縄文 ''Jōmon'') means "cord-impressed pattern", and comes from the characteristic markings found on the pottery. The Jōmon people were [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers, though at least one middle to late Jōmon site ({{nihongo|Minami Mizote|南溝手}}, ca. 1200–1000 BC) had a primitive rice-growing [[agriculture]]. They relied primarily on fish for protein. 

Some, including anthropologist Joseph Powell, believe that the Jōmon migrated from [[South Asia]] or [[Southeast Asia]] and became the Ainu of today.&lt;ref name="NPS Chapter 2"&gt;Powell, Joseph F.; Rose, Jerome C. Chapter 2 [http://www.nps.gov/archeology/kennewick/powell_rose.htm Report on the Osteological Assessment of the Kennewick Man Skeleton] (CENWW.97.Kennewick). Retrieved September 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A research, analysing the autosomal DNA of several Jomon bones, suggest an origin of the Jomon people in [[Siberia]] or northeastern [[Central Asia]] near [[lake Baikal]].&lt;ref&gt;Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama, Kirill Kryukov, Timothy A Jinam, Kazuyoshi Hosomichi, Aiko Saso: . In: . Band 62, Nr. 2, 1. September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers suggests that the Ainu retain a certain degree of uniqueness in their genetic make-up, while having some affinities with other regional populations in Japan as well as with the [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]] of the [[Russian Far East]].

[[Mark J. Hudson]] posits that Japan was settled by a Paleo-Mongoloid population in the [[Pleistocene]] who became the Jōmon, and that their features can be seen in the Ainu and [[Ryukyuan people]].&lt;ref name="hudson"&gt;Hudson, M.J. (1999) ''Ruins of Identity: Ethnogenesis in the Japanese Islands. Honolulu: University of Hawai`i Press''&lt;/ref&gt; The Jōmon shared some physical characteristics, such as relatively abundant [[Androgenic hair|body hair]] and light skin, with [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]], but anthropological genetics shows them to derive from a separate genetic lineage from that of Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Koppel, Tom (2005) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pp8xRFlDciAC&amp;pg=PT389&amp;dq=Jomon+caucasian+separate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZBhGT5qSItLv8QPumPSxDg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jomon%20caucasian%20separate&amp;f=false Lost World: Rewriting Prehistory — How New Science Is Tracing America's Ice Age Mariners]''.

===Yayoi people===
Beginning around 300 BC, the [[Yayoi people]] entered the Japanese islands and displaced or intermingled with the Jōmon. The Yayoi brought [[Paddy field|wet-rice farming]] and advanced [[bronze]] and [[iron]] technology to Japan. The more productive [[paddy field]] systems allowed the communities to support larger populations and spread over time, in turn becoming the basis for more advanced [[institution]]s and heralding the new [[civilization]] of the succeeding [[Kofun period]].

The estimated population of Japan in the late Jōmon period was about one hundred thousand, compared to about three million by the [[Nara period]]. Taking the growth rates of hunting and agricultural societies into account, it is calculated that about one and half million immigrants moved to Japan in the period.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Colonialism==

[[File:Map of Empire of Japan.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Location of Imperial Japan]]

During the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese colonial period]] of 1895 to 1945, the phrase "Japanese people" was used to refer not only to residents of the Japanese archipelago, but also to people from colonies who held Japanese [[citizenship]], such as [[Taiwanese people]] and [[Koreans|Korean people]]. The official term used to refer to ethnic Japanese during this period was {{nihongo|"inland people"|内地人|naichijin}}. Such linguistic distinctions facilitated forced [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of colonized ethnic identities into a single Imperial Japanese identity.&lt;ref name="Tai"&gt;{{cite journal|volume= 36|date=September 2004|pages=355–382|doi=10.1080/1467271042000241586|title=Korean Japanese|author=Eika Tai|publisher=Routledge|journal=Critical Asian Studies|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of World War II, many [[Nivkh people]] and [[Orok people]] from southern [[Sakhalin]], who held Japanese citizenship in [[Karafuto Prefecture]], were forced to repatriate to [[Hokkaidō]] by the [[Soviet Union]] as a part of Japanese people. On the other hand, many [[Sakhalin Koreans]] who had held Japanese citizenship until the end of the war were left stateless by the Soviet occupation.&lt;ref name="Lankov1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|authorlink=Andrei Lankov|publisher=[[The Korea Times]]|date=January 5, 2006|accessdate=November 26, 2006|title=Stateless in Sakhalin|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200601/kt2006010516434554130.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221144952/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200601/kt2006010516434554130.htm|archivedate=2006-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship==
[[File:Shopping area in Ikebukuro, May 2017.jpg|thumb|Japanese people in [[Shibuya]], Tokyo]]
Article 10 of the [[Constitution of Japan]] defines the term "Japanese" based upon Japanese nationality.&lt;ref&gt;[日本国憲法]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "ethnic groups" in Japanese census statistics differs from the concept applied in many other countries. For example, the [[United Kingdom Census]] queries the respondent's "ethnic or racial background", regardless of nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D6588.xls |title=United Kingdom population by ethnic group |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=2001-04-01 |work=[[United Kingdom Census 2001]] |accessdate=2009-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107100221/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D6588.xls |archivedate=January 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese Statistics Bureau, however, asks only about nationality in the census. Because the census equates nationality with ethnicity, its figures erroneously assume that naturalized Japanese citizens and Japanese nationals with multi-ethnic backgrounds are ethnically Japanese.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} [[John Lie (professor)|John Lie]], [[Eiji Oguma]], and other scholars problematize the widespread belief that Japan is ethnically homogeneous, arguing that it is more accurate to describe Japan as a multiethnic society,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lie (professor)|John Lie]] ''Multiethnic Japan'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Oguma Eiji]], ''A Genealogy of 'Japanese' Self-images'' (Melbourne: Trans Pacific Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; although such claims have long been rejected by conservative elements of Japanese society such as former Japanese Prime Minister [[Tarō Asō]], who once described Japan as being a nation of "one race, one civilization, one language and one culture".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2005/10/18/national/aso-says-japan-is-nation-of-one-race/ Aso says Japan is nation of 'one race']".

The term {{nihongo|''nikkeijin''|日系人}} is used to refer to Japanese people who emigrated from Japan and their descendants.

Emigration from Japan was recorded as early as the 12th century to the [[Philippines]] and [[Borneo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacificuniverse.com/pkm/tech.htm|title=Hotels in Philippines - Booked.net|website=Booked.net|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of traders from Japan also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-I6owJcCOdwC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Racial+intimacy+in+Japan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KQVvUv6bK_Td4APn14DoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Racial%20intimacy%20in%20Japan&amp;f=false|title=Interracial Intimacy in Japan|website=Google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.&amp;nbsp;52–3}} However, migration of Japanese people did not become a mass phenomenon until the [[Meiji era]], when Japanese people began to go to [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]], [[Canada]], and [[Peru]]. There was also significant emigration to the territories of the [[Empire of Japan]] during the colonial period, but most of these emigrants and settlers [[repatriate]]d to Japan after the [[end of World War II in Asia]].&lt;ref name="Lankov2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200603/kt2006032318091354130.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619173835/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200603/kt2006032318091354130.htm|archivedate=2006-06-19|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|accessdate=December 18, 2006|date=March 23, 2006|title=The Dawn of Modern Korea (360): Settling Down|publisher=The Korea Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Association of Nikkei and Japanese Abroad, there are about 2.5 million ''nikkeijin'' living in their adopted countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1173">'''Joaquín Setantí''' (c. 1540-1617) was an important figure in the municipality of [[Barcelona]] at the beginning of the seventeenth century. He contributed several monographs to the movement known as [[tacitism]] including ''Frutos de historia'' (1590).  His collection of moral aphorisms, ''Centellas de varios conceptos'' (1614), stands out, due to its originality. Setantí was a precursor of [[Baltasar Gracián]] and of the other great cultivators of aphorisms during the [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Spanish Baroque]]. His 500 dense ''Centellas'' (sparks) are said to "reveal a modern political and personal attitude that marks an important milestone in Spanish sententious literature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiolum.com/en/mediocentell.htm Modern edition of the ''Centellas'' edited by Emilio Blanco]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Anthony Parsons''' (20 February 1938 – 26 April 2004) was a British sports journalist and author.

== Life ==
John was born the son of Les Parsons and his wife Marion in [[Oxford]] on February 20, 1938. His father had been president of the [[Lawn Tennis Association]] for the Oxford area.

As a schoolboy at [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]], Parsons was a member of the tennis team. At the age of 14, he began writing football match reports for the [[Oxford Mail]]. After leaving school in 1956, he took a job as a reporter on general topics at the paper. In 1964 he moved to the [[Daily Mail]].

In January 1981, Parsons came to the [[Daily Telegraph]] and succeeded [[Lance Tingay]] as tennis correspondent. In 2001, he retired from full-time work but continued to cover major events for the paper. Beside his journalistic work, he published numerous books including ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Tennis'' (1998) and the ''Official Wimbledon Annual'' every year.

Parsons was born with only one functioning [[kidney]]. He received a kidney transplant in 1982 after his only kidney had been injured by a soldier during a military coup in [[Nigeria]] in 1975. While reporting from the [[2004 NASDAQ-100 Open|NASDAQ-100 Open]] at [[Miami]] in March 2004, he suffered an [[Acute kidney injury|acute kidney failure]] and was brought to [[Mercy Hospital (Miami)|Mercy Hospital]]. He died there a month later. He was unmarried and survived by his parents and his sister Heather Nason.

'''John Dalton''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɔː|l|t|ən}}; 6 September 1766 – 27 July 1844) was an English [[chemist]], [[physicist]], and [[meteorologist]]. He is best known for introducing the [[atomic theory]] into chemistry, and for his research into [[Color blindness|colour blindness]], sometimes referred to as Daltonism in his honour.

==Early life==

John Dalton was born into a [[Quaker]] family in [[Eaglesfield, Cumbria|Eaglesfield]], near [[Cockermouth]], in [[Cumberland]], England.&lt;ref name="CHF"/&gt; His father was a weaver. He received his early education from his father and from Quaker John Fletcher, who ran a private school in the nearby village of [[Pardshaw Young Friends' Centre|Pardshaw Hall]]. Dalton's family was too poor to support him for long and he began to earn his living at the age of ten in the service of a wealthy local Quaker, Elihu Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cockermouth.org.uk/dms-showpage.php?tid=606|title=Pardshaw – Quaker Meeting House|publisher=|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said he began teaching at a local school at age 12 and became proficient in Latin at age 14.

==Early career==
When he was 15, Dalton joined his older brother Jonathan in running a Quaker school in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]], about {{convert|45|mi}} from his home. Around the age of 23 Dalton may have considered studying law or medicine, but his relatives did not encourage him, perhaps because being a [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]], he was barred from attending English universities. He acquired much scientific knowledge from informal instruction by [[John Gough (natural philosopher)|John Gough]], a blind philosopher who was gifted in the sciences and arts. At the age of 27 he was appointed teacher of mathematics and [[natural philosophy]] at the "New College" in [[Manchester]], a [[dissenting academy]] (the lineal predecessor, following a number of changes of location, of [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford]]). He remained there until the age of 34, when the college's worsening financial situation led him to resign his post and begin a new career as a private tutor in mathematics and natural philosophy.

==Scientific contributions==

===Meteorology===
Dalton's early life was influenced by a prominent Eaglesfield Quaker, Elihu Robinson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=53552|title=Robinson, Elihu|first=Peter|last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; a competent [[meteorology|meteorologist]] and instrument maker, who interested him in problems of mathematics and meteorology. During his years in Kendal, Dalton contributed solutions to problems and answered questions on various subjects in ''[[The Ladies' Diary]]'' and the ''[[Gentleman's Diary]]''. In 1787 at age 21 he began his meteorological diary in which, during the succeeding 57 years, he entered more than 200,000 observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = R. Angus | title = Memoir of John Dalton and History of the Atomic Theory | publisher=H. Bailliere | location = London | year = 1856 | page = 279 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZOsAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP17&amp;dq=angus+smith+john+dalton | accessdate =24 December 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4021-6437-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rediscovered [[George Hadley]]'s theory of atmospheric circulation (now known as the [[Hadley cell]]) around this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/251166/George-Hadley George Hadley] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Accessed 30 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 Dalton's first publication, ''Meteorological Observations and Essays'', contained the seeds of several of his later discoveries but despite the originality of his treatment, little attention was paid to them by other scholars. A second work by Dalton, ''Elements of English Grammar'', was published in 1801.

====Measuring mountains====
After leaving the [[Lake District]], Dalton returned annually to spend his holidays studying meteorology, something which involved a lot of hill-walking. Until the advent of aeroplanes and weather balloons, the only way to make measurements of temperature and humidity at altitude was to climb a mountain. Dalton estimated the height using a [[barometer]]. The [[Ordnance Survey]] did not publish maps for the Lake District until the 1860s. Before then, Dalton was one of the few authorities on the heights of the region's mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/thelakes/html/West/WS21P190.htm |title=Thomas West's Guide to the Lakes, 1778/1821 |publisher= |accessdate=18 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125161603/http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/thelakes/html/West/WS21P190.htm |archivedate=25 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was often accompanied by Jonathan Otley, who also made a study of the heights of the local peaks, using Dalton's figures as a comparison to check his work. Otley published his information in his map of 1818. Otley became both an assistant and a friend to Dalton.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fletcher Smith ''Jonathan Otley, Man of Lakeland'', publ. Bookcase, 2007ISBN 978-1-904147-23-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour blindness===
In 1794, shortly after his arrival in Manchester, Dalton was elected a member of the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]], the "Lit &amp; Phil", and a few weeks later he communicated his first paper on "Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours", in which he postulated that shortage in colour perception was caused by discoloration of the liquid medium of the eyeball. As both he and his brother were [[Color blindness|colour blind]], he recognised that the condition must be hereditary.&lt;ref name="daltoncb"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Life and work of John Dalton – Colour Blindness |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/03/sci_nat_the_life_and_work_of_john_dalton_(1766_1844)/html/4.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Dalton's theory lost credence in his lifetime, the thorough and methodical nature of his research into his visual problem was so broadly recognised that Daltonism became a common term for colour blindness.{{efn |Dalton believed that his vitreous humour possessed an abnormal blue tint, causing his anomalous colour perception, and he gave instructions for his eyes to be examined on his death, to test this hypothesis. His wishes were duly carried out, but no blue colouration was found, and Dalton's hypothesis was refuted. The shrivelled remains of one eye have survived to this day, and now belong to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjo.82.2.203d |title=John Dalton's Colour Vision Legacy |journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=203d |year=1998 |last1=Regan |first1=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Examination of his preserved eyeball in 1995 demonstrated that Dalton had a less common kind of colour blindness, [[deuteranopia|deuteroanopia]], in which medium wavelength sensitive cones are missing (rather than functioning with a mutated form of pigment, as in the most common type of colour blindness, [[deuteranomaly|deuteroanomaly]]).&lt;ref name="daltoncb"/&gt; Besides the blue and purple of the optical spectrum he was only able to recognise one colour, yellow, or, as he said in a paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dalton |first=John |title=Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours: with observations |journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |year=1798 |volume=5 |pages=28–45 |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011812155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|That part of the image which others call red, appears to me little more than a shade, or defect of light; after that the orange, yellow and green seem one colour, which descends pretty uniformly from an intense to a rare yellow, making what I should call different shades of yellow.}}

===Gas laws===

In 1800, Dalton became secretary of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and in the following year he presented an important series of lectures, entitled "Experimental Essays" on the constitution of mixed gases; the [[pressure (physics)|pressure]] of steam and other [[vapour]]s at different temperatures in a [[vacuum]] and in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]; on [[evaporation]]; and on the [[thermal expansion]] of gases. The four essays, presented between 2 and 30 October 1801, were published in the ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester'' in 1802.

The second essay opens with the remark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dalton |first=John |title=Essay II. On the Force of Steam or Vapour from Water and Various other Liquids, both is a Vacuum and in Air |journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |series=2nd |year=1802|volume= 5 |pages=550–551 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qdJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA550#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There can scarcely be a doubt entertained respecting the reducibility of all elastic fluids of whatever kind, into liquids; and we ought not to despair of effecting it in [[cryogenics|low temperatures]] and by strong pressures exerted upon the unmixed gases further.}}

After describing experiments to ascertain the pressure of steam at various points between 0 and 100&amp;nbsp;°C (32 and 212&amp;nbsp;°F), Dalton concluded from observations of the [[vapour pressure]] of six different liquids, that the variation of vapour pressure for all liquids is equivalent, for the same variation of temperature, reckoning from vapour of any given pressure.

In the fourth essay he remarks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qdJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA600#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Dalton |first=John |title=Essay IV. On the Expansion of Elastic Fluids by Heat |journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |series=2nd |year=1802 |volume= 5 |page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I see no sufficient reason why we may not conclude, that all elastic fluids under the same pressure expand equally by heat—and that for any given expansion of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], the corresponding expansion of air is proportionally something less, the higher the temperature. ... It seems, therefore, that general laws respecting the absolute quantity and the nature of heat, are more likely to be derived from elastic fluids than from other substances.}}

He enunciated [[Gay-Lussac's law]], published in 1802 by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] (Gay-Lussac credited the discovery to unpublished work from the 1780s by [[Jacques Charles]]). In the two or three years following the lectures, Dalton published several papers on similar topics. "On the Absorption of Gases by Water and other Liquids" (read on 21 October 1803, published until 1805)&lt;ref name=Dalton1805&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Pg5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA271#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Dalton |first=John |title=On the Absorption of Gases by Water and other Liquids |journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |series=2nd |year=1805 |volume= 6 |pages=271–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained his law of partial pressures now known as [[Dalton's law]].

===Atomic theory===
The most important of all Dalton's investigations are concerned with the [[atomic theory]] in chemistry. While his name is inseparably associated with this theory, the origin of Dalton's atomic theory is not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/350077 |title=The Origin of Dalton's Chemical Atomic Theory: Daltonian Doubts Resolved |journal=Isis |volume=57 |pages=35–55 |year=1966 |last1=Thackray |first1=Arnold W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory may have been suggested to him either by researches on [[ethylene]] (''olefiant gas'') and [[methane]] (''carburetted hydrogen'') or by analysis of [[nitrous oxide]] (''protoxide of azote'') and [[nitrogen dioxide]] (''deutoxide of azote''), both views resting on the authority of [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomson |first1=Thomas |title=The Elements of Chemistry |date=1810 |publisher=J. &amp; A.Y.

From 1814 to 1819, Irish chemist [[William Higgins (chemist)|William Higgins]] claimed that Dalton had plagiarised his ideas, but Higgins' theory did not address relative atomic mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The life and work of William Higgins, chemist, 1763-1825 including reprints of "A comparative view of the phlogistic and antiphlogistic theories" and "Observations on the atomic theory and electrical phenomena" by William Higgins|last=Wheeler, T.

I.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent evidence suggests that Dalton's development of thought may have been influenced by the ideas of another Irish chemist [[Bryan Higgins]], who was William's uncle. Bryan believed that an atom was a heavy central particle surrounded by an atmosphere of [[Caloric theory|caloric]], the supposed substance of heat at the time. The size of the atom was determined by the diameter of the caloric atmosphere. Based on the evidence, Dalton was aware of Bryan's theory and adopted very similar ideas and language, but he never acknowledged Bryan's anticipation of his caloric model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2014.0025 |title=John Dalton and the London atomists: William and Bryan Higgins, William Austin, and new Daltonian doubts about the origin of the atomic theory |journal=Notes and Records: The Royal Society Journal of the History of Science |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=339–356 |year=2014 |last1=Grossman |first1=M.

A study of Dalton's laboratory notebooks, discovered in the rooms of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society,{{sfn|Roscoe|Harden|1896}} concluded that so far from Dalton being led by his search for an explanation of the [[law of multiple proportions]] to the idea that chemical combination consists in the interaction of atoms of definite and characteristic weight, the idea of atoms arose in his mind as a purely physical concept, forced on him by study of the physical properties of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and other gases. The first published indications of this idea are to be found at the end of his paper "On the Absorption of Gases by Water and other Liquids"&lt;ref name=Dalton1805/&gt; already mentioned. There he says:

{{quote|Why does not water admit its bulk of every kind of gas alike? This question I have duly considered, and though I am not able to satisfy myself completely I am nearly persuaded that the circumstance depends on the weight and number of the ultimate particles of the several gases.}}

The main points of Dalton's atomic theory are:
# Elements are made of extremely small particles called [[atom]]s.
# Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass and other properties; atoms of different elements differ in size, mass and other properties.
# Atoms cannot be subdivided, created or destroyed.
# Atoms of different elements combine in simple whole-number ratios to form [[chemical compounds]].
# In [[chemical reactions]], atoms are combined, separated or rearranged.

Dalton proposed an additional controversial "rule of greatest simplicity" that could not be independently confirmed.

:When atoms combine in only one ratio, "..it must be presumed to be a binary one, unless some cause appear to the contrary".

For elements that combined in multiple ratios, their combinations were assumed to be the simplest ones possible. Two combinations resulted in a binary and a ternary compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transforming Matter: A History of Chemistry from Alchemy to the Buckyball|last = Levere|first = Trevor|publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-8018-6610-4|location = Baltimore, Maryland|pages = 84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was merely an assumption, derived from faith in the simplicity of nature. No evidence was then available to scientists to deduce how many atoms of each element combine to form compound molecules. But this or some other such rule was absolutely necessary to any incipient theory, since one needed an assumed molecular formula in order to calculate relative atomic weights. Dalton's "rule of greatest simplicity" caused him to assume that the formula for water was OH and [[ammonia]] was NH, quite different from our modern understanding (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Despite the uncertainty at the heart of Dalton's atomic theory, the principles of the theory survived.

===Atomic weights===
[[Image:A New System of Chemical Philosophy fp.jpg|right|thumb|Various atoms and [[molecule]]s as depicted in John Dalton's ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'' (1808).]]
Dalton published his table of relative [[atomic weight]]s containing six elements, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur and phosphorus, with the atom of hydrogen conventionally assumed to weigh 1. Dalton provided no indication in this paper how he had arrived at these numbers{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} but in his laboratory notebook, dated 6 September 1803,{{sfn|Roscoe|Harden|1896|page=83}} is a list in which he set out the relative weights of the atoms of a number of elements, derived from analysis of water, ammonia, [[carbon dioxide]], etc. by chemists of the time.

The extension of this idea to substances in general necessarily led him to the [[law of multiple proportions]], and the comparison with experiment brilliantly confirmed his deduction.{{sfn|Roscoe|Harden|1896|pages=50–51}} In the paper "On the Proportion of the Several Gases in the Atmosphere", read by him in November 1802, the law of multiple proportions appears to be anticipated in the words:

{{quote|The elements of oxygen may combine with a certain portion of nitrous gas or with twice that portion, but with no intermediate quantity.}}

But there is reason to suspect that this sentence may have been added some time after the reading of the paper, which was not published until 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dalton |first=John |title=On the Proportion of the Several Gases in the Atmosphere |journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |series=2nd |year=1805 |volume= 6 |pages=244–258 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Pg5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds were listed as binary, ternary, quaternary, etc. (molecules composed of two, three, four, etc. atoms) in the ''New System of Chemical Philosophy'' depending on the number of atoms a compound had in its simplest, empirical form.

Dalton hypothesised the structure of compounds can be represented in whole number ratios. So, one atom of element X combining with one atom of element Y is a binary compound. Furthermore, one atom of element X combining with two atoms of element Y or vice versa, is a ternary compound.  Many of the first compounds listed in the ''New System of Chemical Philosophy'' correspond to modern views, although many others do not.

Dalton used his own symbols to visually represent the atomic structure of compounds. They were depicted in the ''New System of Chemical Philosophy'', where he listed 20 elements and 17 simple molecules.

===Other investigations===
Dalton published papers on such diverse topics as rain and dew and the origin of springs (hydrosphere); on heat, the colour of the sky, steam and the [[Specular reflection|reflection]] and [[refraction]] of light; and on the grammatical subjects of the [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[participle]]s of the English language.

===Experimental approach===
As an investigator, Dalton was often content with rough and [[accuracy and precision|inaccurate]] instruments, even though better ones were obtainable. Sir [[Humphry Davy]] described him as "a very coarse experimenter", who almost always found the results he required, trusting to his head rather than his hands. On the other hand, historians who have replicated some of his crucial experiments have confirmed Dalton's skill and precision.

In the preface to the second part of Volume I of his ''New System'', he says he had so often been misled by taking for granted the results of others that he determined to write "as little as possible but what I can attest by my own experience", but this independence he carried so far that it sometimes resembled lack of receptivity. Thus he distrusted, and probably never fully accepted, [[Gay-Lussac]]'s conclusions as to the combining volumes of gases.

He held unconventional views on [[chlorine]]. Even after its elementary character had been settled by Davy, he persisted in using the atomic weights he himself had adopted, even when they had been superseded by the more accurate determinations of other chemists.

He always objected to the chemical notation devised by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], although most thought that it was much simpler and more convenient than his own cumbersome system of circular symbols.

==Other publications==
For ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' Dalton contributed articles on Chemistry and Meteorology, but the topics are not known.

He contributed 117 ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester'' from 1817 until his death in 1844 while president of that organisation. Of these the earlier are the most important. In one of them, read in 1814, he explains the principles of [[volumetric analysis]], in which he was one of the earliest researchers. In 1840 a paper on [[phosphate]]s and [[arsenic|arsenate]]s, often regarded as a weaker work, was refused by the [[Royal Society]], and he was so incensed that he published it himself. He took the same course soon afterwards with four other papers, two of which ("On the quantity of [[acid]]s, [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s and salts in different varieties of salts" and "On a new and easy method of analysing sugar") contain his discovery, regarded by him as second in importance only to atomic theory, that certain [[anhydrate]]s, when dissolved in water, cause no increase in its volume, his inference being that the salt enters into the pores of the water.

==Public life==
Even before he had propounded the atomic theory, Dalton had attained a considerable scientific reputation. In 1803, he was chosen to give a series of lectures on natural philosophy at the [[Royal Institution]] in London, and he delivered another series of lectures there in 1809–1810. Some witnesses reported that he was deficient in the qualities that make an attractive lecturer, being harsh and indistinct in voice, ineffective in the treatment of his subject, and singularly wanting in the language and power of illustration.

In 1810, Sir Humphry Davy asked him to offer himself as a candidate for the [[fellowship of the Royal Society]], but Dalton declined, possibly for financial reasons. In 1822 he was proposed without his knowledge, and on election paid the usual fee. Six years previously he had been made a corresponding member of the French [[Académie des Sciences]], and in 1830 he was elected as one of its eight foreign associates in place of Davy. In 1833, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]'s government conferred on him a pension of [[GBP|£]]150, raised in 1836 to £300. Dalton was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1834.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter D|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterD.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A young [[James Prescott Joule]], who later studied and published (1843) on the nature of heat and its relationship to mechanical work, was a pupil of Dalton in his last years.

==Personal life==
[[File:John Dalton by Thomas Phillips, 1835.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dalton in later life by [[Thomas Phillips]], [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] (1835).]]
Dalton never married and had only a few close friends. As a Quaker, he lived a modest and unassuming personal life.&lt;ref name="CHF"&gt;{{Cite web |title=John Dalton |website=Science History Institute |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/john-dalton |access-date=20 March 2018|date=June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 26 years prior to his death, Dalton lived in a room in the home of the Rev W. Johns, a published botanist, and his wife, in George Street, Manchester. Dalton and Johns died in the same year (1844).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Robert Angus|title=Memoir of John Dalton and History of the Atomic Theory up to his time|journal=Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester|date=1856|volume=13|pages=298|series=Second|language=English|format=hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalton's daily round of laboratory work and [[tutoring]] in Manchester was broken only by annual excursions to the Lake District and occasional visits to London. In 1822 he paid a short visit to [[Paris]], where he met many distinguished resident men of science. He attended several of the earlier meetings of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] at [[York]], [[Oxford]], [[Dublin]] and [[Bristol]].

==Disability and death==
Dalton suffered a minor stroke in 1837, and a second in 1838 left him with a speech impairment, although he remained able to perform experiments. In May 1844 he had another stroke; on 26 July 1844 he recorded with trembling hand his last meteorological observation. On 27 July 1844, in Manchester, Dalton fell from his bed and was found lifeless by his attendant.

Dalton was accorded a civic funeral with full honours. His body lay in state in [[Manchester Town Hall]] for four days and more than 40,000 people filed past his coffin. The funeral procession included representatives of the city's major civic, commercial, and scientific bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |title=Dalton, John |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/chemistry-biographies/john-dalton |access-date=August 8, 2017 |year=2008 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcbio"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Science celebrates 'father of nanotech' |last=King |first=Kristine |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3178890.stm |work=BBC News |date=10 October 2003 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Manchester in [[Ardwick cemetery]].

'''Julio Nalundasan''' (July 21, 1894 – 20 September 1935, [[Batac, Ilocos Norte]]) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] politician who was one of the political rivals of [[Ilocos Norte]] politician [[Mariano Marcos]], father of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] (who later became the tenth [[President of the Philippines]]).

Nalundasan was killed by a sniper at his home in 1935, the day after beating Marcos for the second time in elections for the office of representative for the second district of Ilocos Norte. Mariano Marcos' son, Ferdinand, and brother-in-law, Quirino Lizardo, were later convicted for the murder. However, the conviction was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], through a decision by Associate Justice [[Jose P. Laurel]] (who, like Marcos, also became President).

== Life ==
She was born in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Kaʻū district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawaiʻi]], to Mary Paʻahana Kanakaʻole (a native Hawaiian woman) and Henry Nathaniel Wiggin (originally from [[Massachusetts]]). In the traditional custom of ''[[hānai]]'', she was initially reared by her mother's parents. Her grandmother Naliipoʻaimoku, a [[hula#Hula Kahiko|traditional dancer]] in the court of [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]], taught her chants and stories, while her grandfather Keli'ikanaka'ole-o-Haililani (k) was a healer and ''[[kahuna]] pale keiki'' ([[obstetrician]]) who used ''[[lomilomi massage]]'', ''laʻau lapaʻau'' (herbal medicine), ''[[ho'oponopono|hoʻoponopono]]'' (forgiveness), and ''pule'' (prayer). Her great grandmother Keliʻipaʻahana was a ''kahuna pule'' (priestess) in the [[pele (deity)|Pele]] line. Keli'iPa'ahana's parents were the High Chief KU or Kauhi and High Chiefess Na'ai Hunali'i (The Hidden chief). Keli'iPa'ahana was interned in Halema'uma'u in 1869 in the Ka'u district. She married the High Chief Keli'iKanaka'ole (k) the son High Chief Kaelele and Princess Kekelaokalani. Family is known to inherit the sacred Ali'i Moe Kapu (the prostrating Taboo). Upon the death of her grandmother Nali'i Poai moku she returned to live with her parents and spoke both Hawaiian and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/150/sesq6pukui |title=Mary Kawena Pukui |first= Mike |last=Gordon|work=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=July 2, 2006 |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was educated in the [[Hawaiian Mission Academy]], and taught [[Hawaiiana]] at [[Punahou School]]. Pukui was fluent in the [[Hawaiian language]], and from the age of 15 collected and translated [[folklore|folk tales, proverbs and sayings]]. She worked at the [[Bishop Museum|Bernice P. Bishop Museum]] from 1938–1961 as an [[ethnology|ethnological]] assistant and translator. She also taught Hawaiian to several scholars and served as informant for numerous [[anthropology|anthropologists]]. She published more than 50 scholarly works. She is the co-author of the definitive ''Hawaiian-English Dictionary'' (1957, revised 1986), ''Place Names of Hawaii'' (1974), and ''The Echo of Our Song'' (1974), a translation of old chants and songs. Her book, ''ʻŌlelo Noʻeau'', contains nearly 3,000 examples of Hawaiian proverbs and poetical sayings, translated and annotated. The two-volume set ''Nānā i ke Kumu, Look to the Source'', is an invaluable resource on Hawaiian customs and traditions. She was a chanter and hula expert, and wrote lyrics and music to more than 150 Hawaiian songs.

In addition to her published works, Pukui's knowledge was also preserved in her notes, oral histories, hundreds of audiotape recordings from the 1950s and 1960s, and a few film clips, all collected in the Bishop Museum.
She is often credited with making the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]] of the 1970s possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Author aided revival of Hawaiian tongue |newspaper= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date= November 1, 1999 |author= Burl Burlingame |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/11/01/news/story8.html |accessdate= 2010-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was named a "[[Living Treasure of Hawai'i]]" by the [[Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawai'i|Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaiʻi]] in 1977. In 1995 she was inducted into the Hawaiian  Music Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1995 Hall of Fame Honoree: Mary Kawena Pukuʻi |url=http://www.hmhof.org/honorees/1995/pukui.html |publisher=Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame |year=1995 |accessdate=2009-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, ''Hawaiʻi Magazine'' ranked her among a list of the most influential women in Hawaiian history.&lt;ref name="Dekneef2017"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dekneef|first=Matthew|title=15 extraordinary Hawaii women who inspire us all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5369">'''Maureen Johnson Smith Long''' (July 4, 1882 - June 20, 1982), most often referred to as '''Maureen Johnson''', is a fictional character in several [[science fiction]] novels by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]].  She is the mother, lover and eventual wife of [[Lazarus Long]], the longest-living member of Heinlein's fictional [[Howard Families]].  She is the only character from the "Lazarus Long cycle" to have an entire fictional memoir devoted to her life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heinleinsociety.org/concordance/J_HC.htm J - Heinlein Concordance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sailbeyond.jpg|200px|right|Maureen Johnson and Pixel. ]]

==Background==

Maureen first appears as a secondary character in the 1973 novel ''[[Time Enough for Love]]''.  She appears briefly in ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' (1980),  ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' (1985) and recounts her own life story, and sometimes contradictory versions of events recorded in other Heinlein stories, in 1987's ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.2secondfuse.com/archives/robertheinleintosailbeyond.html |title=Robert Heinlein - To Sail Beyond The Sunset |last=Spears |first=Vlad |website=2Second(fuse) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213082333/http://www.2secondfuse.com/archives/robertheinleintosailbeyond.html |archivedate=February 13, 2006 |access-date=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and marriage==

Maureen was born in [[Missouri]] on July 4, 1882, the daughter of Doctor Ira Johnson, a member of the Howard Families.  As a young teenager, Maureen discovers this fact from her very frank father who encourages her to seek a husband from among the accepted list of family candidates.  She marries Brian Smith and they settle in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and have several children, all subsidized by the Howard Families foundation.

==Children==

The most famous of her children is Woodrow Wilson Smith, born November 11, 1912.  Woodrow will eventually be known by many names in his long life, the most famous being "Lazarus Long."

''Time Enough for Love'' recounts how, during 1916, Maureen and her father are visited by a mysterious man who calls himself Theodore Bronson.  Bronson and Maureen are mentally and physically attracted to one another, and even go on a date and attempt to have sex, but are thwarted by young "Woody," who sneaks along, hidden in the back of the car.  Ted Bronson eventually goes off to fight in the war, and is presumed killed.  "Bronson" was eventually revealed to Maureen to be her time-traveling son, Woodrow, aka "Lazarus Long."

==Post-divorce business career and "death"==

When Brian Smith divorces Maureen to marry their daughter-in-law, Maureen strikes out on her own, becomes a board member of [[D. D. Harriman]]'s Harriman Enterprises, the first company to put a man on the moon in Heinlein's central universe ("[[The Man Who Sold the Moon]]").  She also witnesses the introduction of the "rolling roads" ("[[The Roads Must Roll]]").

On June 20, 1982, Maureen, just short of her one hundredth birthday, is crossing a street when a truck barrels down on her.  She has no time for regrets as she is scooped up in a rescue mission from the future by her son Lazarus, with assistance from Hilda Corners Burroughs, Jacob Burroughs, Zebediah Carter, Dejah Thoris "Deety" Burroughs Carter and their sentient car, [[The Number of the Beast (novel)|Gay Deceiver]]. The rescue is outlined in the book ''The Number of the Beast''.

==Rejuvenation and Time Corps career==

She is rejuvenated, and first works as a nursing assistant, then a nurse, and eventually a physician/rejuvenator herself. But she regrets not knowing the eventual fate of her beloved father, Dr. Ira Johnson, and on the advice of co-husband [[Jubal Harshaw]] becomes an agent of the ''Time Corps'' (often accompanied by Pixel, the titular "Cat Who Walks Through Walls"). She is kidnapped by the "Committee For Aesthetic Deletions" while on a research trip and held in Kansas City on a previously unknown time-line. Pixel manages to lead Lazarus to Maureen and rescue her from the Committee. Then Maureen, Lazarus and the rest of the Long family rescue Ira Johnson from certain death during the [[Coventry Blitz]].

==Worlds without end==

Maureen is united with her descendants in a massive group marriage in the settlement of Boondock on the planet Tellus Tertius.  Her last words in ''To Sail Beyond the Sunset'' are:

{{quote|So we all joined hands in the presence of our children (of course Pixel was there!) and we pledged ourselves to love and cherish our children--those around us, those still to come, worlds without end.

And we all lived happily ever after.}}

'''Miguel Angel Varvello''' (born 13 March 1943 in [[Cañada de Gomez]], [[Santa Fe Province]], Argentina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tango.info/0000000081322650 |title=Miguel Ángel Varvello |publisher=tango.info |date=1943-03-16 |accessdate=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] musician who plays and teaches the [[bandoneon]].

He was only six years old when he discovered the bandoneon, it was love at first sight, and his family was then faced with the difficult task of finding him a small instrument, known as a bandoneon 3/4, so that he could begin his studies. His first teacher was Tito Aparicio. He never planned on a career as a musician, it merely happened. 

At the age of eight, he appeared as a soloist on radio stations LT2 and LT8 of the city of [[Rosario]]. Then, he began to work as a freelance bandeoneonist. He perfected his technique with Jose Bustamante and, like Anibal Troilo and Astor Piazzolla before him, he benefited from the influence of mythical Rosario Bandoneon player Antonio Rios. He also studied harmony, counterpoint and composition with Titi Rossi. Today he is a player with and exceptional technique, combined with his natural gift for discovering and illuminating the natural spaces in music. At 27 years old, moved to Buenos Aires, where he became one of the most sought-after bandoneon players on the tango scene, and played with many different groups, including the Jose Basso, Osvaldo Berlinghieri, Alberto Di Paulo, Carlos Lazari, Osvaldo Piro, Osvaldo Requena, Francisco Rotundo and Hector Varela tango orchestras. He also established his own groups, with which he performed extensively in the better known tango venues of [[Buenos Aires]] such as Michelangelo, Caño 14 and La Ciudad, and toured all over the world. 

He created Ensamble Trio (bandoneon, piano and bass), played duos with guitarist Jorge Labanca and, together with bandoneonist Lisandro Adrover, set up the revolutionary nonet Ensamble Porteño (flute, clarinet, two violins, two bandoneons, piano, bass and percussion). These groups mainly used Varvello's own arrangements and played and recorded many of his works. The albums ''Despertar en Buenos Aires'' (Ensamble Porteño, 1978), ''Momentos Inestables'' (Ensamble Trio, 1984) and ''Devenir'' (Duoo Varvello- Labanca, 1989) bear witness to his work of those years. He is currently a member of the orchestra accompanying the highly acclaimed show Forever Tango which has been staged the world over, including Europe, Japan and de U.S. In 2002, the famous company TESTIGO published "A magic instrument", where this exceptional artist, brings awareness of the uniqueness of this incredible instrument in classical music, a unique feat of this kind, he played Bach, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, and also tango music. In 2003 the company Zaf records from Argentina, published "Tangos de Vanguardia" Trio Ensemble, under his direction and arrangements. Also acts as musical director of the show "Tango Dreams", in appearances with the symphony orchestras of Albuquerque, New Mexico and Long Beach, California, USA, as well in the city of Tokyo, Japan.

His orchestra participated in the activities of the Montreal International Tango Festival of 2006 &amp; 2007. He also made recordings of bandoneon "solos" for Universal Studios, U.S. music division, with participation in the project "Cafe de los Maestros," making presentations 2008 in Paris and Lyon, Buenos Aires, Oman, Brussels and many more. Also participated in the  FESTIVAL DE TANGO DE BUENOS AIRES 2010, the nightly tribute to Rovira.

His Works are published by Editorial Lagos S.R.L./ Warner Chappell in Argentina, and by Tonos Musikverlag GmbH in Germany. Mr. Varvello also teaches extensively. He lives in Buenos Aires with his wife and children, and receives students from everywhere in the world "Teaching the bandoneon is a way of being in contact with the music I love. And it is very stimulating to see how students gradually discover that their relationship with the bandoneon is something personal and specific to each of them".
In 2012, Mr. Varvello just released  a new cd, again in classical music with  the famous company TESTIGO, "Concerto for bandoneon", this album includes a concert for bandoneon with strings, piano, harp, timpani and percussion,  in three movements,  and is accompanied by works of Frédéric Chopin, Johann Sebastian Bach and Achille-Claude Debussy, and tangos of Agustín Bardi, Eduardo Rovira Astor Piazzolla.

'''Olga Havlová''', born '''Šplíchalová''' (July 11, 1933 in [[Prague]] – January 27, 1996 in Prague) was the first wife of [[Václav Havel]], the last [[President of Czechoslovakia]] and first [[President of the Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name=Havel&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vaclavhavel.cz/index.php?sec=1&amp;id=5&amp;page=1&amp;setln=2|title=::.Václav Havel.::The official website of Vaclav Havel, writer, dramatist, dissident, prisoner of conscience, human rights activist, former president of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic|publisher=Vaclavhavel.cz|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==

Olga Havel was born in [[Žižkov]], "one of the roughest, working-class districts of [[Prague]]",&lt;ref name="Keane2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Keane|title=Vaclav Havel: A Political Tragedy In Six Acts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6TLpLid804C&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=20 October 2012|date=23 May 2001|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-03720-9|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a working-class family. She spent her childhood in a way typical for such a harsh environment. Her parents split up when she was six years old. In a large family, also including Olga's older sister Jaroslava's family (a single mother of five children), any free hand was useful. Therefore, it was obvious that Olga cared for her young nieces and nephews since her childhood. As a child, she also attended Milíčův dům (Milíč House in Prague) established by Přemysl Pitter. Olga used to spend a lot of time in libraries where she acquired her strong lifelong love of literature. Although her family's life was modest, Olga's mother used to take her children to cinema and theatre quite often. After graduating from secondary school, Olga became a trainee in the [[Tomáš Baťa]] factory, where she also worked afterwards. In the course of working on a sewing machine, she lost four fingers on her left hand.

When she was about twenty, she was an enthusiastic theatre lover and attended the drama classes of Professor Lydie Wegener. Together with her other pupils, she acted in an amateur theatre performance in Divadlo Na slupi (which does not exist anymore). During the 1950s, she went through a number of different jobs. She worked, e.g., as an accountant, a store keeper, a sales assistant.

Olga met Václav Havel at the Prague writer's hangout [[Café Slavia]] &lt;ref&gt;Keane, pg. 141&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1950s and married him in 1964. During the 1960s, her husband became a respected author both at home and in Europe. In the second half of the 1960s, he - as a writer and a contributor to the cultural magazines - was involved in a democratization process, particularly in the field of culture. He advocated [[freedom of speech]], independence of culture, return of full-fledged civil rights. During the years 1961 – 1967, Olga Havel worked at the theatre Divadlo Na zábradlí ([[Theatre on the Balustrade]]) where Václav was also active until 1968. Václav Havel made no secret of the fact that, despite the diversity of personalities and family environment as well as all the usual problems of life and crises, Olga meant a lot for him. He appreciated how quickly this seemingly ordinary young woman from Žižkov became a part of the Prague intellectual environment of the 1950s and '60s, that she was an attentive first reader and critic of his essays and dramatic works, a valuable supporter and collaborator in the difficult years of [[Charta 77]] as well as a reliable lifelong partner.

In 1967, the Havels bought a country estate in the foothills called Hrádeček. Later on, when Václav Havel was gradually losing not only a possibility to find a job but also some contacts and friends in Prague, the couple moved to their cottage and practically lived there until November 1989. Olga Havel, a passionate mushroom-picker and nature-lover, fell in love with the place just like her husband. She was fond of gardening and taking her dogs for long walks to the forest. They alternated moments of peace and seclusion used by Václav for his work with a rich social life, of which they were hospitable organizers.

==Olga Havel in Czech dissent==

Following the [[1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]] by the Warsaw Pact armies until the revolution in 1989, Václav Havel could not publish, theatres were not allowed to stage his plays and he was gradually pushed out of the public cultural activities and became one of the most prominent dissidents. As a fighter against continuously intensified totalitarian regime, he was persecuted by the secret police ([[Státní bezpečnost]]),&lt;ref name= Keane-2001 &gt;{{cite book|author=John Keane|title=Vaclav Havel: A Political Tragedy In Six Acts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6TLpLid804C&amp;pg=PA309|accessdate=20 October 2012|date=23 May 2001|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-03720-9|pages=309–}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was often detained, interrogated and imprisoned eventually. Olga Havel was always an important back up to her husband; she supported him in all his dissident activities and she was also involved in them. She was described as "...full of forthright, even earthy common sense. A shrewd, intuitive judge of people, calm but tough, and with a natural dignity..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1996/mar/21/on-olga-havel-19331996/?pagination=false|title=On Olga Havel (1933–1996)|author=Ash, Timothy Garton|work=NY Books|date=1996-03-21|accessdate=2011-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he was sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment, Olga Havel together with her brother-in-law Ivan Havel took over responsibilities and obligations in [[samizdat]] Edition Expedition, which was led by Václav before. In relation to the prosecution for transporting prohibited printed material, she was accused of subversion of a republic in the case of "Karavan". Her prosecution was abolished after the fall of the totalitarian regime.

Olga Havel was the addressee of the intellectually deep, philosophically and existentially toned letters sent by Václav Havel during the years 1979 – 1983 from prison. Some of them were intended not only to her but also to the philosophically minded circle of friends with whom he - through the letters - tried to think through different things and they tried to help him stay intellectually active. [[Letters to Olga]], (''Dopisy Olze'') a selection of these letters, forms one of the most important books of Václav Havel, first published in 1983 in the Edition Expedition. Olga also organized meetings, distributed manuscripts and participated in the Charta 77 activities. She signed Charta 77 in 1982.

In the difficult years of insecurity, persecution and imprisonment of her husband, Olga fully and with joy used the opportunity to escape from the difficulties of everyday life by joining Hrobka (Tomb), the circle of friends organizing various humorous activities. Václav Havel characterized this circle accurately: "In the early 1980s, I was – like several of my friends - imprisoned, conditions outside were harsh and so Hrobka was created as a way of self-defence; it was a cheerful community of imprisoned dissidents' wives, those who remained at large and their friends."  Olga soon became one of the organizers of a diverse range of cultural and social activities and thus she returned to her creative interests from the years of amateur theatre. She added to the community life not only as a regular hostess of costumed garden parties at Hrádeček on the occasion of her birthday but, first of all, she herself came up with many ideas and inspiration.

In 1987, Olga co-founded Originální Videojournal, the samizdat video news magazine which documented the activities of dissent in pictures and informed about the present political and cultural situation in Czechoslovakia openly. She actively worked in the magazine and focused mainly on ecological topics. In late 1985, she initiated a magazine O divadle (About Theatre), and as a member of the editorial staff she helped mainly with economic and production issues.

==After November 1989==

===Committee of Good Will – Olga Havel Foundation===

As the wife of the first Czechoslovak democratic president after February 1948, Olga Havel intensively focused on charitable activities. In the era of newly emerging democracy, she was a pioneer of charity in the country. In early 1990, she and her friends from Charta 77 founded the Committee of Good Will, one of the very first projects of this kind in Czechoslovakia. In 1992, she founded the Olga Havel Foundation and members of the Committee of Good Will became Board Members of the foundation with Olga as the Chair. The main objective of the Committee of Good Will - Olga Havel Foundation (OHF) was to help people with disabilities, abandoned or discriminated with their integration into society. The Foundation activities soon became well known abroad. In some countries in Europe and overseas, sister organizations were established to support the main goals of the Foundation.
Olga Havel visited emerging centres for children with multiple disabilities to inquire what could make their life easier. She was often seen among senior citizens and handicapped children. She was interested in transformation of hospitals into non-profit, non-governmental organizations and urged ministers to support civil society organizations working in the social field. She earned respect of world politicians and cultural figures. She met outstanding personalities in and outside Europe; together with [[Christiane Herzog]], wife of German President, she organized help for children suffering from cystic fibrosis.

===Olga Havel Award===

On the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the OHF, Olga decided to present an award to a person with a handicap who helped to improve living conditions of other handicapped people. This prize is awarded annually in May. Olga attended just the first awards ceremony - she died in January 1996. The prize, a statue called Encouragement by Olbram Zoubek, thus also became a remembrance of a person who had always been an advocate for the rights of vulnerable citizens. One part of the Olga Havel Award project is to promote civic associations providing social and medical services in a dignified way, and using new forms of social services. For the OHF, the ceremony is also an opportunity to pay tribute to its significant donors and collaborators.

===Last years and death===

In 1991, Nordic foundation Stiftelsen Arets Budeje awarded Olga Havel with the prestigious prize Woman of the Year 1991. In 1995, Olga received the Přemysl Pitter medal and became the Woman of the year 1995 in the Czech Republic. Olga Havel dedicated last years of her life to tireless building of civil society. In 1995, Olga was according to the public survey the most significant woman of the Czech Republic and she became an authority even abroad. Thanks to her the issue of handicapped people stopped to be an "indecent topic".

Olga Havel died of cancer on January 27, 1996. Her death deeply hit the entire nation. People stood in a long queue to honour her, laid flowers in the chapel at the south wing of Prague Castle, and signed a condolence book. She is buried in the Havel family tomb at Prague's Vinohrady cemetery.

In 1997, Olga Havel was in memoriam awarded the [[Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] for outstanding contribution to democracy and human rights.&lt;ref name=Havel/&gt; Since 1996, based on approval of the President Václav Havel, secondary school in Ostrava-Poruba carries an honorary title – Olga Havel Gymnázium. In 2014, Business Academy, specialized school and practical school in Janské Lázně, which Olga Havel opened in 1994, was officially named after her.

Olga Havel left neither letters nor a book of memories. People can learn about her life from the books by Pavel Kosatík or Helena Marková, from the tribute anthology Síla věcnosti (Power of factuality) and other texts. In 1993, the documentary was made within the cycle GEN – Galery of the nation's elite, in 2006 – on the occasion of 10th anniversary of her death – a documentary Paní Olga (Lady Olga) from the cycle Příběhy slavných (Stories of the famous). In 2014, director Miroslav Janek made the documentary OLGA, which was awarded in the category Best Documentary on the 22nd film awards Český lev (Czech Lion). In 2010, a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the building where the Committee of Good Will is located (Prague, Senovážné náměstí 2); since 2012, a new street in Žižkov-Vackov bears the name of Olga Havel.

'''Patrick Smith'''&lt;ref&gt;Patrick was often known as 'Paddy' throughout his lifetime.&lt;/ref&gt; (17 July 1901 – 18 March 1982) was an Irish [[Fianna Fáil]] politician, who served as a [[Teachta Dála]] from 1923 until 1977; a tenure of 53 years, the [[Records of members of the Oireachtas#Longest-serving former TD|longest in the state]]. He held a number of ministerial positions within the governments of [[Éamon de Valera]] and [[Seán Lemass]].

Smith was born in the town of [[Bailieborough]], [[County Cavan]]. Patrick joined the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], he took a small role in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916. By 1920, he was involved with the [[Irish Republican Army (1919–1922)|Irish Republican Army]] and was one of its youngest commandants, at the age of 19. He was captured by British forces in 1921, along with [[Seán Moylan]], who would go on to become a government colleague. He was interned, put on trial treason but his life was saved by the truce called between the [[British Army]] and the IRA during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. After the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], Smith took sides with de Valera and the [[Anti-Treaty Sinn Fein|Anti-Treaty]] side of the [[Irish Civil War]]. Smith had felt that the Irish negotiators did not test the British delegation enough, this sentiment would last with him well into his political career, Smith being said to have shouted across the floor at [[Dáil Éireann]], "They gave us stepping-stones, but they [state forces in 1922] would not walk on them." A play on the same quote by Irish revolutionary, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]].

He entered the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] in September 1923, as a [[Republican (Ireland, 1923)|Republican]] candidate. In 1926, [[Éamon de Valera]], the Leader of [[Anti-Treaty Sinn Fein]], approached Smith and persuaded him to join his newly founded political party, [[Fianna Fáil]]. Fianna Fail abandoned the [[abstentionist]] policy of Anti Treaty Sinn Fein and its elected members took their seats in [[Dáil Éireann]]. De Valera and Smith had a strong personal and professional relationship; Smith had a strong loyalty for Fianna Fail and by extension, de Valera, whom he often defended from allegations of [[totalitarian]] style policies. Smith retorted these allegations, citing that he felt de Valera had always given a voice to members of the party. He worked as Parliamentary Secretary at the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], known today as the [[Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach]] or Government Chief Whip. Smith identified this time during [[World War II]] as his most fulfilling period in Irish politics.

He was then moved to the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]], as the respective [[Minister of State at the Department of Finance|Minister of State]] in that department. He served under [[Seán T. O'Kelly]] and [[Frank Aiken]] during his tenure in the department. Smith was then transferred to the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Department of Agriculture]] and this was his first cabinet position as [[Minister for Agriculture (Ireland)|Minister for Agriculture]]. He held this position until the collapse of the Fianna Fail government which had been in power for over 10 years. The party spent a number years in opposition, until the [[1951 Irish general election]]. Smith was then appointed as [[Minister for Local Government (Ireland)|Minister for Local Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De Valera: Rule: 1932–1975|last=McCullagh|first=David|publisher=Gill Books|year=2018|isbn=9780717179220|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith focused on many social issues, especially the [[tuberculosis]] issue in Ireland. He advocated for the reduction of overcrowding in the slums of [[Dublin]]. He also oversaw the doubling of the car license fee to ensure the government had enough cashflow for the upkeep of urban and rural roads. The improvement of roads also facilitated unemployment programs by offering recruitment opportunities to work on the roads. The fund for road improvement soon amounted to £3 million, and work began on surfacing the 34,000 miles of road which remained below standard. The Fianna Fail government collapsed in 1954 and was replaced by the [[Second Inter-Party Government]], led by [[John A. Costello]]; Smith resumed his post in the Department of Local Government when Fianna Fail were re-elected at the [[1957 Irish general election]]

Smith was transferred to the [[Department of Agriculture (Ireland)|Department of Agriculture]] for the final time in 1957 when Fianna Fail resumed its position in government. His main objectives while in this office were to eliminate [[Cattle TB|cattle tuberculosis]], which proved to be a serious issue for Irish farmers at the time. He also encouraged greater productivity from the primary economic sector, specifically farming and also aimed to improve grassland quality across the island. Outside of agriculture, Smith continued to serve as Minister for Local Government. He also was part of a group of ministers who supervised the '''First Programme for Economic Expansion''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', an economic development plan by [[T. K. Whitaker]], Secretary at the Department of Finance, that has been heavily praised as the programme that helped kickstart Ireland's economic growth which would take full form in the mid-1990's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/the-man-who-made-modern-ireland-1.2931549|title=The man who made modern Ireland|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a spell as [[Minister for Social Protection|Minister for Social Welfare]].

Smith continued to serve under [[Seán Lemass]], but became disillusioned with the Taoiseach about relations with trade unions. Smith, who felt Lemass was too close to unions and would too easily bend the knee, resigned from the government in 1964 from all his ministerial positions in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sean Lemass: Democratic Dictator|last=Evans|first=Bryans|publisher=The Collins Press|year=2011|isbn=9781848899414|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith returned to the backbenches of Fianna Fail and never returned to the frontbench in the subsequent government of [[Jack Lynch]], the successor of Lemass. During the [[Arms Crisis]], Smith, like many of the 'old guard' of Fianna Fail, sided with Lynch against [[Charles Haughey]] and [[Neil Blaney]]. Smith stepped down from politics in 1977 at the age of 75. In the [[Fianna Fáil leadership election, 1979|1979 leadership election]] for Fianna Fail, Smith again sided with the more traditional members of the party in supporting the leadership campaign of [[George Colley]], who was also endorsed by Lynch. Haughey won the election and would lead Fianna Fail until 1992.

Smith died on 18 March 1982, aged 80, at his home in [[Castleblayney]], [[County Monaghan]]. He was survived by his wife, Mary Ward and his 6 children. He body was returned to his ancestral parish of [[Knockbride]], a townland outside of [[Bailieborough]], [[County Cavan]]. He was buried in West Knockbride Chapel, with his graveside oration given by Charlie Haughey, who had been appointed [[Taoiseach]] a number of days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/the-community-values-of-an-old-fianna-failer-recalled-1.509134|title=The community values of an old Fianna Failer recalled|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Priscilla Duffield''' (April 8, 1918 – July 21, 2009) worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War II. She was secretary to [[Ernest O. Lawrence]] at the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]], and to [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]]. After the war she was executive assistant to directors of [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]] and the [[National Accelerator Laboratory]].

A graduate of the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], from which she obtained a degree in [[political science]], Priscilla Greene started working for Lawrence in February 1942, and then for Oppenheimer later that year. She arrived in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], on March 1943, and established the Los Alamos Laboratory's office.  She became the office manager at Los Alamos, greeting visitors, answering the telephone, making travel arrangements, arranging security passes and accommodation, and taking notes of telephone calls. In September 1943, she married Robert Duffield, a chemist working at the Los Alamos laboratory, and changed her surname from Greene to Duffield.

In the post-war years, Duffield was secretary and executive assistant to [[Roger Revelle]], the director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In November 1967, she became secretary and executive assistant to [[Robert R. Wilson]], the founding director of the National Accelerator Laboratory, and once again she helped establish a new scientific laboratory on a new site. In later life she moved to Colorado, where she served on the board of the Uncompahgre Medical Clinic.

==Early life==
Priscilla Greene was born in [[Berkeley, California]], on April 8, 1918, and grew up in [[Corning, California]].&lt;ref name="The Watch"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Watch |url=http://www.thewatchmedia.com/obituarypriscilla-duffieldapril-8-1918-july-21-2009/ |title=Obituary Priscilla Duffield April 8, 1918 – July 21, 2009 |date=July 30, 2009 |accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She entered the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], from which she obtained a degree in [[political science]]. After graduation, she studied and travelled in New York and Europe before returning to Berkeley, where she got a job as secretary to [[Ernest O. Lawrence]], the director of the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation Laboratory]] at the University of California,&lt;ref name="Santa Fe"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]]  |title=Priscilla Duffield, 1918–2009: The 'right hand' to father of atomic bomb |url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Priscilla-Duffield--1918-2009-The--right-hand--to-father-of-ato#.VDzlVxYREtp |first=Sue |last=Vorenberg |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate=October 14, 2014}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; in February 1942,{{sfn|Conant|2005|p=23}} replacing [[Helen Griggs]], who had left to marry [[Glenn Seaborg]].{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=340–341}}

==Manhattan Project==
When [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] began working on the [[nuclear weapon design]] for the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]], Lawrence loaned Greene part-time to take dictation and do general secretarial work for Oppenheimer, while still working full-time for himself.&lt;ref name="Santa Fe"/&gt; "When Robert returned from travel and told me that he had just been to a beautiful place, all I could say is, 'take me too!'" she later recalled.&lt;ref name="Santa Fe"/&gt; Lawrence reluctantly let her go.{{sfn|Childs|1968|pp=340–341}} She immediately started working for Oppenheimer full-time, taking over the disused office of a physics professor who was absent on leave in November 1942.{{sfn|Conant|2005|p=23}}

Greene arrived in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], on March 18, 1943 with Oppenheimer's son Peter and his nurse.{{sfn|Smith|Weiner|1980|p=242}} She found  [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], "a pretty appalling place. It was windy, dusty, cold, snowy... and nothing was finished."{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=62}} "Everything was put together amazingly fast ... (but) it was nothing spectacular. There were unfinished buildings, mud and trucks everywhere."&lt;ref name="Santa Fe"/&gt; Since there was no telephone line to Los Alamos, the office was initially established at 109 East Palace in Santa Fe.{{sfn|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|p=159}} There was no purchasing system in place either, so she bought a typewriter in Santa Fe with her own money. She would spend the rest of the war trying to get reimbursed for it.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=68}}

When the office moved to Los Alamos, Greene became the office manager, greeting visitors and answering the telephone. She would listen in on all of Oppenheimer's calls and take notes, except when the director of the Manhattan Project, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], told her to get off the line. She typed Oppenheimer's correspondence.{{sfn|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|p=159}} Numerous typed documents would end with "JRO:pg".&lt;ref name="Faces"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebulletin.org/multimedia/faces-made-bomb |title=The faces that made the Bomb |publisher=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] |first=Alex |last=Wellerstein |date=June 19, 2013 |accessdate=October 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She handled travel arrangements, security passes and accommodation.{{sfn|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|p=160}} Alex Wellersten noted that: {{quote|While Oppenheimer gets much credit for keeping the entire bomb project in his head, it was actually Greene who managed the director’s office and kept it organized; it was Greene who took notes on phone conversations and managed the correspondence with far-flung sites; it was Greene who helped Oppenheimer, a man who had never managed anything in his life, stay on top of the innumerable tasks assigned to him.&lt;ref name="Faces"/&gt; }}

Greene married Robert Duffield, a chemist working on the project, in a ceremony at [[Dorothy McKibbin]]'s house on September 5, 1943.  McKibben had a local judge conduct the ceremony, but due to the project's security, he was not allowed to know the surnames of the couple.{{sfn|Conant|2005|pp=162–163}} Nor was any family allowed to attend, although Greene's brother DeMotte, whom she had recruited to work on the project as a technician, was on hand to give the bride away, and  guests included [[Robert Serber]], [[Robert R. Wilson]], [[Harold Agnew]] and Katherine Oppenheimer. Three weeks later everyone assembled there again for the wedding of her bridesmaid, Marjorie Hall, to [[Hugh Bradner]].{{sfn|Conant|2005|pp=162–163}}

When Duffield became pregnant, she wanted to quit working, but the demands of the project were so great that Oppenheimer kept refusing her requests. He eventually recruited Anne Wilson from Groves's office as her replacement.{{sfn|Conant|2005|pp=273–274}}

==Later life==
After the war, Duffield became secretary and executive assistant to [[Roger Revelle]], the director of the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]. On November 6, 1967, she became secretary and executive assistant  to Robert R. Wilson, the founding director of the [[National Accelerator Laboratory]], and served in that capacity until  December 31, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.fnal.gov/significant_staff.html#Priscilla_Duffield |publisher=Fermilab History and Archives Project |title=Significant Staff: Priscilla Duffield |accessdate=October 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive/archive_2009/today09-08-31.pdf |date= August 31, 2009 |title=In Memoriam: Priscilla Duffield |journal=Fermilab Today |accessdate=October 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffield likened this job to working for Oppenheimer at Los Alamos: {{quote|"There was the same close feeling of a group of people in a strange land, ... a group of people who were isolated from the rest of the world and trying to do something special." Duffield said that moving to the Weston site evoked memories of the esprit de corps at Los Alamos, and "that did really make it a frontier." She also recalled The feeling of independence and adventure in those early days on the Weston site. "We had a flagpole and a big fancy colorful tent was put alongside the house" As she explained, "It was a place to sit and have a meeting: but it also "was a symbol." And at both labs, "everyone did sort of everything—there was a crisis every day." Duffield emphasized: "Bob managed to give people the feeling of tremendous urgency, of getting the thing done and getting it done fast and getting it done cheap." Later, secretary Barb (Rozic) Kristen recalled that many new employees considered it hard to know just what to do in those early days, but Duffield, unlike everyone else, knew exactly what was needed and how to get things done.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Kolb|Westfall|2008|p=103}} }}

Duffield moved to [[Norwood, Colorado]], where she served on the board of the Uncompahgre Medical Clinic.&lt;ref name="The Watch"/&gt; She died of natural causes at her home there on July 21, 2009. She was survived by her daughters Deborah and Libby. Her husband Robert died in 2000.&lt;ref name="Santa Fe"/&gt;

Richard Leibler was born in March 1914. He received his A.M. in mathematics from [[Northwestern University]] and his Ph.D. from the [[University of Illinois]] in 1939. While working at the [[National Security Agency]], he and [[Solomon Kullback]] formulated the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]], a measure of similarity between probability distributions which has found important applications in [[information theory]] and [[cryptology]]. Leibler is also credited by the NSA as having opened up "new methods of attack" in the celebrated [[Venona project|VENONA]] code-breaking project during 1949-1950;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/coldwar/venona_story.pdf Robert Benson, ''The Venona Story'' NSA publications]&lt;/ref&gt; this may be a reference to his joint paper with Kullback, which was published in the open literature in 1951 and was immediately noted by Soviet cryptologists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1gb5QxSXUTcC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;lpg=PA433&amp;dq=Solomon+Kullback+Venona&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=joczoTRQ0V&amp;sig=pn_2vemAWmhMm5pagLZhfeh-mMI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O4zcVLHeOqyt7gbb_IC4BQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Solomon%20Kullback%20Venona&amp;f=false Suhov, Y and Kelbert, M ''Probability and Statistics by Example'' vol 2 (CUP, 2008) p433 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samba Bathily''' is a [[Mali]]an [[entrepreneur]], [[philanthropist]] from [[Bamako]]. He is also [[chief executive officer]] of “Solektra International” and co-founder of [[Akon Lighting Africa]].

==Career ==
In 2014, Samba co-founded [[Akon Lighting Africa]]. This was launched with international music star Akon and Thione Niang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/05/20/singer-akon-makes-progress-with-african-solar-power-venture/|title=Singer Akon Makes Progress With African Solar Power Venture|date=2015-05-20|accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of this initiative is to bring awareness around the use of solar solutions to provide villages throughout Africa with access to clean, renewable and reliable electricity. To date, results include a series of solar developments such as the installation of street lamps and domestic and community modern renewable energy solutions in 14 countries throughout Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=17&amp;v=MFPxL-Nz7fk|title=CNBC Africa - Akon to electrify Africa|date=2015-08-19|accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also launched in 2014 was Solektra International, a company that specializes in the planning, design, construction and maintenance of solar power systems.

'''Satnarayan Maharaj''' [[Chaconia Medal|CM]] (also known as '''Sat Maharaj''' or the ''[[Hanuman]] ji of [[Hindus]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://archives.newsday.co.tt/2011/04/25/happy-80th-birthday-sat/&lt;/ref&gt;) (born April 17, 1931 in Chandernagore Village, [[Chaguanas]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.co.tt/letters/0,139490.html |title=Happy 80th birthday Sat |publisher=[[Trinidad Newsday]] |accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a religious leader in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].  He is the [[Secretary-General]] of the [[Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha]], a major [[Hinduism|Hindu]] organisation in Trinidad and Tobago.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

The Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha operates 150 [[mandir]]s and over 50 schools in Trinidad and Tobago. It was formed in 1952 when [[Bhadase Sagan Maraj]] engineered the merger of the Satanan Dharma Association and the Sanatan Dharma Board of Control. An affiliated group, the Pundits' Parishad, has 200 affiliated pundits. The organisation's headquarters are located in St. Augustine.

Under the present Secretary General, Satnarayan Maharaj, the Maha Sabha has modernised all 42 schools and built 5 secondary schools as well as 12 early childhood educational centres. Maharaj has also revived the observance of Phagwa and was instrumental in the creation of the Indian Arrival Day holiday and annual celebrations. The Maha Sabha also introduced a Children’s Cultural Festival - Baal Vikaas Vihar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discover-tt.net/arts_and_culture/baal_vikaas_vihar_festival.html |title=Baal Vikaas Vihar Festival |publisher=DiscoverTT |accessdate=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Satoshi Nakamoto''' is the name used by the unknown person or people who developed [[bitcoin]], authored the bitcoin [[white paper]], and created and deployed bitcoin's original [[reference implementation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/11/economist-explains-1|last1=S.|first1=L.|title=Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?|accessdate=3 November 2015|publisher=The Economist|work=The Economist explains|date=2 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821154511/http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/11/economist-explains-1|archivedate=21 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the implementation, they also devised the first [[blockchain]] database.&lt;ref name=te20151031&gt;{{cite journal|author=Economist Staff|date=31 October 2015|title=Blockchains: The great chain of being sure about things|journal=[[The Economist]]|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21677228-technology-behind-bitcoin-lets-people-who-do-not-know-or-trust-each-other-build-dependable|accessdate=18 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000844/http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21677228-technology-behind-bitcoin-lets-people-who-do-not-know-or-trust-each-other-build-dependable|archivedate=3 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, they were the first to solve the [[double-spending]] problem for [[digital currency]] using a [[peer-to-peer]] network. They were active in the development of bitcoin up until December 2010.

== History ==

On a [[P2P Foundation]] profile, Nakamoto claimed to be a man living in [[Japan]], born on 5 April 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://diginomics.com/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/|title=Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?|date=9 November 2014|publisher=Diginomics|website=diginomics.com|first=Travis|last=Patron|accessdate=7 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811054828/https://www.diginomics.com/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/|archivedate=11 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation about the true identity of Nakamoto has mostly focused on a number of [[cryptography]] and [[computer science]] experts of non-Japanese descent, living in the United States and various European countries.&lt;ref name="wallace"/&gt; Satoshi Nakamoto also created the [[bitcointalk]] forum, and posted the first message in 2009 under the pseudonym satoshi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/from-nakamoto-to-hodl-5-intriguing-facts-about-iconic-bitcointalk-forum|title=From Nakamoto to ‘HODL’: 5 Intriguing Facts About Iconic Bitcointalk Forum|date=September 14, 2017|work=CoinTelegraph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130145406/https://cointelegraph.com/news/from-nakamoto-to-hodl-5-intriguing-facts-about-iconic-bitcointalk-forum|archivedate=30 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of bitcoin ==
In October 2008, Nakamoto published a paper&lt;ref name="whitepaper"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nakamoto|first=Satoshi|title=Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System|url=https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2014|date=24 May 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320135003/https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf|archivedate=20 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nakamoto|first=Satoshi|date=31 October 2008|url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.general/12588/|title=Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper|accessdate=5 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121228025845/http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.general/12588/|archivedate=28 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=cryptography@metzdowd.com&amp;q=from:%22Satoshi+Nakamoto%22|title=Satoshi's posts to Cryptography mailing list|publisher=Mail-archive.com|date=|accessdate=14 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103200631/http://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=cryptography@metzdowd.com&amp;q=from:%22Satoshi+Nakamoto%22|archivedate=3 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the bitcoin digital currency. It was titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". In January 2009, Nakamoto released the first bitcoin software that launched the network and the first units of the bitcoin [[cryptocurrency]], called ''bitcoins''.&lt;ref name="inventor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Joshua|title=The Crypto-Currency: Bitcoin and its mysterious inventor.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis|work=The New Yorker|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J555dPUv?url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis|archivedate=23 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penenberg|first=Adam|title=The Bitcoin Crypto-Currency Mystery Reopened|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1785445/bitcoin-crypto-currency-mystery-reopened|publisher=Fast Company|quote=A New Yorker writer implies he found Bitcoin's mysterious creator.

Nakamoto claimed that work on the writing of the code began in 2007.&lt;ref name="17nov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/15/|title=Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper 2008-11-17 16:33:04 UTC|author=Satoshi Nakamoto|accessdate=4 December 2016|date=17 November 2008|publisher=Satoshi Nakamoto Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207145306/http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/15/|archivedate=7 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nakamoto knew that due to its nature, the core design would have to be able to support a broad range of transaction types. The implemented solution enabled specialized codes and data fields from the start through the use of a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicative]] [[Scripting language|script]].&lt;ref name="17jun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/126/#selection-5.0-5.66|title=Re: Transactions and Scripts: DUP HASH160 ...

Nakamoto created a website with the domain name bitcoin.org and continued to collaborate with other developers on the bitcoin software until mid-2010.  Around this time, he handed over control of the [[Codebase|source code repository]] and network alert key to [[Gavin Andresen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosker|first=Bianca|title=Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin Architect: Meet The Man Bringing You Bitcoin (And Getting Paid In It)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/gavin-andresen-bitcoin_n_3093316.html|publisher=HuffPostTech|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803102036/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/gavin-andresen-bitcoin_n_3093316.html|archivedate=3 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; transferred several related [[domain name|domain]]s to various prominent members of the bitcoin community, and stopped his involvement in the project. Until shortly before his absence and handover, Nakamoto made all modifications to the source code himself.

On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the ''[[Bitcoin#Blockchain|genesis block of bitcoin]]'' (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins.&lt;ref name="Wired:RFB"&gt;{{cite news|author=Wallace, Benjamin|title=The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/|publisher=Wired|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=13 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031043919/http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin|archivedate=31 October 2013|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Block 0&amp;nbsp;– Bitcoin Block Explorer |url=http://blockexplorer.com/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015154613/http://blockexplorer.com/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f |archivedate=15 October 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Embedded in the [[Bitcoin#Supply|coinbase transaction]] of this block was the text:

This block is unlike all other blocks in that it doesn't have a previous block to reference.&lt;ref name="htu"/&gt; This required the use of custom code to mine it. Timestamps for subsequent blocks indicate that Nakamoto did not try to mine all the early blocks solely for himself.&lt;ref name="htu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://21.co/learn/view-the-genesis-block/#the-genesis-block|title=How to use hexdump to look at the Genesis Block|publisher=21.co|accessdate=25 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225214556/https://21.co/learn/view-the-genesis-block/#the-genesis-block|archivedate=25 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As initially the sole and subsequently the predominant miner, Nakamoto was awarded bitcoin at genesis and for 10 days afterwards.&lt;ref name="hoda"/&gt; Except for test transactions these remain unspent since mid January 2009.&lt;ref name="hoda"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.coindesk.com/dangerous-satoshi-nakamoto/|title=How Dangerous is Satoshi Nakamoto?|author=Danny Bradbury|accessdate=24 December 2016|date=23 November 2014|work=Coindesk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224165351/http://www.coindesk.com/dangerous-satoshi-nakamoto/|archivedate=24 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public bitcoin transaction log shows that Nakamoto's known addresses contain roughly one million bitcoins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/|title=The Well Deserved Fortune of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin creator, Visionary and Genius|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204075938/https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/|archivedate=4 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At bitcoin's peak in December 2017, this was worth over US$19 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://preev.com/|title=Bitcoin Exchange Rate — Bitcoin Live Converter — Preev|website=preev.com|access-date=20 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915080601/http://preev.com/|archivedate=15 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Nakamoto possibly the 44th richest person in the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Billionaires|url=https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/2/#version:static|website=Forbes|publisher=forbes.com|accessdate=13 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223083758/https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/2/#version:static|archivedate=23 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics and identity ==
Nakamoto has not disclosed any personal information when discussing technical matters.&lt;ref name="wallace"/&gt;  He provided some commentary on banking and [[fractional-reserve banking]]. On his [[P2P Foundation]] profile as of 2012, Nakamoto claimed to be a 37-year-old male who lived in [[Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satoshi Nakamoto's Page|url=http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto|website=P2P Foundation|accessdate=2 May 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529203623/http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some speculated he was unlikely to be Japanese due to his use of perfect [[English language|English]] and his bitcoin [[software]] not being documented or labelled in Japanese.&lt;ref name="wallace"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Benjamin|title=The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/all/|publisher=Wired|quote=It seemed doubtful that Nakamoto was even Japanese.

Occasional [[British English]] spelling and terminology (such as the phrase "bloody hard") in both source code comments and forum postings led to speculation that Nakamoto, or at least one individual in the consortium claiming to be him, was of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] origin.{{r|"wallace"}}{{r|"whitepaper"}}{{r|"betabeat"}} Moreover, the first bitcoin block that could only be mined by Satoshi contains the encoded text &lt;code&gt;The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks&lt;/code&gt; which implies that he was reading London's ''The Times'' newspaper at the time of the inception of bitcoin.&lt;ref name="NY2011"&gt;{{cite web |last = Davis |first = Joshua |title = The Crypto-Currency: Bitcoin and its mysterious inventor |url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/10/the-crypto-currency |work = The New Yorker |date = 10 October 2011 |accessdate = 31 October 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141101014157/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/10/the-crypto-currency |archivedate = 1 November 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pagliery|first1=Jose|title=Bitcoin: And the Future of Money|date=2014|publisher=Triumph Books|isbn=9781629370361|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_-wuBAAAQBAJ|accessdate=20 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121071329/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_-wuBAAAQBAJ|archivedate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's bitcoin forum posts (more than 500); the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. [[Greenwich Mean Time]]. This was between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. [[UTC+9|Japanese time]], suggesting an unusual sleep pattern for someone presumably living in Japan. As this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto was asleep at this time.&lt;ref name="wallace" /&gt;

Nakamoto's initial email to Dai is dated &lt;q&gt;22 August 2008&lt;/q&gt;; the metadata for this PDF (&lt;code&gt;pdftk bitcoin.pdf dump_data&lt;/code&gt;) yields as the &lt;code&gt;CreationDate&lt;/code&gt; the value &lt;code&gt;20081003134958-07'00'&lt;/code&gt; – this implies 3 October 2008 or a bit over a month later, which is consistent with the local date mentioned in the Cypherpunk mailing list email. This is an earlier draft than the final draft on &lt;code&gt;bitcoin.org&lt;/code&gt;, which is dated &lt;code&gt;20090324113315-06'00'&lt;/code&gt; or 24 March 2009; the timezone differs: −7 vs −6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gwern.net/docs/2008-nakamoto|title=Dai/Nakamoto emails - Gwern.net|last=Dai|first=Satoshi Nakamoto, Wei|website=www.gwern.net|language=en|access-date=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still doubt about the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurocheddar.com/profiles-in-europe/satoshi-nakamoto-creator-bitcoin/|title=Satoshi Nakamoto|last=Feins|first=William|website=www.eurocheddar.com|language=en-US|access-date=20 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820115902/http://www.eurocheddar.com/profiles-in-europe/satoshi-nakamoto-creator-bitcoin/|archivedate=20 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hal Finney ====
[[Hal Finney (computer scientist)|Hal Finney]] (4 May 1956 – 28 August 2014) was a pre-bitcoin cryptographic pioneer and the first person (other than Nakamoto himself) to use the software, file bug reports, and make improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/03/hal-finney-received-the-first-bitcoin-transaction-heres-how-he-describes-it/|title=Hal Finney received the first Bitcoin transaction.

However, after meeting Finney, seeing the emails between him and Nakamoto and his bitcoin wallet's history (including the very first bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto to him, which he forgot to pay back) and hearing his denial, Greenberg concluded that Finney was telling the truth. Juola &amp; Associates also found that Nakamoto's emails to Finney more closely resemble Nakamoto's other writings than Finney's do. Finney's fellow [[extropian]] and sometimes co-blogger [[Robin Hanson]] assigned a subjective probability of "at least" 15% that "Hal was more involved than he’s said", before further evidence suggested that was not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/03/conspiracy-theory-up-close-personal.html|title=Conspiracy Theory, Up Close &amp; Personal|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=25 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326081004/http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/03/conspiracy-theory-up-close-personal.html|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed research by financial author [[Dominic Frisby]] provides much circumstantial evidence but, as he admits, no proof that Satoshi is Szabo.&lt;ref&gt;Frisby, Dominic (2014) "Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?" In Bitcoin: the Future of Money?, pp. 85–149. [[Unbound (publisher)|Unbound]]. {{ISBN|1783520779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on [[RT (TV network)|RT's]] ''[[The Keiser Report]]'', he said "I've concluded there is only one person in the whole world that has the sheer breadth but also the specificity of knowledge and it is this chap&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/shows/keiser-report/202535-episode-max-keiser-676/|title=Nick Szabo is (probably) Satoshi Nakamoto|date=6 November 2014|accessdate=6 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106231725/http://rt.com/shows/keiser-report/202535-episode-max-keiser-676/|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}} at ~17:30 into the show&lt;/ref&gt; However, Szabo has denied being Satoshi.

==== Dorian Nakamoto ====
In a high-profile 6 March 2014 article in the magazine ''[[Newsweek]]'',&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; journalist [[Leah McGrath Goodman]] identified Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in [[California]], whose [[Name at birth|birth name]] is Satoshi Nakamoto,&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto.html|title=The Face Behind Bitcoin|work=Newsweek|date=6 March 2014|accessdate=6 March 2014|author=[[Leah McGrath Goodman]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NtE8qHbJ?url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto.html|archivedate=7 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andy Greenberg|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/06/bitcoin-community-responds-to-satoshi-nakamotos-outing-with-disbelief-anger-fascination/|title=Bitcoin Community Responds To Satoshi Nakamoto's Outing With Disbelief, Anger, Fascination|publisher=Forbes|date=|accessdate=6 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306211349/http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/06/bitcoin-community-responds-to-satoshi-nakamotos-outing-with-disbelief-anger-fascination/|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oremus|first=Will|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/06/the_real_satoshi_nakamoto_newsweek_finds_mysterious_bitcoin_creator_in_los.html|title=The real Satoshi Nakamoto: Newsweek finds mysterious bitcoin creator in Los Angeles|publisher=Slate.com|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=6 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429180701/http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/06/the_real_satoshi_nakamoto_newsweek_finds_mysterious_bitcoin_creator_in_los.html|archivedate=29 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Nakamoto in question. Besides his name, Goodman pointed to a number of facts that circumstantially suggested he was the bitcoin inventor.&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt; Trained as a physicist at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona|Cal Poly University in Pomona]], Nakamoto worked as a systems engineer on classified defense projects and computer engineer for technology and financial information services companies. Nakamoto was laid off twice in the early 1990s and turned [[libertarian]], according to his daughter, and encouraged her to start her own business "not under the government's thumb." In the article's seemingly biggest piece of evidence, Goodman wrote that when she asked him about bitcoin during a brief in-person interview, Nakamoto seemed to confirm his identity as the bitcoin founder by stating: "I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection."&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Winton|title=Deputies: Newsweek Bitcoin story quoted Satoshi Nakamoto accurately|date=7 March 2014|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-la-sheriffs-say-satoshi-nakamoto-man-did-talk-about-bitcoin-to-newsweek-reporter-20140307,0,609860.story|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=9 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308181437/http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-la-sheriffs-say-satoshi-nakamoto-man-did-talk-about-bitcoin-to-newsweek-reporter-20140307,0,609860.story|archivedate=8 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The article's publication led to a flurry of media interest, including reporters camping out near Dorian Nakamoto's house and subtly chasing him by car when he drove to do an interview.&lt;ref name="latimes dorian denial"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bitcoin-founder-la-chased-20140306,0,3692933.story|title=Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto chased by reporters, denies founding Bitcoin|first=Salvador|last=Rodriguez|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=6 March 2014|accessdate=6 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306233446/http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bitcoin-founder-la-chased-20140306,0,3692933.story|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the subsequent full-length interview, Dorian Nakamoto denied all connection to bitcoin, saying he had never heard of the currency before, and that he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being about his previous work for military contractors, much of which was classified.&lt;ref name="Hedman Rahm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hedman Rahm|first=Victor|url=https://www.coinworld.io/learn/unbelievable-story-bitcoin/|title=The Unbelievable story of Bitcoin|work=Coinworld|accessdate=1 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827043010/https://www.coinworld.io/learn/unbelievable-story-bitcoin/|archivedate=27 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Reddit "ask-me-anything" interview, he claimed he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being related to his work for [[Citibank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3nzqqh/hi_rbitcoin_i_am_dorian_nakamoto_ama/|title=Hi r/bitcoin I am Dorian Nakamoto.

==== Other claimed candidates ====
In a 2011 article in ''The New Yorker'', [[Joshua Davis (writer)|Joshua Davis]] claimed to have narrowed down the identity of Nakamoto to a number of possible individuals, including the Finnish economic sociologist Dr. Vili Lehdonvirta and Irish student Michael Clear, then a graduate student in cryptography at [[Trinity College Dublin]] and now a post-doctoral student at [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis?currentPage=all|title=The Crypto-Currency|work=The New Yorker|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=17 December 2013|author=Davis, Joshua|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217120451/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis?currentPage=all|archivedate=17 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clear strongly denied he was Nakamoto,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~clearm/bitcoin.html|title=Clarifications on Bitcoin Article|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013|last=Clear|first=Michael|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031180459/https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~clearm/bitcoin.html|archivedate=31 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did Lehdonvirta.&lt;ref name="coindesk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coindesk.com/information/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/|title=Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?|publisher=coindesk.com|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125155821/http://www.coindesk.com/information/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/|archivedate=25 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, writing for ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'', investigative journalist [[Adam Penenberg]] cited circumstantial evidence suggesting Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry could be Nakamoto.&lt;ref name="Penenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1785445/bitcoin-crypto-currency-mystery-reopened|title=The Bitcoin Crypto-currency Mystery Reopened|publisher=The Fast Company|date=11 October 2011|accessdate=17 December 2013|author=Penenberg, Adam|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006235216/http://www.fastcompany.com/1785445/bitcoin-crypto-currency-mystery-reopened|archivedate=6 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They jointly filed a patent application that contained the phrase "computationally impractical to reverse" in 2008, which was also used in the bitcoin white paper by Nakamoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|20100042841|Updating and Distributing Encryption Keys US 20100042841 A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[domain name]] bitcoin.org was registered three days after the patent was filed.

The late [[Dave Kleiman]] has been also named as a possible candidate, and Craig Wright claimed an association with him as well.&lt;ref name="Hardy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seebitcoin.com/2016/05/everything-makes-sense-if-david-kleiman-was-satoshi-nakamoto-heres-why/|title=Everything makes sense if David Kleiman was Satoshi Nakamoto.

Dustin D. Trammell, a Texas-based security researcher, was suggested as Nakamoto, but he publicly denied it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.dustintrammell.com/2013/11/26/i-am-not-satoshi|title=I am not Satoshi|accessdate=21 February 2014|format=blog|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217003002/http://blog.dustintrammell.com/2013/11/26/i-am-not-satoshi/|archivedate=17 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, two Israeli mathematicians, Dorit Ron and [[Adi Shamir]], published a paper claiming a link between Nakamoto and [[Ross Ulbricht|Ross William Ulbricht]]. The two based their suspicion on an analysis of the network of bitcoin transactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/study-suggests-link-between-dread-pirate-roberts-and-satoshi-nakamoto|title=Study Suggests Link Between Dread Pirate Roberts and Satoshi Nakamoto|publisher=New York Times|date=23 November 2013|author=Markoff, John|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125093841/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/study-suggests-link-between-dread-pirate-roberts-and-satoshi-nakamoto/|archivedate=25 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later retracted their claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/silk-road-satoshi-paper-retraction-2013-11|title=Researchers Retract Claim Of Link Between Alleged Silk Road Mastermind And Founder Of Bitcoin|work=Business Week|accessdate=17 December 2013|author=Wile, Rob|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326211601/http://www.businessinsider.com/silk-road-satoshi-paper-retraction-2013-11|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have considered that Nakamoto might be a team of people: [[Dan Kaminsky]], a security researcher who read the bitcoin code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/07/bitcoin-scares-banks-governments|title=Why Bitcoin scares banks and governments|last=Naughton|first=John|date=7 April 2013|work=The Observer|accessdate=11 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302170424/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/07/bitcoin-scares-banks-governments|archivedate=2 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that Nakamoto could either be a "team of people" or a "genius";&lt;ref name="betabeat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betabeat.com/2011/10/did-the-new-yorkers-joshua-davis-nail-the-identity-of-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto/|title=The New Yorker's Joshua Davis Attempts to Identify Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto|publisher=Betabeat|date=4 October 2011|accessdate=27 December 2013|author=Jeffries, Adrianne|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001515/http://betabeat.com/2011/10/did-the-new-yorkers-joshua-davis-nail-the-identity-of-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto/|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laszlo Hanyecz, a former Bitcoin Core developer who had emailed Nakamoto, had the feeling the code was too well designed for one person.&lt;ref name="wallace"/&gt;

'''Thomas Neville Waul''' (January 5, 1813 &amp;ndash; July 28, 1903) was a [[Confederate States Army]] [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]] during the [[American Civil War]] (Civil War). Before the Civil War, he was a teacher, lawyer, judge and planter. He served for a year in the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]] from Texas. He was captured at the fall of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] on July 4, 1863 and exchanged in October 1863. After his promotion, Waul served in the Confederate [[Trans-Mississippi Department]]. He was wounded at the [[Battle of Jenkins' Ferry]]. After the Civil War, Waul was a farmer and lawyer who lived in Texas until his death at age 90.

Waul was born January 5, 1813, in the Sumter District, now [[Sumter County, South Carolina]], near [[Stateburg, South Carolina|Stateburg]].&lt;ref name="Eicher557"&gt;Eicher, John H., and [[David J.

Thomas N. Waul was a member of the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]] from Texas between February 19, 1861, and February 17, 1862, when a permanent Confederate government was established.&lt;ref name="Eicher557"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warner328"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faust809"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sifakis698"&gt;Sifakis, Stewart.

New York: Facts On File, 1988. {{ISBN|0-8160-1055-2}}. p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the Committee on Commercial Affairs and Committee on Indian Affairs.&lt;ref name="Sifakis698"/&gt; He opposed the African slave trade as a diplomatic effort and restrictions on the cotton trade.&lt;ref name="Faust809"/&gt; He supported establishment of the central government, free trade, and local defense.&lt;ref name="Faust809"/&gt; Waul lost his run for a seat in the [[First Confederate Congress]] of the regular [[Congress of the Confederate States]].&lt;ref name="Faust809"/&gt;

On May 17, 1862, Waul entered [[Confederate States Army]] service as [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of [[Waul's Legion]], which he recruited.&lt;ref name="Eicher557"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warner328"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boatner896"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sifakis698"/&gt;

On April 30, 1864, after being transferred to [[Arkansas]] to oppose Union [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Frederick Steele|Frederick Steele's]] [[Camden Expedition]], Brigadier General Waul was wounded in the left arm at the [[Battle of Jenkins' Ferry]].&lt;ref name="Eicher557"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warner328"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boatner896"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sifakis698"/&gt; He returned to service in September 1864 and until December 1864 commanded Brigade I, Division I, I Corps of the Trans-Mississippi Department.&lt;ref name="Eicher557"/&gt; From January 1865 to May 26, 1865, he commanded Brigade I, Division I, of the District of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona in the Trans-Mississippi Department.&lt;ref name="Eicher557"/&gt; There is no record of his parole.&lt;ref name="Eicher557"/&gt;

==Construction==

It was built with only an [[electric motor|electric]] drive, a 3.1-kW Sauer-Danfoss 24V DC electric motor. Coupled with a 24V 200Ah Setronic-Flamm GS gel battery, this gave a range of {{cvt|6|mi|km|order=flip}}, but a charging time of 24 hours.

==History==
''Freya'' was completed in 2002, and she was put to sea, starting voyages.&lt;ref name=Ingeniøren-2005-04-28/&gt;
In July 2002, out of the water for inspection and refit, it was crushed by a transport accident, when the truck it was on passed under a low bridge, and the attached crane was knocked over, crushing the conning tower and central portion. Insurance monies paid by the transport company were used to pay for repairs, making it seaworthy again, later in 2002. The repairs were done by Madsen and company.&lt;ref name=Ingeniøren-2002-10-01&gt; {{da icon}} {{cite web |url= https://ing.dk/artikel/ubaden-freja-sejler-igen-44356 |title= Ubåden Freja sejler igen |author= Signe Lund |date= 1 October 2002 |publisher= Ingeniøren }} &lt;/ref&gt;

After decommissioning, it was sunk to the bottom of the Øresund.&lt;ref name=Forte-2017-08-16/&gt;

[[File:The Wooing of Olwen - Illustration 1.png|thumb|So huge is his frame, Ysbaddaden requires great forks to prop up his eyelids. Illustration by [[John D. Batten]] (1892)]]

{{lang|mga|'''Ysbaddaden Bencawr'''}}; "Ysbaddaden, Chief of Giants," is the primary [[antagonist]] of the [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] romance ''[[Culhwch and Olwen|Culhwch ac Olwen]]''. A vicious [[Giants (Welsh folklore)|giant]] residing in a nigh unreachable castle, he is the father of [[Olwen]] and uncle of [[Goreu fab Custennin]]. 

[[Culhwch|Culhwch's]] father, [[Cilydd|King Cilydd son of Celyddon]], loses his wife [[Goleuddydd]] after a difficult childbirth. When Cilydd remarries, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother's attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful [[Olwen]], daughter of the [[giant (mythology)|giant]] Ysbaddaden. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin [[King Arthur|Arthur]]. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in [[Celliwig]] in [[Cornwall]] and asks for support and assistance.

Arthur agrees to help, and sends six warriors to join Culhwch in his search for Olwen. They travel onwards until they come across the "fairest of the castles of the world", and meet Ysbaddaden's [[shepherd]] brother, Custennin. They learn that the castle belongs to Ysbaddaden, that he stripped Custennin of his lands and murdered the shepherd's twenty-three children out of cruelty. Custennin set up a meeting between Culhwch and Olwen, and the maiden agrees to lead Culhwch and his companions to Ysbadadden's castle. The warrior [[Sir Kay|Cai]] pledges to protect the twenty-fourth son, [[Goreu fab Custennin|Goreu]], with his life.

The knights attack the castle by stealth, killing the nine porters and the nine watchdogs, and enter the giant's hall. Upon their arrival, Ysbaddaden attempts to kill Culhwch with a poison dart, but is outwitted and wounded, first by [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]], then by the enchanter [[Menw]], and finally by Culhwch himself. Eventually, Ysbaddaden relents, and agrees to give Culhwch his daughter on the condition that he complete a number of impossible tasks (''anoethau''), including hunting the [[Twrch Trwyth]] and recovering the exalted prisoner [[Mabon ap Modron]]. Culhwch accepts the giant's challenge and, with the help of Arthur and his knights, eventually completes the numerous tasks.

With the ''anoethau'' completed, Culhwch, Goreu and others who "wished ill to Ysbaddaden Bencawr" ride to his court. The giant's beard, skin and [[flesh]] are shaved off by Caw of Pictland and, accepting his humiliation and defeat, he is dragged away by Goreu, who avenges his murdered brothers by [[decapitation|beheading]] the giant. Ysbaddaden's head is placed on the spike of the citadel, Goreu claims his uncle's lands as his own, and Olwen is free to marry her love.

'''Óscar Eduardo Guerrero Silva''' (1971 – 1 February 2004), commonly referred to by his alias '''Z-8''' and/or '''The Winnie Pooh''', was a Mexican drug lord and high-ranking leader of Los Zetas, a Mexican criminal organization. 

Shortly after marrying, Guerrero Silva joined the [[Mexican Army]] in early 1992 and became an infantry soldier. After being promoted to [[corporal]] the following year, he deserted from the military in 1999, and began to work as an assassin for the Los Zetas and [[Gulf Cartel]], a drug trafficking organization, along with other ex-soldiers. His life as an outlaw overwhelmed him, and he later committed suicide through a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

==Criminal career==
Óscar Eduardo Guerrero Silva was born in [[Reynosa, Tamaulipas]] around the year 1971, and joined the [[Mexican Army]] on 28 January 1992 as an infantry soldier. The following year, he was promoted to [[corporal]]. Nonetheless, he eventually deserted from the Armed Forces in 1999 and was recruited by the drug trafficking organization known as the [[Gulf Cartel]], becoming one of the 50 most-wanted criminals in Mexico during his time.{{sfn|Grayson|2010|p=282}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los soldados que trajeron el caos|url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/229980.html|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=[[El Siglo de Torreón]]|date=11 August 2006|agency=Editora de la Laguna|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DtTpRJZa|archivedate=23 January 2013|deadurl=no|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Gustavo|title=También catean vivienda de Los Zetas en Nuevo León|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2004/02/04/046n1soc.php?origen=soc-jus.php&amp;fly=1|accessdate=26 January 2013|newspaper=[[La Jornada]]|date=4 February 2004|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DwrjHegx|archivedate=25 January 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2002, gunmen of Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel wearing police uniforms raided a prison in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]] and liberated three men accused of drug trafficking and a woman imprisoned for homicide.

Guerrero Silva was known for having one of the most bizarre and unique Mexican criminal nicknames, ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie Pooh]]'', but he was "hardly a lovable bear".&lt;ref name=yourfamily/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevenson|first=Mark|title=Outlandish Nicknames Suit Mexican Criminals|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/18/news/adfg-nicknames18|accessdate=26 January 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=18 July 2004|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DwrKs60L|archivedate=25 January 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 1 February 2004, elements of the extinct [[Agencia Federal de Investigación|Federal Investigative Agency]] (AFI) raided a residence at the Riveras del Río neighborhood in [[Guadalupe, Nuevo León]], near the city of [[Monterrey]], and discovered the corpse of Guerrero Silva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Catean casa en la que fue encontrado cadáver de narcotraficante|url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/notas/2004/107567.html |accessdate=24 December 2016 |newspaper=[[La Crónica de Hoy]]|date=3 February 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225004519/http://www.cronica.com.mx/notas/2004/107567.html |archivedate=25 February 2013|deadurl=no|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] had a gunshot wound from a 9mm pistol, suggesting that his death was an apparent suicide. Guerrero Silva was reportedly overwhelmed after the Mexican authorities had him under surveillance and because he believed his own accomplices were going to betray him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cardona|first=Jorge|title=Autoridades creen que elementos de la banda de narcos 'los zetas' estén en Monterrey|url=http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/341380.html|accessdate=26 January 2013|newspaper=[[Esmas.com]]|date=3 February 2004|agency=[[Televisa]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110205556/http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/341380.html|archivedate=25 January 2013|deadurl=no|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=agobiado/&gt;

==Personal life and family==
Gilberto López Barrera, the brother-in-law of Guerrero Silva and a member of Los Zetas drug cartel, was arrested in downtown [[Monterrey]] on 22 May 2005 and charged with a number of crimes. He is the brother of Ivonne López Barrera, a former romantic partner of Guerrero Silva.&lt;ref name=agobiado&gt;{{subscription required}} {{cite news|last=lvarez|first=Mario Alberto|title=Detienen a cunado de zeta|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/311696323|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=[[El Norte (Monterrey)]]|date=22 May 2005|agency=Editora El Sol, S.A. de C.V|pages=7|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, two years before joining the Mexican Army, Guerrero Silva married Gabriela Cervantes Zamorano. Both of them stopped seeing each other in 1997, and his wife later found out that he had deserted the military and was working for Los Zetas.&lt;ref name=desinteresado/&gt; Gabriela recalls that Guerrero Silva would send her money and call her on the phone every now and then, but that he seemed uninterested in their matrimony. Although married to Gabriela, Guerrero Silva had a romantic relationship with another woman, which explains why he visited [[Guadalupe, Nuevo León]] from [[Reynosa, Tamaulipas]] (his actual residence) periodically.&lt;ref name=desinteresado&gt;{{subscription required}} {{cite news|last=Ramírez|first=Rodrigo|title=Interroga la PGR a esposa de 'Zeta'|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/315773925|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=[[El Norte (Monterrey)]]|date=6 February 2004|agency=Editora El Sol, S.A. de C.V|pages=5|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
