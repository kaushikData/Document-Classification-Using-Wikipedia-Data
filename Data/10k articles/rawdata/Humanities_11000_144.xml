[[Image:Storybus 53.jpg|thumb|220px|The StoryBus in Chicago]]
'''America's Children's Museum on Wheels: StoryBus''' is a children's literacy museum on wheels that visits schools and community events in the [[Chicago area]]. Housed inside a 37-foot Winnebago, the bus promotes reading to students at the [[kindergarten]] and [[pre-k]] levels. Filled with a rotating collection of hands-on interactive exhibits, the StoryBus transports children inside the worlds of favorite children's stories, such as ''[[The Little Red Hen]]'', ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]'', and ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]''.

StoryBus has a special mission to serve low-income children who too often fall behind in the development of reading skills. StoryBus also provides teachers with an arts-based curriculum to reinforce the StoryBus experience and special training institutes for using the curriculum.

Launched in 2000, the StoryBus is a project of the [[Dolores Kohl Education Foundation]]. Members of the [[Kohl McCormick Academy of Outstanding Educators]] present at the institutes, mentor teachers at participating schools, and develop the curriculum materials. [[Merri Dee]] serves on the board.{{clear}}

The '''American Dialect Society''' ('''ADS'''), founded in 1889, is a [[learned society]] "dedicated to the study of the English language in North America, and of other [[language]]s, or [[dialect]]s of other languages, influencing it or influenced by it."&lt;ref name=NYT1985&gt;{{cite news|last=Flexner|first=Stuart B.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/books/one-language-highly-divisible.html?sq=%22American+Dialect+Society%22+1889&amp;scp=2&amp;st=nyt|title=One language, highly divisible|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 15, 1985|accessdate= February 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society publishes the academic journal, ''[[American Speech]]''.

Since its foundation, dialectologists in English-speaking North America have affiliated themselves with the American Dialect Society, an association which in its first constitution defined its objective as "the investigation of the spoken English of the United States and Canada" (Constitution, 1890). Over the years, its objective has remained essentially the same, only expanded to encompass "the English language in North America, together with other languages or dialects of other languages influencing it or influenced by it" (Fundamentals, 1991).&lt;ref name=Syl&gt;{{cite book|first=Sylvain |last=Auroux|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJDtIToTmcAC&amp;pg=PA2366&amp;lpg=PA2366&amp;dq=%22american+dialect+society%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5eDm-_bHly&amp;sig=25v5L9bqz-MgHb7noj_ZpH2-eJg|title= History of the Language Sciences|page=2366|publisher=Walter de Gruyter, 2006|isbn=3-11-016736-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organization was founded as part of an effort to create a comprehensive American dialect dictionary, a near century-long undertaking that culminated in the publication of the ''[[Dictionary of American Regional English]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT1985/&gt; In 1889, when [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] began editing the ''[[English Dialect Dictionary]]'', a group of American philologists founded the American Dialect Society with the ultimate purpose of producing a similar work for the United States.

Members of the Society began to collect material, much of which was published in the Society's journal ''Dialect Notes'', but little was done toward compiling a dictionary recording nationwide usage until [[Frederic G. Cassidy]] was appointed Chief Editor in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first= Joan Houston|chapter=The Dictionary of American Regional English|title=Language in the USA: Perspectives for the 21st Century|editor1-first=Edward |editor1-last=Finegan|editor2-first=John|editor2-last= Rickford|location= Cambridge|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2004|pages=94‚Äì95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume of the ''Dictionary of American Regional English'', covering the letters A-C, was published in 1985.&lt;ref name=NYT1985/&gt; The other major project of the Society is the Linguistic Atlas of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=Syl/&gt;

==Membership==
The Society has never had more than a few hundred active members. With so few scholars advancing the enterprise, the developments in the field came slowly.&lt;ref name=Syl/&gt; Members of the organization include "linguists, lexicographers, etymologists, grammarians, historians, researchers, writers, authors, editors, professors, university students, and independent scholars."&lt;ref name=Word2007&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americandialect.org/index.php/amerdial/subprime_voted_2007_word_of_the_year/|title= "Subprime" voted 2007 word of the year|work=Americandialect.org|publisher=American Dialect Society|date=January 4, 2008|accessdate=February 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities include a mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americandialect.org/index.php/amerdial/ads_l_the_american_dialect_society_email_discussion_list/|title=ADS-L: email discussion list|work=Americandialect.org|publisher=American Dialect Society|year=2012|accessdate=February 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629052939/http://www.americandialect.org/index.php/amerdial/ads_l_the_american_dialect_society_email_discussion_list/|archive-date=June 29, 2006|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which deals chiefly with [[American English]] but also carries some discussion of other issues of linguistic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0301E&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R605&amp;I=-3|date=January 29, 2003|first=Laurence|last=Horn|title=Re: Canadians in ADS|work=ADS-L|publisher=listserv.linguistlist.org|accessdate=February 2, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120719231552/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0301E&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R605&amp;I=-3|archive-date=July 19, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Word of the Year==
Since 1991, the American Dialect Society has designated one or more words or terms to be the ''[[word of the year]]''. ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that the American Dialect Society "probably started" the "word-of-the-year ritual".&lt;ref name=NYT2007/&gt; However, the "Gesellschaft f√ºr deutsche Sprache" (GfdS) has announced a word of the year since 1977.

In addition, the ADS has chosen its "Word of the 1990s" ('[[World Wide Web|web]]'), "Word of the 20th Century" ('[[jazz (word)|jazz]]'), and "Word of the Past Millennium" ('[[she]]'). The society also selects words in other categories that vary from year to year, such as "most original" or "most unnecessary" (or "most outrageous") and "most likely to succeed" (see: [[Word of the year]]).

A number of words chosen by the ADS are also on the [[lists of Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/30/twitter-declared-top-word-of-2009|title='Twitter' declared top word of 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Richard|last=Lea|date=November 30, 2009|accessdate=February 2, 2012|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/09words.htm|title=Word of the Year 2009|work=Merriam-Webster Online|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|year=2009|accessdate=February 2, 2012|author=Merriam-Webster staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''BC Racers''''' is a [[racing video game]] released by [[Core Design]] in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]] for the [[Sega CD]], in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]] for the [[Sega 32X]] and the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], and for the PC as [[freeware]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} in 1995. It was the third game released in the [[Chuck Rock|Chuck Rock series]] (even though the Chuck Rock connection isn't as prominent in this game). The game was designed by [[Toby Gard]], who later created [[Lara Croft]].

==Storyline==
''BC Racers'' tries to create a [[Racing video game|racing]] simulation by mixing the usual elements of games of this genre with the "[[prehistoric]]" theme. Particularly, the game takes place in the world of one of [[Core Design|Core]]'s iconic characters, [[Chuck Rock]]. The millionaire playboy caveman Millstone Rockafella has organized a BC bike race, the winner of which will receive the Ultimate Boulderdash Bike. Six groups of riders -one driving, one deploying weapons from the [[sidecar]]- from all around the prehistoric world will use their rock-powered sidecars to compete for this prize.

==Gameplay==
''BC Racers'' has four difficulty settings: Easy, Medium, Hard and Rockhard. Each of the settings has eight different circuits, making a total of 32 circuits in the game. There are also eight themes, from desert wastes to active volcanoes and massive jungles. The tracks need four laps to complete, and feature many special elements specific to the circuit's setting. Unusually for a game of this type, there are no [[power-up]]s, except for a "turbo" that the bikes can trigger every few seconds.

Both of the bikes' riders can use physical attacks to injure other drivers. If the bike gets beaten enough, it crashes out, giving the player extra [[Score (video games)|points]]. The same thing can happen to the player's bike.

Some [[Porting|ports]] of the game include a split-screen two player mode. The Sega CD version instead has a two player cooperative mode (one of the players controls the driver, while the other controls the fighting, steering and turbo).

==Playable characters==
Some of the riders in ''BC Racers'' come from other famous [[Core Design]] games, such as [[Chuck Rock]] and Chuck Rock Junior. Others are obvious references to several real world characters, such as Brick Jagger, Sid Viscous and Jimi Handtrix (referencing [[Mick Jagger]], [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]]).

==Reception==
Reviewing the Sega CD version, ''[[GamePro]]'' criticized the [[pixelated]] landscapes, minimal sound effects, and difficult controls when using a three-button controller, but praised the comical graphics and "lightweight" tone, and recommended it as a decent title for younger gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: BC Racers|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=79 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1995|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Digital Press'' gave the Sega CD version 7 out of 10, praising the controls and music, but the criticized the graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Santulli|first=Joe|title= Random Reviews|url=https://archive.org/stream/Digital_Press_Issue_27_1995-09_Santulli_Joe_US#page/n13/mode/2up|magazine= Digital Press|page= 14|publisher= |date= September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their review of the 32X version, ''[[GamePro]]'' commented that the graphics are sharper than in the Sega CD version, but look much worse during actual gameplay due to the choppy [[frame rate]] and prominent slowdown, especially during two-player mode. They nonetheless concluded that "BC Racers' numerous tracks, humorous attacks, and simultaneous two-player action will appeal to those looking for a lighthearted challenge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: BC Racers|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=82|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=July 1995|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that "there's nothing here you haven't seen before. ''Super Karts'', with its larger graphics and wide variety of power-ups, is still the reigning champion of cart-racers."&lt;ref name="NG9"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=9|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=September 1995|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the 3DO version, a ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic rated it as the worst racing game on the 3DO to date, citing the lack of depth to the car handling, the ugly-looking courses, and overall outdated feel of the game. He gave it one out of five stars.&lt;ref name="NG16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first= |title=BC Racers |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=16|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=April 1996|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It highlights the [[Black Canadian]] experience and to promote awareness about the complexities of contemporary Black youth experience in [[Ontario Canada|Ontario]].

The book consists of a foreword by the President of the Ontario Black History Society, Rosemary Sadlier, [[OOnt]] and work by various youth on issues of identity, belonging, and Canadian Black History.

The anthology was created in partnership with the Office of the Provincial Advocate of Children and Youth in Ontario a commission of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] which puts youth at its centre and uses rights to improve the lives and conditions of youth in systems of care in Ontario. The anthology was started in January 2012 and was published by General Store Publishing House in July 2012.

The title "Basodee" comes from the Trinidadian creole word of the same name meaning "half-conscious" and "disoriented." The term was chosen as the title of the book to express the confusion and identity crisis of Black Canadian youth.

The book consists of photography, essays, short stories and poetry by 13 youth expressing what it is to be young, Black and Canadian. Many are immigrants to the country or first-generation Canadians. Some have had experience with the mental health or criminal justice system and some are in care. Each shares their personal stories and views on what it means to be Black and Canadian today.

==Context==
''Basodee'' makes its debut at a time when concern about escalating gun violence in the City of Toronto such as the shooting at the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] on June 2, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/1205036--shooting-reported-at-eaton-centre |title=One dead, seven injured in Eaton Centre shooting |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2012-06-03|accessdate=2012-09-27 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] on July 16, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=07/17/2012 12:01 am Updated: 07/20/2012 12:44 pm |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/07/17/shyanne-charles-joshua-yasay-danzig-shooting-_n_1678359.html |title=Shyanne Charles, Joshua Yasay, Identified As Victims Killed In Toronto Block Party Shooting (PHOTOS) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in statements by Toronto Mayor [[Rob Ford]] that he wishes to force individuals convicted of a gun charge out of the city and more money from the province during a 'gun summit' for "anti-crime" initiatives such as the Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/tavis |title=Toronto Police Service :: To Serve and Protect |publisher=Torontopolice.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which places increased police presence in priority neighbourhoods.

In response to the July 16 shooting, the Toronto Star published a cartoon by Michael de Adder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadder.net |title=Home |publisher=de Adder |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; cartoon depicting a little black girl's alleged "expected" injuries before the age of two -"boo boo from highchair, mark from tricycle, and head laceration from a medium-caliber bullet."  After numerous complaints the Star apologized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/corrections/article/1230430‚Äîapology|title=Apology|publisher=Thestar.com|accessdate=2012-09-27|location=Toronto|date=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the cartoon's insensitivity to the complex issues at play in gun violence. It is media sanctioned expressions of negative stereotypes like these that ''Basodee'' tries to fight, using the voices of many of the youth these stereotypes and top-down solutions attempt to silence.

When many expressions of a voice other than the mainstream Canadian voice are being squelched and co-opted, such as ''Sway Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swaymag.ca |title=Sway Magazine |publisher=Swaymag.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Caribana]] due to economic considerations and a clear climate of devaluation of diversity, the Basodee collective comes together to bring true diversity back to the Canadian cultural milieu and show youth commitment to celebrations such as [[Black History Month]], which are  often seen as outdated and unnecessary in a post-racial "multicultural" society such as Toronto. Michael de Adder and Rob Ford's comments and many of the pieces in ''Basodee'', however, prove that Toronto is very much a race conscious city and is no where near embracing multiculturalism as many have been publicly threatened by the chief city official with exile.

==Major themes==
Some of the major themes in ''Basodee'' include identity, struggle and belonging. The book argues that part of the "basodeeness" of Black youth stems from "mis-education" about their history. The term "mis-education" is borrowed from [[Carter G. Woodson]]'s book [[The Mis-Education of the Negro]]. ''Basodee'' contains essays outlining the history of discrimination  in the Canadian education system against Blacks and the present struggle for solutions to this ongoing discrimination such as the establishment of the Africentric Alternative School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2009/09/08/africentric-alternative-school.html |title=Africentric school opens in Toronto - Toronto - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also contains an essay tracing a history of Canadian human rights abuses against Blacks extending into the present day. ''Basodee'' argues that this history which is seldom spoken about form a major part of Black youth's basodeness. When many Black youth feel that dropping out of school and turning to a life of crime are the only way to protect themselves from discrimination and secure against mainstream attempts to erode their identity.

Given this real struggle of Black youth to safeguard their identity, the main thesis of ''Basodee'' is that Black youth in Canada have not been given a place of belonging in Canadian society, despite being here for generations and even since the time of slavery. Thus, the book presents examples from its contributors of how to find that identity ‚Äì such as remembering where you came from, the struggles you have gone through, and undergoing [[negrescence]].

==Purpose==
The collective hopes that ''Basodee'' will one day become a resource to Black youth struggling to find themselves in the midst of media stereotypes, threats of exile, and stigmatization. In partnering with the Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, the collective hopes to get the book in the hands of youth in the system who need the ideas it explores the most ‚Äì Crown wards, youth in detention centres, and youth in care. The collective is currently looking for more organizations that work with Black youth as part of their mandate to share the book and also partner with in the future.

It lies just outside the northeast border of the Federal District (Distrito Federal). The name derives from the [[Nahuatl]] words ‚Äúchimalli‚Äù (shield), hua (possession particle) and can (place), this would mean "Place of Shields".The ancient name of the city by its founders was ‚ÄúChimalhuacantoyac‚Äù.The word Atenco, is also Nahuatl; A, ‚Äúwater‚Äù; tentli, ‚Äúlip‚Äù and co, ‚Äúplace‚Äù, hence would mean ‚Äúat the water side‚Äù.&lt;ref name=Enciclopedia&gt;{{cite web|first= |last= |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de Mexico Estado de Mexico Chimalhuac√°n. |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15031a.htm |publisher=Mexican government |location= |language= |trans-title=Encyclopedia  of Mexico State municipalities, Chimalhuac√°n. |year= |accessdate=1 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015136/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15031a.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chimalhuac√°n glyph appears on the Quinatzin codex, symbolizing a round shield on a hill, has an alternate interpretation, the name Chimalltepetl = "Hill shields" or "shields site"; most probably referring to the "Chimalhuache" hill, mountain located within the municipality and near the site.&lt;ref name= Enciclopedia   /&gt;

It is considered one of the cradles of Mesoamerican civilization due to the finding in 1984, of the "Chimalhuac√°n Man", whose remains are some 12,000 old.

==History==
The Chimalhuac√°n [[Altepetl]] was founded 1259 by three [[Tlatoani]]s (brothers) named Huauxomatl, Chalchiutlatonac and Tlatzcantecuhtli. These tlatoanis and their people originated from [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and [[Culhuac√°n (altepetl)|Colhuacan]]. They spoke [[Chichimec]] y [[Mexica]] languages; since their ancestors were [[Acolhua]] and Mexica, but with time their customs merged and Nahuatl became the dominant language.  Chimalhuac√°n was one of the Texcoco Alt√©petl, thus belonged to the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] (M√©xico, Texcoco y Tlacopan), as of 1431. These villages dominated the territory part of current Mexico.&lt;ref name= Enciclopedia /&gt;

The site, also known as "Los Pochotes", one of the few [[Mesoamerican chronology|late Postclassical]] period (1200-1521 CE.) known examples of palace architecture in the Basin of Mexico. Although the place was inhabited from the preclassical or Formative, the building, a place or tecpan (Sp), that now can be seen corresponds to the village founded by Chichimec‚Äôs towards 1250 AD. Chimalhuac√°n would become an important Texcoco tributary.&lt;ref name=Arqueo  &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= Chimalhuac√°n,  Bajo la sombra de los volcanes|trans-title=Chimalhuac√°n, Under the sahdow of the volcanoes |journal=  Arqueomex |location=  |url= http://www.arqueomex.com/S9N5n4Esp35.html|language=Spanish |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occupation Stages==
Chimalhuac√°n had three main occupation epochs identified:

===Late Preclassical period===
Probably founded and originally occupied between 400 a 100 BCE.

===Classical period===
There is occupation evidence during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|classical period]], between 200 and 450 CE.

===Postclassical period===
There are two occupation stages reported, during the early (800 to 1000 CE) and late (1100 to 1521 CE) Postclassical

==Relevant historical events==
Chimalhuac√°n registered events:

===Nezahualc√≥yotl Crowining===
Before the [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Netzahualcoyotl]] crowning as Texcoco Tlatoani, triple alliance troops from Mexico, went to Texcoco and accompanied Netzahualcoyotl,  the [[Tenochtitlan]] Tlatoani traveled, via de Santa Martha plains, and upon arriving at Chimalhuac√°n decreed an amnesty for all villages, that belonging to Texcoco, fought against them siding with the [[Tepaneca]], as was the case of Huexotla; the fourth Mexica Tlatoani [[Itzcoatl]] (1427‚Äì1440) offered pardon in exchange for their surrender, as otherwise allied troops would enter and take their city, Huexotla did not accept the offer and decided to fight, the battle was brief as, Itzc√≥atl successor, [[Moctezuma I]] (1440‚Äì1469) took their king prisoner and the troops surredendered shortly thereafter. Finally Netzahualcoyotl was proclaimed Texcoco Tlatoani.&lt;ref name= Enciclopedia   /&gt;

===Moctezuma I - First Visit===
Moctezuma I or Moctezuma Ilhuicamina was twice at this town, perhaps due to the closeness of the Texcoco Lake to Tenochtitlan. At a point in time he was taken prisoner by the Chalcas, whom offered his life to Huejotzingo, they rejected the offer. Then he was taken before [[Maxtla]] (Tlatoani Tepaneca and last independent governor of the [[Azcapotzalco]] Alt√©petl (1426‚Äì1428), with the same purpose, but Maxtla was not interested. Cuateotl freed him and advised him to go back to M√©xico via Chimalhuac√°n.&lt;ref name= Enciclopedia   /&gt;

===Moctezuma I ‚Äì Second Visit===
The second time Moctezuma was when he accompanied Netzahualcoyotl, after their triumph against the Tepaneca.&lt;ref name= Enciclopedia   /&gt;

==Structures==
The archaeological area approximate covers one hectare. Architectural remains in the area correspond to a residential area of Azteca phase III and it has been determined that it is a governor palace. Spaniards destroyed the Chimalhuac√°n buildings and city and built their chapels.&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garc√≠a Chavez|first=Ra√∫l E.

[[File:Christmas Day in the Workhouse.png|thumb|right|352px|A [[postcard]], from about 1905, which carries and illustrates the first two verses.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2012|p=87}}]]
'''''In the Workhouse : Christmas Day''''', better known as '''''Christmas Day in the Workhouse''''', is a dramatic [[monologue]] written as a [[ballad#literary ballads|ballad]] by campaigning journalist [[George Robert Sims]] and first published in ''[[Sunday Referee|The Referee]]'' for the Christmas of 1877.{{sfn|Connelly|2012|p=36}}  It appeared in Sims' regular ''Mustard and Cress'' column under the pseudonym [[Dagonet]] and was collected in book form in 1881 as one of ''The Dagonet Ballads'',{{sfn|Connelly|2012|p=36}} which sold over 100,000 copies within a year.{{sfn|Kemp|Mitchell|Trotter|1997|p=363}}

It is a criticism of the harsh conditions in English and Welsh [[workhouse]]s under the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834 Poor Law]].{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=72}} As a popular and sentimental [[melodrama]], the work has been [[parody|parodied]] many times.{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=72}}

==Opening verses==
&lt;poem&gt;
It is Christmas Day in the workhouse, 
And the cold, bare walls are bright 
With garlands of green and holly, 
And the place is a pleasant sight; 
For with clean-washed hands and faces, 
In a long and hungry line 
The paupers sit at the table, 
For this is the hour they dine.

And the guardians and their ladies, 
Although the wind is east, 
Have come in their furs and wrappers, 
To watch their charges feast; 
To smile and be condescending, 
Put pudding on pauper plates. 
To be hosts at the workhouse banquet 
They've paid for ‚Äî with the rates.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Synopsis==
The poem tells of an old [[Devon]] trader named John who has been reduced to poverty and so must eat at the workhouse on Christmas Day.  To the shock of the [[board of guardians|guardian]]s and master of the workhouse, he reviles them for the events of the previous Christmas when his wife, Nance, was starving. They could not afford food so, for the first time, he went to the workhouse but was told that food would not be given out ‚Äì they would have to come in to eat.  At that time, families might be separated inside such institutions but his wife refused to be parted from her husband of fifty years on Christmas Day. He went out again in search of scraps but she died before he returned and so now he is bitter at the memory.{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=72}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/story-behind-moving-victorian-poem-1801554|title=The story behind moving Victorian poem In The Workhouse, Christmas Day|date=20 December 2011|accessdate=23 December 2015|publisher=Wales Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote=''Christmas Day in the Workhouse'' was for a time vigorously denounced as a mischievous attempt to set the paupers against their betters, but when a well-known social reformer died recently I read in several papers that he always declared that it was reading ''Christmas Day in the Workhouse'' which started him on his ceaseless campaign for old age pensions, a campaign which he lived to see crowned with victory.

[[George Robert Sims|Sims]] was a [[Investigative journalism|campaigning journalist]] who, while young, had investigated the poor of [[East End of London|London's East End]].{{sfn|Broadview Press|2012|p=149}}  The details in this ballad were perhaps not accurate as the poor law regulations did permit old couples to cohabit and allow for short-term relief to be given out,{{sfn|Higginbotham|2012|p=88}} but its melodramatic and sentimental style made it very popular and such work made Sims a great success.{{sfn|Broadview Press|2012|p=149}}  He went on to write detailed expos√©s of the life of the poor for periodicals such as the ''[[Sunday Dispatch|Weekly Dispatch]]'', ''[[The Pictorial World]]'' and ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'', which had been founded by [[Charles Dickens]].{{sfn|Broadview Press|2012|p=149}}

{{Ancient Near East topics}}
The '''chronology of the ancient Near East''' provides a framework of dates for various events, rulers and dynasties. Individual inscriptions and texts customarily record events in terms of a succession of officials or rulers, taking forms like "in the year X of king Y". Thus by piecing together many records a [[relative dating|relative chronology]] is arrived at, relating dates in cities over a wide area. For the first millennium BC, the relative [[chronology]] can be tied to actual calendar years by identifying significant astronomical events. An inscription from the tenth year of Assyrian king [[Ashur-Dan III]] refers to an eclipse of the sun, and astronomical calculations among the range of possible dates identify the eclipse as having occurred 15 June 763 BC. The date can be corroborated with other mentions of astronomical events and a secure [[Absolute dating|absolute chronology]] established, that ties the relative chronologies into our calendar.

For the third and second millennia, the correlation is not so fixed. A key document is the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]], preserving record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] tablets during the reign of the  Babylonian king [[Ammisaduqa]], known to be the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]] in the ''relative calendar''. In the series, the conjunction of the rise of Venus with the new moon provides a fixed point, or rather three fixed points, for the conjunction is a [[Periodic function|periodic]] occurrence. Astronomical calculation can therefore fix, for example, the first dates of the reign of Hammurabi in this manner either as 1848, 1792, or 1736 BC, depending on whether the "high" (or "long"), "[[Middle chronology|middle]]" or "low (or short) chronology" is followed.

For the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd]] and [[2nd millennium BC|2nd]] millennia BC, the following periods can be distinguished:
#[[Early Bronze Age]]: A series of rulers and dynasties whose existence is based mostly on the [[Sumerian King List]] besides some that are attested [[Epigraphy|epigraphically]] (e.&amp;nbsp;g., [[En-me-barage-si]]). No absolute dates within a certainty better than a century can be assigned to this period.
#[[Middle Bronze Age|Middle]] to [[Late Bronze Age]]: Beginning with the [[Akkadian Empire]] around 2300 BC, the chronological evidence becomes internally more consistent. Essentially, for this period, a good picture can be drawn of who succeeded whom, and synchronisms between [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and the more robust [[chronology of Ancient Egypt]] can be established. The assignment of absolute dates is a matter of dispute; the conventional ''middle chronology'' fixes the [[sack of Babylon]] at 1595 BC while the ''short chronology'' fixes it at 1531 BC.
#The [[Bronze Age collapse]]: a "Dark Age" begins with the fall of Babylonian Dynasty III (Kassite) around 1200 BC, the invasions of the [[Sea Peoples]] and the collapse of  the [[Hittite Empire]].
#[[Early Iron Age]]: around 900 BC, historical data, written records become more numerous once more, with the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], enabling the certain assignment of absolute dates. Classical sources such as the [[Canon of Ptolemy]], the works of [[Berossus]] and the [[Hebrew Bible]] provide chronological support and synchronisms. An eclipse in 763 BC anchors the [[Assyria]]n list of imperial officials.

==Variant Bronze Age chronologies==
[[File:Mesopotamian Chronology 2-2011-29-03.png|thumb|Middle chronology of the main dominations]]
Due to the sparsity of sources throughout the "Dark Age", the history of the Near Eastern [[Bronze Age]]  down to the end of the [[Third Babylonian Dynasty]] is a "floating chronology". In other words, it fits together internally as a "relative chronology" but not as an "absolute chronology".

The major schools of thought on the length of the Dark Age are separated by 56 or 64 years. This is because the key source for their dates is the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] and the visibility of Venus has a 56/64{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} year cycle. More recent work by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] has suggested that the fundamental 8-year cycle of Venus is a better metric.&lt;ref name="ultra"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0311035] Gurzadyan, V. G., ''On the Astronomical Records and Babylonian Chronology'', Akkadica, v 119‚Äì120 (2000), pp. 175‚Äì184.)&lt;/ref&gt; (see update in &lt;ref name="ultra1"&gt;Warburton, D.A., The Fall of Babylon in 1499: Another Update, in Akkadica, v 132, 1 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="ultra2"&gt;Warburton, D.A., A Rejoinder in favour of an Ultra-Low Chronology, Akkadica, v 134, 17 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;) There are also some scholars who discount the validity of the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa entirely. There have been other attempts to anchor the chronology using records of eclipses and other methods, but they are not yet widely supported. The alternative major chronologies are defined by the date of the 8th year of the reign of [[Ammisaduqa]], king of Babylon. This choice then defines the reign of [[Hammurabi]].

The ''[[middle chronology]]'' (reign of Hammurabi 1792‚Äì1750 BC) is commonly encountered in literature, and many current textbooks on the archaeology and history of the ancient Near East continue using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhrt|first=A.|title=Ancient Near East c. 3000‚Äì330 BC |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge|page=12|location=London|isbn=0-415-16763-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potts|first=D.

A recent analysis combining [[dendrochronology]] and radiocarbon dating pointed to the middle chronology as being most likely. A further refinement by the same group shifted that to the "low-middle chronology" ie 8 years lower.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, S. W.; Kromer, B.; Kuniholm, P. I.; and Newton, M.

As is mentioned below, at present, there are no continuous chronologies for the Near East and a floating chronology has been developed using trees in Anatolia for the Bronze and Iron Ages. Until a continuous sequence is developed, the usefulness of dendrochronology for improving the chronology of the Ancient Near East is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Anatolian tree rings and the absolute chronology of the eastern Mediterranean, 2220‚Äì718 BC Kuniholm, Peter Ian, Kromer, Bernd, Manning, Sturt W, Newton, Maryanne, et al.

The following table gives an overview of the competing proposals, listing some key dates and the deviation relative to the short chronology:

The chronologies of Mesopotamia, the Levant and Anatolia depend significantly on the [[chronology of Ancient Egypt]]. To the extent that there are problems  in the Egyptian chronology, these issues will be inherited in chronologies based on synchronisms with Ancient Egypt.

==Sources of chronological data==

===Inscriptional===
Thousands of cuneiform tablets have been found in an area running from Anatolia to Egypt. While many are the ancient equivalent of modern grocery receipts, these tablets, along with inscriptions on buildings and public monuments, provide the major source of chronological information for the ancient Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Cuneiform Texts and the Writing of History, Marc van de Mieroop, Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-19532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underlying issues====
*State of materials
While there are some relatively pristine objects, such as you might see in the Louvre or the British Museum, the vast majority of recovered tables and inscriptions are in much worse condition. They have been broken with only portions found, intentionally defaced, and damaged by weather or the effects of being buried underground. Many tablets were not even baked in antiquity and have to be carefully handled until they are heated properly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlj/2003/cdlj2003_001.html] Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provenance
The site of an item's recovery is an important piece of information for archaeologists. Unfortunately, two factors impinge on this.  First, in ancient times old materials were often reused either as building material or fill, sometimes at a great distance from the original location. Secondly, looting has been a fact of life for archaeological sites, dating at least back to Roman times. The provenance of a looted object is difficult or impossible to determine.
*Multiple versions
Over time, key documents like the [[Sumerian King List]] were repeatedly copied across the generations. As a result, there are sometimes multiple versions of a chronological source that differ from each other. It can be very hard to determine which version is correct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section2/tr211.htm] Translation of Sumerian King List&lt;/ref&gt;
*Translation
The translation of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, especially given the damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, our knowledge of the underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done now may be quite different than one done in AD 1900. The result of all this is that there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. Worse yet, many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.
*Slant
Many of our important source documents, such as the Assyrian King List, are the products of government and religious establishments. They often have a built-in slant in favor of the king or god in charge. A king may even take credit for a battle or construction project of an earlier ruler. The Assyrians in particular have a literary tradition of always putting the best possible face on history. The tablets or inscriptions in question still have value, though one does have to keep the slant in mind.

====King Lists====
Keeping historical lists of rulers was traditional in the ancient Near East.

*[[Sumerian King List]]
Covers rulers of Mesopotamia from a time "before the flood" up to the fall of the Isin Dynasty. For many early city-states it is the only source of chronological data. A major problem is that many early rulers are listed with fantastically long reigns. There has been some speculation that this stems from an error transcribing from the base 60 arithmetic of the Sumerians to the decimal-based system of the later Akkadians.&lt;ref&gt;"A Mathematical Approach to Certain Dynastic Spans in the Sumerian King List," Dwight W. Young, ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', Vol. 47, No. 2 (Apr., 1988), pp. 123‚Äì129&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Babylonian King List]]
This list deals only with the rulers of Babylon. It has been found in two versions, Babylonian King List A and Babylonian King List B. The later dynasties in the list reflect the Kassite and Sealand periods of Babylon. There is also a Babylonian King List of the Hellenistic Period which covers the later part of the 1st millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/k/kinglist/babylonian_hellenistic.html] Babylonian King List of the Hellenistic Period&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Assyrian King List]]
Found in multiple differing copies, this tablet lists all the kings of Assyria and their regnal lengths back into the mists of time, with the portions with reasonable data beginning at around the 14th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/k/kinglist/assyrian.html] Assyrian King List at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with the various Assyrian chronicles, the Assyrian King List anchors the chronology of the 1st millennium.
*[[Waddell's chronology|Indus Valley King List]]
A list of [[Indus Valley Civilization]] kings was compiled by [[Laurence Waddell]], but it is not generally accepted or well regarded by mainstream academia.&lt;ref name="Macnaughton1932"&gt;{{cite book|author=Duncan Macnaughton|title=A scheme of Egyptian chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLYrAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 October 2012|year=1932|publisher=Luzac &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chronicles====
Many chronicles have been recovered in the ancient Near East. Most are partial or fragmentary, but when combined with other sources, they provide a rich source of chronological data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/chron00.html |work=Livius |title=Mesopotamian Chronicles |date=21 May 2017|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Synchronistic Chronicle
Found in the library of Assurbanipal in Nineveh, it records the interaction of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires, from the Assyrian point of view. While useful, the consensus is that this chronicle should not be considered reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc21/synchronistic1.html] Synchronistic Chronicle at Livius.org&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chronicle P]]
While quite incomplete, this tablet provides the same type of information as the Assyrian Synchronistic Chronicle, but from the Babylonian point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc22/p.html] Chronicle P at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Royal Chronicle of Lagash
The Sumerian King List omits any mention of [[Lagash]], even though it was clearly a major power during the period covered by the list. The Royal Chronicle of Lagash appears to be an attempt to remedy that omission, listing the kings of Lagash in the form of a chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/cm/lagash.html] Royal Chronicle of Lagash at Livius.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe the chronicle to be either a parody of the Sumerian King List or a complete fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Mesopotamian Chronicles,Jean-Jacques Glassner,(2004) {{ISBN|1-58983-090-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Royal inscriptions====

In general, political figures in the ancient Near East liked to take credit for public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler are likely to have some sort of inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. These are very useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.

====Year lists====

Unlike current calendars, most ancient calendars were based on how long the current ruler had been in power. A year might be "the 5th year in the reign of Hammurabi". As part of this, each royal year was given a title, like "the year Ur was defeated". Most often this reflected a deed of the ruler. The compilation of these years are called date lists.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/yearnames/yn_index.html] Mesopotamian Year Names&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eponym (limmu) lists====

In Assyria, a royal official or [[limmu]] was selected every year of a king's reign. Many copies of these lists have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/li-ln/limmu/limmu_2.html] Assyrian Eponym List 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire 910‚Äì612 B.C., by Alan Millard. State Archives of Assyria Studies 11, Helsinki: Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 1994. xvi + 153 pp., 20 plates&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, details are not always clear-cut. There are sometimes too many or few ''limm≈´'' for the length of a king's reign and sometimes the different versions of the eponym list disagree on a limmu. An example is the [[Mari Eponym Chronicle]]. There is now a Assyrian Revised Eponym List which attempts to resolve some of these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Gojko Barjamovic, Thomas Hertel and Mogens T. Larsen, Ups and Downs at Kanesh: Chronology, History and Society in the Old Assyrian Period (Leiden: Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade, diplomatic, and disbursement records====

As is often the case in archaeology, it is everyday records that give the best picture of a civilization. Cuneiform tablets were constantly moving around the ancient Near East, offering alliances (sometimes including daughters for marriage), threatening war, acting as shipping documents for mundane supplies or settling accounts receivable. Most were tossed away after use the way that we would discard unwanted receipts. Fortunately for us, tablets are durable and many are well-preserved even when used as material for wall filler in new construction.

*[[Amarna letters]]

The classic example. A number of cuneiform tablets were found at Amarna in Egypt, the city of the pharaoh [[Akhenaten]]. They were written mostly in Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the time. Several named rulers in the region including the kings of Assyria and Babylon. Assuming that the correct kings have been identified, it locks the chronology of the ancient Near East to that of Egypt, at least from the middle of the 2nd millennium.

===Classical===
Some data sources are available to us from the classical period:
*[[Berossus]]
Berossus was a Babylonian astronomer living during the Hellenistic period. He wrote a history of Babylon which has not survived to modern times. Luckily, portions of this work were preserved by other classical writers.
*Canon of Ptolemy or [[Canon of Kings]]
This book provides a list of kings starting at around 750 BC in Babylon and forward through the Persian and Roman periods, in an astronomical context. It is used to help define the chronology of the 1st millennium.
*Hebrew Bible
Not having the benefit of being written into clay and buried, the records of the Hebrews have an additional layer of time to work through in being used as a source for chronology. On the other hand, the Hebrews did live pretty much in a territory directly in the crosshairs of Babylon, Assyria, Egypt and the Hittites, giving them a front row seat to actions in the area. Mainly of use in the 1st millennium and with the Assyrian New Kingdom.

===Astronomical===
*[[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]]

A record of the movements of Venus during the reign of a king of the First Babylonian Dynasty. Using it, various scholars have proposed dates for the fall of Babylon based on the 56/64 year cycle of Venus.  The mentioned recent work suggesting that the fundamental 8-year cycle of Venus is a better metric, led to the proposal of an "ultra-low" chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Gurzadyan, V. G., The Venus Tablet and Refraction, ''Akkadica'', v. 124 (2003), pp. 13‚Äì17.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eclipses====

A number of lunar and solar eclipses have been suggested for use in dating the ancient Near East. Many suffer from the vagueness of the original tablets in showing that an actual eclipse occurred. At that point, it becomes a question of using computer models to show when a given eclipse would have been visible at a site, complicated by difficulties in modeling the slowing rotation of the earth, [[Delta T]]. One important event is the [[Assyrian eclipse|Nineveh eclipse]], found in an Assyrian limmu list q.e. "Bur-Sagale of Guzana, revolt in the city of Ashur. In the month Simanu an eclipse of the sun took place." This eclipse is considered to be solidly dated to 15 June 763 BC. Another important event is the [[Ur III]] Lunar/Solar Eclipse pair in the reign of [[Shulgi]]. Most calculations for dating using eclipses have assumed that the Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa is a legitimate source.&lt;ref name="ultra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Wayne A., "Ancient Astronomical Observations and Near Eastern Chronology", ''JACF'', v.3 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dendrochronology===

[[Dendrochronology]] attempts to use the variable growth pattern of trees, expressed in their rings, to build up a chronological timeline. At present, there are no continuous chronologies for the Near East. A floating chronology has been developed using trees in Anatolia for the Bronze and Iron Ages.  Until a continuous sequence is developed, the usefulness for improving the chronology of the Ancient Near East is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Anatolian tree rings and the absolute chronology of the eastern Mediterranean, 2220‚Äì718 BC Kuniholm, Peter Ian, Kromer, Bernd, Manning, Sturt W, Newton, Maryanne, et al. Nature. London: Jun 27, 1996. Vol. 381, Iss. 6585; pp. 780‚Äì783&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dendrochronological Dating in Anatolia: The Second Millennium B.C."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter I. Kuniholm, Maryanne W. Newton, Carol B. Griggs, &amp; Pamela J. Sullivan, Der Anschnitt, Anatolian Metal III, Beiheft 18, 2005, pp. 41‚Äì47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=="dendro_2016"&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://dendro.cornell.edu/projects/aegean.php|title=Aegean Dendrochronology Project |series=Cornell Tree-Ring Laboratory |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in tying the chronology to the modern day lies primarily in the Roman period, for which few good wood samples have been found, and many of those turn out to be imported from outside the Near East.&lt;ref name=="dendro_2016"/&gt;

===Radiocarbon dating===

As in Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean, radiocarbon dates run one or two centuries earlier than the dates proposed by archaeologists. It is not at all clear which group is right, if either.&lt;ref&gt;Recent Developments in Near Eastern Chronology and Radiocarbon Dating, Michael G. Hasel, Institute of Archaeology, Southern Adventist University, Origins Vol 56 2004, pp. 6‚Äì31.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of accelerator based carbon dating techniques may help clear up the issue. Another promising front is the dating of lime plaster from structures.&lt;ref&gt;New Uses for Old Laboratory techniques, Jason A. Rech, Near Eastern Archaeology, Dec. 2004; 67,4. pp. 212‚Äì219.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, radiocarbon dates from the final destruction of [[Ebla]] have been shown to definitely favour the middle chronology (with the fall of Babylon and Aleppo at c. 1595 BC), and do not seem to fall with the ultra-low chronology (same event at c. 1499 BC), although it is emphasized that this is not to be seen as a decisive argument.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiae, P.

===Synchronisms===

====Egypt====
At least as far back as the reign of [[Thutmose I]], Egypt took a strong interest in the ancient Near East. At times they occupied portions of the region, a favor returned in later days by the Assyrians. Some key synchronisms:
*[[Battle of Kadesh]], involving [[Ramses II]] of Egypt (in his 5th year of reign) and [[Muwatalli II]] of the Hittite empire. Recorded by both Egyptian and Hittite records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hittites.info/history.aspx?text%3Dhistory%2FMiddle+Late+Empire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014163832/http://www.hittites.info/history.aspx?text=history%2FMiddle+Late+Empire.htm |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Battle of Kadesh ‚Äì Hittite Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;
*Peace treaty between Ramses II of Egypt (in his 21st year of reign) and [[Hattusili III]] of the Hittites. Recorded by both Egyptian and Hittite records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/ramses-hattusili-treaty.htm] Treaty between Egypt and the Hittite Empire&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Amenhotep III]] (Amenophis III) marries the daughter of [[Shuttarna II]] of [[Mitanni]]. There is also a record of messages from the pharaoh to [[Kadashman-Enlil I]] of Babylon in the Amarna Letter (EA1‚Äì5). Other Amarna letters link Amenhotep III to [[Burnaburiash II]] of Babylon (EA6) and [[Tushratta]] of Mitanni (EA17‚Äì29) as well.
*[[Akhenaten]] (Amenhotep IV) married the daughter of Tushratta of Mitanni (as did his father Amenhotep III), leaving a number of records on the matter. He also corresponded with [[Burna-Buriash II]] of Babylon (EA7‚Äì11, 15), and [[Ashuruballit I]] of Assyria (EA15‚Äì16)

There are problems with using Egyptian chronology. Besides some minor issues of regnal lengths and overlaps there are three long periods of poorly documented chaos in the history of ancient Egypt, the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]], and the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]], whose lengths are not well understood. This means the Egyptian Chronology is actually made up of three floating chronologies.

====Indus Valley====

There is much evidence that the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] civilization of the [[Indus Valley]] traded with the region. This is demonstrated by clay seals found at Ur III and in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;Gadd, C. J. ‚ÄúSeals of Ancient Indian Style Found at Ur.‚Äù Proceedings of the British Academy 18 (1932): 191‚Äì210.&lt;/ref&gt; Seals and beads were also found at the site of [[Esnunna]]. &lt;ref&gt;Henri Frankfort, The Indus civilization and the Near East. Annual Bibliography of Indian Archaeology for 1932, Leyden, VI, pp. 1-12, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if the land of [[Meluhha]] does indeed refer to the Indus Valley, then there are extensive trade records ranging from the Akkadian Empire until the Babylonian Dynasty I.

====Thera and Eastern Mediterranean====

Goods from Greece made their way into the ancient Near East, directly in Anatolia and via the island of [[Cyprus]] in the rest of the region and Egypt. A Hittite king, Tudhaliya IV, even captured Cyprus as part of an attempt to enforce a blockade of the Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;Urbanism on Late Bronze Age Cyprus: LC II in Retrospect, Ora Negbi, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, Feb 2005, Iss. 337; pp. 1‚Äì45&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[minoan eruption|eruption of the Thera volcano]] provides a possible time marker for the region. A large eruption, it would have sent a plume of ash directly over Anatolia and filled the sea in the area with floating pumice. This pumice appeared in Egypt, apparently via trade. Current excavations in the Levant may also add to the timeline. The exact date of the volcanic eruption has been the subject of strong debate, with dates ranging between 1628 and 1520 BC. Radiocarbon dating has placed it at between 1627&amp;nbsp;BC and 1600&amp;nbsp;BC with a 95% degree of probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Friedrich|first=Walter L|authorlink=|author2=Kromer, B |author3=Friedrich, M |author4=Heinemeier, J |author5=Pfeiffer, T |author6=Talamo, S |title=Santorini Eruption Radiocarbon Dated to 1627‚Äì1600 B.C.|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5773|pages=548|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006|doi=10.1126/science.1125087|id=|accessdate=10 March 2007 |pmid=16645088 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manning |first=Sturt W |author2=Ramsey, CB |author3=Kutschera, W |author4=Higham, T |author5=Kromer, B |author6=Steier, P |author7=Wild, EM|title=Chronology for the Aegean Late Bronze Age 1700‚Äì1400 B.C. |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5773 |pages=565‚Äì569 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/565 |doi=10.1126/science.1125682 |accessdate=10 March 2007 |pmid=16645092 |bibcode=2006Sci...312..565M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = SW | last = Manning | contribution=Clarifying the "high" v.

"'''Corngate'''" was a political [[scandal]] which took place in [[New Zealand]] in 2002 and involved the suspected release of [[genetically modified maize]] (corn) seed in 2000. 

==Background==
The possibility of the presence of a small percentage of GE corn in a seed shipment from the [[United States|U.S.]] was raised publicly by [[Nicky Hager]] in his book ''[[Seeds of Distrust]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hager|first=Nicky|title=Seeds of Distrust|publisher=Craig Potton Publishing|location=Nelson, N.Z. |year=2002|isbn=0-908802-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage was found well after sowing to be above "allowable limits" of contamination - the allowable limit being zero as the question of the accidental presence of GE content or the unreliability of low level testing had not been considered. The results showing GE contamination were later seen as being a PCR artifact, likely being due to contamination of the samples rather than the corn.

It became politically important due to the [[New Zealand Green Party]] stance on [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] crops. The ruling [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] policy regarding GE research was brought into the argument allowing Corngate to become an election issue as the book, ''Seeds of Distrust'' was released a few months prior to the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 Parliamentary elections]].

A [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]], including members of the Green Party, was formed to investigate the matter. Green Party statements claim the committee was "obstructed" by [[Syngenta]] refusing to release test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Notes on the select committee's "Corngate" report| work =| publisher =| date =2007-10-19| url =http://www.greens.org.nz/factsheets/notes-select-committees-corngate-report?rnd=3346| doi =| accessdate =2007-11-27| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120612063851/http://www.greens.org.nz/factsheets/notes-select-committees-corngate-report?rnd=3346| archivedate =2012-06-12| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report, released in late 2004, was inconclusive due to a lack of clear evidence, poor reporting in the original incident and the deletion of raw data critical for a full re-evaluation. Scientific assessment highlighted a lack of rigor in the testing procedures at that time and noted failures in the administration and interpretation of the results by the regulatory body, the [[Environmental Risk Management Authority]] (ERMA).

The incident also highlighted the problems of testing for the presence of GMOs down to a regulatory level of zero when all available detection methods have a relatively high base threshold before results become unreliable.   

The scandal was further intensified when news anchor [[John Campbell (broadcaster)|John Campbell]] interviewed Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] about the issue.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dET78Z5b5s Campbell Live video interview with Prime Minister Helen Clark on GE]&lt;/ref&gt; It ended with Clark labelling Campbell a "sanctimonious little creep" due to what she considered the ambush style of the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ME1vBrTXNFwC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22John+Campbell%22+%22Little+creep%22|title=Voters' Veto: The 2002 Election in New Zealand and the Consolidation of Minority Government|isbn=1-86940-309-6|pages=36|first=Jack|last=Vowles|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) later ruled that the infamous "Corngate" interview was unbalanced, unfair and lacked impartiality and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Authority Releases Decision On 3 News Special|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0307/S00032.htm|work=Scoop: Politics, 4 July 2003|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Corngate is one of many [[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|scandals suffixed with "-gate"]], ultimately originating from the [[Watergate scandal]] in U.S. politics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">'''Cultural analytics''' is the exploration and analysis of massive [[Culture|cultural]] data sets of visual material ‚Äì both digitized visual artifacts and contemporary visual and interactive media.  Taking on the challenge of how to best explore large collections of rich cultural content, cultural analytics researchers developed new methods and intuitive visual techniques which rely on high-resolution [[visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] and [[digital image processing]]. These methods are used to address both the existing research questions in humanities, to explore new questions, and to develop new theoretical concepts which fit the mega-scale of [[digital culture]] in the early 21st century.

== History ==
The term "cultural analytics" was coined by [[Lev Manovich]] in 2007. Cultural analytics shares many ideas and approaches with [[visual analytics]] ("the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by visual interactive interfaces") and visual [[data analysis]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Visual data analysis blends highly advanced computational methods with sophisticated graphics engines to tap the extraordinary ability of humans to see patterns and structure in even the most complex visual presentations. Currently applied to massive, heterogeneous, and dynamic datasets, such as those generated in studies of astrophysical, fluidic, biological, and other complex processes, the techniques have become sophisticated enough to allow the interactive manipulation of variables in real time. Ultra high-resolution displays allow teams of researchers to zoom in to examine specific aspects of the renderings, or to navigate along interesting visual pathways, following their intuitions and even hunches to see where they may lead. New research is now beginning to apply these sorts of tools to the social sciences and humanities as well, and the techniques offer considerable promise in helping us understand complex social processes like learning, political and organizational change, and the diffusion of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four to Five Years: Visual Data Analysis|url=http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/visual-data-analysis/|work=2010 Horizon Report|publisher=The New Media Consortium|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810143644/http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/visual-data-analysis/|archivedate=2011-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

While increased computing power and technical developments allowing for interaction visualization have made the exploration of large data sets using visual presentations possible, the intellectual drive to understand cultural and social processes and production pre-dates many of these computational advances. Charles Joseph Minard's famous dense graphic showing Napoleon's March on Moscow&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/minard Napoleon's March on Moscow]&lt;/ref&gt; (1869) offers a 19th-century example. More recently, [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s historical survey of the cultural consumption practices of mid-century Parisians, documented in [[La Distinction]], foregrounds the study of culture and aesthetics through the lens of large data sets. Most recently, [[Franco Moretti]]'s ''Graphs, maps, trees: abstract models for a literary history.''&lt;ref name = "Moretti, 2005"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with many projects in the Digital Humanities reveal the benefit of large scale analysis of cultural material.

== Current research ==
To date, cultural analytics techniques have been applied to films, animations, video games, comics, magazines, books, and other print publications, artworks, photos, and a variety of other media content.  The technology used ranges from open-source programs downloadable on any personal computer to supercomputer processing and large-scale displays such as the HIPerSpace (42,000 x 8000 pixels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://vis.ucsd.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Research_Projects:_HIPerSpace HIPerSpace]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies ==
The methodologies which fall under the umbrella of cultural analytics includes the [[data mining]] of large sets of culturally-relevant data (such as studies of library catalogs, image collections, and social networking databases.) [[Image processing]] of still and moving video, with feature recognition as well as image data extraction is used to support research into cultural and historical change. Cultural analytical methodologies are deployed to study and interpret videogames and other software forms, both at the phenomonological level ([[human-computer interface]], feature extraction) or at the object level (the analysis of source code.)

Cultural analytics relies heavily on software-based tools, and the field is related to the nascent discipline of [[software studies]]. While the objects of a cultural analytical approach are often digitized representations of the work, rather than the work in its original material form, the objects of study need not be digital works in themselves.

{{Monarchism |Concepts}}
{{Rights |By claimant}}
The '''divine right of kings''', '''divine right''', or '''God's mandate'''  is a [[politics|political]] and [[religion|religious]] doctrine of royal and [[political legitimacy]]. It asserts that a [[monarch]] is subject to no earthly authority, deriving the right to rule directly from the will of [[God]]. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the [[aristocracy]], or any other [[estate of the realm]]. It implies that only God can judge an unjust king and that any attempt to depose, dethrone or restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act. It is often expressed in the phrase "[[by the Grace of God]]", attached to the titles of a reigning monarch.

== Origins ==

In the pagan world,{{Clarify|date=July 2017}} kings were often seen as either ruling with the backing of heavenly powers or perhaps even being divine beings themselves. However, the Christian notion of a divine right of kings is traced to a story found in [[1 Samuel]], where the prophet [[Samuel]] anoints [[Saul]] and then [[David]] as ''[[mashiach]]'' or king over Israel. The anointing is to such an effect that the monarch became inviolable, so that even when Saul sought to kill David, David would not raise his hand against him because "he was the Lord's anointed".

[[Adomnan of Iona]] is one of the earliest Christian proponents of this concept of kings ruling with divine right. He wrote of the Irish King [[Diarmait mac Cerbaill]]'s assassination and claimed that divine punishment fell on his assassin for the act of violating the monarch. Adomnan also recorded a story about Saint [[Columba]] supposedly being visited by an angel carrying a glass book, who told him to ordain [[Aedan mac Gabrain]] as King of [[Dal Riata]]. Columba initially refused, and  the angel answered by whipping him and demanding that he perform the ordination because God had commanded it. The same angel visited Columba on three successive nights. Columba finally agreed, and Aedan came to receive ordination. At the ordination Columba told Aedan that so long as he obeyed God's laws, then none of his enemies would prevail against him, but the moment he broke them, this protection would end, and the same whip with which Columba had been struck would be turned against the king. Adomnan's writings most likely influenced other Irish writers, who in turn influenced continental ideas as well. [[Pepin the Short]]'s coronation may have also come from the same influence.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. ''Life of St Columba''. Penguin Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Carolingian dynasty and the Holy Roman Emperors also influenced all subsequent western ideas of kingship.

In the Middle Ages, the idea that God had granted earthly power to the monarch, just as he had given spiritual authority and power to the church, especially to the Pope, was already a well-known concept long before later writers coined the term "divine right of kings" and employed it as a theory in political science. For example, [[Richard I of England]] declared at his trial during the diet at Speyer in 1193: "[[s:I am born in a rank which recognizes no superior but God|I am born in a rank which recognizes no superior but God, to whom alone I am responsible for my actions]]", and it was Richard who first used the motto ''"[[Dieu et mon droit]]"'' ("God and my right") which is still the motto of the [[Monarch of the United Kingdom]].

With the rise of nation-states and the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the late 16th century, the theory of divine right justified the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters.  [[Henry VIII of England]] declared himself the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]], and exerted the power of the throne more than any of his predecessors.  As a political theory, it was further developed by [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] (1567‚Äì1625), and came to the fore in England under his reign as James I of England (1603‚Äì1625). [[Louis XIV of France]] (1643‚Äì1715) strongly promoted the theory as well.

=== Scots texts of James VI of Scotland ===
The [[Scots language|Scots]] textbooks of the divine right of kings were written in 1597‚Äì1598 by James VI of Scotland. His ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'', a manual on the powers of a king, was written to edify his four-year-old son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry Frederick]] that a king "acknowledgeth himself ordained for his people, having received from the God a burden of government, whereof he must be countable". He based his theories in part on his understanding of the Bible, as noted by the following quote from a speech to parliament delivered in 1610 as James I of England:  

{{quote|The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth, for kings are not only God's lieutenants upon earth and sit upon God's throne, but even by God himself they are called gods. There be three principal [comparisons] that illustrate the state of monarchy: one taken out of the word of God, and the two other out of the grounds of policy and philosophy. In the Scriptures kings are called gods, and so their power after a certain relation compared to the Divine power. Kings are also compared to fathers of families; for a king is truly ''parens patriae'' [parent of the country], the politic father of his people. And lastly, kings are compared to the head of this microcosm of the body of man.&lt;ref name="A speech to parliament"&gt;[http://www.thenagain.info/Classes/Sources/JamesI.html A speech to parliament (1610)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

James's reference to "God's lieutenants" is apparently a reference to the text in Romans 13 where Paul refers to "God's ministers".

{{quote|(1) upon removing the last just Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. (2) Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. (3) For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: (4) For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. (5) Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. (6) For this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. (7) Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.&lt;ref name="Romans 13"&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|13:1-7|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The conception of [[ordination]] brought with it largely unspoken parallels with the [[Anglican]] and [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priesthood]], but the overriding metaphor in James's handbook was that of a father's relation to his children. "Just as no misconduct on the part of a father can free his children from obedience to the [[Ten Commandments|fifth commandment]]",&lt;ref&gt;that is, the commandment: "Honor your father ..." etc., which is the fifth in the reckoning usual among Jewish, Orthodox, and Protestant denominations, but to be according to the law, yet is he not bound thereto but of his good will ..."&lt;/ref&gt; James also had printed his ''Defense of the Right of Kings'' in the face of English theories of inalienable popular and clerical rights. The divine right of kings, or divine-right theory of kingship, is a political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy. It asserts that a monarch is subject to no earthly authority, deriving his right to rule directly from the will of God. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or any other estate of the realm, including (in the view of some, especially in Protestant countries) the church. A weaker or more moderate form of this political theory does hold, however, that the king is subject to the church and the pope, although completely irreproachable in other ways; but according to this doctrine in its strong form, only God can judge an unjust king. The doctrine implies that any attempt to depose the king or to restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act.

One passage in scripture supporting the idea of divine right of kings was used by [[Martin Luther]], when urging the secular authorities to crush the [[German Peasants' War|Peasant Rebellion of 1525]] in Germany in his ''[[Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants]]'', basing his argument on St. Paul's Epistle to the {{bibleverse||Romans|13:1‚Äì7|NKJV}}.

It is related to the ancient Catholic philosophies regarding monarchy, in which the monarch is God's [[vicegerent]] upon the earth and therefore subject to no inferior power. However, in Roman Catholic jurisprudence, the monarch is always subject to [[Natural law|natural]] and [[divine law]], which are regarded as superior to the monarch. The possibility of monarchy declining morally, overturning natural law, and degenerating into a tyranny oppressive of the general welfare was answered theologically with the Catholic concept of extra-legal [[tyrannicide]], ideally ratified by the pope. Until the [[Papal states|unification of Italy]], the [[Bishop of Rome|Holy See]] did, from the time Christianity became the Roman [[Holy Roman Empire|state religion]], assert on that ground its primacy over secular princes; however this exercise of power never, even at its zenith, amounted to [[theocracy]], even in jurisdictions where the Bishop of Rome was the temporal authority.

=== Catholic justified permission ===
Catholic thought justified submission to the monarchy by reference to the following:
# The Old Testament, in which God chose kings to rule over Israel, beginning with [[Saul]] who was then rejected by God in favor of [[David]], whose dynasty continued (at least in the [[Kingdom of Judah|southern kingdom]]) until the [[Babylonian captivity]].
# The New Testament, in which the first pope, St. Peter, commands that all Christians shall honour the Roman Emperor ({{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:13‚Äì20|NKJV}}), even though, at that time, he was still a pagan emperor. St. Paul agreed with St. Peter that subjects should be obedient to the powers that be because they are appointed by God, as he wrote in his Epistle to the {{bibleverse||Romans|13:1-7|NKJV}}. Likewise, Jesus Christ proclaims in the Gospel of Matthew that one should "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's"; that is at first, literally, the payment of taxes as binding those who use the imperial [[currency]] (See {{bibleverse||Matthew|22:15‚Äì22|NKJV}}). Jesus told [[Pontius Pilate]] that his authority as Roman governor of [[Judaea]] came from heaven according to {{bibleverse||John|19:10‚Äì11|NKJV}}.
# The endorsement by the popes and the church of the line of emperors beginning with the Emperors [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]], later the Eastern Roman emperors, and finally the Western Roman emperor, [[Charlemagne]] and his successors, the Catholic [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperors]].

The French Huguenot nobles and clergy, having rejected the pope and the Catholic Church, were left only with the supreme power of the king who, they taught, could not be gainsaid or judged by anyone. Since there was no longer the countervailing power of the papacy and since the Church of England was a creature of the state and had become subservient to it, this meant that there was nothing to regulate the powers of the king, and he became an absolute power. In theory, [[Divine law|divine]], [[Natural law|natural]], customary, and [[constitutional law]] still held sway over the king, but, absent a superior spiritual power, it was difficult to see how they could be enforced, since the king could not be tried by any of his own courts.

Some of the symbolism within the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] ceremony for British monarchs, in which they are [[anointed]] with [[Holy Oil (Christianity)|holy oils]] by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], thereby ''[[Holy Orders|ordaining]]'' them to monarchy, perpetuates the ancient Roman Catholic monarchical ideas and ceremonial (although few Protestants realize this, the ceremony is nearly entirely based upon that of the Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, in the UK, the symbolism ends there, since the real governing authority of the monarch was all but extinguished by the Whig revolution of 1688‚Äì89 (see [[Glorious Revolution]]). The king or queen of the [[United Kingdom]] is one of the last monarchs still to be crowned in the traditional Christian ceremonial, which in most other countries has been replaced by an [[inauguration]] or other declaration.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[File:King Charles I from NPG.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles I of England]], with a divine hand moving his crown]]
The concept of divine right incorporates, but exaggerates, the ancient Christian concept of "royal God-given rights", which teach that "the right to rule is anointed by God", although this idea is found in many other cultures, including [[Aryan]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] traditions. In pagan religions, the king was often seen as a kind of god and so was an unchallengeable despot. The ancient Roman Catholic tradition overcame this idea with the doctrine of the "Two Swords" and so achieved, for the very first time, a balanced constitution for states. The advent of Protestantism saw something of a return to the idea of a mere unchallengeable despot.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] condoned extra-legal [[tyrannicide]] in the worst of circumstances:
{{quote|When there is no recourse to a superior by whom judgment can be made about an invader, then he who slays a tyrant to liberate his fatherland is [to be] praised and receives a reward.|''Commentary on the Magister Sententiarum''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaxxine.com/hyoomik/aquinas/regicide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927064708/http://www.vaxxine.com/hyoomik/aquinas/regicide.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, Aquinas forbade the overthrow of any morally, Christianly and spiritually legitimate king by his subjects. The only human power capable of deposing the king was the pope. The reasoning was that if a subject may overthrow his superior for some bad law, who was to be the judge of whether the law was bad? If the subject could so judge his own superior, then all lawful superior authority could lawfully be overthrown by the arbitrary judgement of an inferior, and thus all law was under constant threat. Towards the end of the Middle Ages, many philosophers, such as [[Nicholas of Cusa]] and [[Francisco Su√°rez|Francisco Suarez]], propounded similar theories. The Church was the final guarantor that Christian kings would follow the laws and constitutional traditions of their ancestors and the laws of the presumptive god and of justice. Similarly, the Chinese concept of [[Mandate of Heaven]] required that the emperor properly carry out the proper [[ritual]]s, consult his ministers, and made it extremely difficult to undo any acts carried out by an ancestor.

The French prelate [[Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet]] made a classic statement of the doctrine of divine right in a sermon preached before King Louis XIV:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWf5USWTfWQC&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=bossuet%20sermons%20royalty&amp;pg=PA219&amp;ci=55%2C632%2C772%2C172|title=Sermons choisis de Bossuet|author=[[Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet]]|work=Sur le devoir des rois}} p. 219, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OWf5USWTfWQC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U0FBRrjh8fZ8ViFiVucnPKYolU_ew&amp;ci=55%2C632%2C772%2C172&amp;edge=0 Image]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Les rois r√®gnent par moi, dit la Sagesse √©ternelle: 'Per me reges regnant'; et de l√† nous devons conclure non seulement que les droits de la royaut√© sont √©tablis par ses lois, mais que le choix des personnes est un effet de sa providence.}}
{{quote|Kings reign by Me, says Eternal Wisdom: 'Per me reges regnant' [in Latin]; and from that we must conclude not only that the rights of royalty are established by its laws, but also that the choice of persons [to occupy the throne] is an effect of its providence.}}

==Divine right and Protestantism==
Before the Reformation the anointed [[king]] was, within his [[realm]], the accredited vicar of God for secular purposes (see the [[Investiture Controversy]]); after the Reformation he (or she if [[queen regnant]]) became this in Protestant states for religious purposes also.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=y |last=Phillip |first=Walter Alison |wstitle=King#Divine Right of Kings. |display=King ¬ß Divine Right of Kings |volume=15 |page=806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England it is not without significance that the sacerdotal vestments, generally discarded by the clergy ‚Äì dalmatic, alb and stole ‚Äì continued to be among the insignia of the sovereign (see [[Coronation of the British monarch]]). Moreover, this sacrosanct character he acquired not by virtue of his "sacring", but by hereditary right; the coronation, anointing and vesting were but the outward and visible symbol of a divine grace adherent in the sovereign by virtue of his title. Even Roman Catholic monarchs, like [[Louis XIV]], would never have admitted that their coronation by the archbishop constituted any part of their title to reign; it was no more than the consecration of their title.{{sfn|Phillip|1911|p=806}}

In England the doctrine of the divine right of kings was developed to its extremest logical conclusions during the political controversies of the 17th century; its most famous exponent was Sir [[Robert Filmer]]. It was the main issue to be decided by the [[English Civil War]], the [[Cavalier|Royalist]]s holding that "all Christian kings, princes and governors" derive their authority direct from God, the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]]s that this authority is the outcome of a contract, actual or implied, between sovereign and people.{{sfn|Phillip|1911|p=806}}

In one case the king's power would be unlimited, according to Louis XIV's famous saying: ''"L' √©tat, c'est moi!"'',{{sfn|Phillip|1911|p=806}} or limited only by his own free act; in the other his actions would be governed by the advice and consent of the people, to whom he would be ultimately responsible. The victory of this latter principle was proclaimed to all the world by the [[execution of Charles I]]. The doctrine of divine right, indeed, for a while drew nourishment from the blood of the royal "martyr";{{sfn|Phillip|1911|p=806}} it was the guiding principle of the [[Anglican Church]] of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]; but it suffered a rude blow when [[James II of England]] made it impossible for the clergy to obey both their conscience and their king. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 made an end of it as a great political force. This has led to the constitutional development of [[the Crown]] in Britain, as held by descent modified and modifiable by parliamentary action.{{sfn|Phillip|1911|p=806}}

==Divine right in Asia==
In early Mesopotamian culture, kings were often regarded as deities after their death. [[Shulgi]] of [[Ur]] was among the first Mesopotamian rulers to declare himself to be divine. This was the direct precursor to the concept of "Divine Right of kings", as well as in the Egyptian and Roman religions.

===Mandate of Heaven===
{{main article|Mandate of Heaven|Son of Heaven}}
[[File:Amaterasu cave - large - 1856.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Emperor of Japan]] rules as a divine descendant of the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]] ]]
In [[China]] and [[East Asia]], rulers justified their rule with the philosophy of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], which, although similar to the European concept, bore several key differences. While the divine right of kings granted unconditional legitimacy, the Mandate of Heaven was dependent on the behaviour of the ruler, the [[Son of Heaven]]. [[Heaven]] would bless the authority of a just ruler, but it could be displeased with a despotic ruler and thus withdraw its mandate, transferring it to a more suitable and righteous person. This withdrawal of mandate also afforded the possibility of revolution as a means to remove the errant ruler; revolt was never legitimate under the European framework of divine right.

In China, the [[right of rebellion]] against an unjust ruler had been a part of the political philosophy ever since the [[Zhou dynasty]], whose rulers had used this philosophy to justify their overthrow of the previous [[Shang dynasty]]. Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that the Mandate of Heaven had passed on to the usurper.

In Japan, the Son of Heaven title was less conditional than its Chinese equivalent. There was no divine mandate that punished the emperor for failing to rule justly. The right to rule of the Japanese emperor, descended from the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]], was absolute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Beasley|chapter=The Making of a Monarchy|title=The Japanese Experience: A Short History of Japan|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22560-2|page=29|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese emperors traditionally wielded little secular power; generally, it was the duty of the sitting emperor to perform rituals and make public appearances, while true power was held by regents, high-ranking ministers, a commander-in-chief of the emperor's military known as the ''[[sh≈çgun]]'', or even retired emperors depending on the time period.

===Sultans in Southeast Asia===
In the [[Malay Annals]], the [[raja]]s and [[sultan]]s of the Malay States (today [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and [[Philippines]]) as well as their predecessors, such as the [[Indonesia]]n kingdom of [[Majapahit]], also claimed divine right to rule. The sultan is mandated by God and thus is expected to lead his country and people in religious matters, ceremonies as well as prayers. This divine right is called ''Daulat'' (which means 'state' in Arabic), and although the notion of divine right is somewhat obsolete, it is still found in the phrase ''Daulat Tuanku'' that is used to publicly acclaim the reigning [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] and the other sultans of Malaysia. The exclamation is similar to the European "[[The king is dead, long live the king!|Long live the King]]", and often accompanies pictures of the reigning monarch and [[Raja Permaisuri Agong|his consort]] on banners during royal occasions. In [[Indonesia]], especially on the island of [[Java]], the sultan's divine right is more commonly known as the ''way'', or 'revelation', but it is not hereditary and can be passed on to distant relatives.

===South Asian kings===
In [[Dravidian culture]], before [[Brahmanism]] and especially during the [[Sangam period]], emperors were known as ‡Æá‡Æ±‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Æ∞‡Øç (''Iraiyer''), or "those who spill", and kings were called ‡Æï‡Øã (''Ko'') or ‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ©‡Øç (''Kon''). During this time, the distinction between kingship and godhood had not yet occurred, as the [[caste]] system had not yet been introduced. Even in Modern [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the word for temple is '‡Æï‡Øã‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç', meaning "king's house".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramanujan|first=A.K.|title=Poems of Love and War: From the Eight Anthologies and the Ten Long Poems of Classical Tamil|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15735-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kings were understood to be the "agents of God", as they protected the world like God did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=N. Subramanian|title=≈öa·πÖgam polity: the administration and social life of the ≈öa·πÖgam Tamils|year=1966|publisher=Asia Pub. House}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may well have been continued post-Brahminism in [[Tamilakam]], as the famous Thiruvalangadu inscription states:

{{quote|"Having noticed by the marks (on his body) that Arulmozhi was the very Vishnu" in reference to the Emperor [[Raja Raja Chola I]].}}

==Rights==
Historically, many notions of [[rights]] were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to respect from his son did not indicate a right for the son to receive a return from that respect; and the divine right of kings, which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave a lot of room for many rights for the subjects themselves.&lt;ref name=tws21decfrre&gt;{{cite news
|title = Divine Right of Kings
|quote = [...] the idea that a king was sacred, appointed by God and above the judgment of earthly powers [...] was called the Divine Right of Kings and it entered so powerfully into British culture during the 17th century that it shaped the pomp and circumstance of the Stuart monarchs, imbued the writing of Shakespeare and provoked the political thinking of Milton and Locke.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, modern conceptions of rights often emphasize [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, for example in the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].

==Opposition==
{{further|All men are created equal}}
In the sixteenth century, both Catholic and Protestant political thinkers began to question the idea of a monarch's "divine right".

The Spanish Catholic historian [[Juan de Mariana]] put forward the argument in his book ''[[De rege et regis institutione]]'' (1598) that since society was formed by a "pact" among all its members, "there can be no doubt that they are able to call a king to account".&lt;ref&gt;Baer, Robert V. ''Power &amp; Freedom: Political Thought and Constitutional Politics in the United States and Argentina'' ProQuest, 2008 {{ISBN|0549745106}} (pp. 70‚Äì71)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p&amp;l"&gt;Blumenau, Ralph. ''Philosophy and Living'' Imprint Academic, 2002 {{ISBN|0907845339}} (pp. 198‚Äì199)&lt;/ref&gt; Mariana thus challenged divine right theories by stating in certain circumstances, [[tyrannicide]] could be justified. [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Robert Bellarmine]] also "did not believe that the institute of monarchy had any divine sanction" and shared Mariana's belief that there were times where Catholics could lawfully remove a monarch.&lt;ref name="p&amp;l" /&gt;

Among groups of English [[Protestant]] exiles fleeing from [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], some of the earliest anti-monarchist publications emerged. "Weaned off uncritical royalism by the actions of Queen Mary ... The political thinking of men like [[John Ponet|Ponet]], [[John Knox|Knox]], [[Christopher Goodman|Goodman]] and Hales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Reformation|last=Dickens|first=A. G.|year=1978|publisher=Fontana/Collins|location=London &amp; Glasgow|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1553, Mary I, a Roman Catholic, succeeded her Protestant half-brother, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], to the English throne. Mary set about trying to restore Roman Catholicism by making sure that: Edward's religious laws were abolished in the Statute of Repeal Act (1553); the Protestant religious laws passed in the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] were repealed; and the [[Revival of the Heresy Acts]] were passed in 1554. The [[Marian Persecutions]] began soon afterwards. In January 1555, the first of nearly 300 Protestants were burnt at the stake under "Bloody Mary". When [[Thomas Wyatt the younger]] instigated what became known as [[Wyatt's rebellion]], [[John Ponet]], the highest-ranking ecclesiastic among the exiles,&lt;ref name="Dickens391"&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Reformation|last=Dickens|first=A. G.|year=1978|publisher=Fontana/Collins|location=London &amp; Glasgow|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly participated in the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Reformation|last=Dickens|first=A.G.|year=1978|publisher=Fontana/Collins|location=London &amp; Glasgow|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped to [[Strasbourg]] after the Rebellion's defeat and, the following year, he published ''A Shorte Treatise of Politike Power'', in which he put forward a theory of justified opposition to secular rulers.

"Ponet's treatise comes first in a new wave of anti-monarchical writings ... It has never been assessed at its true importance, for it antedates by several years those more brilliantly expressed but less radical [[Huguenot]] writings which have usually been taken to represent the [[Tyrannicide]]-theories of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]."&lt;ref name="Dickens391"/&gt;

Ponet's pamphlet was republished on the eve of [[King Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s [[Execution of Charles I|execution]].

According to U.S. President [[John Adams]], Ponet's work contained "all the essential principles of liberty, which were afterward dilated on by [[Algernon Sidney|Sidney]] and [[John Locke|Locke]]", including the idea of a three-branched government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of John Adams, with Life|last=Adams|first=C. F.|year=1850‚Äì56|location=Boston|volume=6|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In due course, opposition to the divine right of kings came from a number of sources, including poet [[John Milton]] in his pamphlet ''[[The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates]]'', and [[Thomas Paine]] in his pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]''. Probably the two most famous declarations of a right to revolution against tyranny in the English language are [[John Locke]]'s ''Essay concerning The True Original, Extent, and End of Civil-Government'' and Thomas Jefferson's formulation in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] that "[[all men are created equal]]".

'''''Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp''''' is a 1991 [[laserdisc video game]] by the [[Leland Corporation]]. It is regarded as the first "true" sequel to ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]''. As with the original, ''Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp'' consists of an animated short film that requires the player to move the [[joystick]] or press a fire button at certain times in order to continue. It takes place years after the original ''Dragon's Lair''. Dirk has married [[Princess Daphne (character)|Daphne]], and the marriage has produced many children. When Daphne is kidnapped by the evil wizard Mordroc in order to be forced into marriage, Dirk's children and his mother-in-law are clearly upset by the abduction of Daphne, and Dirk must once again save her.

Home ports of the game were announced for the [[Sega Saturn]],&lt;ref name="EGM86"/&gt; [[Philips CD-i]], [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]], and [[Atari Jaguar CD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:VideoGames_DE_1995-08.pdf&amp;page=41|title=Release Liste|magazine=[[:de:Video Games|Video Games]]|issue=46|publisher=Future-Verlag|date=August 1995|page=43|lang=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Gore|first=Chris|url=https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games_The_Ultimate_Gaming_Magazine_Issue_79_August_1995#page/n13/mode/1up|title=The Gorescore - Industry News You Can|magazine=[[VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment#VideoGames - The Ultimate Gaming Magazine|VideoGames - The Ultimate Gaming Magazine]]|issue=79|publisher=[[Larry Flynt Publications|L.F.P., Inc.]]|date=August 1995|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only the CD-i version was actually released, though non-playable demos of the 3DO and Jaguar CD versions appear on those consoles' respective versions of ''[[Brain Dead 13]]''. The game was later ported to the [[Wii]] as part of the compilation release ''Dragon's Lair Trilogy''. A [[PlayStation 3]] port was released on June 1, 2011.

==Story==
Dirk the Daring must find and rescue [[Princess Daphne (character)|Daphne]] with the help of a well-spoken [[time machine]]. It seems that the time machine is (or has been) [[Spiritual possession|possessed]] by the brother of Mordroc, the foul wizard that has kidnapped Daphne. Dirk travels through [[parallel universe (fiction)|several dimensions]] and historical eras searching for Daphne, some inspired by classic stories and [[fairy tale]]s such as ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', to prevent Mordroc from enslaving Daphne to his whim with the dreaded Death Ring. Voice actor [[Michael Rye]] reprises his role as the narrator in the [[attract sequence]], as he did with ''Dragon's Lair'' as well as ''[[Space Ace]]''.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay differs from the original in two important ways. First, it follows a [[Linearity (computer and video games)|linear]] sequence of events which flow one into the next, as opposed to the randomized sequences of rooms from the first game;&lt;ref name="EGM86"/&gt; "dying" in the sequel also forces the player to resume from a checkpoint in the level rather than starting a randomly different level as in the original. Second, golden treasures are scattered throughout the game; getting each treasure is optional and requires an extra move, but the player is awarded extra points. If the player misses any, at the end of the game it loops back to the first treasure missed. As well, unlike in the first game, the actions the player must do are prompted by a brief flash of what Dirk should use or where he should go next.

==Development==
Development on the game began in 1983 after the success of the original ''Dragon's Lair'', and finally reached [[video arcade|arcades]] eight years later, hence Leland Interactive's credit on the title screen, although a commercial from [[Don Bluth Productions]] featuring completed animation from stage 3 in the game had aired on television in 1984.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Actually creating the game's animation took three years.&lt;ref name="EGM86"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Dragon's Lair 2: The Daring Dirk Returns|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=86 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=September 1996|pages=84-84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
*Stage 1; Dirk is terrified and horrified to death of his angered mother-in-law trying to smack him with a rolling pin or toss destructible objects towards him for her revenge on him because of the kidnapping to his married Princess Daphne by Mordroc. He must flee from her while getting past several creatures and obstacles in the deceased Singe's old castle, including a ravenous snake wearing a [[Tam o' Shanter (cap)|Tam o' Shanter]], in order to reach the time machine that will allow him to pursue Mordroc.
*Stage 2; In prehistoric times, Mordroc takes a moment to taunt Dirk as he battles [[Pterosaur|pterodactyls]], a [[Tyrannosaurus|T-rex]], and two bat-winged centaurs that carry Daphne away. As this happens, the tiny island they are on gradually crumbles into the sea.
*Stage 3; In 1865, Dirk is materialized in [[Alice Liddell]]'s house and goes through the looking-glass that hangs over the fireplace.  While being dressed as Alice by enemy characters, he tumbles into Wonderland where he faces [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]], the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]], her army of [[playing card]] soldiers, the [[Mad Hatter]] and the [[March Hare]], the [[Jabberwocky]] and the [[Cheshire Cat]].
*Stage 4; In the [[Garden of Eden]], Dirk has to escape from guardian [[angel]]s, the advances of [[Eve]] the fat Lady, two snakes (one wanting to eat Dirk and the other a smooth-talker), and finally, the ruin of Eden itself when Eve accidentally eats the forbidden apple.
*Stage 5; In 1808, Dirk is shrunk to the size of a [[mouse]] in [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s study, where he must avoid the predations of the composer's constant playing the piano with his hands, his wicked hungry cat and the sheer chaos of his creative gust.
*Stage 6; In [[Ancient Egypt]], Dirk finds what appears to be Daphne (wrapped completely in linen bandages) but is actually Mordroc in disguise, leading Dirk on a wild goose chase as he explores an ancient tomb while narrowly avoiding poison gas, spiders, giant bats, corrosive [[acid]], scarabs, and a giant [[mummy]].
*Stage 7; At his castle, Mordroc puts the Death Ring on Daphne's finger, which transforms her into a monstrous banshee. Dirk must avoid the monstrous Daphne's mindless attempts to devour him. He must get the ring off her finger, restore her to normal, and defeat Mordroc at the same time. In addition to the alternate scene in the non-arcade version, Dirk has to remove the ring from Daphne and throw it at Mordroc.
*Final Stage; Although Mordroc is defeated, Dirk must fight off Mordoc's last surviving minions, who are trying to get their revenge on him for defeating their master, so that Dirk safely escapes the crumbling castle with Daphne.

During the course of the game, the player can optionally find and collect "treasures". In the ''Director's Cut'' version of the game, gathering all the treasures offers an alternate, shorter and easier second-to-last stage. In it, Dirk must get the Death Ring and then throw it at Mordroc. This also includes three death scenes that were not used in the final release.

==Releases==

===Home computers===
Around the time the Arcade was out, an [[abridged]] version was released for the [[Amiga]] home computers by [[ReadySoft]]. It included only some of the scenes and most stages were absent altogether. It included the introduction reaching the machine, followed by the prehistoric stage, the Garden of Eden, and the final stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dragons-lair-ii-time-warp|title=Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp for Amiga (1990)|work=MobyGames}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was followed by ''[[Dragon's Lair III: The Curse of Mordread]]'' also by ReadySoft. it presented an original storyline with Mordroc's sister, the evil witch "Mordread". She arrives at Dirk's and Daphne's home, and absorbing both the house and Daphne into an orb. This game incorporated the stages of Wonderland and Beethoven's piano from ''Time Warp'' but also included some original sequences: an intro, a stage on a [[pirate ship]], a stage in the time realm, and an original ending.

===DVD release===
''Dragon's Lair II'' was released on [[DVD]] on April 17, 2007.

===Blu-ray release===
Following the release of ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'' and ''[[Space Ace]]'' in [[High-definition video|high-definition]] for [[Blu-ray]], Digital Leisure said they were working on a Blu-ray version of ''Dragon's Lair II'' for some time in 2008. The disc was released on June 2, 2009.

An [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] on the ''Space Ace'' Blu-ray allows the player to play the first scene of ''Dragon's Lair II'' in Blu-ray format.

===PlayStation 3 release===
''Dragon's Lair II'' was released on the [[PlayStation 3]] on June 1, 2011.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called ''Dragon's Lair II'' "an exceptional program which suffers from uninteresting game-play". The magazine criticized the game for, like its predecessor, being "a long series of trial and error" instead of testing the player's ability.{{r|greenberg199203}} The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the CD-i version a 7.25 out of 10, commenting that it looks and plays just as good as the arcade version, and praising the addition of collectable items. One of the reviewers dissented with the majority opinion, saying that FMV games had lost their novelty and that the game was lacking in interaction.&lt;ref name="EGM65"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Dragon's Lair II|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65 |publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1994|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' gave it a rave review. They applauded the sharp and colorful graphics, absence of slowdown, high frame rate, realistic sound effects, and outstanding controls, elaborating that "The CD-i's circular directional pad gives you quicker, more accurate button presses that help you get past every snake, dragon, and mother-in-law in sight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=67 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1995|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{tone|date=March 2016}}
{{Wittgenstein|Later}}
'''Form of life''' ({{lang-de|Lebensform}}) is a technical term used by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and others in the [[continental philosophy]] and [[philosophy of science]] traditions. Wittgenstein himself used the term consistently in his works ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' and ''[[On Certainty]]'', but other writers have sometimes used it in very different and often mutually incompatible ways.

==Description==
Comments about a form of life are not explanations meant to comprehend the concept as a whole. The view that stringing together simple, non-controversial statements of ordinary understanding will illuminate something that is supposedly already understood is, in Wittgenstein's view, quite nonsensical. The concept of 'form of life' itself, for example, is extremely difficult to get right, as is indicated by the widely divergent things that have been said about it since Wittgenstein introduced it in the books cited above.

In response to a question from an imagined interlocutor, Wittgenstein notes the following:

: "So you are saying that human agreement decides what is false and what is true?" ‚Äì It is what human beings ''say'' that is false and true; and they agree in the ''language'' they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life. (Wittgenstein, ''Philosophical Investigations'', para. 241 [emphasis not in original])

Ordinarily, humans do not step away from their activities in order to justify how or why they say and do what they say and do. However, their activities, when investigated in an historical way, will be found to reflect a particular form of life.

When such questions do arise, a philosophical investigation will involve reminding the questioner of certain things he or she takes for granted and which, when noted, can help dissolve the question. We do what we do because we assume a given form of life, which gives our actions, ourselves, and the world meaning. Form of life is what makes meaning itself possible.

==Use by Agamben==
Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] takes up the intersecting concepts of form-of-life, rule-following and use, but besides attempting to deconstruct what Wittgenstein meant, traces these concepts genealogically, in the manner of Stirner or Rousseau. In ''The Highest Poverty ‚Äì Monastic Rules and Form-of-Life'', Agamben looks at the emerging genre of written rules starting in the 9th century, and its development into both law and something beyond law in the Franciscan form-of-life, in which the Franciscans replaced the idea that we possess our life (or objects generally) with the concept of 'usus', that is 'use'. Agamben finds earlier versions of form-of-life in monastic rules, developing from 'vita vel regula', 'regula et vita', 'forma vivendi', and 'forma vitae'. Thus Agamben takes Wittgenstein's concepts and applies them to the history of Western monasticism in order to rethink the consequences of these concepts for doing (contemporary) politics ‚Äî the main goal of his ''Homo Sacer''-project, which started with ''[[Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life]]'' and to which ''The Highest Poverty'' belongs.

The institution was founded in 1845 as a government-run educational institute. It was established as regular college in 1850, and is now under the direct management of the Education Department of [[Government of Gujarat]].&lt;ref name=ah&gt;{{cite book|title=Ahmedabad, Being a Compilation of Articles Contributed by Rotarians and Others on Various Subjects Prominently Bringing Out Many Interesting Details Pertaining to and Connected with the City|year=1940|publisher=Rotary Club of Ahmedabad|page=54,59,103|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=4X1aUex9hKusB47cgeAG&amp;id=hcIBAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=gujarat+collage+1860&amp;q=gujarat+collage+#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;The Gujarat Government Gazette, 1962 - Page 1195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gz91&gt;{{cite book|title=Gujarat State Gazetteer , Volume 2 by U.M.

==History==
Gujarat College started as a small educational institution in 1860&lt;ref name=ah/&gt; due to efforts of [[Theodore Hope|T. C. Hope]],&lt;ref name=gz91/&gt; who inspired local people for charity, which led to the start of the institution.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;&lt;ref name=pd&gt;{{cite book|title=Speeches of President Giani Zail Singh: 1982-1984|year=1987|publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fw22AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=gujarat+collage+1860&amp;dq=gujarat+collage+1860&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4X1aUex9hKusB47cgeAG&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the institute was started in 1860 as Gujarat Providential College but ceased to work in 1872. However, after a gap of five years it was restarted in 1879 as Gujarat College under management of the Gujarat College Committee, which at that time was under the able leader ship of local textile magnate, [[Ranchhodlal Chhotalal|Rai Bahadur Sheth Ranchhodlal Chotalal]].&lt;ref name=pd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Women in India's freedom struggle by Nawaz B.

To mention, in the year 1897, he donated {{INR convert|6|l}} and further {{INR convert|20|l}} for the construction of Arts College&lt;ref name=z&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bombay University Calendar|year=1929|publisher=University of Bombay|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=enpaUaTSBsWGrAfyk4C4DA&amp;id=1k4mAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=gujarat+collage+chinubhai&amp;q=+chinubhai#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which he further added a sum of {{INR convert|1.5|l}} for a library and college hall.&lt;ref name=z/&gt; The buildings that came up from these donations were Madhavlal Ranchodlal Science Institute named after father of Sir Chinubhai, Sydenham Library and George V Hall, which all were inaugurated by [[George Sydenham Clarke|Lord George Sydenham Clarke]] in 1912, 1915 and 1917, respectively.&lt;ref name=z/&gt; The Engineer, [[Himmatlal Dhirajram Bhachech|Rai Bahadur Himmatlal Dhirajram Bhachech]], who was President of [[Ahmadabad Municipality]] at that time, overlooked the construction of college buildings.  The first college building was constructed in the year 1897, which followed more buildings appearing on the land using the generous flow of donations by Sir Chinubhai Madhavalal, Bert, ICE, who again donated another sum of {{INR convert|10|l}} as patron of College
.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

After Independence of India, the college continued to expand and the New Science Building was built in 1948, Tutorial Building in 1965, and Science Workshops in 1965.The Department of Dramatics was established in 1970-71.

==Present status==
The college houses departments of Arts faculty, departments of science and a full-time degree course in drama.  The institute also runs many undergraduate courses.

The institute is managed by the Commissioner for College and Universities under the State Department of Education.

== Affiliation ==
The college started with affiliation from [[University of Bombay]], which was granted in March 1879.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;&lt;ref name=pd/&gt; Later when [[Gujarat University]] at [[Ahmedabad]] came into existence it granted its affiliation to Gujarat College and since then the college is affiliated to Gujarat University.

==Indian Independence Movement==
[[Mahatma Gandhi]] held an historic meeting at Gujarat College campus under the presidency of V.J. Patel on 28 September 1920 and addressed a huge mass of students asking them to join [[Non-cooperation Movement]], giving detailed description of atrocities committed by British regime on Indians. This led to many professors and students leaving college, as it was government run institution and joining [[Gujarat Vidyapith]], which was started by Gandhi in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gandhi and the Mass Movements|pages=13, 20‚Äì21, 30‚Äì33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4i1aMXriA0sC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=gujarat+college&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U61bUYikF8n9rAeAuYDYCQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=gujarat%20college&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Quit India Movement]] in 1942, many students of college participated organizing a rally and shouting slogan against British, which led to death of one student of college named [[Vinod Kinariwala]], who was shot dead by English policeman inside college campus, on 9 August 1942.&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; Later in 1947, Veer Vinod Kinariwala Memorial was inaugurated by [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] in memory of martyrdom of [[Shaheed]] Vinod Kinariwala inside college campus.&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|title=Tributes to Quit India Movement martyrs:|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3AbxTyd_jOuEAJ%3Amobiletoi.timesofindia.com%2Fmobile.aspx%3Farticle%3Dyes%26pageid%3D4%26sectid%3Dedid%3D%26edlabel%3DTOIA%26mydateHid%3D08-08-2012%26pubname%3DTimes%2Bof%2BIndia%2B-%2BAhmedabad%26edname%3D%26articleid%3DAr00406%26publabel%3DTOI+gujarat+college+vindo+kinariwala&amp;cd=9&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in&amp;client=firefox-a|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=17 February 2013|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411013640/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bxTyd_jOuEAJ:mobiletoi.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article%3Dyes%26pageid%3D4%26sectid%3Dedid%3D%26edlabel%3DTOIA%26mydateHid%3D08-08-2012%26pubname%3DTimes%2Bof%2BIndia%2B-%2BAhmedabad%26edname%3D%26articleid%3DAr00406%26publabel%3DTOI+gujarat+college+vindo+kinariwala&amp;cd=9&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in&amp;client=firefox-a|archivedate=11 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is directed by Dr. [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/george-nicholas George P. Nicholas] ([[Simon Fraser University]]), co-developed with [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/julie-hollowell Julie Hollowell] ([[Indiana University]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/kelly-bannister Kelly Bannister] ([[University of Victoria]]) and is funded by the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]]'s (SSHRC) major collaborative research initiatives (MCRI) program.

IPinCH is a collaboration of scholars, students, heritage professionals, community members, policy makers, and Indigenous organizations across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people|title = People &amp; Partners|website = Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Research Team&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team|title = Research Team {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes over fifty leading scholars and professionals, nearly one hundred Associates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates|title = Associates {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; sixteen Fellows,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/fellows|title = Fellows {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over thirty partnering organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/partners|title = Partnering Organisations {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing Canada, Australia, United States, New Zealand, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Germany, and Switzerland. Our organizational partners range from the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), to [[Parks Canada]], to Indigenous groups including the [[Penobscot Nation of Maine]] and the [[Moriori]] of [[Rekohu]] (Chatham Islands, New Zealand)

The project serves as both a practical resource and a network of support for communities and researchers engaged in cultural heritage work. Topics of research include the theoretical, ethical, and practical implications of commodification, appropriation, and other flows of knowledge about the past, and how these may affect communities, researchers, and other stakeholders.

==Purpose==

===Objectives===
* To document the diversity of principles, interpretations, and actions arising in response to [[intellectual property]] issues in [[cultural heritage]] worldwide;
* To generate more robust theoretical understandings as well as norms of good practice in heritage work; and
* To make findings available to stakeholders, from Aboriginal communities to professional organizations to government agencies, allowing them to develop and refine their own theories, principles, policies and practices.

===Mission===
IPinCH is an international collaboration of [[archaeologists]], [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous organizations]], [[lawyers]], [[anthropologists]], [[ethicists]], museum specialists, policy makers, and others, working to facilitate fair and equitable exchanges of knowledge relating to heritage. The IPinCH Project is concerned with the theoretical, ethical, and practical implications of [[commodification]], [[appropriation (sociology)|appropriation]], and other flows of knowledge about the past, and how these may affect communities, researchers, and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].

===Vision===
IPinCH provides a foundation of research, knowledge and resources to assist archaeologists, academic institutions, descendant communities, scholars, policy makers, and other stakeholders in negotiating more equitable and successful terms of research and policies through an agenda of community-based research and topical exploration of intellectual property (IP) issues. IPinCH focuses on archaeology as a primary component of cultural heritage; however, this project is ultimately concerned with larger issues of the nature of knowledge and rights based on culture‚Äîhow these are defined and used, who has control and access, and especially how fair and appropriate use and access can be achieved to the benefit of all stakeholders in the past.

==Project Description==
The 7-year project began in 2008 with a $2.5 million grant from the Major Collaborative Research Initiatives program of Canada‚Äôs Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sshrc.ca/ Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council&lt;/ref&gt;  About one-fourth of the project budget is reserved for student fellowships&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/opportunities/Students student fellowships&lt;/ref&gt; and research support, and one-fourth for community-based heritage research for case studies&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project_components case studies&lt;/ref&gt; related to the project themes.

The IPinCH Project is led by Dr. Nicholas and guided by a steering committee of six team members representing five universities ([https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/catherine-bell Catherine Bell] [University of Alberta], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/joe-watkins Joe Watkins] [University of Oklahoma], and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/john-r-welch John Welch] [Simon Fraser University], plus Hollowell and Bannister). Team members represent nine Canadian and nineteen international universities, and eleven Canadian and international organizations.  A project advisory board will review project activities in addition to advising on strategies for linking with stakeholders and dissemination of results ([https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/michael-brown Michael Brown] [Williams College], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/larry-chartrand Larry Chartrand] [M√©tis; University of Winnipeg], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/robert-layton Robert Layton] [University of Durham, UK], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/peter-levesque Peter Levesque] [Principal Director, KMbW - Knowledge Mobilization Works], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/robert-paterson Robert K.

The IPinCH project initially had three components:
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives Community Initiatives]
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/working-groups Working Groups]
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/knowledge-base Knowledge Base]
As of March 2016, eight of the twelve community initiatives have been completed and the final reports are available on the IPinCH website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives|title=IPinCH Community Initiatives|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for details on IPinCH‚Äôs Community Initiatives, please see below). To accommodate broadening research interests and developments, IPinCH Working Groups have been reconceptualized as Research Themes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/working-groups|title=Working Groups|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see section below on Research Themes). The knowledge base (KB),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/knowledge-base|title=The IPinCH Knowledge Base|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online searchable database and archive containing scholarly and popular articles, documents and tools created by communities, global case studies, research protocols and legislation, and resources created by the IPinCH project, has been retired from the IPinCH website. A selection of KB material is available within Simon Fraser University‚Äôs Institutional Repository Summit.

In IPinCH‚Äôs [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives Community-Based Initiatives] (CBIs), team members work closely with communities to investigate and address pressing cultural heritage challenges in specific contexts. IPinCH-supported Community-Based Initiatives are located all over the globe. We fund seventeen initiatives, based in Australia, Canada, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand, and the United States, working with groups such as the Inuvialuit, the Penobscot Nation, the Ainu, the Hopi Tribe, and the Moriori.

IPinCH values a collaborative approach and employs Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)&lt;ref&gt;Minkler, M., and N. Wallerstein (editors) 2003 Community-Based Participatory Research for Health. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Springett, J. 2003 Issues in Participatory Evaluation. In Community-Based Participatory Research for Health, edited by M. Minkler and N. Wallerstein, pp. 263‚Äì288. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;St. Denis, V. 1992 Community-Based Participatory Research: Aspects of the Concept Relevant for Practice. Native Studies Review 8 (2): pp. 51‚Äì74&lt;/ref&gt; methods that engage the community in all aspects of the research process. In the CBIs, communities determine the research goals, which form for the foundation for the initiative, including the practical and theoretical outputs. After community review, the results of these initiatives will be made available to partner organizations and stakeholders, in order to assist them in refining their own policies and approaches.

Key features of a CBPR methodology include: 
*A collaborative approach that engages the community or organization in all aspects of the research process‚Äîfrom development of research questions and research design to conducting the research, designing outputs, and disseminating results;
*Research goals that prioritize community needs and result in direct community benefits;
*Projects that contribute to community capacity building and to sustainable and more equitable relations between the community and outside researchers, promote respect for local values, and address mistrust, inequity, and similar issues in conventional research.

Twelve community initiatives received funding from IPinCH and a further five Special Initiatives have also been approved. The community initiatives address a broad range of pressing cultural heritage topics: 
*'''A Case of Access: Inuvialuit Engagement with the Smithsonian‚Äôs MacFarlane Collection'''

The MacFarlane Collection is a collection of 550 [[Inuvialuit]] items bought by [[Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company]] trader Roderick MacFarlane in the mid-1800s for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, David. Painted Wooden Plaques from the MacFarlane Collection: The Earliest Inuvialuit Graphic Art. ARCTIC VOL. 59, NO. 4 (DECEMBER 2006) P. 351‚Äì 360&lt;/ref&gt; Inuvialuit elders, youth, cultural experts, anthropologists and museum curators shared with one another their respective knowledge about the museum collection and documented the process. The project has encouraged interaction and engagement by the Inuvialuit with the objects in the MacFarlane Collection, supported by the creation of a [http://www.inuvialuitlivinghistory.ca/ virtual exhibit] and searchable archive of the collection. Additional details about the "A Case of Access" Community Initiative are available in the [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/project_components/community-based_initiatives/acaseofaccess_finalreport_2014.pdf full report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/project_components/community-based_initiatives/inuvialuit_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary], available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Cultural Tourism in Nunavik'''

In the early 1990s, the first few attempts at [[cultural tourism]] in [[Nunavik]] saw little success, but there is now support from businesses to include tourism as a facet of economic development. The [http://www.avataq.qc.ca/en/Home Avataq Cultural Institute], an IPinCH partner organization, has advocated the development of cultural tourism for some time, but Avataq sees a world‚Äôs difference between what it envisions as responsible development and certain economic interests‚Äô vision for cultural tourism. This case study works with local communities to answer several key questions: What part do the Nunavimmiut really play in this development? Are they silent participants or, on the contrary, the driving force behind this development? One of the aims of the research is to re-centre the meaning of cultural tourism as a means of protecting [[Inuit culture]], possibly in tension with the Quebec government‚Äôs ‚Äú[[Plan Nord]]‚Äù for Northern economic and tourism development.

*'''Developing Policies and Protocols for the Culturally Sensitive Intellectual Properties of the Penobscot Nation of Maine'''

Indigenous communities face legal, social, cultural, and economic challenges when attempting to protect or manage their intellectual property (IP), and often there is a lack of community infrastructure to formalize processes for confronting IP issues. To mitigate this challenge, the [[Penobscot|Penobscot Nation]] in Maine established an IP Working Group that developed tribal protocols, tools, and an internal infrastructure to address IP issues particularly related to archaeology and heritage-based places. This involved discussions around what constitutes Penobscot Nation intellectual property, what characterizes intellectual property violations (and how to deal with them), and identifying the community‚Äôs intellectual property priorities. The [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/penobscot_final_report_2014.pdf full project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/penobscot_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.
*'''Education, Protection and Management of ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' (Sanilac Petroglyph Site)'''

For the [[Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation]] of Michigan, ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' is a sacred place where teachings from their Anishinabe ancestors are embedded in the rock as [[petroglyph]]s. Amidst concerns over the inappropriate use of the teachings, this case study explores issues around cultural commodification with the goal of working with the Saginaw Chippewa's Ziibiwing Cultural Society to create a plan to protect and control the use of the ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' site. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/ezhibiigaadek_asin_finalreport_2016.pdf project report] is available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Grassroots Resource Preservation and Management in Kyrgyzstan: Ethnicity, Nationalism and Heritage on a Human Scale'''

This case study began a public conversation among both urban and rural people about intellectual property and cultural heritage in [[Kyrgyzstan]], a post-Soviet nation where ties to the past have been attenuated and even severed. In Kyrgyzstan, local communities have little or no awareness of the heritage resources in their midst, and damage to sites is common. This case study had three components all with the shared goal of encouraging a national dialogue on cultural heritage and intellectual property. The first project involved developing a new foundation for an endangered archaeological structure. The second project focused on preserving oral traditions for younger generations of Kyrgyz, while the third initiative was centered on creating a photographic record of local archaeological sites.
*'''Moriori Cultural Database'''

Located on Rƒìkohu ([[Chatham Islands]], New Zealand), this project involved research and community-building related to [[Moriori people|Moriori]] identity, indigenous cultural heritage and resource management and protection. A key component of this study was the development of a multi-layer database to integrate research on Moriori identity, cultural heritage protection, land use, and resource management in culturally sensitive ways. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/moriori_final_report_2014.pdf project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/moriori_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Secwepemc Territorial Authority ‚Äì Honoring Ownership of Tangible / Intangible Culture'''

This initiative brought together [[Secwepemc]] community leaders and knowledge holders from Neskonlith, Adams Lake, and Splats‚Äôin Bands of interior [[British Columbia]] with a group of social, legal, and political scholars. This community initiative will outline approaches to cultural heritage encounters within Secwepemc territory, examining what it would look like were we to fully accept and act upon the premise that Secwepemc Peoples‚Äô have economic, political, and legal authority within their territory. At the heart of this project is a desire to develop fruitful scholarly and economic collaborations, while fully honouring Secwepemc peoples‚Äô assertions of territorial authority.
* '''The History and Contemporary Practices of the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office'''
What are the differences between [[Hopi]] notions of ''navoti'' (‚Äú[[traditional knowledge]]‚Äù) and Euro-American understandings of intellectual property? What are the implications of this in terms of managing cultural knowledge resources? This case study is working towards developing an official cultural heritage management guide for the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office and the Hopi Tribe.

*'''The Journey Home - Guiding Intangible Knowledge Production in the Analysis of Ancestral Remains'''

In the Journey Home project, the question was not whether ancestral remains should be repatriated from the [[University of British Columbia]] Lab of Archaeology to the [[Sto:lo|St√≥:l≈ç Nation]], but rather how to do things right, regardless of timeframe. This study developed mutually acceptable guidelines for [[repatriation]], addressing complex questions related to the production of knowledge, authority, control, and ongoing relationships with ancestors. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/thejourneyhome_finalreport_2016.pdf project report] is available on the IPinCH website.
*'''The Ngaut Ngaut Interpretive Project: Providing Culturally Sustainable Online Interpretive Content to the Public'''

Indigenous groups around the world are struggling to come to terms with the issues that an online environment poses to the presentation of the Indigenous past and present. In this initiative, the Mannum Aboriginal Community Association Inc. countered offensive and incorrect online information about the Ngaut Ngaut heritage complex in [[South Australia]] by creating their own interpretive content in which they shared community perceptions and values about this significant cultural landscape. The [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3YUNheVwtsFcVRWQXNDbG5MNkE/view?pli=1 full project report] and an [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3YUNheVwtsFYm4wWndadjFRTTQ/view?pli=1 interpretive guide] for the Ngaut Ngaut site are available on the IPinCH website. 
*'''Treaty Relations as a Method of Resolving IP Issues'''

This case study examined the political relationship established between [[First Nations]] and Canada through historical [[Treaty|treaties]]. Did the treaty relationship include, either directly or indirectly, a shared understanding of how the cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples would be treated by Settlers and by the governments they established? How might this historical relationship serve Settler-First Nations relations today? Based on a careful examination of published primary and secondary materials related to treaty negotiations in central Ontario and the Northwest Territories, the study applies historical, oral-historical, and anthropological methods and attempts to identify aspects of these historic treaties which have resonance for current IP debates around topics such as property, ownership, and jurisdiction. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/treatyrelations_finalreport_2014.pdf project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/treatyrelations_projectsummary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.
*'''Yukon First Nations Heritage Values and Heritage Resource Management'''

This community initiative seeks understandings of heritage values from three participating [[Yukon]] First Nations: the [[Champagne and Aishihik First Nations|Champagne &amp; Aishihik First Nations]], the [[Carcross/Tagish First Nation|Carcross-Tagish First Nation,]] and the [[Ta'an Kwach'an Council|Ta'an Kwach'√§n Council.]] This project will explore how the values of Yukon First Nations towards heritage resources differ from Western understandings, and will articulate and document what Indigenous heritage management practices look like on a practical level.

==Research Themes==
Integrating research findings and knowledge from our Community-Based Initiatives and other sources, the IPinCH Research Themes explore unique questions relating to intellectual property and heritage.  Each group is led by at least two team members, as Research Theme Co-Chairs. Membership in these groups is open to all associated students, partnering organization representatives, co-investigators, associates, collaborators, research assistants, steering committee members, and community representatives.
* '''Bioarchaeology, DNA, and Indigeneity'''
How is [[Genetics|genetic]] information being used to define‚Äîor redefine‚Äîidentity, [[Ancestor|ancestry]], and diversity? What are the ensuing social, ethical, and practical implications of [[DNA]] research for descendent communities, First Nations peoples, and other stakeholders? What are the intersections of genetic and cultural identities? What can research examples such as that of [[Kw√§day D√§n Ts'√¨nchi]] (Long Ago Person Found) or the [[Anzick-1|Clovis period child]] from the Anzick site teach us about moving forward with genetic studies through collaborative research? As archaeologists and anthropologists increasingly turn to genetic information to provide insights into the past, there are important implications for Indigenous peoples today. From genetic ancestry tests that purport to identify ‚ÄúNative American ancestry,‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science|last=TallBear|first=Kim|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Minnesota|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the potential application of [[ancient DNA analysis]] to assist with the [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains|repatriation]] of human remains, DNA is changing the way in which identity is constructed‚Äîboth for ancient and present-day peoples. Research theme chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/daryl-pullman Daryl Pullman] (Memorial University), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/alan-h-goodman Alan Goodman] (Hampshire College), and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/dorothy-lippert Dorothy Lippert] (Smithsonian Institution).
*'''Commodifications of Cultural Heritage'''
How can processes of commodification be both harmful and beneficial? What tools and strategies can Indigenous communities and scholars use to deal with commodification concerns and opportunities? This theme covers complex topics such as the role of government and legislation in regulating cultural commodification, whether commodification can benefit disempowered communities, and the impact of treating human remains as commodities, whether in medical science or museums. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/sven-ouzman Sven Ouzman] ([[University of Pretoria]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates/solen-roth Solen Roth] (University of British Columbia). 
*'''Community-Based Cultural Heritage Research (CBCHR)'''
[[Community-Based Participatory Research]] (CBPR) methods engage communities in all aspects of the research process. In IPinCH‚Äôs Community Initiatives, the communities determine the research goals, which form for the foundation for the initiative, including the practical and theoretical outputs. These IPinCH-supported initiatives may serve as positive examples of CBPR methods being put to use to investigate and address pressing cultural heritage needs. There is an ongoing need for background information and case studies to help students and scholars think through the implications of community-based work. This theme also amalgamates resources to help foster balanced and mutually beneficial relationships between academic and community researchers and promote fair and culturally-appropriate uses of intellectual property. Research theme chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/kelly-bannister Kelly Bannister] (University of Victoria), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/julie-hollowell Julie Hollowell] (Indiana University), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/ian-lilley Ian Lilley] (University of Queensland), and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/john-r-welch John R. Welch] (Simon Fraser University). 
*'''Cultural Tourism'''
The diversity of the world‚Äôs cultures, both past and present, is one of the key attractions of travel. Governments, the tourism industry, and communities work hard to create unforgettable cultural products and experiences. But are the economic benefits of these experiences shared equally with communities? Are they sustainable environmentally, are they culturally appropriate experiences to share, and do communities have control over how their culture is represented? These questions are at the heart of the ''Cultural Tourism'' research theme. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/lena-mortensen Lena Mortensen] (University of Toronto - Scarborough) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/david-schaepe David Schaepe] (Sto:lo Nation)
*'''Indigenous Peoples, Cultural Heritage, and the Law'''
The ''Indigenous Peoples, Cultural Heritage, and the Law'' Research Theme investigates the application of [[intellectual property law]] to the realm of cultural heritage, as well as alternative models to protect, promote, and maintain cultural and heritage goods. A number of legal systems coexist and often intersect with conventional intellectual property protections, including customary law, international law, informal or ‚Äúvernacular‚Äù intellectual property, and moral economies. Many stakeholders thus face an inter-jurisdictional geography of cultural rights, consisting of [[indigenist]] social movements, NGOs, development agencies and institutions, multilateral institutions, and the [[Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples]]. This theme addresses these complex legal and political landscapes. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/rosemary-j-coombe Rosemary Coombe] ([[York University]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates/patricia-goff Patricia Goff] ([[Wilfrid Laurier University]], Ontario).
*'''Indigenous Research Ethics'''
The ''Indigenous Research Ethics'' theme explores the dynamic intersection of policies, procedures, practices, and philosophies of contemporary Indigenous research ethics. The research contained within this theme represents a useful resource for practitioners who grapple with intellectual property ethics and issues. Emphasis is placed upon the special demands and rewards of collaborative research practice. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/alison-wylie Alison Wylie] ([[University of Washington]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/sonya-atalay Sonya Atalay] ([[Indiana University]]).
* '''Safeguarding Indigenous Heritage'''
In 2014, the long-standing conflict over Grace Islet, off [[Salt Spring Island]], B.C., a well-documented [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] burial islet, reached a boiling point as construction began on a private residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/resources/declarations/open-letter-grace-islet|title=An Open Letter on Grace Islet|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grace-islet-home-on-sacred-aboriginal-cemetery-to-be-demolished-1.3186534|title=Home on sacred B.C. aboriginal cemetery to be demolished|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following protests by First Nations, scholars, and members of the public, construction was halted and the province of British Columbia eventually purchased Grace Islet from the private landowner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grace-islet-controversy-ends-as-b-c-steps-in-to-buy-land-1.2906882|title=Grace Islet burial site saved as province steps in|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IPinCH believes that the critical issue in the Grace Islet case is the absence of respect for First Nations laws, values, and practices relating to burial sites and ancestral remains, and the need for descendant communities to have a say in how their ancestral sites are managed and protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/resources/declarations/ancestral-burial-grounds|title=Declaration on the Safeguarding of Indigenous Ancestral Burial Grounds as Sacred Sites and Cultural Landscapes|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace Islet is one of many such cases in British Columbia and, indeed, around the world, that demonstrate the limited legal protections available to protect Indigenous burial grounds''.'' This research theme seeks to examine current challenges in protecting Indigenous ancestral burial sites within the province and to propose a new approach that meets the needs of all parties.

Renowned for its postmodern complexity and opacity, Ashbery's work still proves controversial. Ashbery stated that he wished his work to be accessible to as many people as possible, and not to be a private dialogue with himself.&lt;ref name=NYT-MTV/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4542617 NPR interview with Ashbery about his collection ''Where Shall I Wander'' - including poem audio.

Langdon Hammer, chairman of the English Department at [[Yale University]], wrote in 2008, "No figure looms so large in American poetry over the past 50 years as John Ashbery" and "No American poet has had a larger, more diverse vocabulary, not [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]], not [[Ezra Pound|Pound]]."&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, Langdon, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/books/review/Hammer-t.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=books&amp;pagewanted=print "‚ÄòBut I Digress‚Äô"], review of ''Notes from the Air: Selected Later Poems'', by John Ashbery, ''New York Times Book Review'', April 20, 2008, accessed same day.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephanie Burt]], a poet and [[Harvard]] professor of English, has compared Ashbery to [[T.

==Life==
Ashbery was born in [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/238 |title=John Ashbery |publisher=[[Academy of American Poets]] |accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]], the son of Helen (n√©e Lawrence), a biology teacher, and Chester Frederick Ashbery, a farmer.&lt;ref name="CurryRamm2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Curry|editor1-first=Jennifer|editor2-last=Ramm|editor2-first=David|editor3-last=Rich|editor3-first=Mari|title=World Authors, 2000-2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqsjAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA14|year=2007|publisher=[[H. W. Wilson Company|H.W. Wilson]]|isbn=978-0-8242-1077-9|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised on a farm near [[Lake Ontario]]; his brother died when they were children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/20340 |title=Video: The Other Twenty-Three Hours |year=2008 |publisher=[[Academy of American Poets]] |accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashbery was educated at [[Deerfield Academy]], an all-boys school, where he read such poets as [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] and began writing poetry. Two of his poems were published in ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine by a classmate who had submitted them under his own name, without Ashbery's knowledge or permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/144210/john-ashbery|title=Remembering John Ashbery|last=|first=|date=2017-09-11|website=|publisher=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashbery also published a piece of short fiction and a handful of poems‚Äîincluding a sonnet about his frustrated love for a fellow student‚Äîin the school newspaper, the ''Deerfield Scroll''. His first ambition was to be a painter: from the age of 11 until he was 15, Ashbery took weekly classes at the art museum in Rochester.
[[File:John Ashbery by David Shankbone.jpg|right|thumb|Ashbery at a 2007 tribute to [[W.H. Auden]] at [[Cooper Union]] in [[New York City]].]]
Ashbery graduated in 1949 with an A.B., ''[[cum laude]]'', from [[Harvard|Harvard College]], where he was a member of the ''[[Harvard Advocate]]'', the university's literary magazine, and the [[Signet Society]]. He wrote his senior thesis on the poetry of [[W. H. Auden]]. At Harvard he befriended fellow writers [[Kenneth Koch]], [[Barbara Epstein]], V. R. Lang, [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[Edward Gorey]], and was a classmate of [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Bly]] and [[Peter Davison (poet)|Peter Davison]]. Ashbery went on to study briefly at [[New York University]] before receiving an M.A. from [[Columbia University]] in 1951.

After working as a [[copywriter]] in [[New York City|New York]] from 1951 to 1955,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/38138/John-Ashbery |title=John Ashbery |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]] |accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the mid-1950s, when he received a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Fellowship]], through 1965, Ashbery lived in [[France]]. He was an editor of the 12 issues of ''Art and Literature'' (1964‚Äì67) and the ''New Poetry'' issue of [[Harry Mathews]]' ''Locus Solus'' (# 3/4; 1962). To make ends meet he translated French murder mysteries, served as the art editor for the European edition of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and was an art critic for ''Art International'' (1960‚Äì65) and a Paris correspondent for ''[[ARTnews]]'' (1963‚Äì66), when Thomas Hess took over as editor. During this period he lived with the French poet [[Pierre Martory]], whose books ''Every Question but One'' (1990), ''The Landscape is behind the Door'' (1994) and ''The Landscapist'' he translated (2008), as he did [[Arthur Rimbaud]] (''Illuminations''), [[Max Jacob]] (''The Dice Cup''), [[Pierre Reverdy]] (''Haunted House''), and many titles by [[Raymond Roussel]]. After returning to the United States, he continued his career as an [[art critic]] for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazines while also serving on the editorial board of ''ARTnews'' until 1972. Several years later, he began a stint as an editor at ''[[Partisan Review]]'', serving from 1976 to 1980.

During the fall of 1963, Ashbery became acquainted with [[Andy Warhol]] at a scheduled poetry reading at the [[Literary Theatre]] in New York. He had previously written favorable reviews of Warhol's art. That same year he reviewed Warhol's ''Flowers'' exhibition at Galerie [[Ileana Sonnabend]] in Paris, describing Warhol's visit to Paris as "the biggest transatlantic fuss since [[Oscar Wilde]] brought culture to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] in the nineties". Ashbery returned to New York near the end of 1965 and was welcomed with a large party at [[the Factory]]. He became close friends with poet [[Gerard Malanga]], Warhol's assistant, on whom he had an important influence as a poet. In 1967 his poem ''Europe'' was used as the central text in [[Eric Salzman|Eric Salzman's]] ''Foxes and Hedgehogs'' as part of the ''New Image of Sound'' series at [[Hunter College]], conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]]. When the poet sent Salzman ''Three Madrigals'' in 1968, the composer featured them in the seminal ''Nude Paper Sermon'', released by [[Nonesuch Records]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowchartfoundation.org/tc/advanced_search.php?reorder=yes&amp;sortfield=publicationdate&amp;sorttype=desc&amp;se_type=EX&amp;pg=20&amp;/|title=Ashbery Research Center archive|publisher=|accessdate=3 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141214045519/http://www.flowchartfoundation.org/tc/advanced_search.php?reorder=yes&amp;sortfield=publicationdate&amp;sorttype=desc&amp;se_type=EX&amp;pg=20&amp;/|archivedate=14 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, Ashbery began teaching at Brooklyn College, where his students included poet [[John Yau]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=AAAS /&gt; In the 1980s, he moved to [[Bard College]], where he was the Charles P. Stevenson, Jr., Professor of Languages and Literature, until 2008, when he retired but continued to win awards, present readings, and work with graduate and undergraduates at many other institutions. He was the [[List of U.S. states' Poets Laureate|poet laureate of New York State]] from 2001 to 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/poets/newyork.html|work=US State Poet Laureates|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also served for many years as a chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]]. He served on the contributing editorial board of the literary journal ''[[Conjunctions]]''. In 2008 Ashbery was named the first poet laureate of [[MtvU]], a division of [[MTV]] broadcast to U.S. college campuses, with excerpts from his poems featured in 18 promotional spots and the works in their entirety on the broadcaster's website.
&lt;ref&gt;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/books/27laur.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashbery was a Millet Writing Fellow at [[Wesleyan University]] in 2010, and participated in Wesleyan's Distinguished Writers Series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesleyanargus.com/2010/02/19/john-ashbery-visits-presents-his-poetry/ John Ashbery Visits, Presents His Poetry], Wesleyanargus. By Marjorie Rivera, Contributing Writer. 19 February 19, 2010. Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a founding member of [[The Raymond Roussel Society]], with [[Miquel Barcel√≥]], Joan Bofill-Amarg√≥s, [[Michel Butor]], Thor Halvorssen and Hermes Salceda.

Ashbery lived in New York City and [[Hudson, New York]], with his husband, David Kermani.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/arts/john-ashbery-dead-prize-winning-poet.html&lt;/ref&gt; He died of natural causes on September 3, 2017, at his home in Hudson, at the age of 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/john-ashbery-regarded-worlds-greatest-poets-dies-age-49599605|title=John Ashbery, regarded as one of the world's greatest poets, dies at age 90, his husband confirms|first=ABC|last=News|publisher=|accessdate=3 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904013700/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/john-ashbery-regarded-worlds-greatest-poets-dies-age-49599605|archivedate=4 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/John-Ashbery-celebrated-and-challenging-poet-12170718.php|title=John Ashbery, celebrated and challenging poet, dies at 90|publisher=|accessdate=3 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904012957/http://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/John-Ashbery-celebrated-and-challenging-poet-12170718.php|archivedate=4 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Ashbery's long list of awards began with the [[Yale Younger Poets Prize]] in 1956. The selection, by [[W. H. Auden]], of Ashbery's first collection, ''Some Trees'', later caused some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/jascha-kessler/|title=Jascha Kessler - ArtsBeat Blog - The New York Times|website=papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5235921.ece|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|website=entertainment.timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5278554.ece|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|website=entertainment.timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume was screened out in the contest's early stages and was given to Auden by [[Chester Kallman]] after Auden had decided not to award the prize that year because of the poor quality of the volumes he received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=_sFZAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=After the Death of Poetry: Poet and Audience in Contemporary America|last=Shetley|first=Vernon Lionel|date=1993|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1993|isbn=0822313421|location=Durham &amp; London|pages=109|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashbery's early work shows the influence of Auden, along with [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Boris Pasternak]], and many of the French [[surrealists]] (his translations from French literature are numerous), though he claimed in a 1956 letter to "hate all modern French poetry, except for [[Raymond Roussel]]‚Äù and to like his own "wildly inaccurate translations of some of the 20th-century ones, but not the originals‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/15/collected-french-translations-poetry-john-ashbery-review|title=Collected French Translations: Poetry by John Ashbery ‚Äì review|last=McGuinness|first=Patrick|date=2014-11-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, John Bernard Myers, co-owner of the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], categorized Ashbery's [[avant-garde]] poetry and that of [[Kenneth Koch]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[James Schuyler]], [[Barbara Guest]], [[Kenward Elmslie]] and others as a "[[New York School (art)|New York School]]", despite their very different styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://observer.com/2013/01/the-meaning-of-all-this-talking-to-john-ashbery-about-his-past-present-and-future/2/|title=The Meaning of All This: Talking to John Ashbery About His Past, Present and Future|date=2013-01-01|work=Observer|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 Myers launched the magazine ''Semi-Colon'', in which New York School poets appeared amid an eclectic mix of authors, such as Auden, [[James Ingram Merrill|James Ingram Merill]] and [[Saul Bellow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=SpxbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets|last=Diggory|first=Terence|date=|publisher=Infobase Learning|year=2013|isbn=9781438140667|location=New York|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ashbery published some work in the avant-garde [[little magazine]] [[Nomad (magazine)|''Nomad'']] at the beginning of the 1960s. He then wrote two collections while in France, the highly controversial ''The Tennis Court Oath'' (1962) and ''Rivers and Mountains'' (1966), before returning to New York to write ''The Double Dream of Spring'', published in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Perrin Robert|date=December 2013|others=|title=‚ÄúRivers and mountains‚Äù : the conceptual wedding of the temporal and spatial in the early volumes of John Ashbery|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/24089|journal=University of Texas Electronic Theses and Dissertations|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Paul Auster John Ashbery BBF 2010 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul Auster]] and Ashbery discussing their work at the 2010 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]].]]
Increasing critical recognition in the 1970s transformed Ashbery from an obscure avant-garde experimentalist into one of America's most important poets (though still one of its most controversial). After the publication of ''Three Poems'' (1973) came ''[[Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror (book)|Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror]]'', for which he was awarded the three major American poetry awards: the [[Pulitzer Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/john-ashbery|title=Winners in Poetry: Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror, by John Ashbery (Viking)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.pulitzer.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Book Award for Poetry|National Book Award]]&lt;ref name=nba1976&gt;

His subsequent collection, the more difficult ''Houseboat Days'' (1977), reinforced Ashbery's reputation, as did 1979's ''As We Know,'' which contains the long, double-columned poem "Litany." In 1988, his "Bridge Poem" was installed, using metal letters, on the 375-foot-wide [[Irene Hixon Whitney Bridge]] in Minneapolis; the poet was selected by the bridge's architect, artist [[Siah Armajani]], and commissioned by the [[Walker Art Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/magazine/john-ashbery-siah-armajani-bridge-poem|title=Not a Conduit but a Place: John Ashbery Reads his Poem for Siah Armajani‚Äôs Bridge|first=Paul|last=Schmelzere|date=12 September 2017|via=Walker Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s and 1990s, Ashbery had become a central figure in American and more broadly English-language poetry, as his number of imitators attested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://radioopensource.org/john-ashbery-is-you/|title=Let Us Now Praise John Ashbery - Open Source with Christopher Lydon|website=radioopensource.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashbery's works are characterized by a free-flowing, often disjunctive syntax; extensive linguistic play, often infused with considerable humor; and a prosaic, sometimes disarmingly flat or parodic tone. The play of the human mind is the subject of a great many of his poems. Ashbery once said that his goal was "to produce a poem that the critic cannot even talk about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2114565/|title=The Instruction Manual|first=Meghan|last=O'Rourke|date=9 March 2005|publisher=|accessdate=3 September 2017|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formally, the earliest poems show the influence of conventional poetic practice, yet by ''The Tennis Court Oath'' a much more revolutionary engagement with form appears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Straub|first=Peter|date=2007|title=The Oath Unbroken: The Tennis Court Oath (1962)|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24516471|journal=Conjunctions|issue=49|pages=259‚Äì262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashbery returned to something approaching a reconciliation between tradition and innovation with many of the poems in ''The Double Dream of Spring'',&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=490097|title=Ashbery and the Individual Talent|first=James|last=Longenbach|date=3 September 1997|publisher=|journal=American Literary History|volume=9|issue=1|pages=103‚Äì127|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/490097}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his ''Three Poems'' are written in long blocks of prose. Although he has never again approached the radical experimentation of ''The Tennis Court Oath'' poems or "The Skaters" and "Into the Dusk-Charged Air" from his collection ''Rivers and Mountains,'' syntactic and semantic experimentation, linguistic expressiveness, deft, often abrupt shifts of register, and insistent wit remain consistent elements of his work.

Ashbery's art criticism has been collected in the 1989 volume ''Reported Sightings, Art Chronicles 1957-1987'', edited by the poet [[David Bergman (American writer)|David Bergman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-24/books/bk-130_1_american-artists|title=REPORTED SIGHTINGS: Art Chronicles, 1957-1987  by John Ashbery edited by David Bergman (Alfred A.

The '''Letoon trilingual''' is an inscription in three languages: standard [[Lycian language|Lycian]] or Lycian A, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]] covering the faces of a four-sided stone  [[stele]] called the '''Letoon Trilingual Stele''', discovered in 1973 during the [[archeology|archeological]] exploration of the [[Letoon]] temple complex, near [[Xanthos]], ancient [[Lycia]], in present-day [[Turkey]]. The inscription is a public record of a decree authorizing the establishment of a cult, with references to the deities, and provisions for officers in the new cult. The Lycian requires 41 lines; the Greek, 35 and the Aramaic, 27. They are not word-for-word translations, but each contains some information not present in the others. The Aramaic is somewhat condensed.&lt;ref name=JNES37-2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teixidor|first=Javier|title=The Aramaic Text in the Trilingual Stele from Xanthus|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=37|issue=2|pages=181‚Äì185|date=April 1978|doi=10.1086/372644|jstor=545143}} First page displayable no charge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the use of the term "Letoon" with regard to the inscription and the stele is unequivocal, there is no standard name for either. '''Xanthos trilingual''' is sometimes used, which is to be distinguished from the Xanthos bilingual, meaning the [[Xanthian Obelisk|Xanthos stele]]. However, sometimes Xanthos stele is used of the Letoon trilingual stele as well as for the tomb at Xanthos. Moreover, the term Xanthos trilingual (Lycian A, Lycian B, Greek) is sometimes used of the tomb at Xanthos. In the latter two cases only the context can provide clues as to which stele is meant.

==Find site==
The Lƒìt≈çon was a temple complex about {{convert|4|km|0|sp=us}} south of [[Xanthos|Xanthus]], capital of ancient [[Lycia]]. The complex dates to as early as the 7th century BC and must have been a center for the [[Lycian League]]. In it were three temples to [[Leto|Lƒìt≈ç]], [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo|Apoll≈ç]]. The stele was found near the temple of Apollo. It has been removed to the museum at [[Fethiye]]. The entire site is currently under several inches of water.
{{details|Letoon}}

==Date of the inscription==
The first five lines of the [[Aramaic]] version mention that the inscription was made in the first year of the reign of the Persian king, Artaxerxes, but does not say which Artaxerxes:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the month siwan, year 1 of King Artaxerxes. In the frontier of Ar√±na. Pixodarus son of Katomno, the satrap who is in Karka and Termmila.&lt;ref name=JNES37-2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; If the king in question was [[Artaxerxes III Ochus]], the date of the inscription is 358 BC. However, [[Pixodarus of Caria|Pixodarus]] was [[satrap]] of [[Caria]] and [[Lycia]] no earlier than 341/340. Therefore the Persian king most likely was [[Arses of Persia|Arses]], son of Artaxerxes III, who took his father's name on coming to power. In that case the trilingual is dated to 337/336 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1986) pages 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4903">'''Luis Leal''' ([[Linares, Nuevo Le√≥n]], September 17, 1907 ‚Äì [[Santa Barbara, California]], January 25, 2010) was a [[Mexican-American]] writer and literary critic.

==Biography==
Born into a family that had participated in the [[Mexican Revolution]], Leal lived in the United States beginning in 1927, studying at [[Northwestern University]]. There, in 1936, he met his future wife Gladys Clemens, with whom he would have two sons, Antonio and Luis Alfonso. In 1939 he was naturalized as an American citizen. After serving in the [[Philippines]] during the [[Second World War]], he resumed his literary studies at the [[University of Chicago]], where in 1950 he acquired a doctorate in Spanish and Italian literature.

Leal was a pioneer in the field of [[Latin-American literature|Latin-American]] and [[Chicano literature]]. He taught briefly at the [[University of Mississippi]], but uncomfortable with [[racial segregation]] transferred to [[Emory University]] and later to the [[University of Illinois]] before finally accepting a post at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1976. There he directed the Center for Chicano Studies from 1994 to 1996. He lectured as a guest professor at various universities and continued his academic career until well into his nineties. He published articles in ''Cuadernos Americanos'' and ''Historia Mexicana,'' and edited ''Ventana Abierta: Revista Latina de Literatura, Arte y Cultura''. He was especially interested in Mexican storytelling, particularly the work of [[Mariano Azuela]] and [[Juan Rulfo]], contributing substantially to the ''Encyclopedia of Latino Folklore''. He authored some 45 books and more than four hundred articles. Among his students were the hispanists [[Merlin Foster]], [[Sara Poot-Herrera]], [[Francisco Lomel√≠]], and [[Mar√≠a Herrera-Sobek]].

Leal was one of the first professors to incorporate the writers of the [[Latin American Boom]] (i.e. [[Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], and [[Julio Cort√°zar]]) into his curriculum. He also introduced American scholarship to the works of [[Amado Nervo]], [[Mariano Azuela]], [[Rafael Mu√±oz (journalist)|Rafael Mu√±oz]], and [[Mart√≠n Luis Guzm√°n]]. With respect to Chicano literature, he promoted the study of [[Tom√°s Rivera]], [[Rolando Hinojosa]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Alurista]], and [[Rudolfo Anaya]].

A member of the Modern Language Association of America, Leal received the [[National Humanities Medal]] and was honored by the National Association for Chicano Studies in 1988. In 1991 he received the [[Order of the Aztec Eagle]].

[[File:West Dean lynchet.JPG|thumb|right|The slope of a prehistoric lynchet at [[West Dean, West Sussex]]]]
A '''lynchet''' is an earth terrace found on the side of a hill. Lynchets are a feature of ancient field systems of the [[British Isles]]. They are commonly found in vertical rows and more commonly referred to as 'strip lynchets'. Lynchets appear predominantly in Southern Britain and many are in areas close to [[Hillfort|Iron Age forts]] and other earthworks, including later Roman earthworks and earlier [[Tumulus|barrows]] from the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] periods. The size, location, spacing and number of rows of many strip lynchets indicates that many were man-made. It is most likely that lynchets were dug to maximise the use of land for agriculture, although they may have had other, ceremonial uses. 

In the village of [[Loders]], Dorset, lynchets form a terraced band structure similar to an amphitheatre overlooking the village. [[File:Loders Lynchet theatre.jpg|thumb|Lynchets are arranged in a semi-circular giant amphitheatre above the village of Loders in Dorset.]] Lynchets form part of the Conservation area of neighbouring village [[Uploders]] and where they apparently form old hillside field systems in close proximity to an iron age fort and hill-top barrows. Maps from the 1800 indicate that cider orchards were planted on some lynchets in that area. 


The traditional theory on the formation of lynchets is that they may form naturally on the downslope of a field [[plough]]ed over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68626|title=National Monuments Record Thesauri|author=|date=|work=|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=14 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172401/http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68626|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbed [[soil]] slips down the hillside to create a positive lynchet while the area reduced in level becomes a negative lynchet{{clarify|date=September 2014}}. 

The word is the diminutive form of ''lynch'', now rarely appearing in the [[English language]], indicating an [[Terrace (agriculture)|agricultural terrace]].

'''Michael A. Barry''' (born 1948, in New York) is a [[Princeton University]] professor and historian of the greater Middle East and Islamic world. Since 2004 he has taught as Lecturer in Islamic Culture in Princeton's Department of Near Eastern Studies, in addition to serving as consultative chairman of the Department of Islamic Art at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (2005-2009) and special consultant to the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] since 2009. An established authority on Islamic art and the history and culture of Afghanistan, on which subjects he has written extensively in both French and English, Barry's works include a standard French-language history of Afghanistan (''Le Royaume de l'insolence''), a biography of the late commander of the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]], [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] (''Massoud: de l‚Äôislamisme √† la libert√©''), which won France's [[Prix Femina]] in 2002, and an interpretive history of medieval Islamic figurative painting from the 15th to the 16th centuries (''Figurative Art in Medieval Islam and the Riddle of Bihz√¢d of Her√¢t (1465-1535)'').

His most recent work is ''[https://www.princeton.edu/lisd/barry_afgh.html Kabul's Long Shadows]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},'' published in 2011 by Princeton University's [https://www.princeton.edu/~lisd/ Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination] (LISD). This monograph, which summarizes Barry's views on Afghanistan for the first time in English, addresses current U.S. policy toward Afghanistan in light of the country's political and cultural history, its tribal dynamics and the strategic concerns of the surrounding region.

Prior to coming to Princeton, Barry spent many years in Afghanistan with the [[International Federation for Human Rights]], [[M√©decins du Monde]] and the [[United Nations]], working in often perilous conditions to provide and coordinate humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people from 1979 to 2001. He holds an A.B. in Near Eastern Studies from Princeton University, post-graduate degree in anthropology from [[Cambridge University]], M.A. from [[McGill University]] and Ph.D. from the [[√âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris.

A '''monologist''' ({{IPAc-en|m|…ô|Àà|n|…í|l|…ô|d í|…™|s|t|,_|-|…°|…™|s|t}}), or interchangeably '''monologuist''' ({{IPAc-en|m|…ô|Àà|n|…í|l|…ô|…°|…™|s|t}}), is a solo artist who recites or gives [[oral interpretation|dramatic readings]] from a [[monologue]], [[soliloquy]], [[poetry]], or work of literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monologue |title=Monologue |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the entertainment of an audience.  The term can also refer to a person who monopolizes a conversation; and, in an obsolete sense, could describe a bird with an unchanging, repetitive song.&lt;ref&gt;"Monologist." ''Oxford English Dictionary''. 3rd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002. Retrieved via ''OED Online'', 2017-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic monologist==
A '''dramatic monologist''' is a term sometimes applied to an actor performing in a [[monodrama]] often with accompaniment of [[music]]. In a monodrama the lone player relays a story through the eyes of a central character, though at times may take on additional roles.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis, Patrice (1998). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tIXwrduoDMoC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217 Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis]''.  Translated from the French by Christine Shantz. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|9780802081636}}. "Monodrama", pp.&amp;nbsp;217‚Äì18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era the more successful practitioners of this art have been actresses frequently referred to by the French term ‚Äúdiseuse‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Technique  By Joseph Twadell Shipley 1964 p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - the December 21, 1935 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tennyson's Rapture: Transformation in the Victorian Dramatic Monologue  By Cornelia D. J. Pearsall 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diseuse==
'''Diseuse''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|d|iÀê|Àà|z|…úÀê|z}}, {{IPAc-en|us|d|iÀê|Àà|z|uÀê|z}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|diseuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|diseuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; French for "teller", also called talkers, storytellers, dramatic-singers or dramatic-talkers,&lt;ref&gt;Theater Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaver County Times (Earl Wilson column) March 9, 1972 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  is a term, at least on the English-speaking stage, that appears to date back only to the last decade of the 19th century. The early uses of ‚Äúdiseuse‚Äù as a theatrical term in the American press seem to coincide with [[Yvette Guilbert|Yvette Guilbert‚Äôs]] tour of New York City in the mid-1890s.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Mars Semi-Weekly Sentinel''. Lemars, Iowa. January 09, 1896. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cosmopolitan Magazine]]'' in a February 1896 article on Guilbert described the term as a "newly-coined and specific title".&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmopolitan''. February 1896. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TheaterDictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Diseuse is the feminine form of the French word ''diseur'' "teller", a derivative of ''dire'' "to say, to tell", which in turn came from [[Latin]] ''dƒ´cere''.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster's Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that over the last century or so few male actors became noteworthy performing solely as a dramatic monologist, though many well known actors have played in monodramas over their careers.

The publication ''Theatre World'' wrote in a 1949 piece: "In our time we have fallen under the spell of three remarkable women practising the art of the diseuse‚Äî[[Ruth Draper]], [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]], and [[Joyce Grenfell]]. Each of these great artists has the gift of crowding the stage with imaginary figures who become so vivid as to be practically visible, but as all of these artists happen to be members of the fair sex it could be assumed that they possess a magic denied the mere male of the theatre." The article goes on to suggest that [[Sid Field]] was an actor of comparable talents.&lt;ref&gt;"Whispers from the Wings", by "Looker On". ''Theatre World''. April 1949 (vol. 45, no. 291), p.&amp;nbsp;32. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WVNXAAAAIAAJ Snippet preview on Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book "''The Guest List''" by Ethan Mordden, the art of the diseuse is defined as "a speaker of lyrics: in effect, one who uses the music to get to the words".&lt;ref&gt;The Guest List: How Manhattan Defined American Sophistication‚Äîfrom the Algonquin Round Table to Trumam capote's Ball‚Äù by Ethan Mordden (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 21, 1935, edition of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' an entertainment columnist wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The English language does not contain a word which perfectly describes the performance of Ruth Draper, who comes to the [[Regional Enterprise Tower|Nixon]] next Thursday for the first time in several years to give a different program at each of her four performances here. "Speaking Portraits" and "Character Sketches" are the two terms most frequently applied to Miss Draper's work; and yet it is something more than that. "Diseuse" is the French word, but that is more readily applicable to an artist like Yvette Guilbert or Raquel Meller. Monologist is wholly inadequate. The word "Diseuse" really means "an artist in talking" so that may be the real term to use in connection with Miss Draper.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joyce Grenfell wrote in ''Darling Ma: Joyce Grenfell's Letters to her Mother 1932‚Äì1944'', "What makes a good diseuse is a capacious verbal (and visual) imagination, and an excellent oral delivery. Call these witty ladies Diseuses of the Heart and Lungs. I do."&lt;ref&gt;Darling Ma: letters to her mother, 1932‚Äì1944 by Joyce Grenfell  1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral interpretation==

'''Oral interpretation''', sometimes called dramatic reading or interpretative reading, is the oral staging of a work of literature, prose or poetry, by a person who reads rather than memorizes the material. Typically they are performed by solo artists who ‚Äì unlike players in a monodrama ‚Äì do not assume or tell the story through any one character, but do so instead with oral nuances to bring the story alive with their interpretation of how the creator of the piece intended the story to be told.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Communication  By James Fernandes  2005 p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studygs.net/interpretive.htm |title=Studyygs.net |publisher=Studygs.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soliloquist==

The term soliloquist can apply to a monologist reciting a [[soliloquy]], usually from a play, to entertain an audience. Passages in which characters orally reveal their thoughts are probably most associated with the works of [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/soliloquy |title= definition of soliloquy by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy ‚Äì Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multiple religious belonging''' refers to the idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as [[Asia]] with its many religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion belonging with respect to religious traditions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].{{sfnm |1a1=Cornille |1y=2002 |2a1=Phan |2y=2003}}

==Context==
In some religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], those who hold to an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] understanding of religion see multiple religious belonging as problematic. This is in contrast with countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], whose cultures have a long history of being influenced by different religions.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=498}} Moreover, in the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] period people tend to question their identity, because of the unlimited choices of religions, which leads to the difficulty in defining their identity.{{sfn|Aylesworth|2015}}

Van Bragt showed that 79% of Japanese self-identify as [[Shintoist]]s and 75% self-identify as [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. The reason for the extremely high percentage of both religions is that many Japanese consider themselves as both a Shintoist and a Buddhist and do not consider it a problem to belong to more than one religion.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=8}} (Whether this statistic is correct is arguable.{{efn|According to Mark R. Mullins's figures, there are only 30‚Äì33% of Japanese consider themselves as having "personal faith", while others usually see themselves as "without religion" (''mushukyo'').{{sfn|Mullins|2011}} For further discussions, see {{harvnb|Mullins|2011|pp=197‚Äì198}}.}}) This phenomenon, according to Van Bragt, is a "[[division of labour]]". Van Bragt argued that the cause of this phenomenon is that, different from the Western concept of religion, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan are defined by their rituals and practices, not by their moral and social authority.{{efn|According to Van Bragt, while Buddhism and Shintoism govern the rituals and practices of Japanese, Confucianism is regarded as the authority for morality and the source of principles of social life.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=9}}}} Thus, the Japanese can belong to several religions that do not conflict with each other in terms of social and ethical issues.

Scholars such as [[Catherine Cornille]], [[Peter C. Phan]], [[Francis Xavier Clooney]], [[Jan Van Bragt]], [[Aloysius Pieris]] and [[Devaka Premawardhana]] have questioned the possibility of defining oneself into multiple religions. For these scholars, "religious belonging" is not an individual's subjective sense of a particular religion but rather, in Cornille's words, "the recognition of one's religious identity by the tradition itself and the disposition to submit to the conditions for membership as delineated by that tradition."{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=4}} For Cornille, the ultimate purpose of a scholarly discussion on multiple religious belonging is to transform one's religion through the understanding of other religions.{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=5}}

== Types of approaches ==
Based on Van Bragt's study, scholars have tried to investigate the possibility for adherents of a religion such as Christianity to belong to multiple religions. The approach to Christian multiple religious belonging, according to Devaka Premawardhana, can be divided into two trends: [[Peter C. Phan|Peter Phan]]'s approach based on a Christological ground, in which he emphasises on Christ's "asymmetrically superior status", and [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]]'s approach rooted in a methodological ground, which tries to cross boundaries into another religion just as religions must have discrete entities.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|p=77}}{{Elucidate|date=December 2017|reason=What does 'just as religions must have discrete entities' mean? Please clarify this sentence.}} These two approaches are summarised below.

=== Christological approach ===
Phan's approach emphasised the assymmetricality in which [[Jesus]] is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] made flesh and the climax of God dealing with humankind.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=503}} In an attempt to resonate with one's cultural identity and tradition, Phan explained that multiple religious belonging is necessary in order for practitioners of multiple belonging to treat other religions as a qualifier of their identity. This approach, according to Phan, does not deny one's Christian identity, which functions as substantive in relation to non-Christian religion.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=509‚Äì510}} Phan noted that multiple religious belonging is not a new issue in the twenty-first century but rather the common form of life of the first-century Christians recorded in the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]. In Phan's view, the disappearance of this trend was "a tragic loss to both [[Judaism]] and Christianity", because it led to a subsequent history of bitter hatred, especially from the side of Christianity.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=504‚Äì505}}

=== Methodological approach ===
As a [[Comparative theology|comparative theologian]], Clooney writes about the diversity in the world nowadays, especially with respect to the flourishing of different religions. For Clooney, reflecting on one's religion in this [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] world is necessary, so that we can "see the others in light of our own, and our own in light of the other."{{sfn|Clooney|2010|p=13}} Focusing on the study of scriptural and theological texts, Clooney compares them between Christian traditions and non-Christian religions, to "cross boundaries" to other traditions, so that one would re-think his or her theology, which would thus shape his or her identity.{{sfn|Clooney|2004}} After more than 40 years of studying Hinduism, Clooney concluded that he finds the distinctive disciplines of theology and Hinduism are "mutually enriching".{{sfn|Clooney|2010|pp=16‚Äì17}} By applying this approach, according to Clooney, one can start within his or her "home" tradition, enter a different tradition and return to his or her tradition, which is enriched and reformulated after crossing boundaries.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|pp=87‚Äì88}}

== Challenges and controversy ==
While scholars studying multiple religious belonging attempt to appreciate other religions' traditions besides their own, the conservative segment of Christianity tends to question the [[Inclusivism|inclusivistic]] view of multiple religious belonging because it implies that salvation can be found from somewhere else other than Jesus Christ.{{sfn|K√§rkk√§inen|2010}}{{efn|For definitions of traditional typology such as exclusivism and inclusivism, see {{harvnb|Migliore|2004|pp=306‚Äì307}}.}} In a 2010 article, [[Veli-Matti K√§rkk√§inen]], a systematic theologian, questioned the approach of "othering" those that have traditions different from Christians' because God is the one who offers salvation; Christians only witness it. It is out of humility that Christians can say that salvation belongs to God, and God only, in K√§rkk√§inen's view.{{sfn|K√§rkk√§inen|2010}} On the other hand, scholars studying multiple religious belonging such as [[John B. Cobb]] see this as an opportunity rather than a threat: "I do not see multiple religious belonging as the primary way into the future. The primary way is the transformation of the particular religious traditions, at least in the Christian case, through their new encounter with other traditions." For Cobb, engaging in [[interfaith dialogue]] helps smooth the tension between Christianity and Judaism and avoid misunderstanding toward [[Islam]].{{sfn|Cobb|2002|p=27}}

In a 2017 article, sociologist Steve Bruce pointed out that most of the published writings in which multiple religious belonging is studied are purely conceptual and offer "only anecdotes to illustrate theoretical or classificatory discussions".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=606}} Bruce argued that the few attempts to gather empirical data on the phenomenon have conflated a variety of different attitudes that should not be given the label of "multiple religious belonging", attitudes such as: [[Universalism|universalistic]] re-interpretation of multiple religions, multiple religious association through family ties, multiple religious interest or sympathies, ancillary religious respect for a specific aspect of a religion, and secular equal respect for all religions.{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=610‚Äì611}} Bruce argued that the term "multiple religious belonging" should be strictly confined to being "an observant 'member' of more than one religion (religion here meaning such high level abstractions as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc)", and since most religions have strict requirements for and expectations of observant members, sociologists should expect multiple religious belonging, defined in this way, to be "remarkably rare".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=611}}

The '''National Museum of Sudan''' or '''Sudan National Museum''', abbreviated '''SNM''', is a double storied 
building constructed in 1955 and established as a museum in 1971. The building and its surrounding gardens house the largest and most comprehensive [[Nubia]]n archaeological collection in the world including objects from the Paleolithic through to the Islamic period originating from every site of importance in the Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicinafrica.net/directory/sudan-national-museum Sudan National Museum] retrieved 7 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular it houses collections of these periods of the [[History of Sudan]]: [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[A-Group culture]], [[C-Group culture]], [[Kerma Culture]], [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Napata]], [[Mero√´]], [[X-Group culture]] and medieval [[Makuria]].

The museum is located on the El Neel (Nile) Avenue in Khartoum in Al-Mugran area near the spot where the [[White Nile|White]] and the [[Blue Nile|Blue]] Niles meet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/Attraction_Review-g293835-d480745-Reviews-Sudan_National_Museum-Khartoum_Khartoum_State.html Tripadvisor about the SNM]  retrieved 7 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The objects of the museum are displayed in four areas: 
* The Main Hall on the ground floor
* The gallery on the first floor
* The Open Air Museum in the garden
* The Monumental Alley outside the museum building

Key highlights of the collections include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfdas.com/IMG/pdf/livretmuse_etenglight.pdf Museum guide] retrieved 8 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Constanza de Simone, Nubia and Nubiens: The Museumization of a culture, University of Leiden,2014, pp.135-141&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Taharqo statue. A 4-meter high granite statue of Pharaoh [[Taharqo]], penultimate Pharaoh of the [[25th dynasty]], facing the main entrance welcomes the visitors of the museum. The statue was broken by the Egyptians upon sacking Napata in 591 BCE under the reign of [[Psamtik II]], then buried in a pit by kushite priests and found by [[George Reisner]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Necia Desiree Harkless, Nubian Pharaos and Meroitic Kings.

=== The museum garden ===
==== The relocated temples from lake Nasser ====
In the museum garden are rebuilt some temples and tombs relocated from the submergence area of [[Lake Nasser]].
The [[Aswan High Dam]] built across the Nile River in Egypt created a reservoir in the Nubia area, which 
extended into Sudan's territory threatening to submerge the ancient temples. During the UNESCO Salvage Campaign
&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ UNESCO Salvage Campaign] retrieved 7 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; the following temples and tombs were re-erected in the museum garden according to the same orientation of their original location surrounding an artificial strip of water symbolic of the Nile:&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Hinkel, Dismantling and Removal of Endangered Monuments in Sudanese Nubia, in: Kush V Journal of the Sudan Antiquity Service, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some remains of the temple of [[Ramses II]] of [[Aksha, Sudan|Aksha]] dedicated to [[Amun]] and to Ramses II himself. Preserved are a part of the [[Pylon (architecture)|Pylon]] with the Pharaoh worshipping the dynastic god Amun and some side-elements detailing submitted peoples.
* The temple of [[Hatshepsut]] of [[Buhen]] dedicated to [[Horus]]. The falcon-headed Horus, the mythical ancestor of all Pharaohs, and Hatshepsut appearing as a king, never as a woman.
* The temple of [[Kumma (Nubia)|Kumma]] dedicated to the ram-headed [[Khnum]], the god of the [[Nile cataracts]].
* The tomb of the Nubian prince Djehuti-hotep at [[Debeira]]
* The temple of [[Semna (Nubia)|Semna]] dedicated to [[Dedwen]] and the deified [[Sesostris III]]. The sunk reliefs of this temple were carved over a large period hence the scenes are fragmented.
* The granite columns from the Faras Cathedral

==== Inscribed rocks ====
* Fragments of inscriptions of the submerged Nile-areas inserted onto fake rocks including a [[Nilometer]] with the name of queen [[Sobekneferu]]. 
* At the banks of the water strip two Meroitic frog statues 60&amp;nbsp;cm in height from [[Basa, Sudan|Basa]] representing the water-goddess [[Heket]], as well as Beset the protector of pregnant women and newborn babies.

==== The Tabo colossi ====
Outside the museum building are set up two granite unfinished colossi from [[Tabo (Nubia)|Tabo]] of the [[Argo Island]]. 
Due to missing inscriptions they cannot be assigned to any person but they have Roman influence.

=== The Monumental Alley ===
The lane leading from the museum car parking to the exhibition halls is flanked with meroitic statues of 2 rams and 6 dark sandstone men-eating lions. The lions are from the first century BCE, as shown by the two [[cartouche]]s from king [[Amanikhabale]] engraved on the first lion on the right. As well as the frogs the lions were brought from Basa and represent the warlike lion-god [[Apedemak]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8403">'''Neo-Dada''' was a movement with [[audio art|audio]], [[visual art|visual]] and literary manifestations that had similarities in method or intent with earlier [[Dada]] artwork. In the United States the term was popularized by [[Barbara Rose]] in the 1960s and refers primarily, although not exclusively, to work created in that and the preceding decade. There was also an international dimension to the movement, [[Neo-Dada Organizers|particularly in Japan]] and in Europe, serving as the foundation of [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]] and [[Nouveau r√©alisme]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada was exemplified by its use of modern materials, popular imagery, and [[Absurdism|absurd]]ist contrast. It was a reaction to the personal emotionalism of [[Abstract Expressionism]] and, taking a lead from the practice of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]], denied traditional concepts of [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Craft, pp.10‚Äì11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
Interest in Dada followed in the wake of documentary publications, such as [[Robert Motherwell]]'s ''The Dada Painters and Poets'' (1951)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yzchnw4YUlcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and German language publications from 1957 and later, to which some former Dadaists contributed.&lt;ref&gt;Brill, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; However, several of the original Dadaists denounced the label Neo-Dada, especially in its U.S. manifestations, on the grounds that the work was derivative rather than making fresh discoveries; that aesthetic pleasure was found in what were originally protests against [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] aesthetic concepts; and because it pandered to commercialism.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Young, ''Dada and After: Extremist Modernism and English Literature'', Manchester University 1983, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-RXpAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=RA4-PT96&amp;dq=neo-dada&amp;pg=RA4-PT96#v=onepage&amp;q=neo-dada&amp;f=false pp.201‚Äì3] and Brill, pp.104‚Äì5&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the artists who identified with the trend subsequently moved on to other specialities or identified with different art movements and in many cases only certain aspects of their early work can be identified with it. For example, [[Piero Manzoni]]'s  ''Consacrazione dell'arte dell'uovo sodo'' (Artistic consecration of the hard-boiled egg, 1959), which he signed with an imprint of his thumb, or his cans of shit (1961) whose price was pegged to the value of their weight in gold, satirizing the concept of the artist's personal creation and art as commodity. 

[[File:Basel Fasnachtsbrunnen Jean Tinguely.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|A Jean Tingueley fountain in Basel]]
An allied approach is found in the creation of [[collage]] and [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], as in the junk sculptures of the American [[Richard Stankiewicz]], whose works created from scrap have been compared with Schwitters' practice. These objects are "so treated that they become less discarded than found, ''objets trouv√©s''."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater in ''A Dictionary of Modern Sculpture'', London 1962, pp.277‚Äì8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Tinguely]]'s fantastic machines, notoriously the self-destructing ''Homage to New York'' (1960), were another approach to the subversion of the mechanical.

Although such techniques as collage and assemblage may have served as inspiration, different terms were found for the objects produced, both in the U.S. and in Europe. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] labeled as "combines" such works as "Bed" (1955), which consisted of a framed quilt and pillow covered in paint and mounted on the wall. [[Arman]] labeled as "accumulations" his collections of dice and bottle tops, and as "''poubelles''" the contents of trash-bins encased in plastic. [[Daniel Spoerri]] created "snare pictures" (''tableaux pi√®ge''), of which the earliest was "Kichka's Breakfast" (1960), and in which the remains of a meal were glued to the cloth and mounted on the table-top affixed to the wall.

==Poems==
In the Netherlands the poets associated with the 'magazine for texts', ''Barbarber'' (1958‚Äì71), particularly [[J. Bernlef]] and [[K. Schippers]], extended the concept of the [[readymade]] into poetry, discovering poetic suggestiveness in such everyday items as a newspaper advert about a lost tortoise and a typewriter test sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Mourits, ''The Conceptual Poetic of K. Schippers: the aesthetic implications of literary readymades'', Dutch Crossing 21.1, pp.119‚Äì34&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of Dutch poets infiltrated the Belgian experimentalist magazine ''Gard Sivik'' and began to fill it with seemingly inconsequential fragments of conversation and demonstrations of verbal procedures. The writers included C.B. Vaandrager (1935‚Äì92), [[Hans Verhagen]] and the artist [[Armando (artist)|Armando]]. On this approach the critic Hugo Brems has commented that "the poet's role in this kind of poetry was not to discourse on reality, but to highlight particular fragments of it which are normally perceived as non-poetic. These poets were not creators of art, but discoverers."&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Brems, ''Contemporary Poetry of the Low Countries'', Flemish Netherlands Foundation, 1995, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The impersonality that such artists aspired to was best expressed by Jan Schoonhoven (1914‚Äì94), the theorist of the [[Zero (art)|Dutch Nul group]] of artists, to which Armando also belonged: "Zero is first and foremost a new conception of reality, in which the individual role of the artist is kept to a minimum. The Zero artist merely selects, isolates parts of reality (materials as well as ideas stemming from reality) and exhibits them in the most neutral way. The avoidance of personal feelings is essential to Zero."&lt;ref&gt;Translation in ''Dutch Interior: Postwar Poetry of the Netherlands and Flanders'', Columbia University 1984, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cPOqoSriyY0C&amp;lpg=PR36&amp;ots=BobxbkKkkC&amp;dq=%22Zero%20is%20first%20and%20foremost%20a%20new%20conception%22&amp;pg=PR35#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Zero%20is%20first%20and%20foremost%20a%20new%20conception%22&amp;f=false pp.36‚Äì7]&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn links it with some aspects of Pop Art and Nouveau R√©aliste practice and underlines the rejection of Expressionism.

The beginnings of [[Concrete Poetry]] and text montage in the [[Wiener Gruppe]] have also been referred back to the example of [[Raoul Hausmann]]'s letter poems.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Katharina Schaffner, "How the Letters Learned to Dance: on language dissection in Dadaist, Digital and Concrete Poetry", in  Avant-garde/Neo-avant-garde, Amsterdam 2005, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7CttwTdwx04C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.149‚Äì165]&lt;/ref&gt; Such techniques may also owe something to [[H.N. Werkman]]'s typographical experiments in the Netherlands which had first been put on display in the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in 1945.

The '''Numismatic Museum''' in [[Athens]] ({{lang-el|ŒùŒøŒºŒπœÉŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œå ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒµŒØŒø}}) is one of the most important museums of [[Greece]] and houses one of the greatest collections of coins, ancient and modern, in the world. The museum itself is housed in the mansion of the archaeologist [[Heinrich Schliemann]], formally known as ''Iliou Melathron'' ({{lang-el|ŒôŒªŒØŒøœÖ ŒúŒ≠ŒªŒ±Œ∏œÅŒøŒΩ}}, "Palace of [[Troy|Ilion]]").

==History==
[[File:Numismatic Museum of Athens 3.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Fa√ßade close-up.]]

The first tries of coin collecting by the state began shortly after the independence of Greece in [[Aegina]]. The collection was enriched after excavations, purchases and donations. The museum was founded in 1838, around the same era with the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] but it was not until many years after and several decrees that became an independent organization. Initially, the collection was a part of the [[National Library of Greece]] and was housed at the main building of the [[University of Athens]] and later at the building of the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] where the collection was first exhibited. In 1946, the collection was moved at the National Archaeological Museum. The organization of the museum became twice independent, in 1893 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;''Papyros Larousse Britannica'', Athens, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iliou Melathron was granted in order to house the collection in 1984 and after a major renovation it finally opened in 1998.&lt;ref name="nam"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ILIOU MELATHRON|url=http://www.nma.gr/ilioumelathron3_en.htm|publisher=Numismatic Museum, Athens|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FmWHIVfJ?url=http://www.nma.gr/ilioumelathron3_en.htm|archivedate=10 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Iliou Melathron==
[[File:Schliemann mansion 1900.png|thumb|240px|The building in 1910]]

The Numismatic Museum is housed at the ''Iliou Melathron'', a three-storey building on [[Panepistimiou Street]]. It was built between 1878-1880 for Heinrich Schliemann and the architect was the then famous [[Ernst Ziller]]. At the time of its completion, it was considered to be the most magnificent private residence of Athens. Its design was inspired by the [[Renaissance Revival]] movement as well as [[Neoclassicism]], while the interior is influenced by the architecture of Pompeii. As a result, the rooms are decorated with mosaics and murals depicting either themes from the Trojan War or Greek mottos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ŒôŒªŒØŒøœÖ ŒúŒ≠ŒªŒ±Œ∏œÅŒøŒΩ|url=http://www.eie.gr/archaeologia/gr/arxeio_more.aspx?id=183|publisher=ŒëŒ°ŒßŒïŒôŒü ŒùŒïŒüŒ§ŒïŒ°Œ©Œù ŒúŒùŒóŒúŒïŒôŒ©Œù|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, the widow of Heinrich Schliemann, Sophia, sold the building to the Greek State and it was subsequently used as the seat of the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] and later the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref name="nam" /&gt;

[[File:Numismatics Museum in Athens.jpg|thumb|240px|View of the interior of the museum.]]

The use of the building as a courthouse caused much damage. After the building was chosen to house the Numismatic Museum, it underwent a major renovation under which the floor mosaics and the murals were restored. Finally, the numismatic collection was inaugurated in the partly restored building in 1998 while the whole collection became viewable in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒπŒ∫œå|url=http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/gh152.jsp?obj_id=16501|publisher=odysseus.culture.gr|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

The collection of the museum contains 600,000 objects, mainly coins but also medals, standard masses, dies, stamps and others, from the 14th century BC until modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Touratsoglou|first=I|title=Numismatic Museum of Athens, Archaeology and Arts, March 1999|url=http://www.archaiologia.gr/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/70-18.pdf|publisher=arxaiologia.gr|accessdate=17 April 2016|language=Greek|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is arranged in such a way so as to follow the history of coinage. The museum holds a very important collection of coins from the 6th century BC until the 5th century CE like those from the Greek [[Polis|Poleis]] and the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and Roman periods. There also major [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and Medieval collections from Western Europe, the East and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

A large portion of the collection is constituted by coins that were found in [[hoard]]s while the rest comes from the initial collection of Aegina, recent excavations in mainland Greece and donations.

The museum houses a library of 12,000 books specialized in the study of coinage. There is also a perfectly equipped conservation laboratory.

==Location and visitors information==

The Numismatic Museum is on 12 [[Panepistimiou Street]] near [[Syntagma Square]]. It is served by the [[Syntagma station|Syntagma metro station]]. There is a museum shop and a coffeehouse in the garden.

{{disability}}
'''People-first language''' ('''PFL'''),&lt;ref name="CDC-NCBDDD_on_PFL"&gt;{{Citation |author=National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities |year=2017 |title=Communicating With and About People with Disabilities |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pdf/disabilityposter_photos.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221060943/https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pdf/disabilityposter_photos.pdf |archive-date=2017-12-21 |access-date=2017-12-21 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''person-first language''' ('''PFL'''), is a type of [[linguistic prescription]] to avoid [[social exclusion|marginalization]] or [[dehumanization]] (either [[consciousness|conscious]] or [[subconscious]]) when discussing people with a [[health]] issue or [[disability]]. It can be a type of [[disability etiquette]] but more often is applied to any group that would otherwise be defined or mentally categorized by a condition or trait (for example, [[disease]], age, disability, or appearance) rather than as a group of people who ''have'' that condition or trait. Rather than using a [[labeling theory|label]] or an [[adjective]] to define someone, person-first language puts the person before the [[diagnosis]] and describes what the person ''has'' (for example, "a person with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]" or "a person with [[alcoholism]]"), not an assertion of what the person ''is'' (for example, "a diabetic" or "an alcoholic"). Thus a person is foremost a person and secondly a person with some trait. Advocates of person-first language point out that failing to mentally separate the person from the trait tends to reinforce a sense (even if only subconsciously) that both the trait and the person are inherently bad or inferior and thus tends to marginalize or even dehumanize the person. It also tends to implicitly reinforce a sense of permanency even regarding issues that are temporary; for example, a person with a [[substance use disorder]] has a fair chance of achieving long-term [[cure#remission|remission]]‚Äîmany years in which he is healthy and productive‚Äîbut calling him a "substance abuser" reinforces an unspoken sense that he is inherently and permanently tainted and casts too much doubt on maintenance of remission.

==Definition==
People-first language is a type of [[linguistic prescription]] in [[English language|English]]. It aims to avoid perceived and subconscious [[dehumanization]] when discussing people with [[disabilities]] and is sometimes referred to{{By whom|date=April 2018}} as a type of [[disability etiquette]]. People-first language can also be applied to any group that is defined by a condition rather than as a people: for example, "those that are homeless" rather than "the homeless".

Rather than using labels to define individuals with a health issue, it is more appropriate to use terminology, which describes individuals as being diagnosed with an illness or disorder. People first language puts the person before the diagnosis and describes what the person has not what the person is.&lt;ref name="Lynn, 2017"&gt;Lynn, V. A. (2017). Language and HIV communication. HIV/AIDS (Auckland, NZ), 9, 183." &lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea is to use a sentence structure that names the person first and the condition second, for example, "people with disabilities" rather than "disabled people" or "disabled," in order to emphasize that "they are people first." Because it is a common practice in English to place an adjective before a noun, the adjective might be replaced with a relative clause, e.g., from "an asthmatic person" to "a person who has asthma". Furthermore, the use of [[E-Prime|''to be'' is deprecated]] {{By whom|date=April 2018}}  in favor of using ''to have''.

By using such a sentence structure, the speaker articulates the idea of a disability as a secondary attribute, not a characteristic of a person's identity.

==History==
The term ''[[:wikt:people-first language|people-first language]]'' first appeared in 1988 as recommended by [[advocacy group]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[BusinessWeek]] (letter to the editor), Issues 3059‚Äì3062, 1988 [https://books.google.com/books?id=tGA1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22people-first+language%22&amp;dq=%22people-first+language%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SaLOTKWwAYeBOoS1jOcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA];''Supportive housing needs of elderly and disabled persons: hearing before the Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, One Hundred First Congress, first session on S. 566 ... the National Affordable Housing Act, June 2, 1989, Volumes 22‚Äì23'': "All references to 'handicapped individuals' in the Act must be changed to 'people with disabilities{{'"}} ‚Äì We join with many of our fellow advocacy organizations in emphasizing the importance of using 'people first' language throughout the Act."&lt;/ref&gt; The usage has been widely adopted by [[speech-language pathologist]]s and researchers, with "person who stutters" (PWS) replacing "stutterer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Folkins |first=John |url=http://www.asha.org/publications/journals/submissions/person_first.htm |title=Resource on Person-First Language |publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association |date=December 1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511071056/http://www.asha.org/publications/journals/submissions/person_first.htm |archivedate=May 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although it is believed that People-first language originated in the mental health community, its origin dates back to the Denver Principles (1983), which states, "We condemn attempts to label us as "victims," a term which implies defeat, and we are only occasionally "patients," a term which implies passivity, helplessness, and dependence upon the care of others. We are "People With AIDS."

Use has been recommended in other increasingly common chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes. Non-profit organizations, such as the Obesity Action Coalition have expanded advocacy for People-First Language to [[obesity]]. As of 2017, 5 U.S. medical societies had pledged for it, and use it in their communications: the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, The Obesity Society, American Society of Bariatric Physicians, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obesityaction.org/weight-bias-and-stigma/people-first-language-for-obesity People-First Language for Obesity] Obesity Action Coalition, April 2013 retrieved 13 Dec 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common alternative to person-first language is usually called identity-first language, as it places the identifying condition before the personal term. For example, while someone who prefers person-first language might ask to be called a "person with autism", someone who prefers identity-first language would ask to be called an "autistic person". There is no common term for use of identifying conditions as nouns, but it is not usually preferred apart from select communities, such as [[Dwarfism|dwarfs]]. Others have proposed "person-centered language", which, instead of being a replacement linguistic rule, promotes prioritizing the preferences of those who are being referred to and argues for greater nuance in the language used to describe people and groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://radicalcopyeditor.com/2017/07/03/person-centered-language |last=Kapitan |first=Alex |year=2017 |title=On "Person-First Language": It's Time to Actually Put the Person First |publisher=Radical Copyeditor.com |accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
{{main|Linguistic prescriptivism|Language and thought}}
The [[Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis]] is the basis for ideologically motivated [[linguistic prescriptivism]]. The hypothesis states that language use significantly shapes perceptions of the world and forms ideological preconceptions.

In people-first language, preconceptions judged to be negative arise from placing the name of the condition before the term "person" or "people", such as "white person" or "Jewish people". Proponents of people-first language argue that this places an undue focus on the condition which distracts from the humanity of the members of the community of people with the condition.

In a 2008 publication about an experiment on teen's perception of people with disabilities, scientists gathered evidence to prove why people-first language, or word order, matters. the scientists divided teenagers from a summer camp into two groups; one group was asked questions using the term "people with epilepsy" and the other group was asked using the term "epileptics". They asked the teenagers questions such as "Do you think that people with epilepsy/epileptics have more difficulties at school?" and "Do you have prejudice toward people with epilepsy/epileptics?"  The studied showed that the teenagers had a higher "stigma perception" on the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy when it came to "epileptics", as opposed to "people with epilepsy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernandes|first=Paula T.|last2=De Barros|first2=Nelson F.|last3=Li|first3=Li M.|date=2009-05-01|title=Stop saying epileptic|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01899.x/abstract|journal=Epilepsia|language=en|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1280‚Äì1283|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01899.x|issn=1528-1167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage guidelines==
Some U.S. organizations like the United Spinal Association have published [[disability etiquette]] guides, which prescribe people-first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedspinal.org/pdf/DisabilityEtiquette.pdf |title=Disability Etiquette |publisher=United Spinal Association |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucp.org/media/tools-for-reporters |title=Tools for Reporters: Disability Etiquette |publisher=United Cerebral Palsy |accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ''[[For Dummies]]'' guide to [[etiquette]] prescribed people-first language.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Sue (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=HGno_t1crwwC&amp;pg=PA321 "Being Sensitive about Disabilities and Illnesses"]. ''Etiquette for Dummies''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|9781118051375}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the rules of people-first language have become normative in US governmental institutions on the federal (e.g. CDC) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pdf/disabilityposter_photos.pdf Communicating With and About People with Disabilities] CDC n.d., retrieved 13 Dec 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and on state levels in the heath departments' Developmental Disabilities Councils e.g. Michigan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/5_People_1st_Language_313302_7.pdf People First Language In Proposals for Michigan Developmental Disabilities Council Grants].

== Criticism ==
Critics have objected that people-first language is awkward, repetitive and makes for tiresome writing and reading. [[C. Edwin Vaughan]], a [[sociologist]] and longtime activist for the blind, argues that since "in common usage positive pronouns usually precede nouns", "the awkwardness of the preferred language focuses on the disability in a new and potentially negative way". According to Vaughan, it only serves to "focus on disability in an ungainly new way" and "calls attention to a person as having some type of 'marred identity{{'"}} in terms of [[Erving Goffman]]'s theory of identity.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, C. Edwin (1997). [http://www.blind.net/a-philosophy-of-blindness/individual-articles/people-first-language.html "People-First Language: An Unholy Crusade"]. National Federation of the Blind.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the [[National Federation of the Blind]] adopted a resolution condemning people-first language. The resolution dismissed the notion that "the word 'person' must invariably precede the word 'blind' to emphasize the fact that a blind person is first and foremost a person" as "totally unacceptable and pernicious" and resulting in the exact opposite of its purported aim, since "it is overly defensive, implies shame instead of true equality, and portrays the blind as touchy and belligerent".&lt;ref&gt;Jernigan, Kenneth (March 2009). [http://www.nfb.org/images/nfb/Publications/bm/bm09/bm0903/bm090308.htm "The Pitfalls of Political Correctness: Euphemisms Excoriated"]. ''Braille Monitor'' '''52''' (3). "Be it resolved by the National Federation of the Blind in Convention assembled in the city of Dallas, Texas, this 9th day of July, 1993, that the following statement of policy be adopted: We believe that it is respectable to be blind, and although we have no particular pride in the fact of our blindness, neither do we have any shame in it. To the extent that euphemisms are used to convey any other concept or image, we deplore such use. We can make our own way in the world on equal terms with others, and we intend to do it."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[deaf culture]], person-first language has long been rejected. Instead, deaf culture uses deaf-first language since being culturally deaf is a source of positive identity and pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lum |first=Doman |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aMqGhHCxXUYC&amp;pg=PA441 |title=Culturally Competent Practice: A Framework for Understanding |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=441 |isbn=9780840034434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correct terms to use for this group would be "Deaf person" or "hard of hearing person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallaudet.edu/clerc_center/information_and_resources/info_to_go/educate_children_(3_to_21)/resources_for_mainstream_programs/terminology.html |title=Terminology Describing Deaf Individuals |publisher=Gallaudet University |accessdate=June 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605054809/http://www.gallaudet.edu/Clerc_Center/Information_and_Resources/Info_to_Go/Educate_Children_(3_to_21)/Resources_for_Mainstream_Programs/Terminology.html |archivedate=June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "hearing impaired" is not acceptable to most Deaf or hard of hearing people because it emphasizes what they cannot do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq |title=Community and Culture ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Association of the Deaf |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11820">The '''Prisoner Human Rights Movement''' (PHRM) was launched in 2011 by [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] inmates in response to large numbers of inmates being moved from general prison populations to solitary-confinement units after allegations of gang affiliation or political organizing. Its goal is to improve living conditions for inmates in [[California]].

==Purpose==
The PHRM wanted to address inadequacies in the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] (CDCR), including:

# Systemic problems in 180- and 270-designed (level 4){{technical statement|date=November 2018}} prisons and institutions, including chains of command, staff assessment and CDCR culture
# Prisoners' Inmate Welfare Funds (IWF) and budget allocations
# Injustice, brutality and human-rights violations

To deal with these issues, the Pelican Bay organizers called for the right to document, expose and challenge abuses and violations; an end to violence and brutality by prison employees; an end to police brutality, inside and outside prison, and the right to safety from retaliation and coercion, threats and blackmail to betray fellow prisoners with false accusations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prisonerhumanrightsmovement.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/blue-print-full284pgs3.pdf|title=Prisoner Human Rights Movement Blueprint|last=Jamaa|first=Sitawa Nantambu|date=December 1, 2015|website=www.prisonerhumanrightsmovement.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Pelican Bay State Prison, California‚Äôs only [[supermax prison]], was built in 1989 on the outskirts of [[Crescent City, California|Crescent City]]. Half the prison houses maximum-security inmates in the general population (GP), and the other half holds prisoners in Security Housing Units (SHU). SHU cells are windowless, {{convert|8|by|10|ft|adj=on}} concrete boxes. Inmates are confined to the cells for twenty-two to twenty-three hours a day without access to telephones, television, programs, loved ones and basic human interaction. They receive three meals a day through a small slot at the bottom of their cell door.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Ashley T|date=2017-01-25|title=Keramet Reiter, 23/7: Pelican Bay Prison and the Rise of Long-Term Solitary ConfinementReiterKeramet, 23/7: Pelican Bay Prison and the Rise of Long-Term Solitary Confinement, Yale University Press: New Haven, 2016, 302 pp. (including index): ISBN: 9780300211467, $32.50 (hbk)|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1462474517690838|journal=Punishment &amp; Society|pages=146247451769083|doi=10.1177/1462474517690838|issn=1462-4745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates housed in the SHU are subjected to abuse from other inmates and guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haney|first=Craig|date=August 2008|title=A Culture of Harm|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0093854808318585|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|volume=35|issue=8|pages=956‚Äì984|doi=10.1177/0093854808318585|issn=0093-8548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmates are sent to the SHU at the discretion of correctional administrators. They are sent for a fixed term for breaking a prison rule, or for an indeterminate term for being labeled a prison-gang member. The largest segments of SHU populations are [[jailhouse lawyer]]s and political activists. Although inmates identified as gang members are not supposed to be isolated for more than six years, the prison-gang investigation unit often finds new evidence to extend an inmate‚Äôs isolation. The only way for these prisoners to leave the SHU is to debrief. An inmate debriefs by divulging information incriminating other inmates as gang associates. Although inmates (or their families) who debrief can become targets of violence by gangs, they often provide false information about others to escape the SHU. SHU assignments can also affect sentencing length and severity. Inmates do not earn credit for time served in the SHU, extending their sentence and making them eligible for release later than they would otherwise be. Inmates sentenced to life imprisonment are not eligible for parole while they are in the SHU. For many SHU inmates, the only options for escape are debriefing or death. This essentially removes sentencing from the judiciary and gives it to prison administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Keramet A|date=December 2012|title=Parole, snitch, or die: California‚Äôs supermax prisons and prisoners, 1997‚Äì2007|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1462474512464007|journal=Punishment &amp; Society|volume=14|issue=5|pages=530‚Äì563|doi=10.1177/1462474512464007|issn=1462-4745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, an inmate in the Pelican Bay SHU spent an average of over two years in isolation before being released into the general population or [[parole]]d; some have spent decades in solitary confinement. Every month, about 15 prisoners are paroled from the SHU with no services to assist with the transition from isolation to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/WeeklyWed|title=California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation population reports|last=|first=|date=2017|website=CDCR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|The Movement}}Movement==
In response to the treatment of prisoners housed in Pelican Bay's SHU, four inmates (Arturo Castellanos, Sitawa Nantambu Jamaa (Ronnie Dewberry), Todd Ashker and George Franco) began the PHRM. The moverment's principal negotiators (PNs), they have organized around the belief that the CDCR is fraught with systemic, deep-rooted problems. The movement's goal is immediate action by the governor of California to remedy the CDCR's flawed policies and enforcement and to encourage lawmakers to create effective and genuine improvements to the department.

In addition to the principal negotiators, the PHRM is composed of twenty representatives, local councils and the plaintiffs in [[#Legal remedies|''Ashker v. Brown'']]. The PNs, the movement's face and driving force, represent over 100,000 inmates in thirty-three California prisons. Representatives and local councils monitor and record conditions at their prisons, reporting to the PNs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On April 3, 2011, the Pelican Bay negotiators issued five core demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://prisonerhumanrightsmovement.wordpress.com/blue-print/five-core-demands-issued-432011/|title=Five Core Demands, issued 4/3/2011|date=2016-05-09|work=Prisoner Human Rights Movement|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Hunger Strikes}}Hunger strikes==
==={{anchor|2011 Hunger Strikes}}2011===
On July 1, 2011, a hunger strike began. Nearly every prisoner in the Pelican Bay SHU (over 1,000 inmates) was refusing food, and they were joined by general-population inmates. By the end of the first day, about 6,000 prisoners across California had reportedly participated in the hunger strike. Though levels of participation varied (from inmates partaking only in food purchased from canteens, to liquid sustenance, to refusal of any and all sustenance) the most involved organizers made it clear that they were willing to starve to death to have their demands met. In the first week, supporters on the outside were also engaging with the movement by fasting and participating in solidarity demonstrations across the state.  Within the next few weeks, prison and state officials scrambled to deal with the strike. Some prisons used deceptive tactics, like lying about meeting the demands of the strike, or spreading rumors that an inmate had died, attempting to break solidarity between prisoners. Other prisons further isolated prisoners participating in the hunger strike, cutting off communications between the prisoners and the outside world. As the strike wore on, state officials threatened to force feed inmates who were refusing food, though this action is illegal in most cases. Three weeks into the hunger strike, the CDCR agreed to enter negotiations with the Pelican Bay PNs and immediately conceded on a few points. The strike officially ended on July 20. However, most conditions within the prison remained largely unchanged.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The hunger strike resumed on September 26, with about 12,000 people in California and other states participating in the strike. It was called off on October 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ccrjustice.org/home/what-we-do/our-cases/ashker-v-brown|title=Ashker v. Governor of California|website=Center for Constitutional Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|2013 Hunger Strike}}2013===
The 59-day [[2013 California prisoner hunger strike]], organized by the Pelican Bay PNs (who became known as the Short Corridor Collective), mobilized 30,000 prisoners across the state. The strike ended when a judge issued a court order allowing the strikers to be force-fed by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/solitary-secure-housing-units-2014-2/index7.html|title=The Plot From Solitary|website=NYMag.com|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Legal Remedies}}Legal remedies==
''Ashker v. Governor of California'' (or ''Ashker v. Brown'') was a [[class action]] lawsuit filed on May 31, 2012 by the Pelican Bay Hunger Strike negotiators on behalf of inmates housed in SHU. The case was an amended version of an earlier ''[[Pro se legal representation in the United States|pro se]]'' lawsuit filed by Pelican Bay SHU inmates Todd Ashker and Danny Troxell. Judge [[Claudia Ann Wilken]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] presided over the case. It was settled in September 2015, ending indiscriminate solitary confinement in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ccrjustice.org/home/what-we-do/our-cases/ashker-v-brown|title=Ashker v. Governor of California|website=Center for Constitutional Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the settlement, nearly 1,500 prisoners were transferred from SHU to the general population. Many  inmates were sent to Level VI housing, however, which mimicked solitary confinement. In March 2018, a federal court refused to order the CDCR to release long-term SHU inmates into the general population. The defense counsel noted that the earlier settlement was inadequate for ending indeterminate isolated imprisonment in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ccrjustice.org/home/press-center/press-releases/ongoing-isolation-ca-prisons-not-governed-settlement-judge-rules|title=Ongoing Isolation in CA Prisons Not Governed by Settlement, Judge Rules|website=Center for Constitutional Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|International Law}}International law===
In August 2011, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] published a [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] report on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The report outlines the international consensus that solitary confinement in pretrial detention for more than fifteen days of juveniles or people with mental disabilities is "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and even torture". It describes best practices for states to limit solitary confinement. The report was crucial as a legal defense to the movement's claim that prolonged solitary confinement is a form of torture and a human-rights violation under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sveaass|first=Nora|date=September 2017|title=The United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/med/9780199374625.003.0009|journal=Oxford Medicine Online|doi=10.1093/med/9780199374625.003.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42148">'''[[Public]]''' '''[[rhetoric]]''' refers to discourse both within a group of people and between groups, often centering on the process by which [[individual]] or group discourse seeks membership in the larger public discourse. Public rhetoric can also involve rhetoric being used within the general populace to foster social change and encourage [[agency (sociology)|agency]] on behalf of the participants of public rhetoric. The collective discourse between rhetoricians and the general populace is one representation of public rhetoric. A new discussion within the field of public rhetoric is digital space because the growing digital realm complicates the idea of private and public, as well as previously concrete definitions of discourse. Furthermore, scholars of public rhetoric often employ the language of [[tourism]] to examine how identity is negotiated between individuals and groups and how this negotiation impacts individuals and groups on a variety of levels, ranging from the local to the global.

== Public rhetoric participants ==
A '''public''', not to be confused with ''the'' public, is composed of members that address each other, are addressed as a group, and also subscribe to specific ideals. [[Michael Warner]] describes a public as ‚Äúbeing self-organized, ‚Ä¶a relationship among strangers ‚Ä¶[where] merely paying attention can be enough to make [one] a member.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = |pages = 49‚Äì90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|56}} Robert Asen notes that identity formation of members of a public ‚Äúentails mutual recognition among members of diverse cultures." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Imagining the public sphere|last = Asen|first = Robert|date = 2002|journal = Philosophy and Rhetoric|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 35|issue = 4|page = |pages = 345‚Äì367}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|346}} To Warner, publics are a social space where information is exchanged and is required for the exchange of information.

=== Counterpublics ===
Within the public sphere, dominant publics exist whose discourse can subordinate other publics or exclude them from a related discourse. Counterpublics are the result of discourse and/or people feeling marginalized, ignored, inadequately voiced, or silenced within the public sphere. ‚ÄúCounterpublic refers to those publics that form through mutual recognition of exclusions in wider publics, set themselves against exclusionary wider publics, and resolve to overcome these exclusions,‚Äù writes Asen''.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|358}} Where dominant public groups typically manufacture heteronormative public spaces and discourse, counterpublics seek to insert or reinsert voices and perspectives of and from publics. Discourse then abnormalizes or even challenges dominant public rhetoric. Warner describes the facilities of counterpublic using the [[LGBT|LGBTQ+]] community:&lt;blockquote&gt;Within a gay or queer counterpublic, for example, no one is in the closet: the presumptive heterosexuality that constitutes the closet for individuals in ordinary speech is suspended. But this circulatory space, freed from heteronormative speech protocols, is itself marked by that very suspension: speech that addresses any participant as queer will circulate up to a point, at which it is certain to meet intense resistance. It might therefore circulate in special, protected venues, in limited publications. The individual struggle with stigma is transposed, as it were, to the conflict between modes of publicness. The expansive nature of public address will seek to keep moving that frontier for a queer public, to seek more and more places to circulate where people will recognize themselves in its address; but no one is likely to be unaware of the risk and conflict involved.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{rp|86‚Äì87}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Asen furthers, ‚ÄúIndividuals do not necessarily recognize exclusions and resolve to overcome them by virtue of their location in a social order.‚Äù&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|359}} Asen maintains that claiming a counterpublic of this form can diminish counterpublic forms to particular contributors who share specific interests with other members but might not consider each other as allies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|359}}

=== Subaltern and bourgeois groups ===
Amid publics and counterpublics, prevailing ideology, discourse, and images can create a hierarchy of group members and the rhetoric thereof. The struggle for political and social power within the public sphere between publics gives rise to dominant and weaker internal publics within a public, namely [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] and [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] publics, respectively. For example, in their article ‚ÄúGraffiti Hurts in the United States,‚Äù Terri Moreau and Derek H. Alderman describe an anti-graffiti task force, Graffiti Hurts, advocating for the eradication of urban graffiti in public spaces. This organization funded mural projects that would serve as a deterrent for would-be graffitists. While graffiti is often considered a lesser art form compared to the classical arts such as music, canvas painting, and sculpture, the mural projects ‚Äúactually work to carry out a ‚Äònormative‚Äô prescription of landscape. The normalization has the ability to eradicate the potential for alternative constructions of public expression. As [Kurt] Iveson observes, ‚ÄòA legal mural might have some effect in making . . . people‚Äôs culture more visible in public space, but often this is on someone else‚Äôs‚Äô terms.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Publics and the City|last = Iveson|first = Kurt|publisher = Blackwell|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Graffiti hurts and the eradication of alternative landscape expression|last = Moreau|first = Terri|date = 2011|journal = Geographical Review|doi = 10.1111/j.1931-0846.2011.00075.x|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Alderman|first2 = Derek H.|issue = 1|volume = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|109}}  Keith Herring argues that the dominant images of a [[gay]] counterpublic produce ‚Äúclones‚Äù representing ‚Äúwell-built,‚Äù effeminate, white males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Keith Haring and Queer Xerography|last = Herring|first = Scott|date = 2007|journal = Public Culture|doi = 10.1215/08992363-2006-03|pmid = |access-date = |pages = 329‚Äì348}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|333}} While [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|whiteness]] is idealized, racial minority imagery and representation was and remains marginalized.

A bourgeois subgroup within a public is primarily composed of ‚Äúprivate individuals‚Ä¶[that] do not ‚Äòrule‚Äô.... Instead, their ideas infiltrated the very principle on which the existing power is based.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article|last = Habermas|first = J√ºrgen|date = 1974|journal = New German Critique|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = |pages = 49‚Äì55|editor-last = Lennox|editor-first = Sarah|editor2-last = Lennox|editor2-first = Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|51}} The bourgeois within a public represent a prevailing definition of the relevant publics and thereby control a greater degree of shared space for the related discourse between the larger public membership.

=== Strangers ===
'''Strangers''' are those who are not aware of their membership within a particular public. They are capable of being members of a public; however, they can also hold no opinion or in other ways pay no attention to their potential membership to a public. Strangers are normally not those who ignore their membership (which implies one is aware of being a member of a public). To Warner, without the presence of strangers in a public sphere, public discourse cannot occur because it is a requirement for public discourse to address strangers and provide them the awareness to identify themselves as an addressed public.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{Rp|57}}

=== Orientation ===
Public rhetoric participants produce discourse relative to a larger conglomerate of people or publics. Within the public sphere, different publics engage their own or other publics in conversation creating discourse that affects their own and other groups through definition of public boundaries, redefining public structure, and dispersing related public ideology. For a person to produce public rhetoric, one would self-identify with a public.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{Rp|3}} Media, culture, and geography are the more predominant orienting processes that channel people towards and away from specific publics. Through public rhetoric, publics can recruit strangers and embed or polarize members of the same or other publics. Political propaganda and product advertisement are two concrete examples of forces that orient strangers and publics through analog and digital media. When people engage in public discourse, ‚Äúdescrib[ing] themselves and others, they do not engage in a value-neutral and transparent process. Rather, representational processes implicate participants in (often unacknowledged) choices regarding how people should be portrayed‚Äù.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|10‚Äì11}} As one begins to form judgments regarding the image of a public, of a particular ideology, or of the protocols governing inclusion and exclusion in public discourse, that person then gains membership within a relevant public, thus becoming, in part, a representation of the whole image of said public.

How one is introduced to a public varies as existing knowledge and experience can augment how one perceives a public and public rhetoric. Tony Hiss points out how places can orient and disorient civilians. In his discussion, Hiss describes public parks as having the function of ‚Äúchanging the way we look at things, diffusing our attention and also relaxing its intensity‚Ä¶‚Äù.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The experience of place: A new way of looking at and dealing with our radically changing cities and countryside|last = Hiss|first = Tony|publisher = Random House, Inc|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|34}} The geography of the park often contrasts the image of the city in which it exists. Effective entrance design for parks encourage visitors to enter, displacing prior experience in exchange for ‚Äúpark experience‚Äù, in a transition that navigates the visitors smoothly to and from the park experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|42‚Äì44}} Similarly, when strangers are introduced to public discourse, orientation processes enable strangers to adopt and displace specific images of a public and evoke their membership to the new public.

== Rhetoric for public use ==
According to David J. Coogan and John M. Ackerman, ‚Äúrhetoric is in the midst of discovering anew its usefulness.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Coogan &amp; Ackerman 2013, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[service-learning|service learning]] and [[civic engagement]] increase at colleges and universities, rhetoric begins the process of regrouping and becoming relevant in the community outside of the academy. In both the field of English and of communication, rhetoric‚Äôs reputation needs to be repaired and adapted to meet the needs of the general populace. In general, the public view of rhetoric is a negative one. It is the talk of politicians‚Äîfilled with lies and manipulation. Instead, the public work of rhetoric should try to lead to social change. Scholars such as Ellen Cushman and Cynthia Sheard demonstrate this belief in their work; these and other scholars believe that rhetoricians should use their tools for the good of the public. In order to make this shift in rhetoric‚Äôs reputation, rhetoric needs a new set of guidelines by which to prepare rhetoricians to participate in social action.

=== Rhetoric in praxis as social action ===
Because rhetoric and composition are so closely related, the composition classroom becomes an open space for fostering social activism through service learning and allowing students to develop a sense of agency for both their scholarship and their interactions with the public. Ellen Cushman tells readers in her article ‚ÄúThe Rhetorician as an Agent of Social Change‚Äù that ‚Äúone way to increase our participation in public discourse is to bridge the university and community through activism. Given the role rhetoricians have historically played in the politics of their communities, [Cushman believes] modern rhetoric and composition scholars can be agents of social change outside the university.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Cushman 1996, p. 7"&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Through their respective institutions, Cushman argues that both young and old scholars of rhetoric and composition can use their educational expertise to connect with the public outside of the university that, as scholars, they are typically estranged from. Because universities are often situated as counterpublics within the overall public of the geographic area in which they are located, it appears that scholars often feel prohibited from approaching and participating in the outside community.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to negate this feeling of being restricted from community engagement, Cushman urges members of the rhetoric and composition community at universities to participate in service learning.

=== Reciprocity from practicing rhetoric in public spaces ===
In an attempt to bridge the gap between the university and the community, Cushman suggests ways to ‚Äúempower people in our communities, establish networks of reciprocity with them, and create solidarity with them.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Cushman 1996, p. 7"/&gt; In order to invent this network of reciprocity, Cushman urges rhetoricians and students within the university to venture outside of the boundaries of the institution, foster relationships with members of the community, and to perform work that benefits the community. Hopefully the scholar perceives a [[kairos|kairotic moment]] in which they come to an understanding of the relationship between the community and public rhetoric and are then, in turn, able to write and publish on their work. In essence, ‚Äú[Cushman is] asking for a deeper consideration of the civic purpose of our positions in the academy, of what we do with our knowledge, for whom, and by what means.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the reciprocity that inherently comes from performing social activism within the general community, engaging with those outside of academe allows scholars to improve the public‚Äôs general conception of rhetoric, thereby increasing the field's [[ethos]] in the eyes of the general public.

=== Reforming the public‚Äôs view of rhetoric ===
While the general populace currently views ‚Äúdoing rhetoric‚Äù as ‚Äúmenacing our fellow citizens with lies and misdirection,‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Coogan &amp; Ackerman 2013, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; these devices have the ability to allow rhetoricians and social activists alike to bring about social change and repair rhetoric‚Äôs reputation in the eyes of the general populace. For example, in Cynthia Sheard‚Äôs article, ‚ÄúThe Public Value of Epideictic Rhetoric,‚Äù she discusses how [[Epideictic|epideictic rhetoric]], which has traditionally elicited a negative public opinion, can be used to foster social change. Sheard calls rhetoricians to embrace a process of ‚Äú[r]econceptualizing epideictic in order to emphasize . . . [i]ts close connection to the public sphere and its visionary quality . . . ‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 770.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheard continues to explain that ‚Äúepideictic discourse alters the reality in which it participates by making its vision a reality for its audience and instilling a belief that the power for realizing the vision lies with them.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 781.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sheard, this ability to alter the audience‚Äôs perception of reality, an ability that epideictic rhetoric was once criticized for, is exactly what gives this device the power to involve the general populace in social activism and persuade them to view rhetoric in a positive light instead of describing it as a manipulative device.

== Spaces ==
Spaces are the sites in which public rhetoric happens. These sites are not necessarily physical, geographically bound places, but metaphysical spaces in which discourse is shared and mediated by the members of specific publics.

=== Places vs. Spaces ===
To understand the spaces in which public rhetoric is enacted, it is important to understand the differences between ‚Äúspace‚Äù and ‚Äúplace.‚Äù In his book [[The Practice of Everyday Life]], [[Michel de Certeau]], defines places as an ‚Äúinstantaneous configuration of positions.‚Äù &lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"&gt;Certeau 1988, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; To Certeau, places are geographically bound, locatable sites. These sites are defined by location and spatial relations to other places.

Certeau claims that places are different from spaces because places are ‚Äúultimately reducible to being there‚Äù while spaces are specified ‚Äúby the actions of historical subjects.‚Äù &lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"/&gt; While places could be pointed to on a map and are defined by what is physically inside of them, spaces are sites where things have happened. A space is defined by the interactions that individual agents have with it, not by its physical features. Certeau gives the examples that the place of a street becomes a space only when people walk on it and the places of texts only become spaces when people read them.&lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"/&gt; When people engage in a discourse with a place, when they participate in public rhetoric there, it becomes a space.

=== Utopias and heterotopias ===
[[Michel Foucault]] built on Certeau‚Äôs definition of space in his essay, ‚ÄúOf Other Spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias,‚Äù pointing out that spaces were defined by ‚Äúa set of relations that delineates sites which are irreducible to one another and absolutely not superimposable on one another.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"&gt;Foucault 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that these individual, specific spaces could be placed in two main types: utopias and heterotopias.

==== Utopias ====
According to Foucault, [[utopias]] are spaces with no real place which present society in its perfected form.&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"/&gt; Since these spaces are not places that exist in reality, but rather as a result of the rhetoric that surrounds them, they are described as fundamentally unreal places.

==== Heterotopias ====
[[Heterotopia (space)|Heterotopias]] are real spaces that exist in every culture. Unlike Utopias, they are places that exist in physical space and can be indicated by their location. Foucault describes these heterotopias as ‚Äúeffectively enacted utopias in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"/&gt;  These heterotopic spaces transcend a single place as their value comes from the interactions that take place inside of them, but the fact that they are universally constructed and recognized allows for them to be pointed to geographically.

==== Middle spaces ====
Middle-spaces, according to David Coogan, are spaces in which rhetors from different publics can come and have an engaging discourse. As Coogan discusses, these are both physical and ideological places in which agents from two given publics c[an] come together to engage in discourse about ‚Äúthe ‚Äòcodes‚Äô to evaluate conduct, entertain political possibilities, and in other ways arrange their affairs.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Coogan 2010, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; These spaces are especially conducive as places for counterpublics and publics to meet to question the commonplaces or ideological statements. In enacting discourse in middle spaces, counterpublic discourse can be heard and have influence on public discourse.

== Tourism as public rhetoric ==

In discussions of public rhetoric, tourism refers both to the act of traveling to a physical location in search of a transformative experience and to the metaphorical action of traveling into the experiential world of another. Public rhetoric scholars use the language of tourism to examine individuals and communities‚Äô relationships to each other.

=== Identity politics ===

Scholars of public rhetoric frequently invoke the language of tourism to discuss individual and group identity. This is often done to disrupt notions of individuality. [[J√ºrgen Habermas]], for instance, chronicles the emergence of the concept of the individual in Western society, only to demonstrate the individual‚Äôs sublimation before the regulating function of the public sphere: ‚ÄúWith the interweaving of the public and private realm, not only do the political authorities assume certain functions in the sphere of commodity exchange and social labor, but conversely social powers now assume political functions. This leads to a kind of ‚Äòrefeudalization‚Äô of the public sphere.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas‚Äô concern for the political and social ramifications of individual versus public identity is one shared by other public rhetoric scholars.

=== Toxic tourism ===

Whereas the Western conception of the Subject tends to emphasize individual autonomy, scholars of public rhetoric challenge the notion that individual identity exists separately from the surrounding world. This challenge to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notions of identity is exemplified by the work of [[Phaedra Pezzullo]]. In ''Toxic Tourism'', Pezzullo argues that tourism as practice has the potential to help bridge the divide between Subject and Object by facilitating interaction on a multi-sensory level. Pezzullo suggests that embracing tourism‚Äôs ability to engage all of the body‚Äôs senses ‚Äúmay help those of us who study tourism to become more reflexive about our own culpability in privileging and, thus, perpetuating oppressive and colonial sensibilities.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The language of interconnection and responsibility pervades public rhetoric‚Äôs concern with tourism as a process that mediates relationships between human beings.

Researchers such as Pezzullo have discussed the large extent that notions of toxicity are reflected in the ways that certain groups are marginalized. For instance, Pezzullo writes ‚Äúthat the ‚Äòtoxic baggage‚Äô the nation carries exceeds the material impact of toxins and public discourses about them. It includes our cultural perceptions of our bodies and the bodies of ‚Äòpolluted‚Äô and ‚Äòpolluting‚Äô Others.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the language of toxicity is not limited to describing polluted areas or even victims of pollution. Toxicity is used to identify and rhetorically isolate segments of the population that do not conform to the Public‚Äôs normative expectations. Yet, as Pezzullo also suggests, the practice of tourism allows for travel between the Public and those citizens and groups who stand outside it. Pezzullo suggests that toxic tours, for instance, stand to allow the marginalized and often ignored Other to ‚Äúlook back‚Äù at the tourist who is experiencing the toxic area.&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of becoming the Object of the Other‚Äôs gaze raises the possibility that the tourist‚Äôs perspective on the Other may be altered in the exchange, thus raising the possibility that the practice of tourism can induce transformation in the tourist.

=== Tourism and publics ===

Taken in a broad sense, the practice of tourism enables interactions that allow for the formation and maintenance of publics. Tourism as a concept does not merely connote the movement of bodies from one physical place to another; it also refers to the internalization and externalization of ideas. As Michael Warner indicates, the ability to exchange ideas is what enables the participatory creation of the public sphere and is, therefore, a source of great power: ‚ÄúSpeaking, writing, and thinking involve us-actively and immediately-in a public, and thus in the being of the sovereign. Imagine how powerless people would feel if their commonality and participation were simply defined by pre-given frameworks, by institutions and law, as in other social contexts it is defined through kinship. . . . Such is the image of totalitarianism.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Warner 2002, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; Examined as an exchange of ideas, the practice of tourism allows individuals to engage in discourse with other individuals, thereby creating publics.

Key to Warner and other scholars‚Äô understanding of publics is the notion of voluntary participation. The citizen-tourist must willingly encounter the perspectives of other citizens. In this sense, public-creating tourist practices are not limited to ‚Äúthe pundits and wonks and reaction-shot secondary celebrities who try to perform our publicness for us . . . [, but include]  people whose place in public media is one of consuming, witnessing, griping, or gossiping rather than one of full participation, or fame.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Warner 2002, p. 415"&gt;Warner 2002, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner goes on to state that, ‚Äúa public can only produce a sense of belonging and activity if it is self-organized through discourse rather than through an external framework.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Warner 2002, p. 415"/&gt; Just as the tourist who travels to a different geographic area chooses to do so, a choice that invites the possibility of being transformed by the experience, the citizen-tourist must choose to engage in discourse with other citizens in order for that exchange to create and maintain a public.

==Birthplaces of public rhetoric: The street &amp; the riot==
In its most organic form, the discourse of the public sphere arises spontaneously. In his seminal work [http://unige.ch/sciences-societe/socio/files/2914/0533/6073/Habermas_1974.pdf ‚ÄúThe Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article‚Äù] Habermas discusses the bourgeois public as an instrumental development in the history of publics but recognizes the limitations of the bourgeois public for modernity: ‚ÄúAlthough the liberal model of the public sphere is still instructive today with respect to the normative claim that information be accessible to the public, it cannot be applied to the actual conditions of an industrially advanced mass democracy‚Ä¶‚Äù.&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54"&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the modern state limits the ability of the democratic populace to truly engage in a conversation of public rhetoric. Thus, instead of self-regulating, many of the public‚Äôs demands need to be met by the state, which could not please everyone on such a large scale. When these needs are not met, the scale of the democracy requires a dramatic catalyst to bridge the distance between the citizens and bring to light the need for change.&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The most basic (albeit violent) form of public would be that of the riot, which is engendered by ‚Äúcompetitions of interest, competitions which assume the form of violent conflicts.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54"&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this public is less civilized and perfect than is desirable, the spontaneity and power of riots and civil unrest‚Äîwhich Habermas refers to as ‚Äúthe street‚Äù‚Äîoften affect change, as has been demonstrated throughout modern history time and time again. Without any sort of organized formation, the riot embodies the public sphere; the citizenry reacts to an issue with an outburst of the same opinion (one they may not realize they shared) and has thus created a publicly driven rhetorical discourse surrounding the issue.

The riot is organic; often considered barbaric or savage because of the raw emotions involved. Cynthia Sheard claims that it is a result of ‚Äúthe ways in which words fail us‚Ä¶ all-too-common images of violence must make us wonder, indeed, whether words can make any difference in our lives.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the riot may have devastating consequences, it is purposeful in its ability to create recognition of a problem across a nation, bridging the gaps of class and distance the issue may otherwise find insurmountable. For example, the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement is now global due to the riots following the kairotic police [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in Ferguson, MO. Many of those who have never before been affected by police violence towards black males have now seen the movement ‚Äúin their own backyards,‚Äù and protests have arisen across the country, while both the mainstream and social media coverage of Ferguson has enabled this issue to be prescient in the minds of many far-removed citizens.

== Digital public ==
A digital public can be considered as a few different entities. According to Patricia G. Lange, a digital space is a [[social network]], or a group of people related to each other in some way.&lt;ref&gt;Lange 2008, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital social networks in which knowledge is communicated and shared have been labeled ‚Äúepistemopolis.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155"&gt;Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; An epistemopolis facilitates the growth of communities in a specific space around a specific topic.&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155"/&gt; These digital social spaces are complicated by the possibility of anyone in the world being related to anyone else in the world in any given way at any given time; measurements or regulations or requirements for defining a specific digital space would need to be applied on an individual basis. While this isn‚Äôt necessarily up for debate in fields that study digital realms, it does present challenges for public rhetoric because it  provides a more complex, tangled conception of a public.

A digital space can take any of a variety of forms: chat rooms, social media networks, blogs, private journals, news sites, question and answer forums, professional marketing pages, online shopping sites, etc. Additionally, digital space allows for cultural interaction in a way that is not possible in [[analog signal|analog device]] spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Poster 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the internet is a social construction, designed for social interaction among various contexts (including economic, discursive, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Silver 2005, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, digital spaces can be manipulated, adapted, or even created for different, specific functions. Consider [[Wikipedia]]: ‚Äúthe free encyclopedia anyone can edit.‚Äù This site encourages individuals to share more information, making verified knowledge public and collaborative. Another example is Douglas Eyman's text [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=dh;c=dh;idno=13030181.0001.001;rgn=full%20text;view=toc;xc=1;g=dculture|Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice]. Eyman wrote a print and a digital version of this text and includes a statement encouraging readers to take, revise, reuse, and [[Digital rhetoric#Circulation|circulate]] his original text, which is why he made the book available for free online.

=== Public Rhetoric in the Digital Realm ===
The digital sphere presents a new set of challenges for public rhetoric. With issues of authorship, [[autonomy]], and anonymity, the field crosses back and forth constantly between private and public. Individuals can create a digital persona, an [[digital rhetoric#Avatars|avatar]], while keeping their actual identity a secret. It is relatively easy to steal content and present it as your own (leading to copyright and plagiarism issues). To a certain extent, ‚Äútechnology has fused with human consciousness itself,‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Ong 1980, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a collective, shared, public memory.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people may oppose or feel threatened by advancements in technology, especially the internet. Some question personal and financial safety, a fear that may be heard as part of the argument opposing use of digital spaces. Opportunities for extended communication, in a plethora of different ways, litter the argument for development of digital spaces and tools. For example, digital [[social activism]] (also referred to as [[internet activism]] or cyberactivism) is a growing movement that uses digital spaces to spread awareness and encourage action regarding various topics.&lt;ref&gt;McCaughey &amp; Ayers 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Analog spaces tend to allow for a smaller audience than digital spaces, and therefore (typically) results in less action.

[[Digital rhetoric]] is important to consider when thinking about digital publics. Individuals create online identities, influencing how a digital audience can be addressed. This in turn influences how the author uses [[Digital rhetoric#Canons|the rhetorical canons]] in their composition.

== The photographic image as an icon ==
Photographic images can function in public rhetoric as [[Cultural icon|icons]] of U.S. public culture. According to [[Robert Hariman]] and [[John Lucaites|John Louis Lucaites]] in ''No Caption Needed: Iconic Photographs, Public Culture, and Liberal Democracy'', iconic images ‚Äúwork in several registers of ritual and response.‚Äù&lt;ref name="Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1"&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Public interpretations and influences of iconic photographic images manifest themselves as visual representations, or delivery of rhetoric. How these images function in public depends on the features of the specific image, the motivation for the image, and the responses from the public sphere.

=== What makes an icon an icon? ===
While multiple interpretations of photographic images as icons are discussed in conversations of public rhetoric, establishing what makes an icon an icon is important in order to identify and further analyze icons‚Äô functions. Hariman and Lucaites describe the seven characteristics of an icon as follows:

# is easily recognized by many people of varied backgrounds;
# is an object of veneration and other complex emotional responses;
# is reproduced widely and placed prominently in both public and private settings;
# is used to orient the individual [viewer] within a context of collective identity, obligation, and power;
# represents large swaths of historical experience and acquires its own history of appropriation and commentary;
# stands above the welter of news, debates, decisions, and investigations; and/or
# bears witness to something that exceeds words.&lt;ref name="Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1"/&gt;
If a photographic image holds one or more of the above-mentioned characteristics, it is considered an icon and fulfills several important functions in public rhetoric.

=== Functions of photographic icons in  public life ===
As a version of public rhetoric, iconic images serve to compose meaning and persuade a public audience to respond in some way. According to Hariman and Lucaites, ‚Äúeach image presents a pattern of motivation that can make some responses more likely than others.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; An iconic image [[semiotically]] promotes an interpretation by its audience that is by no means incumbent on the specific image, but likely will create a realm of similar meanings more frequently than others. Five vectors of influence are identified for iconic photographs: ‚Äúreproducing [[ideology]], communicating social knowledge, shaping collective [[Memoria|memory]], modeling citizenship, and providing figural resources for communicative action.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Hariman and Lucaites 2007, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reproducing ideology ====
Iconic images have the capability of representing [[ideology]], which Hariman and Lucaites define as ‚Äúa set of beliefs that presents a social order as if it were a natural order, that presents asymmetrical relationships as if they were mutually beneficial, and that makes authority appear self-evident.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph has the power to create such public meaning that can manipulate order, relationships, and authority as part of reproducing ideology.

==== Communicating social knowledge ====
Because icons are distinctively public visual images, they ‚Äúrecast social knowledge with regard to the distinctive concerns and roles of public life.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; By tapping into the knowledge of the public to which they are being presented, icons effectively persuade members of a society and their social interactions, as any successful rhetoric does. Photographs can communicate social knowledge because they are accepted as representations of social performance.

==== Shaping collective memory ====
Photographic icons can negotiate collective memory as part of the social knowledge it communicates. An icon can shape public understanding of specific events and contexts at the kairotic time of their occurrence and thereafter. Thus, society as a whole acts as the audience of the rhetorical message sent about the time the photograph was taken. Hariman and Lucaites contend, ‚Äúthe more collective memory is constructed through the visual media, the more likely it is that the iconic photos will be used to mark, frame, and otherwise set the tone for later generations‚Äô understanding of public life‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; in the specific time period.

==== Modeling citizenship ====
Members of the public interpreting iconic images can themselves be shaped by the messages sent by the icons, as can their [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] relationships with each other. When viewing icons that portray U.S. citizens, the audience sees themselves in those citizens and emulates their portrayal of society. Iconic images essentially ‚Äúdisplay the public to themselves.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Providing figural resources for communicative action ====
Since society can be considered ‚Äúabstract‚Äù in terms of relationships between citizens, photographs serve to communicate such ambiguous citizenship and supply models for how to be a ‚Äúgood citizen.‚Äù Hariman and Lucaites explain that ‚Äúan iconic photograph can continue to shape public understanding and action long after the event has passed or the crisis has been resolved pragmatically.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The collective memory formed by iconic photographs inspire action to perform as a moral citizen and motivate public response.

'''''Ritual and Domestic Life in Prehistoric Europe''''' is a book by the English archaeologist [[Richard Bradley (archaeologist)|Richard Bradley]] of the [[University of Reading]]. It was first published by [[Routledge]] in 2005.

Bradley questions whether a distinction can be drawn between ritual and non-ritual behaviour in prehistoric Europe, citing ethnographic comparisons and archaeological examples to suggest that ritualised activities were a part of domestic life and agriculture.

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=April 2013}}
Part One, "The Importance of Ordinary Things", opens with chapter one, "Death and the Harvest", in which Bradley looks at the manner in which archaeologists have differentiated between ritual and domestic life. Discussing the Galician ''h√≥rreos'', or raised storehouses, he uses them as an example to highlight that both ritual and domestic features can be found in the same structure. Moving on to other archaeological examples, he discusses [[Durrington Walls]] in Wiltshire, England, and then the ''[[viereckschanze]]n'' of southern Germany and Bohemia. He then rounds off the chapter with a discussion of what ritual is, citing the work of social anthropologists and ritual studies scholars like [[Jack Goody]], [[Maurice Bloch]] and [[Catherine Bell (ritual studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]], emphasising that ritual is a form of action.{{sfn|Bradley|2005|pp=3&amp;ndash;40}} Chapter two, "The consecration of the house" explores ritual elements in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], beginning with an examination of [[Gamla Uppsala]] and moving on to suggest that across Northern Europe, houses were used as cultic buildings on certain occasions., citing ethnographic examples from the [[MƒÅori culture|Maori]] of New Zealand. Bradley proceeds to an examination of instances where graves have been placed over houses in prehistoric Europe.{{sfn|Bradley|2005|pp=41&amp;ndash;80}}

The '''School of Arabic Studies''' (in Spanish Escuela de Estudios √Årabes, EEA) is a research Institute of the [[Spanish National Research Council]] (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas, [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]) with headquarters at the Houses of the Chapiz in [[Grenada|Granada]].

This building, declared Object of Cultural Interest according to Spanish legislation, is made up of two former Morisco houses located in the well-known Granada district of [[Albaic√≠n]]. The School was born in 1932, when the Schools of Arabic Studies of Madrid and Granada were created with the aim of "protecting and encouraging Arabic studies in Spain". In its early stages, the Granada School was entitled to teach Arabic language and civilization, Hebrew language, Muslim cultural and political history, Islamic law and institutions, Arabic dialectology, art and archaeology. In 1939, after the Spanish Civil War, the School became a part of the newly created Spanish National Research Council and, consequently, it was devoted to research according to the guidelines of this institution. The School of Arabic Studies of Granada is nowadays the only Institute that keeps the original name, after the School of Madrid took other names, and the only CSIC Institute entirely devoted to Arabic studies. The School has a sole department, called "Department of Arabic Studies", which is made up of four research groups dealing with history of al-Andalus, Arabic historiography, medieval archaeology, Islamic architecture, natural science in al-Andalus, Arabic biographical literature, Islamic law, and edition and translation of Arabic texts.

'''Sid (Sidney Arthur James) Bradley''' (born 1936)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n85-144742/&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[academic]], author and specialist in [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] literature.&lt;ref name="AllchinBradley2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allchin|first1=A. M.|last2=Bradley|first2=S. A. J.|last3=Grundtvig-selskabet|first3=|title=Grundtvig in international perspective: studies in the creativity of interaction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWfZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 May 2011|year=2000|publisher=Aarhus University Press|isbn=978-87-7288-835-4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his best known publication, ''Anglo-Saxon Poetry'', Bradley has translated into modern English prose virtually the entire corpus of extant [[Anglo-Saxon poetry]]. Bradley studied Anglo-Saxon at [[University College, Oxford]], and subsequently taught it at [[King's College London]] then in the [[University of York]] where he became a [[Professor]] of English and Related Literature. From 1990 he was seconded to the Centre for [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]] Studies in the Theology Faculty of the [[University of Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], as a Research and Teaching Associate, during which period he published articles on N. F. S. Grundtvig (1783-1872) exploring the nature of Grundtvig's indebtedness to Anglo-Saxon literature and culture. He continues to write on this subject, most recently in ''Grundtvig-Studier 2016,'' in a collaborative discussion (with Professor K. E. Bugge) of Grundtvig's treatment of the topic of Christ's Descent into Hell. Bradley also served for some years as an editor of the annual journal ''Grundtvig-Studier'', and prepared a major work on biographical texts relating to Grundtvig. His publications have also touched on [[medieval]] [[Denmark|Danish]] [[historiography]], Danish [[ballads]], English [[medieval literature]], [[iconography]] and literature in the English post-[[Norman conquest of England|Conquest]] period, [[archaeology]], 17th-century [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[England|English]] [[political]] [[Tract (literature)|tracts]], and [[England|English]] 18th-century bawdy songs. Since retirement he has served as Chairman of the Trustees of the Friends of St Gregory's Minster in Kirkdale, North Yorkshire, promoting the preservation and interests of this distinguished Anglo-Saxon church. He is currently a member of the editorial committee of the twice-yearly magazine of the Confederation of Scandinavian Societies, for which journal he also writes.

The badly damaged statue is 82 cm high and represents a [[sphinx]] with the head of a woman, body of a winged lion and tail of a snake. This particular sphinx may have been included in an Iberian tomb to carry the soul of the deceased to the afterlife.

The Sphinx of Agost is on display at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]] in [[Madrid]].

The '''Terreaux Hoard''' (French - ''Tr√©sor des Terreaux'') is a hoard of coins discovered during excavations prior to the construction of an underground car park in place des Terreaux in [[Lyon]] in 1993. It was made up of 459 silver coins and 84 gold coins in an earthenware pot. Judging by the coins' date, it was buried c.1360 during the [[Hundred Years War]]. The coins include five [[√©cu]]s of [[Philip VI of Valois]], two [[mouton d'or|moutons d'or]] of [[John II of France|John the Good]], a Venetian [[ducat]] and a number of [[florin]]s. It is on display at the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4501">'''Thai Studies''', a branch of [[Asian studies]], is the multidisciplinary study of Thailand and the [[Thai peoples]]. It calls upon the academic disciplines of [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[religious studies]], [[political science]], [[Thai language]], [[Thai literature]], [[musicology]] and the physical sciences such as geology.

The first organisation to sponsor and promote Thai Studies was the [[Siam Society]], established in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frankfurter|first1=O.|year=1904 |title=The Aims of the Society|journal=Journal of the Siam Society |volume=1|pages=1‚Äì6 |publisher=Siam Society|url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1904/JSS_001_0d_Frankfurter_AimsOfTheSociety.pdf |accessdate=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Siam Society and the affiliated Siamese Heritage Protection Trust maintain an extensive library of Thai studies materials and exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siamese-heritage.org/| title=The Siamese Heritage Protection Program To Commemorate the 84th Royal Birthday Anniversary of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej Patron of The Siam Society Under Royal Patronage|date=20 April 2013|work=by the Siamese Society under Royal Patronage|publisher= Siamese Heritage Trust|accessdate= 21 April 2013|quote=To commemorate the 84th Royal Birthday Anniversary of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the Patron of the Siam Society and protector of fine arts and cultural heritage of Thailand, the Council of the Society approved the establishment of a new program, Siamese Heritage Protection Program, or ‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏©‡πå‡∏°‡∏£‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏™‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏° in Thai.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Journal of the Siam Society]]'' (''JSS'') is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]]. [[Open access]] to [[PDF]] copies of all issues back to 1904 is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Siam Society journal now available to all|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/computer/301595/siam-society-journal-now-available-to-all|newspaper=[[Bangkok Post]]|date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Thai Studies at [[Chulalongkorn University]] is a Thai studies center. The Thailand Information Center (TIC) at Chulalongkorn's main library maintains a repository of research materials for Thai studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://tic.car.chula.ac.th/jtic/|title=Thailand Information Center|date=20 April 2013|work=Office of Academic Resources|publisher=  [[Chulalongkorn University]]|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornell University]] was the first active center for Thai studies in the United States. In 1947, [[Lauriston Sharp]] began the [[Cornell-Thailand Project]], an initiative to collate baseline data in a comprehensive study of what was then a farming village on the outskirts of Bangkok, now [[Tambon]] Bang Chan ({{lang-th|‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏ô}}) in Bangkok's [[Khlong Sam Wa District]] ({{lang|th|‡∏Ñ‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏ß‡∏≤}}). 

Outside Thailand, a group of young, active academics at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) promoted Thai studies as a research discipline in social studies. The inaugural open-access ''Thai Studies Journal'' was launched at RMIT in 2011. RMIT hosted three Thai studies conferences in 2001, 2011, and 2014.

'''''The Mind of the Maker''''' (1941) is a Christian [[Theology|theological]] book, written by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (who was better known for her crime and mystery novels and other fiction, particularly for the character [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]). It used the experience she had of literary creativity to illuminate Christian doctrine about the nature of [[Doctrine of the Trinity|the Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mind of the Maker'', preface&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has a Latin dedication to Saint [[Athanasius]] and to British Christian leaders.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Regarded in the [[Christian world]] as something of a classic, it is often quoted.
:''"In The Mind of the Maker, one of her most profound works, Sayers contends that the creative process in art works in ways that correspond to the dynamic relation among the three Persons of the Trinity in Christian theology ‚Äî and that the activity of one illuminates the activity of the other."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=In God‚Äôs Image: The virtue of creativity | last=Wolfe | first=Gregory | work=National Review online | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/wolfe200505270758.asp | date=27 May 2005 | accessdate=2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly well received, Sayers' work even finds readers beyond the religious world, such as in the software management book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''.
:''"Dorothy Sayers, in her excellent book, The Mind of the Maker, divides creative activity into three stages: the idea, the implementation, and the interaction. A book, then, or a computer, or a program comes into existence first as an ideal construct, built outside time and space, but complete in the mind of the author. It is realized in time and space, by pen, ink, and paper, or by wire, silicon, and ferrite. The creation is complete when someone reads the book, uses the computer, or runs the program, thereby interacting with the mind of the maker. This description, which Miss Sayers uses to illuminate not only human creative activity but also the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, will help us in our present task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering | last=Brookes | first=Frederick P. jr. | work= | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4468/The-Mythical-ManMonth-Essays-on-Software-Engineering-20th-Anniversary-Ed-1995- | date=1975 | accessdate=2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Philosophical Forum''''' is a philosophy journal published by Wiley-Blackwell. It is currently edited by [[Douglas Lackey]].

==History==
''The Philosophical Forum'' was founded in 1943 as an annual philosophy journal, published by the [[Boston University]] Philosophical Club. The first editor was [[Sheldon C. Ackley]]. The first issue contained articles by [[Edgar S. Brightman]], [[David Easton]], [[Robert Whitaker (philosopher)|Robert Whitaker]], and [[William E. Kerstetter]]. The journal continued to publish more or less annually until 1964. In its run it contained articles by many philosophers including [[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], [[Hugo Adam Bedau]], [[Brand Blanshard]], [[Abraham Edel]], and [[Gordon W. Allport]].

''The Philosophical Forum'' was reconstituted in 1968 under the editorship of [[Joseph Agassi]].  It was published quarterly by [[Boston University]]'s department of philosophy. The first issue contained articles by [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Sylvain Bromberger]], and [[Yehuda Elkana]]'s translation of an article by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. After two issues, [[Walter G. Emge]] took over as editor. He held the position for two issues until [[Marx Wartofsky]] took over editorship and reconstituted the Journal. When Wartofsky moved from [[Boston University]] to [[Baruch College]] ''The Philosophical Forum'' moved with him. [[Marx Wartofsky]] edited ''The Philosophical Forum'' until his death. [[William James Earle]] and then [[Douglas P. Lackey]], both of Baruch College's Philosophy department, edited the ''Forum'' after Wartofsky's death.

==Content==
''The Philosophical Forum'' has been consistently publishing articles by prominent philosophers.  The journal's approach to philosophy is rare. [[Marx Wartofsky]] had an extremely broad conception of philosophy that included [[philosophy of science]], [[political philosophy]], and [[aesthetics]] and many other branches of philosophy, from both sides of the philosophical spectrum, including [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]]. ''The Philosophical Forum'' continues to publish articles from many different philosophical traditions.

''The Philosophical Forum'' often publishes single-topic issues. Notably it has released issues on philosophy and [[economics]], [[sociobiology]], [[apartheid]], African-American philosophical traditions, [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[ethnicity]], the philosophy of [[Jerry Katz]], translations of philosophical poetry, ethics and architecture, and translations of French philosophy of science.

Recently it published a 66-page book review of [[Terence Irwin]]'s ''The Development of Ethics: A historical and critical study'' written by 82 separate authors.

'''''The Satire of the Trades''''', also called '''''The Instruction of Dua-Kheti''''', is a work of [[wikt:didactic|didactic]] ancient Egyptian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Katheryn A. Bard, ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt'', Routledge 1999, p.886&lt;/ref&gt; It takes the form of an [[Sebayt|Instruction]], composed by a scribe from Sile named Dua-Kheti for his son Pepi. The author is thought by some to have composed the ''[[Instructions of Amenemhat]]'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;I. E. S. Edwards, N. G. L. Hammond, C. J. Gadd, ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', Cambridge University Press 1975,  p.527&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It describes  a number of trades in an exaggeratedly negative light, extolling the advantages of the profession of scribe. It is generally considered to be a [[satire]], though [[Wolfgang Helck|Helck]] thought it reflected the true attitude of the scribal class towards manual labourers.&lt;ref&gt;W. Helck, ''Die Lehre des DwA-xtjj'', Wiesbaden, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], between 2025 and 1700 BC. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/disability/n852.xml|title=SAGE Knowledge - Home|website=knowledge.sagepub.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text has survived in its entirety, but extremely corrupted, in the Sallier II Papyrus written during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], which is kept at the [[British Museum]]. A number of fragments are kept at the British Museum, the [[Louvre]], the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]], and other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim, ''op.cit.'', pp.184f.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the texts most frequently copied by students during the [[Ramesside Period]].

A '''tumulus''' (plural '''tumuli''') is a [[mound]] of [[Soil|earth]] and [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s raised over a [[grave]] or graves. Tumuli are also known as '''barrows''', '''burial mounds''' or '''[[kurgan]]s''', and may be found throughout much of the world. A [[cairn]], which is a mound of stones built for various purposes, may also originally have been a tumulus.

Tumuli are often categorised according to their external apparent shape. In this respect, a [[long barrow]] is a long tumulus, usually constructed on top of several [[burial]]s, such as [[passage grave]]s. A [[round barrow]] is a round tumulus, also commonly constructed on top of burials. The internal structure and architecture of both long and round barrows has a broad range, the categorization only refers to the external apparent shape.

The method of {{linktext|inhumation}} may involve a [[dolmen]], a [[cist]], a [[mortuary enclosure]], a [[mortuary house]], or a [[chamber tomb]]. Examples of barrows include [[Duggleby Howe]] and [[Maeshowe]].

The word ''tumulus'' is [[Latin]] for 'mound' or 'small hill', which is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''teuh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'' with extended zero grade *''tum-'', 'to bulge, swell' also found in ''tumor'', ''thumb'', ''thigh'', and ''thousand''.&lt;ref&gt;Calvert Watkins, ''American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', 2000, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tumulus burial accounts==
The funeral of [[Patroclus]] is described in book 23 of the ''[[Iliad]]''. Patroclus is burned on a [[pyre]], and his bones are collected into a golden [[urn]] in two layers of fat. The barrow is built on the location of the pyre. [[Achilles]] then sponsors funeral games, consisting of a [[chariot race]], boxing, wrestling, running, a duel between two champions to the first blood, discus throwing, archery and spear throwing.

[[Beowulf]]'s body is taken to Hronesness, where it is burned on a funeral pyre. During cremation, the [[Geats]] lament the death of their lord, a widow's lament being mentioned in particular, singing [[dirge]]s as they [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the barrow.
Afterwards, a mound is built on top of a hill, overlooking the sea, and filled with treasure. A band of twelve of the best warriors ride around the barrow, singing dirges in praise of their lord.

Parallels have also been drawn to the account of [[Attila the Hun|Attila]]'s burial in [[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Klaeber, ''Attila's and Beowulf's funeral'', PMLA (1927); Martin Puhvel, ''The Ride around Beowulf's Barrow'', Folklore (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanes tells that as Attila's body was lying in state, the best horsemen of the [[Huns]] circled it, as in circus games.

An Old Irish ''Life of [[Columcille]]'' reports that every funeral procession "halted at a mound called Eala, whereupon the corpse was laid, and the mourners marched thrice solemnly round the spot."

==Types of barrows==
[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] often classify tumuli according to their location, form, and date of construction (see also [[mound]]). Some British types are listed below:

&lt;!-- please don't add more info here. I'm in the process of creating a separate page for each barrow type --&gt;
*[[Bank barrow]]
*[[Bell barrow]]
*[[Bowl barrow]]
*D-shaped barrow ‚Äì round barrow with a purposely flat edge at one side often defined by stone slabs.
*[[Disc barrow]]
*[[Fancy barrow]] ‚Äì generic term for any [[Bronze Age]] barrows more elaborate than a simple hemispherical shape.
*[[Long barrow]]
*[[Oval barrow]] ‚Äì a [[Neolithic]] long barrow consisting of an elliptical, rather than rectangular or trapezoidal mound.
*[[Platform barrow]] ‚Äì The least common of the recognised types of round barrow, consisting of a flat, wide circular mound that may be surrounded by a ditch. They occur widely across southern England with a marked concentration in East and West [[Sussex]]. 
*[[Pond barrow]] ‚Äì a barrow consisting of a shallow circular depression, surrounded by a bank running around the rim of the depression, from the [[Bronze Age]].
*[[Ring barrow]] ‚Äì a bank that encircles a number of burials.
*[[Round barrow]] ‚Äì a circular feature created by the [[Bronze Age]] peoples of Britain and also the later [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vikings]], and [[Saxons]]. Divided into subclasses such as saucer and bell barrow‚Äîthe [[Six Hills]] are a rare Roman example.
*[[Saucer barrow]] ‚Äì a circular Bronze Age barrow that features a low, wide mound surrounded by a ditch that may have an external bank.
*[[Square barrow]] ‚Äì burial site, usually of [[Iron Age]] date, consisting of a small, square, ditched enclosure surrounding a central burial, which may also have been covered by a mound.

In 2015, the first long barrow in thousands of years, inspired by those built in the [[Neolithic]] Period, was built on land just outside the village of [[All Cannings]] in England. The project was instigated by Tim Daw, a local farmer and steward of [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/application/errorpages/500/|title=500|website=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barrow was designed to have a large number of private niches within the stone and earth structure to receive cremation urns. The structure received significant media attention, with national press writing extensively about the revival of the structures, and various episodes of filming, for example by [[BBC]] [[Countryfile]] as it was being built. It was fully subscribed within eighteen months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelongbarrow.com/news |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212090923/http://www.thelongbarrow.com/news |archivedate=2017-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed soon after by a new barrow near [[St Neots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/local-news/first-burial-barrow-thousands-years-12062456|title=First burial barrow in thousands of years is completed at Hail Weston|last=Makey|first=Julian|date=2016-10-23|work=cambridgenews|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further plans to revive barrows are in development in [[Herefordshire]] and at [[Soulton]] in [[Shropshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soultonhall.co.uk/page/322/new-barrow.htm|title=New Barrow {{!}} Soulton Hall|last=www.stmem.com|first=Shropshire Tourism -|website=www.soultonhall.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[kurgan]] is of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] origin, derives from [[Proto-Turkic]] *Kur- ("to erect (a building), to establish"). In Ukraine and Russia, there are royal kurgans of [[Varangian]] chieftains, such as the [[Black Grave]] in Ukrainian [[Chernihiv]] (excavated in the 19th century), [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]]'s Grave in Russian [[Staraya Ladoga]], and vast, intricate [[Shum-gora|Rurik's Hill]] near Russian [[Novgorod]]. Other important kurgans are found in Ukraine and South Russia and are associated with much more ancient [[steppe]] peoples, notably the [[Scythian]]s (e.g., Chortomlyk, [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]]) and early [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] (e.g., [[Ipatovo kurgan]]) The steppe cultures found in Ukraine and South Russia naturally continue into [[Central Asia]], in particular [[Kazakhstan]].

===Eastern Europe===

====Albania====
Tumuli are one of the most prominent types of prehistoric monuments spread throughout northern and southern [[Albania]]. Some well-known local tumuli are:
*[[Kamenica Tumulus]]
*[[Lofk√´nd Tumulus]]
*[[Pazhok Tumulus]]

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
More than 50 burial mounds were found in Kupres. Man from Kupres- the skeleton found in one of the tumuli is believed to be more than 3000&amp;nbsp;years old and it is kept in Gorica museum in Livno.
Glasinac has many tumuli. During the Bronze and Iron Age it was a place of strong [[Glasinac culture]], who buried their dead in tumulus.

====Bulgaria====
[[File:VarnaMemorial.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Memorial of the [[Battle of Varna]] dedicated to [[W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland]] dug into an ancient [[Thracians|Thracian]] tumulus ]]
Hundreds of [[Thracians|Thracian]] burial mounds are found throughout Bulgaria, including the [[Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak|Kazanlak]] and [[Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari|Sveshtari]] tombs, [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] sites. Located near the ancient Thracian capital cities of [[Seuthopolis]] (of the [[Odrysian kingdom]]) and Daosdava or Helis (of the [[Getae]]), perhaps they represented royal burials. Other tombs contained offerings such as the [[Panagyuriste treasure|Panagyurishte]] and [[Rogozen treasure|Rogozen]] treasures.

====Croatia====
There are thousands of tumuli throughout all Croatia, built of stone ([[Croatian Language|Croatian]]: ''gomila'', ''gromila'') in the carst areas (by the [[Adriatic Sea]]) or made of earth (Croatian: ''humak'') in the inland plains and hills.  Most of these prehistoric structures were built in the 2nd and 1st millennium BC, from the middle [[Bronze Age]] to the end of the [[Iron Age]], by the [[Illyrians]] or their direct ancestors in the same place; the [[Liburnians|Liburnian]] inhumation of dead under tumuli was certainly inherited from the earlier times, as early as the [[Copper Age]]. Smaller tumuli were used as the burial mounds, while bigger (some up to 7&amp;nbsp;metres high with 60&amp;nbsp;metres long base) were the [[cenotaph]]s (empty tombs) and ritual places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udruga-kameleon.hr/tekst/1134/ |title=Tumulusi u Hrvatskoj - veliƒçanstvene prapovijesne "piramide" |author=Goran Majetiƒá |date=July 9, 2008 |publisher=udruga-kameleon.ht |accessdate=8 October 2010 |language=hr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513203027/http://www.udruga-kameleon.hr/tekst/1134/ |archivedate=13 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{See also|Anglo-Saxon burial mounds}}
[[File:Sutton Hoo burial ground 4.jpg|thumb|Part of the burial ground at [[Sutton Hoo]], Suffolk]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], barrows of a wide range of types were in widespread use for burying the dead from the late [[Neolithic]] until the end of the [[Bronze Age]], 2900-800&amp;nbsp;BC. Square barrows were occasionally used in the Iron Age (800&amp;nbsp;BC-43&amp;nbsp;AD) in the east of [[England]]. The traditional round barrow experienced a brief resurgence following the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] conquests, with the introduction of northern [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] burial practices from continental Europe. These later barrows were often built near older Bronze Age barrows. They included a few instances of [[ship burial]]. Barrow burial fell out of use during the 7th century as a result of the spread of [[Christianity]].
Early scholarly investigation of tumuli and theorising as to their origins was undertaken from the 17th century by [[antiquary|antiquaries]], notably [[John Aubrey]], and [[William Stukeley]]. During the 19th century in [[England]] the excavation of tumuli was a popular [[pastime]] amongst the educated and wealthy upper classes, who became known as "barrow-diggers". This leisure activity played a key role in laying the foundations for the scientific study of the past in Britain but also resulted in untold damage to the sites.

Notable British barrows include:
*[[West Kennet Long Barrow]] - Neolithic long barrow in [[Wiltshire]]
*[[Wayland's Smithy]] - Neolithic long barrow and chamber tomb in [[Oxfordshire]] (historically [[Berkshire]])
*[[Belas Knap]] - Neolithic long barrow in [[Gloucestershire]]
*[[Maeshowe]] - Neolithic chambered cairn and passage grave on Mainland, [[Orkney]]
*[[Duggleby Howe]] - Neolithic round barrow in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]
*[[Sutton Hoo]] - 7th-century [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglian]] ship burial with exceptionally rich grave goods in [[Suffolk]]
*[[Devil's Humps, Stoughton|Devil's Humps]] - Bronze Age barrow group on [[Bow Hill, Sussex|Bow Hill]] in [[West Sussex]]
*[[Devil's Jumps, Treyford|Devil's Jumps]] - Bronze Age barrow group on the [[South Downs]] of West Sussex
*[[Seamer Beacon]] - Bronze Age barrow near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]]

====Czech Republic====
During the early [[Middle Ages]], [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribesmen inhabiting what is now the Czech Republic used to bury their dead under barrows. This practice has been widespread in southern and eastern [[Bohemia]] and some neighbouring regions, like [[Upper Austria]] and [[Lusatia]], which at that time have been also populated with Slavic people. However, there are no known Slavic barrows in central part of the country (around [[Prague]]), nor are they found in [[Moravia]]. This has led some of the archaeologists to speculations about at least three distinct waves of Slavic settlers, which have colonized Czech lands separately from each other, each wave bringing its customs with it (including burial rituals).

At places where barrows have been constructed, they are usually found in groups (10 to 100 together), often forming several clearly distinct lines going from the west to the east. Only a few of them have been studied scientifically so far; in them, both burials by fire (with burnt ashes) and unburned skeletons have been found, even on the same site. It seems that builders of the barrows have at some time switched from burials by fire to burying of unburned corpses; however, the reason for such change is unknown. The barrows date too far back in history (700&amp;nbsp;AD to 800&amp;nbsp;AD) to contain any [[Christian]] influences.

As Czech barrows usually served for burials of poor villagers, only a few objects are found in them except for cheap pottery. Only one Slavic barrow is known to have contained gold.

Most of the Czech burial barrows have been damaged or destroyed by intense [[agriculture]] in the densely populated region. Those that remain are usually in forests, especially at hilltops in remote places. Therefore, there is no general knowledge about burial barrows among Czech population.

The best Slavic barrow sites can be found near to [[Vit√≠n]], a small village close to [[ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice]]. There are two groups of barrows close to Vit√≠n, each containing about 80 barrows ordered in lines. Some of the barrows are as much as 2&amp;nbsp;metres high.

There are also some [[prehistoric]] burial barrows in Czech Republic, built by unknown people. Unlike Slavic barrows, they can be found all across the country, though they are scarce. Distinguishing them from Slavic ones is not an easy task for the unskilled eye. Perhaps the most famous of them forms the top of the [[≈Ωur√°≈à]] hill near [[Slavkov u Brna]]; it is from here that [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] commanded his forces during the [[Battle of Austerlitz]].

====Ireland====
A tumulus can be found close to the [[Grian√°n of Aileach]] in [[County Donegal]]. It has been suggested by historians such as [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]], who surveyed the site in the early 19th century, that the tumulus may predate the [[ringfort]] of Aileach by many centuries possibly to the neolithic age. Surrounding stones were laid horizontally, and converged towards the centre. the mound had been excavated in Petrie's time, but nothing explaining its meaning was discovered. It was subsequently destroyed, but its former position is marked by a heap of broken stones. Similar mounds can be found at The [[Hill of Tara]] and there are several prominent tumuli at [[Br√∫ na B√≥inne]] in County Meath.

====Italy====
Some large tumulus tombs can be found especially in the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] culture. Smaller barrows are dated to the [[Villanovan culture|Villanova period]] (ninth-eighth centuries BC) but the biggest were used in the following centuries (from the seventh century afterwards) by the Etruscan aristocracy.

The Etruscan tumuli were normally family tombs that were used for many generation of the same noble family, and the deceased were buried with many precious objects that had to be the "grave goods" or the furnishings for these "houses" in the Afterlife.
Many tombs also hold paintings, that in many cases represent the funeral or scenes of real life.
The most important graveyards (necropolises) with tumulus tombs are [[Veio]], [[Cerveteri]], [[Vetulonia]], [[Populonia]]. Many isolated big barrows can be found in the whole Etruscan territory (mostly in Central Italy).

====Netherlands====

In many places, these prehistoric graves are still clearly visible as low hills. The oldest tumuli (''grafheuvels'') in the Netherlands were built near [[Apeldoorn]] about 5,000 years ago. Concentrations of tumuli from the [[Bronze Age]] are located on the [[Veluwe]] and [[Drenthe]].

Early scholarly investigation of tumuli and [[dolmen|hunebedden]] and theorising as to their origins was undertaken from the 17th century by notably [[Johan Picardt]]. Although many have disappeared over the centuries, some 3000 tumuli are known of which 636 are protected as [[Rijksmonument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grafheuvels.nl/vitruvius4_2008.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221013113/http://www.grafheuvels.nl/vitruvius4_2008.php |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest tumulus in the Netherlands is the [[Vorstengraf (Oss)|grave of a king]] near Oss. [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]], [[Drents Museum]], and [[Huis van Hilde]] have findings from tumuli in their collections.

====Portugal====

One of the densest manifestations of the megalithic phenomenon in Europe occurred in [[Portugal]]. In the north of the country there are more than 1000 late prehistoric barrows. They generally occur in clusters, forming a necropolis. The method of inhumation usually involves a [[dolmen]]. The tumuli, dated from c. 4450 to 1900&amp;nbsp;BC, are up to 3&amp;nbsp;metres high, with diameters from 6 to 30&amp;nbsp;metres. Most of them are mounds of earth and stones, but the more recent ones are composed largely or entirely of stones (cairns). In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], barrows are called ''mamoas'', from the Latin ''mammulas'', given to them by the Romans because of their shape, similar to the breast of a woman.

===Scandinavia===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:180px-Ottar03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Ohthere]]'s mound'' in [[Vendel]], [[Sweden]] from the early 6th century.|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 14 December 2008|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
Burial mounds were in use from the [[Nordic Stone Age|Stone Age]] until the 11th century in Scandinavia and figure heavily in [[Norse paganism]]. In their original state they usually appear as small, man-made hillocks, though many examples have been damaged by [[ploughing]] or plundering so that little visible evidence remains.

The tumuli of Scandinavia is of a great variety of designs, depending on the cultural traditions of the era in which they were constructed. The tumuli tombs may contain single graves, collective graves and both inhumation and cremation was practiced, again depending on the era, but also on geography. Many tumuli in Scandinavia shows a continuation of use from Stone Age to [[Viking Age]]. In the Viking Age (and perhaps in earlier times as well) burning the deceased, was believed to transfer the person to [[Valhalla]] by the consuming force of fire. Archaeological finds testifies that the cremation fire could reach temperatures of up to 1500&amp;nbsp;¬∞C. The remains were often covered with cobblestones and then a layer of gravel and sand and finally a thin layer of turf or placed in urns. The tumuli were used for [[ancestral worship]]ping, an important practice in Norse culture and many places shows continuation of use for millennia.

{{Quotation|Thus he ([[Odin]]) established by law that all dead men should be burned, and their belongings laid with them on the pile, and the ashes be cast into the sea or buried in the earth. Thus, said he, every one will come to Valhalla with the riches he had with him upon the pile, and he would also enjoy whatever he himself buried in the earth. For men of consequence a mound should be raised to their memory, and for all other warriors distinguished for manhood, a standing stone. This custom remained long after Odin's time. [...] It was their faith that the higher the smoke arose in the air, the higher he would be raised whose pile it was, and the richer he would be, the more property that was consumed with him|[[Ynglinga saga]]}}

{{Main article|Vergina}}

Some of the world's most prominent Tumuli, the Macedonian tombs and a cist-grave at [[Vergina]] include the tomb of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] (359‚Äì336&amp;nbsp;BC), father of [[Alexander the Great]] (336‚Äì323&amp;nbsp;BC), as well as the tomb of [[Alexander IV of Macedon|Alexander IV]] (323‚Äì309&amp;nbsp;BC), son of Alexander the Great. A very large tumulus has been discovered in [[Amphipolis]]. Known as the [[Kasta Tomb]], the tomb's occupant is presently unknown. Also numerous Mycenaean Greek Tombs are in all essence Tumuli, notably Agamemnon's site in Mycenae, and other sites in Tiryns, near Olympia and Pylos, and mostly in the Peloponnese peninsula near Mycenaean sites and Bronze Age settlements. Moreover, in [[Central Greece]] there are numerous Tumuli, some excavated, others not. A notable one is in Marathon, serving as a burial for the ones who fell during battle.

As of October 2014 there are ongoing excavations at the [[Kasta Tomb]] in [[Amphipolis]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]] with the tumulus having a perimeter of 497 meters. The tomb within is assessed to be an [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonian]] burial monument of the last quarter of the 4th century BC.

[[File:Gordion82.JPG|thumb|The "Tomb of [[Midas]]" in Gordion, dated 740 BC.]]
On the [[Anatolia]]n peninsula, there are several sites where one can find the biggest specimens of these artificial mounds throughout the world. Three of these sites are especially important. Bin Tepeler (and other [[Lydia]]n mounds of the Aegean inland), [[Phrygia]]n mounds in [[Gordium]] (Central Anatolia), and the famous [[Commagene]] tumulus on the Mount [[Nemrut (mountain)|Nemrut]] (Southeastern Anatolia).

This is the most important of the enumerated sites with the number of specimens it has and with the dimensions of certain among them. It is in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] inland of Turkey. The site is called "Bin Tepeler" (a thousand mounds in Turkish) and it is in the northwest of [[Salihli]] district of [[Manisa Province|Manisa]] province. The site is very close to the southern shoreline of [[Lake Marmara]] (Lake Gyges or Gygaea). Bin Tepeler is a Lydian [[necropolis]] that dates back to 7th and 6th centuries BC. These mounds are called, "the pyramids of Anatolia," as a giant specimen among them is 355&amp;nbsp;metres in diameter, 1115&amp;nbsp;metres in perimeter and 69&amp;nbsp;metres high. According to [[Herodotus]], this giant tumulus belongs to the famous Lydian King [[Alyattes of Lydia|Alyattes]] who ruled between 619‚Äì560&amp;nbsp;BC. There is also another mound belonging to King [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]]. The Gyges mound was excavated but the burial chamber hasn't been found yet. In this site, there are 75 tumuli dating back to Lydian period that belong to the nobility. A large number of smaller artificial mounds can also be observed in the site. There are other Lydian tumuli sites around [[E≈üme]] district of [[U≈üak Province|U≈üak]] province. Certain mounds in these sites had been plundered by raiders in the late 1960s, and the Lydian treasures found in their burial chambers were smuggled to the United States, which later returned them to Turkish authorities after negotiations. These artifacts are now exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of U≈üak.

[[File:TumMMWPintro.jpg|thumb|Tumulus MM, Gordion, at sunset]] 
[[Gordium]] (Gordion) was the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Phrygia]]. Its ruins are in the immediate vicinity of [[Polatlƒ±]], near the Turkish capital [[Ankara]]. At this site, approximately 80-90 tumuli date back to the Phrygian, [[History of Persia|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic]] periods. Around 35 tumuli have been excavated so far, ranging in date from the 8th century BC to the 3rd or 2nd century BC. The biggest tumulus at the site is believed to have covered the burial of the famous Phrygian King [[Midas]] or that of his father. This mound, called Tumulus MM (for "Midas Mound"), was excavated in 1957 by a team from the University of Pennsylvania Museum, led by [[Rodney Young (archaeologist)|Rodney Young]] and his [[Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World|graduate students]]. Among the many fine [[bronze]] artifacts recovered from the wooden burial chamber were 170 bronze vessels, including numerous "omphalos bowls," and more than 180 bronze "Phrygian [[fibula]]e" (ancient safety pins). The [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|wooden furniture]] found in the tomb is especially noteworthy, as wood seldom survives from archaeological contexts: the collection included nine tables, one of them elaborately carved and inlaid, and two ceremonial serving stands inlaid with religious symbols and geometric patterns. Important bronze and wooden artifacts were also found in other tumulus burials at the site.

The Mount [[Nemrut (mountain)|Nemrut]] is 86&amp;nbsp;km in the east of [[Adƒ±yaman]] province of [[Turkey]]. It is very close to [[Kahta]] district of the same province. The mountain has, at its peak, 3050&amp;nbsp;metres of height above the sea level. A tumulus that dates to the 1st century BC is at the peak of the mountain. This artificial mound has 150&amp;nbsp;metres of diameter and a height of 50&amp;nbsp;metres, which was originally 55&amp;nbsp;metres. It belongs to the [[Commagene]] King [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene]] who ruled between 69‚Äì40&amp;nbsp;BC. This tumulus is made of broken stone pieces, which renders excavation attempts almost impossible. The tumulus is surrounded by ceremonial terraces in the east, west, and north. The east and west terraces have tremendous statues (reaching 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;meters of height) and bas reliefs of gods and goddesses from the Commagene [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] where divine figures used to embody the [[Persian mythology|Persian]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] perceptions together.

====Israel====
[[File:JerusalemTumulus2.jpg|thumb|Jerusalem tumulus #2 in 2004]] 
A tumulus forms the center of the ancient [[megalithic]] structure of [[Rujm el-Hiri]] in the [[Golan Heights]]. [[Rujm]] in Arabic can mean tumulus, [[cairn]] or stone heap. Near the western city limits of modern [[Jerusalem]], 19 tumuli have been documented (Amiran, 1958). Though first noticed in the 1870s by early surveyors, the first one to be formally documented was Tumulus #2 in 1923 by [[William Foxwell Albright]], and the most recent one (Tumulus #4) was excavated by [[Gabriel Barkay]] in 1983. &lt;!-- Since 21 kings reigned in [[Jerusalem]] during the [[Israelite]] monarchy from [[David]] to [[Zedekiah]] (who was conquered and humiliated by the [[Chaldea]]n king, [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]]), it is not unreasonable to suspect that these mounds were the locations of ceremonies to mourn/honor them after they had already received proper burial in the royal tombs (probably located in the heart of the city where they could be continuously guarded). See [[2 Chronicles]] 16:14, 21:19 (which states that King [[Jehoram of Judah|Jehoram]] was not given this honor), 32:33, the [[book of Jeremiah]] 34:5 (a conditional promise for [[Zedekiah]] that he did not earn), and [[Biblical archaeology]]. [[Gabriel Barkay]] popularized this theory after studying tumuli near Salamis in [[Cyprus]]. --&gt; The association of these tumuli with the Judean kings who ruled [[Jerusalem]] does not substantiate Biblical history since it is mere speculation. No inscriptions naming any specific Judean king have been excavated from a tumulus.

*More than half of these ancient Israeli structures have now been threatened or obliterated by modern construction projects, including Tumulus #4, which was excavated hastily in a salvage operation. The most noteworthy finds from this dig were two [[LMLK seal]] impressions and two other handles with associated Concentric Circle incisions, all of which suggests this tumulus belonged to either King [[Hezekiah]] (Barkay, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;68) or his son [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]] (Grena, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;326).
*When comparing the number of these tumuli to the total number of Israelite kings (northern and southern), note that [[Saul the King|Saul]] never ruled in [[Jerusalem]], and [[Athaliah]] was never crowned. She took the throne by force ([[Books of Kings|2Kings]] 11:1-3), and would certainly not have been honored with a tumulus ceremony following her brutal assassination.
*The northern kings did not reign over the southern kingdom, and they would certainly not have been honored with a tumulus ceremony in [[Jerusalem]]; if any ceremonies were held for them, they would have transpired in the north (near [[Bethel (Israel)|Bethel]], [[Tirzah]], or [[Samaria]]).

The first burial mounds in Korea were [[dolmens]], which contained material from cultures of the 1st millennium AD, such as bronze-ware, pottery, and other symbols of society elite. The most famous tumulii in Korea, dating around 300&amp;nbsp;AD, are those left behind by the Korean [[Baekje]], [[Goguryeo]]([[Kogyuro]]/[[Koguryo]]), [[Silla]], and [[Gaya confederacy|Gaya]] states and are clustered around ancient capital cities in modern-day [[Pyongyang]], [[Ji'an, Jilin]], [[Seoul]], and [[Gyeongju]]. The Goguryeo tombs, shaped like pyramids, are famous for the well-preserved wall murals like the ones at [[Anak Tomb No.3]], which depict the culture and artistry of the people. The base of the tomb of King [[Gwanggaeto]] is 85&amp;nbsp;meters on each side, half of the size of the Great Pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0521407834&amp;id=sANORB_MSRUC&amp;vq=korean+tombs&amp;dq=korean+tombs&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;pg=PA213&amp;sig=1H5DNJ77lxjt8wlBxZCUKJcw7yY|title=The Archaeology of Korea|last=Nelson|first=Sarah M.|date=1993-05-13|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521407830|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goguryeo Silla tombs are most noted for the fabulous offerings that have been excavated such as delicate golden crowns and glassware and beads that probably made their way to Korea via the [[Silk Road]]. Many indigenous Korean artifacts and culture were transmitted to the tomb builders of early Japan, such as horsetrappings, bronze mirrors, paintings and iron-ware.

In Southwestern British Columbia, several types of burial mounds are known from the Salishan region (Hill-Tout 1895).

{{Main article|Mound builder (people)|List of burial mounds in the United States}}
[[File:Grave Creek Mound.jpg|thumb|[[Grave Creek Mound]], located in [[Moundsville, West Virginia]], was built by the [[Adena culture]]]]

Mound building was a central feature of the public [[architecture]] of many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[mesoamerican religion|Mesoamerican]] cultures from Chile to Minnesota. Thousands of mounds in the United States have been destroyed as a result of farming, pot-hunting, amateur and professional archaeology, road-building and construction. Surviving mounds are still found in river valleys, especially along the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] Rivers, and as far west as [[Spiro Mounds]] in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;[[Spiro Mounds]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mound]]s were used for burial, to support residential and religious structures, to represent a shared [[cosmology]], and to unite and demarcate community. Common forms include conical mounds, ridge-top mounds, [[platform mound]]s, and animal [[effigy mound]]s, but there are many variations. Mound building in the USA is believed to date back to at least 3400&amp;nbsp;BC in the Southeast (see [[Watson Brake]]). The [[Adena culture|Adena]] and the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] cultures are principally known for their mounds, as is the [[Hopewell tradition]]. The largest mound site north of [[Mexico]] is [[Cahokia Mounds]], a vast [[World Heritage Site]] located just east of St. Louis, Missouri.

The '''V visa''' is a temporary visa available to spouses and minor children (unmarried, under 21) of [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[Permanent residence (United States)|lawful permanent residents]] (LPR, also known as [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] holders).  It allows permanent residents to achieve family unity with their spouses and children while the immigration process takes its course.  It was created by the [[Legal Immigration Family Equity Act]] of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Immigration through Legal Immigration Family Equity Act (LIFE) of 2000 | work = | publisher = US Citizenship and Immigration Services| date = | url = http://149.101.23.2/graphics/services/residency/life.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is to relieve those who applied for immigrant visas on or before December 21, 2000. Practically, the V visa is currently not available to spouses and minor children of LPRs who have applied after December 21, 2000.

== Background ==

A permanent resident is a person who has been granted the right to reside permanently in the U.S. He/She is authorized to work and gains the right to become a U.S. citizen if he/she meets certain criteria.

The permanent resident is known as the sponsor of the immigrant visa petition while the spouse/child is known as the beneficiary.

A permanent resident who marries a non-U.S. citizen or permanent resident after getting his/her green card needs to file a Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) | work = | publisher = US Citizenship and Immigration Services| date = | url = http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-130.pdf | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-05-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406114441/http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/I-130.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|USCIS]]. Once the I-130 is approved, the beneficiary needs to wait for an F2A immigrant visa.  The F2A immigrant visa is heavily backlogged because only around 90,000 visas are available each year and demand exceeds supply. The current processing delays for the I-130 can be viewed at the USCIS website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Case Status Service Online | work = | publisher = US Citizenship and Immigration Services| date = | url = https://egov.immigration.gov/cris/jsps/ptimes.jsp | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current backlog for F2A visas is updated each month.  The date is available in the Visa Bulletin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Visa Bulletins | work = | publisher = Bureau of Consular Affairs, US Department of State| date = | url = https://egov.uscis.gov/cris/processTimesDisplayInit.do | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2012-12-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070223102250/http://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi_bulletinarchives.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; posted on the State Department's web site.

While waiting for the I-130 to be approved or the F2A visa to become available, the beneficiary may visit the U.S. on B-2 visa (maximum 90 or 180 days stay) or under the [[Visa Waiver Program]] (VWP, maximum 90 days stay). However, in many cases, application for the B-2 visa or entry under the VWP is denied. Even once allowed a short-visit to the U.S., it cannot be repeated many times. Basically, the beneficiary cannot live or study in the U.S. until obtaining approval of an immigrant visa by a U.S. embassy or consulate outside of the U.S. This is because the visitor and student visas (or the VWP) require demonstration of non-immigrant intent. By definition, the spouse/child of a permanent resident cannot demonstrate non-immigrant intent.

The permanent resident, on the other hand, cannot be away from the U.S. for long periods.  Doing so can be considered abandonment of permanent resident status.

This situation often separates the permanent resident from his/her spouse/child.  These days, it takes 4‚Äì5 years&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html Visa Bulletin] U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; before family unity can be achieved.

== V visa ==

The V visa is available to those beneficiaries who satisfy the following conditions:

1. An immigrant petition (I-130) must have been filed by the sponsor for the beneficiary on or before December 21, 2000.

2. The beneficiary must have been waiting for at least three years since the time the I - 130 was filed.

The V visa is available regardless of whether the beneficiary is waiting for the I-130 to be approved or for an F2A visa.  With this visa, the nuclear family can achieve unity in the U.S.  The spouse can work and the child can go to school.  International travel is permitted.  The V visa remains valid as long as the underlying immigrant petition is valid.

While the V visa is still available to those who satisfy the conditions, it is effectively no longer useful since the sunset date was December 21, 2000.  Those who missed this deadline have no relief. Approximately 1,000,000 spouses/minor children of the lawful permanent residents are standing in the waiting line of 5‚Äì6 years for immigrant visas without being allowed to live with their spouses/parents in the U.S.

== Family unity in other non-immigrant and immigrant categories ==

U.S. non-immigrants (students, specialty workers, intracompany transferees) do not have this kind of problem.  Their spouses/minor children qualify for dependent visas. There are no numerical limits or processing delays associated with dependent visas.

Most U.S. citizens do not experience major delays either.  While U.S. citizens have to file I-130 applications for their spouses/minor children, they do not have to wait for immigrant visas. If the process takes too long, they can apply for [[K-1 visa|K visas]].  Even without having to wait for an immigrant visa, the entire process typically takes at least one year and often as much as three years.  This is caused by USCIS (6-10mo), NVC (1-4mo), and Consular (1-6mo) processing times.

Under current law it is only permanent residents whose spouses/minor children must wait many years to be admitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/Legomsky070419.pdf Written Testimony of Stephen H. Legomsky], John S. Lehmann University Professor, Washington University School of Law. Before the United States House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law. Oversight Hearing on the Shortfalls of the 1986 Immigration Reform Legislation, April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==

Bills have been introduced in previous sessions of Congress to address this issue. H.R. 1823&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.01823: H.R.1823] To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend the provisions governing nonimmigrant status for spouses and children of permanent resident aliens awaiting the availability of an immigrant visa, and for other purposes. House of Representatives, 109th Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; (109th Congress) addresses this head-on by reinstating the V visa. S.1919&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s.01919: S.1919] Immigrant Accountability Act of 2005. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act in order to reunify families, to provide for earned adjustment of status, and for other purposes. Senate, 109th Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; (also 109th Congress) reclassifies spouses and children of permanent residents as immediate relatives.  This classification removes the numerical limits on the number of immigrant visas available to them.  Other bills offered partial solutions to the problem. However, with a new session of Congress that began in January 2007, these bills have lapsed. New bills would have to be introduced for any relief.

Most other developed nations do not separate nuclear families. Canada, for example, expedites family unity petitions.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Statistics ==

=== Number of visas issued by year ===

The first V visas were issued in Fiscal Year 2001, after the LIFE Act became law. In the table below, the years are Fiscal Years, so for instance the year 2009 refers to the period from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009.&lt;ref name=visa-approvals&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/Non-Immigrant-Statistics/NIVDetailTables/FYs97-15_NIVDetailTable.xls |title=Non-immigrant visa statistics |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this only counts V visas issued at embassies and consulates outside the United States, and does not include people who changed nonimmigrant status to V status within the United States.

The significance of the V visa has declined over time, because it applies only to people who had filed [[Form I-130]] petitions on or before December 21, 2000. The most recent V visas were issued in Fiscal Year 2007.

'''Warwick Todd''' is a fictional character created by author and comedian [[Tom Gleisner]]. Todd is the author of four fictional [[cricket]] diaries: ''[[The Warwick Todd Diaries]]'' (1997), ''[[Warwick Todd: Back in the Baggy Green]]'' (1998), ''[[Warwick Todd Goes the Tonk]]'' (2001) and ''[[Warwick Todd - Up in the Block Hole]]'' (2009). The first 3 books in the series were Australian bestsellers.

The diaries, recounting Todd's experiences as a member of the [[Australian cricket team]], are a humorous [[parody]] of the tour diaries and cricketing memoirs that are a staple of the Australian publishing industry.

In contrast to [[Billy Birmingham]]'s [[The Twelfth Man]], Todd's diaries describe real-life matches played by the Australian cricket team, albeit including Todd as a player. Off-field behaviour, however, is completely fictional and quite at odds with the team's public image.

In keeping with the "blokey" style of many tour diaries, Todd refers to all players and support staff by their [[nickname]]s and not their real names (for example, "Pigeon" is [[Glenn McGrath]] and "Dizzy" is [[Jason Gillespie]]).

Gleisner has made live appearances as Warwick Todd for charity cricket matches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6231">'''Xult√∫n''' is a large [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] located 40&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Tikal]] and 8&amp;nbsp;km south of the smaller Preclassic site of [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] in northern [[Guatemala]].

==Site==
The site, which once supported a considerable population, has a 35 m tall [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramid]], two [[Mesoamerican ballgame#The Court|ballcourts]], 24 [[stele|stelae]] (the last of which, Stele 10, dates to 889), several [[plaza]]s, and five large water reservoirs (''aguadas''). Incompletely charted in the 1970s, it is the largest-known Classic Maya site that has yet to be archaeologically investigated.&lt;ref name=NG120510/&gt; Nearby sites include Chaj K‚Äôe‚Äôk Cu√©, believed to be the residential area of the Xult√∫n [[elite]]; Isla Oasis; and Las Minas. The latter sites contain large [[limestone]] [[quarry|quarries]].

===Recent discoveries===
Since 2008, excavations in Xultun have revealed several important features. One is a Late-Classic room (labeled 10K2) with murals on three sides, showing three dark seated characters with large mitres (west wall); a kneeling official extending a stylus to the seated king, Yax We'nel Chan K'inich (north wall); and three other characters, together with unique [[Maya calendar]] notations chiefly relating to lunar astrology (northeast and east walls). Most of the characters bear hieroglyphic titles, some of these reminiscent of the senior-junior rankings of the traditionalist Maya [[Cargo system|civil-religious hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Saturno et al. 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The lunar notations strongly recall much later calculations found in the [[Dresden Codex]].&lt;ref name=NG120510&gt;{{cite web| last=Vance| first=Eric| title=Unprecedented Maya Mural Found, Contradicts 2012 "Doomsday" Myth| publisher=National Geographic| date=10 May 2012| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120510-maya-2012-doomsday-calendar-end-of-world-science/| accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zender and Skidmore 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC100512&gt;{{cite web| title=No hint of world's end in oldest Mayan calendar| publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date= 11 May 2012| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-11/early-mayan-calendar-found/4004686| accessdate= 11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sci110512&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Science| date= 11 May 2012| volume=336| number=6082| pages=714‚Äì717| doi= 10.1126/science.1221444| title=Ancient Maya Astronomical Tables from Xultun, Guatemala|author1=William A.

Another important feature, recently (2014) reported on by William Saturno,&lt;ref&gt;Saturno 2014&lt;/ref&gt; is a building complex called 'Los √Årboles', dating to the Early Classic. Its front is decorated with complicated stucco imagery relating to the royal cult of the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar]], also in evidence on several of the stelas. This cult was apparently associated with the dismemberment (imagined or real) of human victims. At the same time, there is a double reference to a place of origins (7 ''k'an'' - 9 ''imix''), with the numbers personified by their respective jaguar-related patrons.

==History==
Up to now (2017), the dynastical history of the important kingdom of Xultun - which has its own emblem glyph&lt;ref&gt;Prager et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; - is not well known and can only very partially be reconstructed from information on the site's heavily eroded stelas and from the inscriptions of other kingdoms with which it interacted, such as Caracol, Tikal and Naranjo.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison and Stuart 2004; Rossi et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A fuller picture is nonetheless possible by taking into account data from the archaeology of the wider Xultun - San Bartolo habitational area.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison and Dunning 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom's Classic importance is reflected by its role as a center of refined painting 'schools'.&lt;ref&gt;Krempel and Matteo 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
