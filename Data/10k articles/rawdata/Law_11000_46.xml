A '''referendum on the new [[constitution of France]]''' was held in [[Ubangi-Shari]] on 28 September 1958 as part of a [[French constitutional referendum, 1958|wider referendum]] held across the [[French Union]]. The new constitution would see the country become part of the new [[French Community]] if accepted, or result in independence if rejected. It was approved by 98.77% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=fr011958 Frankreich, 28. September 1958 : Verfassung] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Copyleft.svg|thumb|100px|right|The [[copyleft]] symbol. Unlike the copyright symbol, it has no legal meaning.]]
'''All rights reversed''' is a phrase that indicates a release of [[copyright]] or a [[copyleft]] licensing status. It is a pun on the common copyright disclaimer "[[All rights reserved]]", a [[copyright formality]] originally required by the [[Buenos Aires Convention]] of 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iusmentis.com/copyright/allrightsreserved/ |title= The phrase "All rights reserved" |accessdate=2007-12-27 |last= Engelfriet |first= Arnoud |coauthors= |year= 2006 |work= Ius mentis| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080101091757/http://www.iusmentis.com/copyright/allrightsreserved/| archivedate= 1 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; "All Rights Reversed" (sometimes spelled ''rites'') was used by author [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Gregory Hill]] to authorize the free reprinting of his ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' in the late 1960s. Hill's disclaimer was accompanied by the [[kosher]] "Ⓚ" (for [[kallisti]]) symbol, a play on ©, the [[copyright symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Principia Discordia |last= Hill |first= Gregory |year= 1965 |quote=Ⓚ All Rites Reversed - reprint what you like}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984/5 programmer [[Don Hopkins]] sent [[Richard Stallman]] a letter labeled "Copyleft—all rights reversed". Stallman chose the phrase to identify his [[Free software movement|free software]] method of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |last= Stallman |first= Richard  |year= 1999 |publisher= [[O'Reilly Media]] |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |pages= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often accompanied by a reversed version of the copyright symbol (''see illustration'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Source: A Multidisciplinary Approach |last= Muffatto |first= Moreno |year= 2006 |publisher= Imperial College Press |isbn= 1-86094-665-8 |pages= 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, this usage is considered legally risky by the [[Free Software Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is Copyleft? | url = http://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html | publisher = Free Software Foundation | access-date = 2017-05-06 | quote = It is a legal mistake to use a backwards C in a circle instead of a copyright symbol. Copyleft is based legally on copyright, so the work should have a copyright notice. A copyright notice requires either the copyright symbol (a C in a circle) or the word “Copyright”. A backwards C in a circle has no special legal significance, so it doesn't make a copyright notice. It may be amusing in book covers, posters, and such, but be careful how you represent it in a web page!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"All Rights Reversed", its homophone, "All ''Rites'' Reversed", and/or the "Copyleft" symbol, are occasionally used among those who publish or produce media (or any other material that might normally be copyrighted) as a clever means of saying "This is not copyrighted. Please, do with it what you will." and encouraging the duplication and use of the "copy-lefted"  material thereof. 

The [[open source]] character [[Jenny Everywhere]] is released under an "All rights reversed" licence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16376">[[File:Man sleeping on Canadian sidewalk.jpg|thumb|Man sleeps on the street, something anti-homelessness legislation seeks to regulate.]]'''Anti-homelessness legislation''' can take two forms; legislation that aims to help and re-house [[homeless people]], and legislation that is intended to send the homeless to [[homeless shelter]]s compulsively, or criminalize homelessness and begging.

==International law==
Since the publication of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (Charter of the United Nations &amp;mdash; UN) in 1948, the public perception has been increasingly changing to a focus on the human [[right to housing]], travel and migration as a part of individual self-determination rather than the [[human condition]]. The Declaration, an international law  reinforcement of the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Trial Judgements]], upholds the rights of one nation to intervene in the affairs of another if said nation is abusing its citizens, and rose out of a 1939&amp;ndash;1945 World War II Atlantic environment of extreme split between "haves" and "have nots." Article 6 of the 1998 [[Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities]] declares that members of the global community have individual and collective duties and responsibilities to take appropriate action to prevent the commission gross or systematic human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://globalization.icaap.org/content/v2.2/declare.html|title=DECLARATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND HUMAN DUTIES|date=November 2002|journal=Globalization|volume=2|issue=[http://globalization.icaap.org/volume2issue2.html 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern study of homeless phenomena is most frequently seen in this historical context.

==Laws supporting the homeless==
Laws supporting homeless people generally place obligations on [[State (polity)|the state]] to support or house homeless people.

=== The United Kingdom ===
'''The 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act''' required parish unions to supply houses for workers but these unions purposely made these work houses unattractive in order to discourage workers from applying for housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt1t89499.12|title=Housing politics in the United Kingdom|last=|first=|date=2016|publisher=Policy Press at the University of Bristol|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Lund|editor-first=Brian|edition=1|series=Power, planning and protest|location=|pages=207–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act also made casual wards known as "spikes" available for thoses who needed temporary housing in return for their labor.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt1t89g4j.16|title=Comparing social policies|last=Kennett|first=Patricia|last2=Becker|first2=Saul|date=2003|publisher=Policy Press at the University of Bristol|year=|isbn=|edition=1|series=Exploring new perspectives in Britain and Japan|location=|pages=173–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that approximately 30,000 to 80,000 people used the spikes in the early 1900s in Great Britain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Scotland===
{{see also|Scottish homelessness}}

The [[Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003]] was legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament that set the goal of providing permanent residence to those deemed unintentionally homeless.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/10/30092316/1 Homelessness statistics in Scotland:2006-07 &gt; Part 1] The Scottish Government Publications, accessed March 30th 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Following, the [[Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order 2004]] was passed in 2004.  This order made it so that, unless exceptional circumstances were present, any familial unit including children or an expectant mother was not placed in "unsuitable temporary housing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Scotland's most recent anti-homelessness legislation is entitled The Housing Support Services (Homelessness)(Scotland) Regulations 2012, and it came into full effect on June 1, 2013.  These regulations require local authorities to assist the homeless in a variety of ways, including help in adjusting to a new living situation, debt counseling and managing a personal budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2013/06/3279/2|title=HOUSING SUPPORT DUTY TO HOMELESS HOUSEHOLDS - GUIDANCE FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|date=2013-06-03|website=www.gov.scot|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The first, and primary, anti-homelessness act passed in the United States is entitled the [[McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act]].  This act was originally passed in 1987, and has subsequently been amended four times.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;McKinney Vento Act (NCH Fact Sheet #18). National Coalition for the Homeless. June 2006. http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/facts/McKinney.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1988 amendment to the act focused on revising the way in which the funds of the [[McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] were distributed.  The following amendment in 1990 established new programs, including the Shelter Care Plus Program, whose focus was in assisting those with disabilities through housing support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hacsl.org/rental-assistance/homeless-programs/shelter-plus-care-program|title=Housing Authority  » Shelter Plus Care Program|website=www.hacsl.org|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were a variety of additions due to the 1992 amendments, including the implementation of "safe havens" which would allow those whom do not wish to participate in the services offered to receive low cost housing.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  Another primary change created by the amendments of 1992 was the creation of the Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Support program (or ACCESS); this program was created in order to assist the homeless people who had both serious mental illness issues, as well as substance abuse problems and lasted a total of 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steadman|first=Henry J.|last2=Cocozza|first2=Joseph J.|last3=Dennis|first3=Deborah L.|last4=Lassiter|first4=Margaret G.|last5=Randolph|first5=Frances L.|last6=Goldman|first6=Howard|last7=Blasinsky|first7=Margaret|date=2002-07-01|title=Successful Program Maintenance When Federal Demonstration Dollars Stop: The Access Program for Homeless Mentally Ill Persons|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020776310331|journal=Administration and Policy in Mental Health and Mental Health Services Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=6|pages=481–493|doi=10.1023/A:1020776310331|issn=0894-587X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final amendment to the [[McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] occurred in 1994, and it specified the amendment of the Surplus Property Program and the Education of the Homeless Children and Youth program.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

'''The Fair Housing Act''' passed in 1968 was designed to protect those who were traditionally discriminated against by housing agencies because of their race, gender, religion, familial status, and disability.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt1jd952s.9|title=Homelessness Handbook|date=2007|publisher=Berkshire|isbn=9781933782034|edition=1|pages=291–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states and cities also gave homeless people equal access to housing accommodations regardless of their income. Although this Act did not specifically refer to the homeless population, the main beneficiaries of this law were homeless individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990''', also known as the ADA states that people with disabilities must be given appropriate housing accommodations that meet their special needs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, people with disabilities should be given the chance to interact with people who do not have disability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This Act ensures that homeless individuals are not discriminated against because of their special needs.

==Laws criminalizing behaviors engaged in by the homeless==
{{anchor|Laws criminalizing the homeless}}
Use of the law that criminalizes the homeless generally takes on one of five forms:&lt;ref name="LIS"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Randall Amster|Amster, Randall]]|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/lost-in-space-the-criminalization-globalization-and-urban-ecology-of-homelessness/oclc/221150739|title=Lost in Space: The Criminalization, Globalization, and Urban Ecology of Homelessness|publisher=LFB Scholarly|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=1-59332-297-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Restricting the public areas in which sitting or sleeping are allowed.
*Removing the homeless from particular areas.
*Prohibiting [[begging]].
*[[Selective enforcement]] of laws.
*Selective '' creation '' of laws.&lt;ref name=Cunningham&gt;{{cite book |title= Out of Sight&amp;mdash;Out of Mind? |last= Cunningham |first= Kelly |coauthors= |year= 1999 |publisher= DIANE Publishing |location= |isbn= 0-7881-8276-5 |pages= 90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The French novelist [[Anatole France]] noted this phenomenon as long ago as 1894, famously observing that "the law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges".)&lt;ref name="Anatole France"&gt;{{cite book |title=Le lys rouge |last=France |first=Anatole |authorlink=Anatole France |coauthors= |year=1894 |location= |language=French|isbn= |pages= |chapter=VII |chapterurl=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Lys_rouge_-_VII |quote=Ils y doivent travailler devant la majestueuse égalité des lois, qui interdit au riche comme au pauvre de coucher sous les ponts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
'''The 1977 Housing (Homeless Persons) Act''' greatly restricted the homeless housing requirements so that only individuals who were affected by natural disasters could receive housing accommodations from the local authorities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt1t89dc6.14|title=Understanding housing policy (third edition)|last=Becker|first=Saul|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press at the University of Bristol|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Lund|editor-first=Brian|edition=REV - Revised, 3|location=|pages=155–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the rejection of the majority of homeless applications received by the local government. This Act also made it difficult for homeless individuals without children to receive accommodations provided by local authorities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===United States===
{{further|Homelessness in the United States#Criminalization of homelessness}}
The [[National Coalition for the Homeless]] reports that there is a growing trend in the United States towards criminalizing the state of being homeless.&lt;ref name="A Dream Denied"&gt;National Coalition for the Homeless: [http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/crimreport/report.pdf A Dream Denied].&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this approach believe that punitive measures will deter people from choosing to be homeless. To this end, cities across the country increasingly outlaw activities such as sleeping, eating, sitting, and begging in public spaces, and selectively enforce more neutral laws—such as those prohibiting [[United States open container laws|open containers]] or [[loitering]]—against homeless populations.&lt;ref name="A Dream Denied" /&gt; Violators of such laws typically incur criminal penalties, which result in fines and/or incarceration.

In ''Jones v. City of Los Angeles'',&lt;ref name=Jones2006&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=jones+v+city+of+los+angeles&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2003&amp;case=4259488333208893136&amp;scilh=0 ''Jones v. City of Los Angeles''], 444 F.3d 1118, 1138 (9th Cir. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that "the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] prohibits the City from punishing involuntary sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks that is an unavoidable consequence of being human and homeless without shelter in the City of Los Angeles". However on October 15, 2007, the Court vacated its opinion after the parties settled the case and sought withdrawal of the Opinion.&lt;ref name=Jones2007&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4348161734356292769&amp;q=jones+v+city+of+los+angeles&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2003&amp;scilh=0 ''Jones v. City of Los Angeles''], 505 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of homeless criminalization claim that such measures do nothing to actually solve homelessness and in fact make matters worse.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Olson and Scott MacDonald, ''Washington's War on the Visibly Poor: A Survey of Criminalization Ordinances &amp; Their Enforcement'', available at: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2602318&lt;/ref&gt; Homeless people find it harder to secure employment, housing, or federal benefits with a criminal record, and therefore penalizing the act of being homeless makes exiting such a situation much more difficult.&lt;ref name="LIS"/&gt; Although the court's opinion in ''Jones v. City of Los Angeles'' (see above) was vacated, the result suggests that criminalizing homelessness may be unconstitutional. Similarly, in response to growing reports of [[hate crime]]s, some state governments have proposed the addition of "people experiencing homelessness" to their hate-crimes statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/us/08homeless.html|title=Attacks on Homeless Bring Push on Hate Crime Laws|last=Lichtblau|first=Eric|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perception of Homelessness and Policy Implications ==

=== United States ===
The authors of a 2017 study on homelessness stated that homeless people have a higher incidence of sickness, with their most common health problem being skin problems. Homeless people also have a lack of access to sanitation, leading to poor hygiene. These characteristics are noticeable and may trigger reactions of disgust from onlookers who are inclined, at an evolutionary level, to be pathogen-averse. This leads the general public to keep their physical distance from homeless people, and promotes exclusionary policies.  As an example, these authors state that while the majority of the general public support subsidized housing for homeless individuals, they do not want that housing in their own neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clifford|first=Scott|last2=Piston|first2=Spencer|date=2017-06-01|title=Explaining Public Support for Counterproductive Homelessness Policy: The Role of Disgust|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-016-9366-4|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=503–525|doi=10.1007/s11109-016-9366-4|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the public also maintains concern for the homeless, supporting increases in federal spending on homelessness programs. In fact, when surveyed, the public supports spending on homelessness over other social problems by consistently putting the homeless in the top third of their spending priorities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Link, B.

Respondents to surveys also feel that 55% of homeless people are addicted to drugs or alcohol, and that 45% of homeless people have been to jail before. The majority of U.S. residents surveyed also think that homeless people make neighborhood worse, and that their presence brings down the profitability of local businesses.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

{{other|Casual (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Petite Panoply- Trip to Cumberland Island, Georgia (20775335400).jpg|thumb|An American tourist couple in casual [[T-shirt]]s and [[shorts]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]].]]
{{Western dress codes}}
'''Casual attire''' or '''casual wear, clothing''' is a [[Western dress code]] category that comprises anything not approporiate with [[formal attire]], [[semi-formal attire]], or [[informal attire]] [[dress code]]s. In general, casual attire is associated with emphasising personal comfort and individuality over formality or conformity. As such, this type of dress may also be referred to as '''leisurewear'''. The word "[[:wiktionary:casual|casual]]" can in a broader sense be defined as something relaxed, occasional, spontaneous, or "[[wiktionary:informal|informal]]" in the sense of "not formal" or "suited for everyday use" (although notably [[informal attire]] actually refers to a dress code more formal than casual attire, a step below [[semi-formal attire]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/casual&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, when indicated as a dress code for instance on an invitation, casual attire may still be expected to be done tastefully, meaning that trousers and shirts do not have holes, tears, or stains. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lifehacker.com/what-all-of-those-confusing-dress-code-terms-really-mea-1724671659|title=What All of Those Confusing Dress Code Terms Really Mean|last=Allan|first=Patrick|work=Lifehacker|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its wide variety of interpretations per definition, casual attire may be defined not by what it ''is'' by rather what ''is not'':
* [[Formal attire]] such as [[morning dress]] and [[white tie]] ([[dress coat]]), but also [[ceremonial dress]] variants, military [[full dress uniform]], [[religious clothing]] and [[folk costume]]
* [[Semi-formal attire]] such as [[stroller (style)|stroller]] and [[black tie]] ([[tuxedo]])
* [[Informal attire]], including business professional wear comprising [[suit (clothing)|suits]], [[Necktie|ties]] [[waistcoat]]s and [[dress shoes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://emilypost.com/advice/attire-guide-dress-codes-from-casual-to-white-tie/|title=Attire Guide: Dress Codes from Casual to White Tie - The Emily Post Institute|work=The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, however, dress codes within casual attire category such as [[business casual]], [[smart casual]] or [[dress clothes]] may indicate expectation of some sartorial effort, including suit jacket, dress trousers, closely resembling the result of informal attire.

==Elements==
[[Sport coat]], [[Blazer]], [[Jeans]], [[Dress Shirt]], Casual Collared Shirt, and a [[T-shirt]] describe to be a casual wear for men.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sharp-casual-young-man-guide/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/how-to-dress-sharper/&lt;/ref&gt; With the popularity of [[spectator sports]] in the late 20th century, a good deal of athletic gear has influenced casual wear, such as Adidas suits, running shoes, and track clothing.  Clothing worn for [[manual labour|manual labor]] also falls into casual wear. Basic materials used for casual wear include [[denim]], [[cotton]], [[jersey]], [[polyester]], [[flannel]], and [[Wool|fleece]]. Materials such as velvet, chiffon, and brocade could be considered too fancy for casual wear.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.namedclothing.com/material-chart/&lt;/ref&gt;  

While utilitarian costume comes to mind first for casual dress, however, there is also a wide range of flamboyance and theatricality. [[Punk fashion|Punk]] clothes and fashion of the 1970s and 1980s is a striking example.  [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] introduced a great deal of [[lace]], [[jewelry]], and [[cosmetics]] into casual wear during the 1980s.  More recently, [[hip hop fashion]] has played up elaborate jewelry and luxurious materials worn in conjunction with athletic gear and the clothing of manual labor.

Casual wear is typically the dress code in which new forms of [[gender expression]] are attempted before being accepted into semi-casual or semi-formal situations.  An obvious example is [[masculinity|masculine]] jewelry, which was once considered shocking or titillating even in casual circles, and is now hardly noteworthy in semi-formal situations.  [[Amelia Bloomer]] introduced trousers (of a sort) for women as a casual alternative to formal hoops and skirts.  In a recent mirror image, [[sarong]]s and other skirts have been embraced by a few men of the European tradition as a casual alternative to formal trousers.  Both of these innovations caused great embarrassment in formal circles. The trend toward female exposure in the 20th century has also pushed the necklines of formal [[ball gown]]s ever lower and the skirts of [[cocktail dress]]es ever higher.  For men, the exposure of shoulders, thighs, and backs is still limited to casual wear.

In [[employment law]], '''constructive dismissal''', also called '''constructive discharge''' or '''constructive termination''', occurs when an [[employee]] [[resign]]s as a result of the [[employer]] creating a [[hostile work environment]]. Since the resignation was not truly voluntary, it is, in effect, a termination. For example, when an employer places extraordinary and unreasonable work demands on an employee to obtain their resignation, this can constitute a constructive dismissal.

The exact legal consequences differ between different countries, but generally a constructive dismissal leads to the employee's obligations ending and the employee acquiring the right to make claims against the employer.

The employee may resign over a single serious incident or over a pattern of incidents. Generally, a party seeking relief must have resigned soon after one of the constructive acts.

==United States law==
In the United States, constructive discharge is a general term describing the involuntary resignation of an employee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dol.gov/elaws/eta/warn/glossaryall.asp#Constructive_Discharge&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single federal or state law against constructive dismissal in general. From a legal standpoint, it occurs when an employee is forced to resign because of intolerable working conditions which violate employment legislation, such as:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wrongfulterminationsettlements.com/reasons/constructive-discharge/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA)
* Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA)
* Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)
* Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA)
* Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA)
* Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII)
* Any state employment law

The burden of proof in constructive dismissal cases lies with the employee.

The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] has provided a 3-part test to determine whether or not a constructive discharge has occurred: (1) a reasonable person in the complainant’s position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) conduct that constituted discrimination against the complainant created the intolerable working conditions; and (3) the complainant’s involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;https://federalemployeelawblog.com/2017/07/10/constructive-discharge-for-federal-employees/&lt;/ref&gt;  

In California, the California Supreme Court defines constructive discharge as follows:

"In order to establish a constructive discharge, an employee must plead and prove, by the usual preponderance of the evidence standard, that the employer either intentionally created or knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at the time of the employee's resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in the employee's position would be compelled to resign."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=turner+anheuser+bush&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;case=10157690807936007266&amp;scilh=0 ''Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.''], 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 1251, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian law==

Canadian courts recognize there are circumstances in which the employer, although not acting explicitly to terminate an individual’s employment, alters the employment relationship’s terms and conditions to such a degree that an employee is entitled to regard the employer’s conduct as a termination, and claim [[wrongful dismissal]], just as if they had been let go without any notice or termination pay in lieu of notice.&lt;ref name="duttonlaw.ca"&gt;http://duttonlaw.ca/constructive-dismissal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructive dismissal arises from the failure of the employer to live up to the essential obligations of the employment relationship, regardless of whether the employee signed a written employment contract. Employment law implies into employment relationships a common-law set of terms and conditions applicable to all employees. For example, once agreed upon, wages are implicitly locked in by the common-law of contract as an essential term of the employment relationship. In this regard, it is a constructive dismissal if an employer fails to pay an employee.

An employer’s breach of the employment contract releases the employee from their obligation to perform under the contract, and thus treat themselves as dismissed. Hence, a constructive dismissal always becomes a wrongful dismissal.

===Changes to the employment relationship===

Typically, the first way to claim constructive dismissal involves an employer making substantial changes to the employment contract, such as:

# a demotion;
# altering the employee’s reporting structure, job description or working conditions;
# lowering an employee’s compensation;
# changing hours of work;
# imposing a suspension or leave of absence; and
# relocating the employee’s workplace.

In addition, failure on the part of an employer to provide employment standards (i.e. overtime pay, vacation pay, etc.), can result in a constructive dismissal.

Nevertheless, for an employee to have a successful case for constructive dismissal, the employer’s breach must be fundamental. What is “fundamental” depends on the circumstances, and not all changes to the employment relationship give rise to a constructive dismissal. For example, administrative, i.e. non-disciplinary, suspensions might not amount to a constructive dismissal if imposed in good faith and justified by legitimate business reasons (i.e. lack of work). As well, a small reduction in salary, in tough times, and administered rationally, might not be a constructive dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;http://duttonlaw.ca/constructive-dismissal-employees/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxic work environments===

An employee may also be able to claim a constructive dismissal based on an employer’s conduct, rather than a change to a specific or implied term of the employment contract. Here, the second way to claim constructive dismissal examines whether the employer’s (or employee of the employer) course of conduct, or even a single incident, demonstrates an intention to no longer be bound by the written or implied employment contract. An example of this kind of constructive dismissal is a “toxic work environment”. In this regard, if a work environment is so poisoned that a reasonable person wouldn’t be expected to return, then constructive dismissal is likely.

A toxic work environment is classically defined as  unjustified criticism as well as vague and unfounded accusations of poor performance, especially where authority and respect with co-workers had been seriously undermined and compromised. Another example of toxic work environment is where the employer fails to prevent workplace harassment.&lt;ref name="duttonlaw.ca"/&gt;

==UK law==

In [[United Kingdom]] law, constructive dismissal is defined by the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]] section 95(1)c:&lt;ref name=era96-95&gt;{{UK-LEG
|path=ukpga/1996/18/section/95
|title=Section 95(1)c of the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]]
|noprefix=yes
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|The employee terminates the contract under which they are employed (with or without notice) in circumstances in which they are entitled to terminate it without notice by reason of the employer's conduct.}} The circumstances in which an employee is entitled are defined in common law. The notion of constructive dismissal most often arises from a fundamental breach of the term of trust and confidence implied in all [[contract of employment|contracts of employment]]. In order to avoid such a breach ''"[a]n employer must not, without reasonable or proper cause, conduct himself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence between the employer and the employee."''&lt;ref name=Malik&gt;''[[Malik and Mahmud v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA|Malik &amp; anor v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA]]'' 1997] UKHL 23; [1998] AC 20&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst a breach can be of the implied term of trust and confidence, a fundamental breach of any of the express or implied terms of a contract of employment is sufficient.

The [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] states:

{{bq|A [[tribunal]] may rule that an employee who resigns because of conduct by his or her employer has been 'constructively dismissed'. For a tribunal to rule in this way the employer's action has to be such that it can be regarded as a significant breach of the employment contract indicating that he or she intends no longer to be bound by one or more terms of the contract: an example of this might be where the employer arbitrarily demotes an employee to a lower rank or poorer paid position. The contract is what has been agreed between the parties, whether orally or in writing, or a combination of both, together with what must necessarily be implied to make the contract workable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berr.gov.uk/employment/employment-legislation/employment-guidance/page31082.html#Constructive_dismissal&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following a constructive dismissal, claim for "[[unfair dismissal]]" and a claim for "[[wrongful dismissal]]" may arise.

===Types of constructive dismissal===

Although they tend to blend into one in a tribunal, strictly there are two types of constructive dismissal: statutory and common law.

At common law&lt;ref&gt;''Western Excavating (ECC) Ltd v Sharp'' [1978] ICR 221&lt;/ref&gt; the requirement is acceptance of a repudiatory breach, which means the employer has indicated it no longer considers itself bound by an essential term of the contract, e.g. the requirement to pay wages or the requirement not to destroy the mutual bond of trust and confidence. It matters not if the employer did not mean to repudiate the contract.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;''Lewis v Motorworld Garages Ltd'' [1986] ICR 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Under statute&lt;ref name=era96-95/&gt; the requirement is employer's "conduct" allowing the employee to "terminate without notice"; as this can only happen with a repudiatory breach it amounts to the same thing.

===Relation to unfair dismissal===
A common mistake is to assume that constructive dismissal is exactly the same as unfair treatment of an employee – it can sometimes be that treatment that can be considered generally evenhanded nevertheless makes life so difficult that the employee is in essence forced to resign&lt;ref&gt;''Savoia v Chiltern Herb Farms Ltd'' [1982] IRLR 166&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., a fair constructive dismissal might be a unilateral change of contract justified by a bigger benefit to the business than the inconvenience to the employee), but the Employment Appeal Tribunal doubts that it will be very often that the employer can breach ERA96 s98(4) whilst being fair.

A constructive dismissal occurs when the employer's serious breach causes&lt;ref&gt;''British Leyland UK Ltd v McQuilken'' [1978] IRLR 245&lt;/ref&gt; the employee to accept that the contract has been terminated, by resigning. The fairness of it would have to be looked at separately under a statutory claim for unfair dismissal.

The problems for the employer are that constructive dismissal is a contractual claim, which can be made in a tribunal for up to £25,000 or in court without limit, and, by dismissing constructively, it by definition misses out on the correct procedure meaning that even if the reason was fair, the decision was probably not, and so an unfair dismissal usually arises, creating a statutory claim alongside the contractual claim.

The court can look behind the lack of, or different, stated reason given by the employee at the time of resignation to establish that a cover story was in fact a resignation caused by fundamental breach.&lt;ref&gt;''Weathersfield Ltd v Sargent'' [1999] ICR 425&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical causes===
The person causing the dismissal does not need the authority to dismiss, as long as they acted in the course of employment.&lt;ref name=era96-95/&gt;&lt;ref name=hilton&gt;''Hilton International Hotels (UK) Ltd v Protopapa'' [1990] IRLR 316&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grounds====
Constructive dismissal is typically caused by:-

*unilateral contract changes by the employer such as:
** deliberate&lt;ref&gt;''Cantor Fitzgerald International v Callaghan'' [1999] ICR 639&lt;/ref&gt; cuts in pay or status (even temporary&lt;ref&gt;''Wadham Stringer Commercials (London) Ltd and Wadham Stringer Vehicles Ltd v Brown'' [1983] IRLR 46&lt;/ref&gt;),
** persistent delayed wages,
** refusal of holiday,&lt;ref&gt;''Lytlarch Ltd v Reid'' [1991] ICR 216&lt;/ref&gt;
** withdrawal of car,&lt;ref&gt;''Triton Oliver (Special Products) Ltd v Bromage'' (EAT 709/91) IDS Brief 511&lt;/ref&gt;
** suspension without pay (or even on full pay&lt;ref&gt;''William Hill Organisation Ltd v Tucker'' [1999] ICR 291&lt;/ref&gt;),
** dramatic changes to duties, hours&lt;ref&gt;''Greenaway Harrison Ltd v Wiles'' [1994] IRLR 380&lt;/ref&gt; or location (beyond reasonable daily travelling distance&lt;ref&gt;''Courtaulds Northern Spinning Ltd v Sibson'' [1988] ICR 451&lt;/ref&gt;), or
* breach of contract in the form of bullying, e.g.:
** ignoring complaints,&lt;ref&gt;''Goolds v McConnell'' [1995] IRLR 516&lt;/ref&gt;
** persistent unwanted amorous advances,&lt;ref&gt;''Western Excavating (ECC) Ltd v Sharp''&lt;/ref&gt;
** bullying and swearing,&lt;ref&gt;''Korkaluk v Cantor Fitzgerald International'' [2004] ICR 697&lt;/ref&gt;
** verbal abuse (typically referring to gender,&lt;ref&gt;''Isle of Wight Tourist Board v Coombes'' [1976] IRLR 413&lt;/ref&gt; size&lt;ref&gt;''Palmanor v Cedron'' [1978] IRLR 303&lt;/ref&gt; or incompetence&lt;ref name=courtaulds&gt;''Courtaulds Northern Textiles Ltd v Andrew'' [1979] IRLR 84, EAT&lt;/ref&gt;),
** singling out for no pay rise,&lt;ref&gt;''Gardner v Beresford'' [1978] IRLR 63&lt;/ref&gt;
** criticising in front of subordinates,&lt;ref name=hilton/&gt;
** lack of support (e.g. forcing to do two peoples' jobs),&lt;ref&gt;''Seligman v McHugh'' [1979] IRLR 316&lt;/ref&gt;
** failure to notify a woman on maternity leave of a vacancy which she would have applied for if she had been made aware of it,&lt;ref&gt;''Visa International Service Association Ltd v Paul'' [2004] IRLR 42&lt;/ref&gt;
** refusal to confirm continuity on TUPE transfer,&lt;ref&gt;''Euro-Die (UK) Ltd v Skidmore'' (EAT 1158/98) (2000) IDS Brief B665/14&lt;/ref&gt;
** revealing secret complaints in a reference (even ones required by a regulator&lt;ref&gt;''TSB Bank plc v Harris'' [2000] IRLR 157&lt;/ref&gt;), or
*breaches such as:
** behaviour which is arbitrary, capricious, inequitable, intolerable or outside good industrial practice,&lt;ref&gt;''Woods v WM Car Services (Peterborough) Ltd'' [1981] ICR 666&lt;/ref&gt;
** conduct that undermined trust and confidence (i.e. offering an incentive to resign to avoid performance managing capability),&lt;ref&gt;''Billington v Michael Hunter &amp; Sons Ltd'' EAT 0578/03, IDS Brief 758&lt;/ref&gt;
** refusal to look for an alternative role due to workplace stress,&lt;ref&gt;''Thanet District Council v Websper'' EAT 1090/01, IDS Brief 728&lt;/ref&gt;
** disproportionate disciplinary penalty,&lt;ref&gt;''Stanley Cole (Wainfleet) Ltd v Sheridan'' [2003] ICR 297&lt;/ref&gt;
** employer cons employee into resigning.&lt;ref&gt;''Caledonian Mining Co Ltd v Bassett'' [1990] ICR 425&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Flexibility and mobility clauses=====
A flexibility clause does not allow the employer to change a type of job&lt;ref&gt;''Land Securities Trillium Ltd v Thornley'' [2005] IRLR 765&lt;/ref&gt; as it is implied that the flexibility is to operate within the original job.

A mobility clause is subject to the implied term of mutual trust which prevents the employer from sending an employee to the other side of the country without adequate notice or from doing anything which makes it impossible for the employee to keep his side of the bargain.&lt;ref&gt;''United Bank Ltd v Akhtar'' [1989] IRLR 507&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insufficient grounds====
There is no right to automatic pay rises.&lt;ref&gt;''Murco Petroleum Ltd v Forge'' [1987] ICR 282&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is a smoking ban a breach.&lt;ref&gt;''Dryden v Greater Glasgow Health Board'' [1992] IRLR 469&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation===
The employee's conduct is irrelevant to liability, although it can affect quantum; in other words it cannot get the employer off the hook, but could reduce compensation if he helped bring about his own downfall.

===Timing===
The conduct by the employer could be:

* a one-off serious breach of contract,
* anything to the employee's detriment (not necessarily a breach of contract) that acts as a last straw&lt;ref name=logan&gt;''Logan v Commissioners of Custom and Excise'' [2004] IRLR 63&lt;/ref&gt; after a string of serious breaches,&lt;ref&gt;''Abbey National plc v Robinson'' [2001] IDS Brief 680&lt;/ref&gt;
* a serious breach that acts as the last straw after a string of less serious breaches,&lt;ref&gt;''JV Strong &amp; Co Ltd v Hamill'' [2001] IDS Brief 684&lt;/ref&gt; or
* a string of less serious breaches related in time and nature that add up to a serious breach (random mistakes over the years are not enough – it would be more like a sustained campaign to undermine).

===Employee must resign quickly===
The employee has to resign within a reasonable time of the trigger, which is the one-off outrage or the last straw. The employee could work under protest while he or she finds a new job.&lt;ref&gt;''Jones v F Sirl &amp; Son (Furnishers) Ltd'' [1997] IRLR 493&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waiver====

If the employer alleges that the employee waived a breach by not resigning, each breach needs to be looked at to see if it was waived separately,&lt;ref name=logan/&gt; but even if a breach was waived, the last straw revives it for the purpose of determining whether overall there was a repudiation.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

====Affirmation====

If the employer alleges that the employee has affirmed a breach by not resigning, the employee could point out that no consideration was paid for it and so no contract change has been accepted. Acceptance of a replacement job would prove affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;''Bunning v GT Bunning &amp; Sons Ltd'' [2005] EWCA Civ 983&lt;/ref&gt;

An employee who stays on for a year after refusing to sign a new contract does not necessarily accept it.&lt;ref&gt;''Aparau v Iceland Frozen Foods plc'' [1996] IRLR 119&lt;/ref&gt;

====Last straw====

The last straw does not have to be similar to the earlier string of events or even unreasonable or blameworthy – it need only be related to the obligation of trust and confidence and enough that when added to the earlier events the totality is a repudiation.&lt;ref&gt;''Omilaju v Waltham Forest London Borough Council'' [2005] ICR 481&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notice period====

Although the employer's breach must be serious enough to entitle the employee to resign without notice, the employee is entitled to give notice if they prefer, so that they could enjoy the benefit of wages during the notice period.

To prevent the employer alleging that the resignation was caused by a job offer, the employee should resign first and then seek a new job during the notice period.

During the notice period, the employer could make the employee redundant&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG
|path=ukpga/1996/18/section/139
|title=Section 139(1) of the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]]
|noprefix=yes
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or summarily dismiss them, if it has the grounds to do so fairly.  Otherwise, the reason for termination will be resignation and not dismissal, since the employee cannot serve a counternotice.&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG

The '''Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs''' was a drug control treaty promulgated in [[Geneva]] on 13 July 1931 that entered into force on 9 July 1933.

== Overview ==
It established two groups of drugs.

Group I consisted of:
*Sub-group (a), which consisted of:
**[[Morphine]] and its salts, including its ester salts like [[Heroin|morphine diacetate]] (heroin) and preparations made directly from raw or medicinal [[opium]] and containing more than 20 percent of morphine;
**[[Cocaine]] and its salts, including preparations made direct from the [[coca]] leaf and containing more than 0.1 percent of cocaine, all the esters of [[ecgonine]] and their salts;
**[[Dihydrohydrooxycodeinone]] (of which the substance registered under the name of [[eucodal]] is a salt), [[dihydrocodeinone]] (of which the substance registered under the name of [[dicodide]] is a salt), [[dihydromorphinone]] (of which the substance registered under the name of [[dilaudide]] is a salt), [[acetyldihydrocodeinone]] or [[acetyldemethylodihydrothebaine]] (of which the substance registered under the name of [[acedicone]] is a salt); [[dihydromorphine]] (of which the substance registered under the name of [[paramorfan]] is a salt), their esters and the salts of any of these substances and of their esters, [[morphine-N-oxide]] (registered trade name [[genomorphine]]), also the morphine-N-oxide derivatives, and the other pentavalent nitrogen morphine derivatives.
*Sub-group (b), which consisted of:
**Ecgonine, [[thebaine]] and their salts, [[benzylmorphine]] and the other ethers of morphine and their salts, except methylmorphine ([[codeine]]), [[ethylmorphine]] and their salts.

Group II consisted of:
*Methylmorphine (codeine), ethylmorphine and their salts.

Group I was subject to stricter regulations than Group II. For instance, in estimating the amount of drugs needed for medical and scientific needs, the margin allowed for demand fluctuations was wider for Group II drugs than for Group I drugs. Also, in certain reports, a summary statement would be sufficient for matters related to Group II drugs. The establishment of these rudimentary groups foreshadowed the development of the drug scheduling system that exists today. Both the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] have schedules of controlled substances. The 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] has two tables of controlled [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]] chemicals.

The 1931 convention's scope was broadened considerably by the 1948 [[Protocol Bringing under International Control Drugs outside the Scope of the Convention of 13 July 1931 for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs]]. The Convention was superseded by the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].

== History ==
The conference was held in Geneva on or about 27 May 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Pub.Res. 71–130, {{USStat|46|1516}}, enacted 3 March 1931&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pub.Res. 71–136, {{USStat|46|1628}}, enacted 4 March 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention concerning Wages, Hours of Work on Board Ship and Manning''' (or '''Wages, Hours of Work and Manning (Sea) Convention''') is a convention of the [[International Labour Organization]] originally drafted in 1946 and revised conventions in 1949 and 1958, none of which entered into force.

==Entry into Force==
The criterion of entry into force for all three conventions required a minimum number countries acceding with a significant sea trade volume as well as requirements of the aggregate of trade volume by ratifying countries:
#ratification by ''nine countries'' from the group: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany (1958 convention only), Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan (1958 convention only), Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain (1958 convention only), Sweden, Soviet Union (1958 convention only), Turkey, United Kingdom, United States  and Yugoslavia;
#ratification from at least ''five countries'' with over one million gross register tons of shipping;
#an aggregate tonnage by ratifying countries of more than fifteen million gross register tons.

==Ratifications==
An overview of number of ratifications of the conferences is shown below. Although the number of ratifications was larger for the revised conventions, the entry into force criteria were met in none of them. The conventions were closed for signature upon the entry into force of the [[Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of Ships Convention, 1996]].

An overview of the ratifications of the conventions as of 27 May 2013 is shown below. Only the 1958 received ratifications from the list of countries of which 9 were required to ratify. Six such ratifications were received (Yugoslavia also ratified, but is depicted in the list as its successor states). Denouncements of the convention were a result of the entry into force of the Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of Ships Convention, 1996 for those countries.  Also ratification of the [[Maritime Labour Convention]] results -after it enters into force on 20 August 2013- in denouncement of the conventions.

The '''Crown of Ireland Act 1542'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Short title]] as conferred in [[Northern Ireland]] by the [[Short Titles Act (Northern Ireland) 1951]]; the Act lacks a short title in the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] (33 Hen. 8 c. 1) which created the title of [[King of Ireland]] for King [[Henry VIII of England]] and his successors, who previously ruled the island as [[Lord of Ireland]].

The [[long title]] of the Act was "An Act that the King of England, his Heirs and Successors, be Kings of Ireland". Among the 18th-century [[Irish Patriot Party]] it was called the '''Act of Annexation'''.&lt;ref name="Grattan1822"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grattan|first=Henry|title=The Speeches of the Right Honourable Henry Grattan in the Irish, and in the Imperial Parliament |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdU9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=22 February 2016|year=1822|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown|page=114|chapter=Regency: Feb. 11, 1789|quote=The act of Henry VIII., commonly called the act of annexation, proves and ascertains what the member's arguments would deny, the existence, properties, and prerogatives of the Irish crown. |volume=II}}; {{cite book|title=A Review of Mr. Grattan's Answer to the Earl of Clare's Speech |url=http://opac.oireachtas.ie/Data/Library3/Library3/DCT081003.pdf#page=6|volume=Part the first|year=1800|publisher=J. Milliken|location=Dublin|page=6|quote=What by a bold flight of imperialism we now denominate the Act of Annexation, (33d Hen. VIII. c. 1.) was in truth no more than an alteration in the Royal style.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
One of the earlier Christian overkingdoms, the [[Holy See]] of Rome, in 1171 abolished the [[High King of Ireland|High Kingship of Ireland]] ([[Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid|of 9th-century origin]], successor to the [[Kingship of Tara]]) and devalued the ancient [[Kingdoms of Ireland]].

Under a [[Laudabiliter|Papal Bull]], the ancient realm was disestablished and turned into a feudal Province of the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Secretariat of State]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] under the [[State (polity)|temporal power]] of the monarch of [[Kingdom of England|England]] who henceforth held the title [[Lord of Ireland]], relinquishing to the Papacy annual the tribute levied upon the nobility and people of Ireland.

The Act was passed in the [[Parliament of Ireland]], meeting in [[Dublin]], on 18 June 1541, being read out to parliament in English and [[Irish language|Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Moody, T. W.|title=A New History of Ireland. '''8''': A Chronology of Irish History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-19-821744-2|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developments in the 16th century==
The secession of various European rulers during the [[Protestant Reformation]], including Henry VIII, inspired the [[Papacy]] to initiate the [[Counter-Reformation]]. One consequence of this was that the Papacy required all Roman Catholic rulers to consider [[Protestant]] rulers (and their loyal subjects) as [[heresy|heretics]], thus making their realms illegitimate under customary Roman Catholic international law.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  Consequently, the title "King of Ireland" was not initially recognised by Europe's Catholic monarchs and the Papacy. Instead, they remained committed in considering Ireland a feudal fief of the Papacy, to be granted to any Catholic sovereign who managed to secure the island Kingdom from the control of its Protestant monarchs.

After the death of Henry VIII's only legitimate son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], the throne passed to his oldest daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], who was a devout Roman Catholic. Mary shortly thereafter married [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], who was also staunchly Catholic.  The new monarch restored papal authority in both England and Ireland. However, the status of Ireland as a kingdom remained in question: would the Papacy recognise Ireland's existence as a kingdom in its own right or maintain some fiction of temporal papal power in the land? To rectify this, [[Pope Paul IV]] issued a [[papal bull]] in 1555, ''{{lang|la|Ilius, per quem Reges regnant}}'', recognising Philip and Mary as King and Queen of England and its dominions including Ireland. Although this did not explicitly recognise Ireland as a kingdom, it represents the surrender of most of the Papacy's declared authority over Ireland, elevating it from a mere province of the Holy See to one that united Ireland's and England's crowns in one person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/ireland_docs.htm#act1542|title=Crown of Ireland Act 1542|work=Heraldica|date=25 July 2003|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary died without issue in 1558, and the thrones of England and Ireland passed to her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], who was a Protestant. Once again, both kingdoms were removed from papal authority. In reply, [[Pope Pius V]] issued a papal bull in 1570, ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'', declaring "Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime" to be a heretic and releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her and excommunicating any that obeyed her orders.

==Subsequent developments==

Over the course of the next two centuries, the Papacy and Europe's Catholic rulers continued to recognise Ireland as a Kingdom in its own right, whilst at the same time asserting its Protestant monarchy as illegitimate. Simultaneously, they would incite Catholic rebellion to Protestants in the island as a means of recovering Ireland to a Catholic sovereign, preceding the establishment of a Catholic sovereign on the English and Scottish thrones. In reply, British diplomacy concentrated on receiving the recognition of the sovereignty of Ireland from Catholic Europe in the hope of thereby ending future Catholic sovereign incitements of the larger Catholic peasantry and securing the western flank of Great Britain from Catholic invasion. 

Until 1801, Ireland continued to exist as a Kingdom in its own right, with its own Parliament. The government of Ireland, however, remained in English hands even after [[Constitution of 1782|Grattan's constitution]] came into effect in the 1780s. Most of the country's population remained Catholic, but its Protestant minority remained socially, politically, and economically dominant; and even many Protestants were excluded from power as not being members of the [[Established church|established]] [[Church of Ireland]]. The [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] preserving the position of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] began to be dismantled in the 1780s and 1790s. However, fear of revolutionary violence in the wake of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and subsequent republican [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] led the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] government to seek the [[Acts of Union 1800|union of Ireland with Great Britain]]; this resulted in the formation of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].

==The 20th century==
As a result of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] that ended the [[Irish War of Independence]], Ireland left the United Kingdom in 1922 and became the [[Irish Free State]], a mostly self-governing [[Dominion]] that still retained the British monarch as its head of state. Shortly thereafter, the six north-eastern counties ([[Northern Ireland]]) seceded from the Free State and rejoined the United Kingdom, but with [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|their own parliament]] and system of government. Despite these fundamental changes, the 16th-century Act remained unamended on the statute books. 

From a British perspective, the Irish Free State became legislatively independent with the passage in the British parliament of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. However, the Irish Free State considered itself legislatively independent before its passage and did not recognize its legal situation as being changed. The country thereafter shared the person of its monarch with the United Kingdom and the other [[Dominion]]s of the then-called [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]].

The Irish Free State adopted a [[Constitution of Ireland|new constitution in 1937]], although the [[Monarchy of Ireland|Irish monarchy]] was not abolished in UK law until the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]]. The Tudor Act remained on the republic's statute books until formally repealed in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act 1962]], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0029/sec0001.html section 1] and [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1962/en/act/pub/0029/sched1.html Schedule].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The act today==
{{As of|2017}}, Northern Ireland remains a constituent part of the United Kingdom; the Henrician Act remains law there. However, the offence in the act making it treason to endanger the sovereign or her possession of [[the Crown]] now carries only a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, following the completion of the abolition of [[capital punishment in the United Kingdom]] in 1998.

'''Database forensics''' is a branch of [[digital forensics|digital forensic science]] relating to the forensic study of [[databases]] and their related metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olivier|first=Martin S.|title=On metadata context in Database Forensics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7CW4-4TSD9G6-1/2/a5031117d753054d92f2afba332eadf8|publisher=Science Direct|accessdate=2 August 2010|doi=10.1016/j.diin.2008.10.001|date=March 2009|volume=5|journal=Digital Investigation|pages=115–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline is similar to [[computer forensics]], following the normal forensic process and applying investigative techniques to database contents and metadata. Cached information may also exist in a servers [[RAM]] requiring [[Digital forensics#live analysis|live analysis]] techniques.

A forensic examination of a database may relate to the timestamps that apply to the update time of a row in a relational table being inspected and tested for validity in order to verify the actions of a database user.  Alternatively, a forensic examination may focus on identifying transactions within a database system or application that indicate evidence of wrongdoing, such as fraud.

Software tools can be used to manipulate and analyse data. These tools also provide audit logging capabilities which provide documented proof of what tasks or analysis a forensic examiner performed on the database.

Currently many database software tools are in general not reliable and precise enough to be used for forensic work as demonstrated in the first paper published on database forensics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giac.org/certified_professionals/practicals/gcfa/0159.php Oracle Database Forensics using LogMiner - GIAC Certified Student Practical&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
There is currently a single book published in this field,&lt;ref&gt;Oracle Forensics {{ISBN|0-9776715-2-6}} (May 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; though more are destined.&lt;ref&gt;Oracle Forensics Using Quisix {{ISBN|0-470-19118-X}} (Dec 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally there is a subsequent SQL Server forensics book by Kevvie Fowler named SQL Server Forensics which is well regarded also.&lt;ref&gt;SQL Server Forensics  {{ISBN|0-321-54436-6}} (Dec 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The forensic study of relational databases requires a knowledge of the standard used to encode data on the computer disk. A documentation of standards used to encode information in well-known brands of DB such as SQL Server and Oracle has been contributed to the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/forensics/1906.php SANS Institute - Forensic Analysis of a SQL Server 2005 Database Server&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.databasesecurity.com/oracle-forensics.htm Oracle Forensics and Incident Response - databasesecurity.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908135737/http://www.databasesecurity.com/oracle-forensics.htm |date=September 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include [[Apex Analytix]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/triad/stories/2004/01/05/story3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the forensic analysis of a database is not executed in isolation, the technological framework within which a subject database exists is crucial to understanding and resolving questions of data authenticity and integrity especially as it relates to database users.

'''''Davie v Magistrates of Edinburgh''''' 1953 S.C. 34. encapsulates the [[Scots law]] position regarding the role of [[expert witness]]es in providing their opinion to the court in [[Criminal procedure|criminal]] and [[civil procedure|civil proceedings]].

==Case==
In ''Davie v Magistrates of Edinburgh'', an expert witness, gave evidence concerning the effect of [[Shock wave|shock waves]] in blasting operations and referred to a specific section of a [[pamphlet]] that allegedly supported his opinion. The [[Court of Session]] disproved of the Lord Ordinary's action of adopting other parts of the pamphlet that the expert had not made reference to.

:" The Court cannot...rely upon such works for the purpose of displacing or criticising the witness's testimony." - at 41.

==Law==
[[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]] [[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|Cooper]] stated that "their duty is to furnish the [[judge]] or [[jury]] with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of their conclusions, so as to enable the Judge or jury to form their own independent judgment by the application of these criteria to the facts proved in evidence." Therefore, an expert witness should only offer their opinion as to the facts that have already been established in [[court]], and "should not hinder the trier of fact's duty by telling them how to assess the evidence that they have heard". The weight to be given to the evidence provided by the expert witness is a matter for the judge (in civil, or summary criminal proceedings) or jury (in solemn criminal proceedings) alone.

The court also stated that "expert witnesses are only required in order that certain facts can be assessed and understood in their specialist/scientific context".

Moreover, in this case it was held that "in some situations, the scientific knowledge that an expert witness claims to have must be proved in court", such as in "Hewat v Edinburgh Corporation" 1974 S.C. 30. This is to prevent false claims of credentials that may affect the reliability of the opinion advanced by the expert witness.

As a result of this case, only the extracts of any literature relied upon by an expert witness whilst giving their [[testimony]] may be used against them to challenge their opinion. The remainder of any texts/journals is not admissible and thus cannot be relied upon by the expert or any other party to the proceedings.

'''Digital Addressable Lighting Interface''' ('''DALI''') is a trademark for network-based systems that control [[lighting]] in [[building automation]]. The underlying technology was established by a consortium of lighting equipment manufacturers as a successor for [[0-10 V lighting control|{{nowrap|0-10 V}} lighting control]] systems, and as an [[open standard]] alternative to [[Digital Signal Interface]] (DSI), on which it is based.

DALI is specified by technical standards '''IEC 62386''' and [[IEC 60929]]. Standards conformance ensures that equipment from different manufacturers will interoperate. The DALI trademark is allowed on devices that comply with the current standards when manufactured.

Members of the AG DALI (founded by Philips lighting in 1984) were freely allowed to use the DALI trademark until DALI working party was dissolved on 30th March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dali-ag.org/about-us.html|title=DALI - a working party of ZVEI|last=|first=|date=2017-03-30|website=www.dali-ag.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 9th June 2017, [[Digital Illumination Interface Alliance]] (DiiA) certifies DALI equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalilluminationinterface.org/data/downloadables/2/4/diia-acquires-dali-trademarks.pdf|title=DiiA acquires DALI trademarks|last=|first=|date=2017-06-09|website=Digital Illumination Interface Alliance - IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiiA is a Partner Program of [[IEEE-ISTO]].

==Technical overview==
A DALI network consists of a controller, a power supply (which may be built into the controller) and one or more slave devices (e.g., [[electrical ballast]]s, LED drivers and [[dimmer]]s) that have DALI interfaces. The controller can monitor and control each device by means of a bi-directional data exchange. The DALI protocol permits devices to be individually addressed and it also allows multiple devices to be addressed simultaneously via [[multicast]] and broadcast messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.siemens.com/bt/file?soi=A6V10209534 |title = Communication in building automation |publisher = Siemens Building Technologies |year = 2013 |website = Siemens Building Technologies |accessdate=12 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each device is assigned a unique static address in the numeric range 0 to 63, making possible up to 64 devices in a basic system. Addresses may be arbitrarily assigned and need not be contiguous. DALI [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] can be used to implement systems that have more than 64 devices. Data is transferred between controller and devices by means of an asynchronous, half-duplex, serial protocol over a two-wire bus, with a fixed data transfer rate of {{nowrap|1200 [[Bit rate|bit/s]]}}.

A single pair of wires comprise the [[Bus (computing)|bus]] used for communication to all devices on a DALI network. The network can be arranged in a bus or star [[network topology|topology]], or a combination of these. DALI is not classified as [[SELV]] (Separated Extra Low Voltage) and therefore its wiring may be run next to mains cables or within a multi-core cable which includes mains power. Data is transmitted using high voltages ({{val|0|4.5|u=V}} for "0" and {{val|16|6.5|u=V}} for "1"{{r|da|p=19}}) enabling reliable communications in the presence of significant electrical noise.

The bus is used for both signal and power.  A power supply provides 250&amp;nbsp;mA at 24&amp;nbsp;V DC; each device may draw up to 2&amp;nbsp;mA.{{r|da|p=20,35}}  While many devices are line-powered, low-power devices such as motion detectors may be powered directly from the DALI bus.  Each device has a [[bridge rectifier]] on its input so it is polarity-insensitive.  The bus is a [[wired-AND]] configuration where signals are sent by briefly shorting the bus to a low voltage level.

The bus is also defined to be polarity-insensitive, allowing DALI wires can be connected to a device without regard for polarity (the voltage specification allows plenty of headroom for a [[bridge rectifier]] in each slave), and the speed is kept low so no [[Electrical termination|termination resistors]] are required.&lt;ref name=da&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dali-ag.org/c/manual_gb.pdf |title=Digital Addressable Lighting Interface |publisher=DALI AG,  Activity Group, ZVEI-Division Luminaires |website=DALI |date=September 2001 |accessdate=12 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627012349/http://www.dali-ag.org/c/manual_gb.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|21}}

The network cable is required to be mains-rated, with {{nowrap|600 V}} isolation and a maximum drop of {{nowrap|2 volts}} along the cable.{{r|da|p=19}}  (The required cable size depends on the length of the bus, up to a maximum of 300&amp;nbsp;m with {{val|1.5|u=mm2}} (15.4&amp;nbsp;[[AWG]]) conductors.)

Each bit is sent [[Manchester code]]d (half a bit time of the data bit, followed by half a bit time of its complement), so that power is present for half of each bit time.  When the bus is idle, it is high voltage all the time, which is not the same as a "0" or a "1" data bit.  Frames begin with a "0" [[start bit]], then 8 to 16 data bits in msbit-first order (standard [[RS-232]] is lsbit-first), followed by a minimum two bit times of idle.

Each device on a DALI network can be individually addressed, unlike DSI and 0–10V devices. Consequently, DALI networks use fewer wires than DSI or 0–10V systems.

Some devices (e.g., HF ballasts) are mains powered, and only have functional isolation between the mains and the DALI control. This means that even though the DALI control cable operates at ELV potential, it must be treated as if it were at mains potential.

DALI lighting levels are specified by an 8-bit value, where 0 means off, 1 means 0.1% of full brightness, 254 means full brightness, and other values are [[logarithmic scale|logarithmically interpolated]] between, giving a 2.77% increase per step.  That is, a (non-zero) control byte {{mvar|x}} denotes a power level of {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;3(''x''−254)/253&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

==Device addressing==
A DALI device, such as a HF fluorescent ballast, can be controlled individually via its short address. In addition to this method of control, DALI devices can be arranged into groups in which all devices of the same Group can interact with each other. For example, a room with 4 ballasts can be changed from off to on in three common ways:

===Single device===
Using the Short Address, e.g. sending the following DALI messages:

* DALI Short Address 1 go to 100%
* DALI Short Address 2 go to 100%
* DALI Short Address 3 go to 100%
* DALI Short Address 4 go to 100%
This method has the advantage of not relying on the limited number of scenes available in each ballast, or having programmed each ballast with the required group numbers and scene information. The fade rate of the transition can be chosen on the fly.
This method can have an undesirable side effect called "Mexican Wave" when a single large room such as an auditorium contains many ballasts, due to network latency of the comparatively slow 1200 baud rate of DALI. For example, a transition from all on to all off may result in a visible delay between the first and last ballasts switching off. This issue is normally not a problem in rooms with smaller numbers of ballasts.

===Device groups===
Using the DALI Group previously defined for the ballasts in the room, e.g.:
* DALI Group address 1 go to 100%

This method has the advantage of being immune to the “Mexican Wave” effect as described above.
This method has the disadvantage of requiring each ballast to be programmed with the required group numbers and scene information, and has a fixed fade rate which is pre set at the time of commissioning.

===Broadcast===
Using the DALI Broadcast command all, every ballasts will change to that level, e.g.:
* DALI Broadcast go to 50%

==Brightness control==
The DALI protocol provides 254 levels of brightness between off and 100%. The brightness is translated to a ballast power level via a logarithmic dimming curve that matches [[Human eye#Dynamic range|eye sensitivity]] so that perceived brightness steps will have uniform brightness change, and to achieve a uniform brightness between units from different manufacturers.&lt;!--p21--&gt;&lt;ref name=da/&gt;

'''Diplomatic capital''' refers to the trust, goodwill, and influence which a [[diplomat]], or a state represented by its diplomats, has within [[international diplomacy]]. According to political scientist Rebecca Adler-Nissen, diplomatic capital is a kind of [[currency]] that can be traded in [[Diplomacy#Negotiations|diplomatic negotiations]] and that is increased when positive ″social competences, reputation and personal authority" are portrayed.&lt;ref name="czulda-madej-p156"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Czulda|author2=Marek Madej|title=Newcomers No More?

== Accumulation and loss ==
Diplomatic capital can be accumulated for example by economic cooperation&lt;ref name="sato-limaye-2006-p200"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yoichiro Sato|author2=Satu Limaye|title=Japan in a Dynamic Asia: Coping with the New Security Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeNuAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200|date=25 May 2006|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-5669-8|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by contributions to the solution of [[International crisis|international crises]],&lt;ref name="brodsky-rein-2012-p278"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adriana Brodsky|author2=Raanan Rein|title=The New Jewish Argentina: Facets of Jewish Experiences in the Southern Cone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTkyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA278|date=28 September 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-23728-5|pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is strengthened when in other countries the sentiment prevails that the interests of a state or the diplomats representing it are aligned with their own interests. Conversely, it can be squandered when a country engages in a confrontation, an armed conflict or a war, if that is perceived as unjust or at odds with the interests of others.&lt;ref name="kiesling-2006-p277"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Brady Kiesling|title=Diplomacy Lessons: Realism for an Unloved Superpower|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dY6MlrWbLeUC&amp;pg=PA277|year=2006|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59797-017-4|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bow-lennox-2008-p73"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brian J.

Diplomatic capital is also linked to the extent of enforcement of [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="o'flaherty-etal-2011-p7"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael O'Flaherty|author2=Zdzislaw Kedzia|author3=Amrei Müller|author4=George Ulrich|title=Human Rights Diplomacy: Contemporary Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5g8bJoZ252gC&amp;pg=PR7|date=28 October 2011|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-04-19516-5|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Freedom and the Law''''' is Italian jurist and philosopher [[Bruno Leoni]]'s most popular work. It was first published in 1961 and the 3rd edition is now made widely available through the Internet by the Online Library of Liberty [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=920], with permission of the [[George Mason University]].

In this book, Leoni contended that the greatest obstacle to the [[Rule of Law]] is the problem of overlegislation. Leoni also pointed to a parallelism between the market and [[common law]] on the one hand, and [[socialism]] and [[legislation]] on the other.

Through a review of [[Roman Law|Roman doctrine and jurisprudence]], Leoni shows that the Romans thought of [[Law]] as a process of discovery instead as of a set of enacted orders, and that the popular confusion between law and [[legislation]] is contemporary to our era and the advent of socialism.

'''George Osborne Sayles''' (21 April 1901 &amp;ndash; 28 February 1994), better known as '''G. O. Sayles''', was an [[English people|English]] [[historian]] best known for his work on the medieval English law courts and the early [[Parliament of England|English Parliaments]].

==Early life==
He attended [[Ilkeston Grammar School]]. He studied at the [[University of Glasgow]] and then [[University College London]].

==Career==
{{cquote| G.O. Sayles was an outstandingly original and productive historian whose publications over more than 60 years radically changed understanding of the medieval British parliament and advanced very considerably knowledge of the medieval English law courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-g-o-sayles-1429459.html ''The Independent'',  Mar 16, 1994  by A. L. Brown]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During his lifetime he held the following positions: Assistant in History, Glasgow University 1924-25, Lecturer 1925-34, Senior Lecturer 1934-45; Professor of Modern History, [[Queen's University Belfast]] 1945-53; Burnett-Fletcher Professor of History, [[University of Aberdeen]] 1953-62; Vice-President, Selden Society 1954-86; FBA 1962; Kenan Professor of History, New York University 1967-68.

His most important works were ''The King's Parliament of England'' and his work on the translation of the ''[[Fleta]]''.

His longtime writing partner was Henry Gerald Richardson.

==Personal life==
In 1936 he married Agnes Sutherland, from [[Glasgow]]. They had a son (Michael) and daughter (Hilary).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14001">'''Gregor von Rezzori'''{{needs IPA}} (May 13, 1914 – April 23, 1998), born '''Gregor Arnulph Hilarius d'Arezzo''', was an Austrian-born, Romanian,  [[German language|German-language]] [[novelist]], [[memoir]]ist, [[screenwriter]] and author of [[radio play]]s, as well as an actor, journalist, visual artist, art critic and art collector. He was fluent in German, [[Romanian language|Romanian]], Italian, [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], French, and English; during his life, von Rezzori was successively a citizen of [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Romania]], and the [[Soviet Union]], before becoming a [[stateless person]] and spending his final years as a citizen of Austria. He married Beatrice Monti della Corte.

==Biography==
Gregor von Rezzori was born in [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]], [[Bukovina]], part of Austria-Hungary at the time (1914). He originated from a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] aristocratic family from the [[Province of Ragusa]] who had settled in [[Vienna]] by the mid-18th century. His father was an Austrian [[civil service|civil servant]] based in Czernowitz. The family remained in the region after it became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] in 1919, and the young Gregor von Rezzori became a Romanian citizen.

After [[World War I]] von Rezzori studied in colleges in [[Braşov]], [[Fürstenfeld]] and Vienna. He began studying mining at the [[University of Leoben]], then architecture and medicine at the [[University of Vienna]], where he eventually graduated in arts.

In mid-1930 he moved to [[Bucharest]], took up military service in the [[Romanian Army]], and made a living as an artist. In 1938 he moved to [[Berlin]], where he became active as a novelist, journalist, writer in radio broadcasting, and film production. Given his Romanian citizenship, von Rezzori was not drafted by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] authorities during [[World War II]].

Until the mid-1950s, he worked as an author at the broadcasting company [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]]. He regularly published novels and stories, as well as working in film production as a screenplay author and actor (starring alongside actors such as [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Anna Karina]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]] or [[Charles Aznavour]]). Beginning in the early 1960s, Rezzori lived between [[Rome]] and [[Paris]], with sojourns in the United States, eventually settling in [[Tuscany]].

Besides authoring and performing, he and his spouse Beatrice Monti della Corte were significant art collectors, and together founded the Santa Maddalena Retreat for Writers. He died in Santa Maddalena, part of [[Florence]]'s Donnini ''[[frazione]]''.

==Literary works==
Rezzori began his career as a writer of light novels, but he first encountered success in 1953 with the ''Maghrebinian Tales'', a suite of droll stories and anecdotes from an imaginary land called "Maghrebinia", which reunited in a grotesque and parodic key traits of his multicultural Bukovinian birthplace, of extinct Austria-Hungary and of Bucharest of his youth. Over the years, Rezzori published further ''Maghrebinian Tales'', which increased his reputation of language virtuosity and free spirit, writing with wit, insight and elegance.&lt;ref&gt;Killy, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;

Other books, such as ''The Death of My Brother Abel'', ''Oedipus at Stalingrad'', or ''The Snows of Yesteryear'', recording the fading world at the time of the World Wars, have been celebrated for their powerful descriptive prose, nuance and style.&lt;ref name="Kraft"&gt;Kraft, p.1027–1029&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Rezzori first came to the attention of English-speaking readers with the 1969 publication of the story "Memoirs of an [[Antisemitism|Anti-Semite]]," in ''The New Yorker.''  On this occasion, [[Elie Wiesel]], who was born in Bukovina's neighboring [[Maramureş (historical region)|Maramureş]], wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Rezzori addresses the major problems of our time, and his voice echoes with the disturbing and wonderful magic of a true storyteller."&lt;ref&gt;Wiesel, in ''MIT Tech Talk''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though not often heralded as the man behind the quote, it was his controversial "The only convincing love story of our century", attributed simply to "Vanity Fair", the magazine which published in English his original review of the book, that adorned the cover of the Second Vintage International edition of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita.&lt;ref&gt;A Stranger in Lolitaland. An Essay", 1993, Vanity Fair&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Guide for Idiots through German Society'', von Rezzori also used his noted taste for satire. Although he was not unanimously perceived as a major author in the German-speaking area, his posthumous reception has arguably confirmed him among the most important modern German-language authors.&lt;ref name="Kraft"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19826">The '''Groveland Four''' (or the '''Groveland Boys''') were four young African-American men, Earnest Thomas, Charles Greenlee (then a minor at age 16), Samuel Shepherd and [[Walter Irvin]], who in 1949 were accused of raping a 17-year-old white woman and assaulting her husband in [[Lake County, Florida]].

Thomas fled and was killed by a posse several days later and 200 miles away; Greenlee, Shepherd and Irvin were arrested. They were beaten in jail to coerce confessions, but Irvin did not confess. The three survivors were convicted at trial by an [[all-white jury]]. Greenlee was sentenced to life because he was only 16 at the time of the crime; the other two were sentenced to death. In 1951 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ordered a retrial after hearing appeals by the latter two men, led by [[Thurgood Marshall]] of the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]]. It ruled they had not received a fair trial because of excessive adverse publicity and because blacks had been excluded from the jury.

In November 1951, Sheriff [[Willis McCall]] shot both Shepherd and Irvin while they were in his custody, saying they had tried to escape while he was transporting them from the state jail at Railford back to the county seat of [[Tavares, Florida]], for the new trial. Shepherd died on the spot; Irvin survived his wounds and later told [[FBI]] investigators that the sheriff had shot them in cold blood and that his deputy Yates had also shot him in an attempt to finish him off. 

At the second trial, Irvin was again convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. In 1955 his sentence was commuted to life by recently elected Governor [[Leroy Collins]]. In 1968 Irvin was paroled. He died in February 1969 in Lake County.

In 2016 the City of Groveland and Lake County each apologized to survivors of the four men for the injustice against them. The four were posthumously exonerated on April 18, 2017, by a resolution of the [[Florida House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="Exoneration2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/04/19/were-truly-sorry-after-68-years-florida-apologizes-for-racist-history-of-groveland-four/ |title=‘We’re truly sorry’: Fla. apologizes for racial injustice of 1949 ‘Groveland Four’ rape case |first=Katie |last=Mettler |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state senate quickly passed a similar resolution, and lawmakers called on Florida Governor [[Rick Scott]] to officially pardon the men.&lt;!-- Did he? --&gt;

==Background==
*Charles L. Greenlee (b. 4 June 1933, Florida),&lt;ref name="ssdi"/&gt; was the son of Thomas H. and Emma Greenlee, who were born in Georgia and Alabama, respectively.&lt;ref name="1945FLcensus"&gt;[Ancestry.com.

In 1945 Charles and four of his siblings were all in school.&lt;ref name="1945FLcensus"/&gt; Greenlee had come to Groveland in July 1949 looking for work, as he was already married and his wife was pregnant.&lt;ref name="mettler"/&gt;  

*Walter Lee Irvin (b. 8 May 1927, [[Gainesville, Florida]]), was living in Groveland when he registered for the draft in May 1945. He listed his mother Ellia Irvin as next of kin. He was working at the time for Apshawa Groves. He was recorded as 5'3" and weighing 105 pounds, and was described in his registration as "light brown", with brown eyes and black hair.&lt;ref name="draft"&gt;[https://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=YMDraftCardsWWII&amp;h=12581603&amp;indiv=try&amp;o_vc=Record:OtherRecord&amp;rhSource=60525 "Walter Lee Irvin", in U.S. WWII Draft Cards Young Men, 1940-1947], Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the Army, leaving with the rank of private. 

*Samuel Shepherd (b. 7 April 1927) was born in [[Fitzgerald, Georgia]]&lt;ref name="draftSS"/&gt; to Henry Shepherd and his wife Charlie M (Robinson) Shepherd, both of Georgia.

*Earnest (also spelled as Ernest) Thomas (b. Florida), was married by July 1949 and living and working near Groveland. He had encouraged Greenlee to come there because of jobs related to the citrus groves.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;
 
After returning to Groveland following their military service, Shepherd and Irvin both continued to wear their uniforms. They were proud of their service, which some of the local whites resented. Sheriff Willis McCall was known for supporting segregation, and keeping a strong hold on workers and against union organizing. He was part of ensuring there was a ready supply of low-wage workers to man the orange groves. Shepherd could work with his father, and Irvin was determined to find an alternative to the orange groves.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

==Events==
{{main article|Groveland Case}}

Norma Padgett, a 17-year-old white woman, and her husband Willie, said that on July 16, 1949, they had been attacked by four young black men in [[Groveland, Florida]], who stopped where the couple's car had stalled. Norma said she was taken away and raped, and Willie said he had been assaulted. Ernest Thomas, Charles Greenlee, age 16; Samuel Shepherd, age 22, and [[Walter Irvin]], age 22, were identified by the police as suspects. Shepherd and Irvin were both veterans of service in the Army; and both Thomas and Greenlee were married. 

Irvin and Shepherd were arrested shortly after Padgett complained of the attack. The police took the men in their patrol car to a secluded spot and ordered them out of the car. Both men were beaten by police with blackjacks and fists and kicked as they lay crumpled on the ground, while being asked if they had picked up a white girl. Afterward, they were taken to the spot where the crime happened. Deputy Yates inspected Shepherd’s shoes, which he had worn the night before. Yates was frustrated to see that the soles did not match footprints in the ground at the scene. Irvin’s were the same, but Irvin admitted that he was wearing a different pair of shoes. The two men were taken to Tavares jail, where they were interrogated in the basement while cuffed to overhead pipes and severely beaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/harrymoore/terror/irvin.html|title=PBS - Freedom Never Dies: The Story of Harry T. Moore - Florida Terror - Groveland - Irvin's Statement Page 1|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Greenlee was a 16-year-old who had come from Gainesville and was trying to find work with his friend Ernest Thomas. Thomas had convinced Greenlee that there were plenty of jobs in Groveland. Greenlee was waiting at a rail depot to meet Thomas when he was arrested and brought to the police station under suspicion. 

Greenlee was interrogated and beaten in a cell that night until he admitted to the rape of Norma Padgett. Thomas escaped capture and fled Lake County the following morning. Greenlee admitted to having been with Thomas. 

Police learned where the latter lived and where he was hiding, as they found a letter in his letterbox addressed to his wife. Lake County Sheriff [[Willis McCall]] appointed a posse that tracked Thomas down days later, {{convert|200|mi}} away in [[Madison County, Florida]]. He was shot and killed; officers reported that Thomas was armed and reached for his weapon. 

The [[NAACP]] later said that the posse had never intended to arrest Thomas, but to kill him. According to the coroner's inquest, Lake County Sheriff McCall was at the scene when Thomas was shot. The coroner’s jury determined that Thomas had been lawfully killed and ruled his death a justifiable homicide.&lt;ref name="King2012"&gt;{{cite book|title=Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America|first=|date=6 March 2012|publisher=HarperCollins|year=|isbn=978-0-06-209771-2|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Gilbert King}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2018}}

==Trial==
The NAACP helped with the men's defense, hiring Orlando attorney [[Franklin Williams (diplomat)|Franklin Williams]]. After interviewing the three surviving suspects, Williams said each had independently stated that he was beaten by Lake County deputies. Shepherd and Greenlee both told [[FBI]] agents that they confessed to raping Padgett in order to stop the beatings. Irvin never confessed and maintained his innocence. 

Williams documented the visible evidence of their injuries.&lt;!-- When did he see them? --&gt;Shepherd’s injuries included scars on head, broken teeth, tooth puncture of upper lip, lash scars across back and chest, and scars on the wrist, which supported Shepherd’s claim that he had been cuffed to a metal pipe. Irvin had similar injuries: body scars, wide bruises, lash marks, scars across wrists, and an apparently fractured jaw. Greenlee’s injuries included a red and bruised left eye, scars on the right cheekbone and around the neck and groin, swollen testicles, and numerous cuts on his feet.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Thurgood Marshall]], the lead lawyer of the NAACP, pressed the Justice Department and the FBI to initiate a civil rights and domestic violence investigation into the beatings. Marshall convinced the Justice Department that the beatings violated the men's rights, and the FBI dispatched agents to investigate. The FBI later concluded that Lake County deputies James Yates and Leroy Campbell had violated the Groveland men's civil rights and urged U.S. Attorney [[Herbert Phillips]] of Florida to prosecute, but a grand jury did not return indictments of the deputies.&lt;ref name="King2012" /&gt;

Likely fearing that a higher court would reverse any guilty verdicts, the prosecution never introduced the coerced confessions as evidence into the trial. 

There is much uncertainty about whether Padgett was raped. The prosecution did not question Dr. Geoffrey, the physician who examined her, on the stand. Judge Truman Futch did not permit the defense to call the doctor as a witness. According to his records, Geoffrey could not tell whether she had been raped. He found no evidence of tears or wounds in the vagina other than the lacerations mentioned above.&lt;!-- Where? not part of this article --&gt;Laboratory analysis of a vaginal smear revealed no [[spermatozoa]] present in the vagina, nor any organisms resembling [[gonococci]], which could have been other evidence of sex. There were no other gross signs of bruises, breaks in the skin or other signs of violence.&lt;ref name="King2012" /&gt; 

Shepherd and Irvin said that they had been together drinking in [[Eatonville, Florida]], the night of the alleged attack. Greenlee said he was nowhere near the other defendants on that night and that he had never met Shepherd and Irvin before. 

The defense accused Sheriff McCall's deputies of manufacturing evidence to win a conviction. All three men were convicted by the [[all-white jury]]. Shepherd and Irvin were sentenced to death, and Greenlee was sentenced to life, as he was a minor. 

==Appeals and shootings==
The NAACP took on assisting the defense in appeals. In 1951 Marshall led the defense in an appeals hearing for Irvin and Shepherd at the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. It overturned the convictions of both men based on adverse pre-trial publicity, and remanded the case to the lower court for a new trial. (Greenlee had not appealed his sentence of life imprisonment.)

McCall was transporting Shepherd and Irvin from [[Union Correctional Institution|Raiford State Prison]] back to the Lake County jail in Tavares when he claimed to have a flat tire. Alone with the two handcuffed prisoners, McCall pulled down a dirt road to inspect the tire, outside Umatilla, Florida, north of Tavares. He claimed that Shepherd asked to relieve himself, and when the two prisoners, cuffed together, got out of the car, they attacked McCall. He drew his pistol and shot at them. The shooting took place on a dark country road outside the town. He shot each prisoner three times. Shepherd was killed instantly, and Irvin survived by playing dead.&lt;ref name="King2012" /&gt;

The following morning, Irvin told FBI agents and reporters at the hospital where he was taken for treatment that the shooting was unprovoked. He said McCall had shot him and Shepherd in cold blood, staging the scene to make it look like an escape attempt. Irvin shocked reporters by saying that Lake County Deputy James Yates had joined McCall at the scene, saw that Irvin was still breathing, and fired one last shot through Irvin's neck. Irvin survived. The FBI later found a bullet buried in the ground beneath Irvin's blood spot that appeared to support his account of the shooting.&lt;ref name="King2012" /&gt; A nail found in the front wheel of McCall’s car appeared to have caused his claimed "tire trouble" that night. McCall said that he had no idea how the nail got there, but the FBI believed that it had been placed there.&lt;ref name="King2012" /&gt; 

An all-white coroner's jury, made up of many of McCall's friends, took half an hour to find Shepherd’s death justified. They concluded that McCall had been acting in line of duty and in self-defense. McCall was cleared of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="King2012" /&gt; (At this time, most blacks had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] by state laws since the turn of the 20th century. They therefore were excluded from any juries in the state, as they were not on any voter rolls).

==Irvin's second trial==
After recovering from his shooting wounds, Irvin was tried again after refusing a deal from the prosecutor and Governor [[Fuller Warren]] that would have spared him from a death sentence if he pleaded guilty. His defense counsel, [[Thurgood Marshall]], gained a change of venue to [[Marion County, Florida]], because of the extensive and adverse publicity around the case in Lake County. Marshall led the defense team from the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]]. Irvin was found guilty. Judge Futch, who was again presiding, sentenced him to death.&lt;ref name="King2012" /&gt; 

After [[LeRoy Collins]] was elected governor in 1954, questions were raised to him about Irvin's case, because he was considered moderate. He reviewed it and in 1955 commuted Irvin's sentence to life in prison, stating that neither trial proved conclusively that Irvin was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref name="King2012" /&gt; Irvin was paroled in 1968; he died in February 1969 in Lake County.&lt;ref&gt;[https://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=floridadeath&amp;h=1325646&amp;indiv=try&amp;o_vc=Record:OtherRecord&amp;rhSource=2238 "Walter Lee Irvin", Ancestry.com.

Greenlee was paroled from prison in 1962. He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] with his wife and their daughter Carole, born in 1950. (His wife was pregnant when he was arrested.) They had a son, Thomas, in 1965.&lt;ref name="mettler"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/04/19/were-truly-sorry-after-68-years-florida-apologizes-for-racist-history-of-groveland-four/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.a036e8769d6d Katie Mettler, "‘We’re truly sorry’: Fla. apologizes for racial injustice of 1949 ‘Groveland Four’ rape case"], ''Washington Post'', 19 April 2017; accessed 13 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Greenlee died on April 18, 2012.&lt;ref name="ssdi"&gt;[https://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&amp;dbid=3693&amp;h=92136463&amp;tid=&amp;pid=&amp;usePUB=true&amp;_phsrc=IAO482&amp;_phstart=successSource  "Charles L Greenlee", in U.S., Social Security Death Index, 1935-2014], Ancestry.com; accessed 13 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apologies and exoneration==
In 2016, both the city of Groveland and government of Lake County offered posthumous apologies to each of the Groveland Four and their families, and began lobbying state lawmakers to do the same. On Tuesday, April 18, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution sponsored by State Representative Bobby DuBose apologizing to the families of the Groveland Four, some of whose members were in attendance, and exonerating the men. The Florida State Senate passed an identical resolution sponsored by Senator Gary Farmer on April 27, 2017. The resolutions also called on Governor Rick Scott to expedite the process for granting posthumous pardons.&lt;ref name="Exoneration2017" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24401">Created on July 8, 1992 by the Helsinki Summit Meeting of the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (CSCE), now known as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the '''High Commissioner on National Minorities''' (HCNM) is charged with identifying and seeking early resolution of ethnic tension that might endanger peace, stability or friendly relations between and within the participating states of the OSCE. The HCNM focuses on the OSCE area and will alert the Organisation where a situation has the potential to develop into a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Mandate, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107878. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The Organisation consists of 57 participating States across North America, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE Participating States, at http://www.osce.org/states. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the HCNM is generally considered to be a “success story”&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 111&lt;/ref&gt; and a useful instrument of conflict prevention.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The creation of the office of HCNM was directly related to the political circumstances at the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 15&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yugoslav Wars]] were ethnic conflicts that broke out after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and of Communism, and which eventually resulted in the break up of the country. Efforts of the CSCE, [[European Union]] and [[United Nations]] failed to bring peace. The frustration at being unable to prevent such a devastating human tragedy led to the Netherlands government proposing the post of the HCNM.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 16&lt;/ref&gt; This office would aim to prevent conflicts based on tensions with ethnic minorities. In regards to the Yugoslav tragedy, international efforts were deemed to have failed because of the limited knowledge of the international mediators of the ethnic situation.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 17&lt;/ref&gt; This often meant that tensions escalated because the international community did not fully understand the issues at play. Further, any international aid that was provided came too late. It was recognised that such tensions should be identified and addressed as early as possible in order to prevent escalation into endless conflict. The Yugoslav conflict also made clear that many conflicts around the world were rooted in tensions involving national minorities. It was against this background that the proposal for the office of the HCNM was presented.

===Opposition to the proposal===

Many concerns were raised in regards to the model put forward by the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 17&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, several major restrictions to the HCNM’s role were implemented into the mandate.

States disagreed on whether the rights of national minorities were individual or group rights. Ultimately, there was a clear exclusion of individual cases through paragraph 5(c) of the HCNM mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 5(c), at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibits the High Commissioner from considering “violations of CSCE commitments with regard to an individual person belonging to a national minority”. Many states feared that the HCNM would become a sort of "[[ombudsman]]" for national minorities. The aim of the office was not to create a new human rights instrument, but to create a conflict prevention tool.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 18&lt;/ref&gt; This was emphasised in the title of the office: the High Commissioner ''on'' National Minorities, not ''for'' National Minorities.

Many states were also highly opposed to involvement by the HCNM in cases of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 19&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the HCNM was prohibited from considering ‘national minority issues in situations involving organized acts of terrorism’.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 5(b), at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; The international community further decided that the HCNM should not be able to ‘communicate with and (...) acknowledge communications from any person or organization which practices or publicly condones terrorism or violence’.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 25, at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances this clause has become a way for states to ban the HCNM from interfering with their minority problems.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambiguity in the mandate===
The HCNM’s mandate as defined at the Helsinki Summit meeting in 1992 contained many ambiguities, the most significant of which is the definition of “national minorities”. No clear guidance was given in the mandate on how to interpret this term. This was largely because  the CSCE participating states could not come to an agreement on the definition of "national minorities", and therefore opted to provide no definition at all.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The first High Commissioner, [[Max van der Stoel]], focused on clarifying and defining his mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 21&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by consulting many experts on minority rights and international law, and thereby developing a set of guidelines and practices for overcoming the ambiguities in the mandate. Through the broadly defined mandate, he was able to approach the role in the best way he saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 22&lt;/ref&gt; The approach taken by van der Stoel came to define how his successors approached the role too. His definition of “national minorities” had three different elements.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 29&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, a national minority could be distinguished from the rest of society through linguistic, ethnic or cultural characteristics. Secondly, that minority strived to protect and strengthen those characteristics which made up its identity. Finally, he referenced paragraph 32 of the 1990 CSCE Copenhagen Document,&lt;ref&gt;Confoerence for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE’ 1990, paragraph 32, at http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/14304?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasised that being a part of a national minority was a person’s individual choice.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 29&lt;/ref&gt; In the approach taken by van der Stoel and his successors, there is no requirement that a national minority be a numerical minority in the population.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 29&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases a national minority will be a majority in certain countries or regions.

==Function==
The main role of the HCNM is to identify and address tensions involving national minorities which could develop into a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This involves “early warning” of potential conflict followed by “early action” to dissolve tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 3, at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate authorises the HCNM to assess ‘the role of the parties directly concerned, the nature of the tensions and recent developments therein and, where possible, the potential consequences for peace and stability within the OSCE area’.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 11(b), at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; Her most important role is not necessarily to completely resolve all potential conflicts, but rather to manage them in a way that the tension between groups does not escalate but declines.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 17&lt;/ref&gt; This involves mediation as well as the introduction of sustainable solutions.

Ultimately, the role of the High Commissioner is one of preventative diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 26&lt;/ref&gt; She must provide early warnings of escalating tensions as well as early action to prevent any further escalation. Tensions between different societal groups can arise over a variety of elements, such as ethnicity, religion, or language.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Conflict prevention and resolution, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/117648. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The HCNM works to sort through these tensions and towards social cohesion, before those tensions escalate into conflicts. The first HCNM, Max van der Stoel, noted that the HCNM should aim to prevent disputes from arising into armed conflicts, but should also understand that in some cases the situation may go beyond the realm of preventative diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 27&lt;/ref&gt; Where conflicts can only be resolved in the long term, a more comprehensive approach must be taken. This may result in the High Commissioner issuing an early warning notice to the Permanent Council, alongside a request for the OSCE to issue her an ‘ad hoc’ mandate for late prevention of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 113 CHECK&lt;/ref&gt; An early warning notice under paragraph 15 of the mandate has only been issued once before, in regards to the 1999 Kosovo crisis.&lt;ref&gt;CHECK Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to promote social cohesion, the HCNM must provide advice and take actions that are context specific. Significant research should be undertaken about the specific society and ethnic groups involved in order to effectively respond to the situation. Van der Stoel always prepared extensively for any state involvement, often by organising a one- or two-day workshop with leading experts in several relevant areas.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15  at 21&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this approach arose due to the failures of the international community during the Yugoslav Wars, where a lack of understanding about the ethnic situation by international mediators often led to a worsening of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The work undertaken by the High Commissioners since the inception of the role is considered to have been largely successful.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 75&lt;/ref&gt; The role requires expertise, tools and experience in monitoring situations of potential tension, as well as in recognising signs of escalation.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 64&lt;/ref&gt; Such knowledge and skill is invaluable in regards to conflict prevention involving minorities, because these situations are often very precarious and complex. No inter-ethnic tension is alike, and each will involve different factors and historical and cultural influences. There is therefore a clear need for a dedicated office specialised in and focused on minority issues.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods used in conflict prevention===

The HCNM employs several different techniques in order to achieve her purpose of conflict prevention.  The High Commissioner works very closely with the particular state involved and with the leaders of the relevant parties. While the HCNM ultimately cannot enforce any compulsory action, there are many ways that the HCNM can assist the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Commissioner will assist in preventing an escalating conflict by introducing a minimum standard of minority rights, which should be upheld by the state and other majority actors. She may also assist in implementing those standards and helping them become the norm in that state. There are seven sets of thematic recommendations that can provide a platform for better inter-ethnic relations and help to reduce tension. These include recommendations on education, linguistic rights, participation, kin-states, policing in multi-ethnic societies, minority languages in broadcast media, and integration and conflict prevention.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 65&lt;/ref&gt; The HCNM frequently recommends that states take measures to protect minority languages, as this is one of the major causes of inter-ethnic tension.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Minority and majority languages, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107883. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; However, the OSCE and HCNM also promote a policy of integration, which strives for a balance between protection of minority culture and the development of an overarching common identity. This involves integration policies such as encouragement to learn the state language.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, F. (2010) ''Integration as Conflict Prevention: Possibilities and Limitations in the experience of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Security and Human Rights, 21(3) 220 at 221&lt;/ref&gt; The High Commissioner also promotes education of national minority languages and religious practices as a way to prevent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Education and conflict prevention, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107882. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This is a way to foster an appreciation of diversity among communities and also to dissolve stereotypes about certain ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Education and conflict prevention, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107882. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The HCNM will also focus on improving communication between the parties involved, including leaders of the state and leaders of the opposing national groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 113&lt;/ref&gt; This involves assisting processes of negotiations and ensuring participation by all relevant parties. When creating the role, it was recognised that the most frequent cause of hostile inter-ethnic relations was insufficient or distorted communication.&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 115&lt;/ref&gt; The HCNM plays an important role in setting up lines of effective communication before hostile relations begin to develop.

In order to develop a peaceful society the High Commissioner strives to ensure that all minority groups are sufficiently involved in public life, and are fairly represented at national, regional and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Promoting effective participation in public life, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107884. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; By ensuring that minority groups are involved in decision-making processes and that they enjoy some level of influence, states can prevent these groups from becoming marginalised. Active and effective participation also provides remedies for groups who feel their rights are being violated, and in doing so can prevent such groups from seeking remedies in a more violent manner.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, all governments may exercise a right of refusal against participation of the High Commissioner, and may prevent her from entering the country. In such a circumstance, the HCNM is to inform the OSCE.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 28, at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in Ukraine==

The first HCNM, Max van der Stoel, was involved with inter-ethnic tensions in [[Ukraine]] between a substantial Russian minority and the Ukraine government from 1994 to 2001. His work during this time was considered largely successful in reducing tensions and building towards peaceful solutions. This conflict was multi layered and emphasised the importance of finding durable solutions in the search for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 389&lt;/ref&gt; Following the disintegration of the [[USSR]] and [[Ukrainian independence]] in 1991, tensions began to arise as Ukraine sought to establish its identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 391&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, these uneasy relations were caused by historical Russian domination over Ukraine, as well as the prevalence of Russian language in Ukrainian life. While the HCNM was not the only influential actor in managing and resolving these issues, he played a critical role in establishing movement towards peace.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 393&lt;/ref&gt;

The flexibility of the HCNM’s mandate and the nature of the role allowed van der Stoel to become involved in the tensions in Ukraine at a very early stage. He was able to craft a tactful and creative approach to dealing with the precarious issues that had arisen at that stage.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 392&lt;/ref&gt; The success of his work there is in large part credited to his ability to build a relationship of trust with the parties involved and to approach all issues from the basis of impartiality.

The HCNM was invited to Ukraine by the government in February 1994. In Ukraine at that time there were several minority issues that were causing tension. The HCNM  was involved in managing the relations between the Russian minority and the Ukrainian majority, the status of [[Crimea]] within Ukraine, and resettlement of the [[Crimean Tatars]].&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 393&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, descent into violent conflict was prevented in all areas. However, while the HCNM’s work was largely successful, it also exposed the limitations of the role. The Ukrainian government was unwilling to implement the majority of his recommendations, even though it was consistently willing to engage with the HCNM.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 393&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while the HCNM ultimately played a critical role in conflict prevention in Ukraine, his ability to secure a sustainable solution across all areas of tension was often limited.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 394&lt;/ref&gt;

Catchpole was an [[indentured servant]] in the  [[colony]] of [[Maryland]],   arriving there by boat  from the [[The Protectorate|Commonwealth of England]] in January 1656. Upon her arrival she was [[Indictment|accused]] of several  [[crime]]s, resulting in a [[Trial (law)|trial]] on September 22, 1656 in the General Provincial Court in [[Patuxent County, Maryland]]. This trial was   the first  to have an all-female [[jury]] in  colonial Maryland and one of the earliest in colonial America.&lt;ref name="jrnak"&gt;{{cite web

==Circumstances==
Catchpole was accused of [[murder]]ing her child and of other bizarre acts, by William Bramhall, a fellow passenger on the ship "Mary and Francis" and similarly an [[indentured servant]],  who had died after making the accusations.  He had accused her of killing her child, cutting the throat of a female passenger while the woman was asleep, and [[stabbing]] a [[Sailor|seaman]] in the back. Before he died he made known his accusations to other passengers, stating that Catchpole had committed these acts while the other passengers were asleep.  No other passengers substantiated these accusations, nor could any account for how Catchpole had hidden a [[pregnancy]] during the voyage and given [[birth]] on a small ship without others seeing evidence of this.&lt;ref name="jrnak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crime"/&gt;  Catchpole claimed she had never been pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=2007-11-14 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was decided that an all-female jury was needed because the issues of pregnancy and birth required female [[expertise]]. Composed of seven married women and four single women, the trial was ordered by the General Provincial Court at Patuxent for  September 22, 1656.&lt;ref name="maryland"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to determine if Catchpole had murdered her own infant, the jury was to inspect Catchpole's body to find [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that  she had been pregnant and given birth to a child.  The jury  inspected Catchpole's body and concluded that she had not recently given birth. Other [[witness]]es gave [[testimony]] that the man making the accusations was "not in sound mind".&lt;ref name="crime"&gt;{{cite book

Additional [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay evidence]] was presented that the male accuser had spoken of [[witchcraft]] and told other bizarre stories. He had said  that after slitting the woman's throat, she sewed it back up before the woman awoke, and that she rubbed grease on the back of the fatally wounded seaman and he came back to life.&lt;ref name="jrnak"/&gt; 

The jury gave little credence to the charges of witchcraft, and seeing no evidence of childbirth, acquitted Catchpole of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Significance==
Judith Catchpole was tried before the first all-woman jury to serve in colonial Maryland.&lt;ref name="maryland"/&gt; The judicial practices of [[common law]] in colonial America often arose from the need to accommodate to practical situations. In the case of Judith Catchpole, the expertise of women was needed to decide whether she had been pregnant and given birth to a child. In general however, women were not allowed to serve on juries in the [[United States]], even after the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] was passed in 1920 giving women the right to vote.&lt;ref name="jrnak"/&gt;

'''Legislation on Hunting with Dogs''' is in place in many countries around the world. Legislation may regulate, or in some cases prohibit the use of dogs to hunt or flush wild animal species.

==History==
The use of scenthounds to track prey dates back to Assyrian, Babylonian and Egyptian times and in England, hunting with Agassaei hounds was popular before the Romans.&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|date=2005-02-18 |title=Ten things you didn't know about hunting with hounds | last = Aslam | first =D| url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/18/hunting.immigrationpolicy2|accessdate=2007-11-03 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more modern times, hunting regulation has been encouraged by the [[animal welfare]] and [[animal rights]] movements out of concern for [[wildlife management]] and alleged [[cruelty to animals|cruelty]].

==France==
NEEDS COMPLETING PLEASE DO IT

==Germany==
Hunting with hounds was banned in Germany by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s government in 1934, before which hunting laws varied from state to state. Hounds were used to pursue deer, wild boar, hares and foxes.

[[Hermann Göring]] had a passion for shooting game and appointed himself Hunting Master of the Reich (Reichsjaegermeister) soon after the Nazis gained power in 1933. He decided that more order was needed and introduced sweeping legislative changes which were enforced throughout the Reich. The Hunting Law ("Reichsjagdgesetz") of 1934 was closely modelled on the Prussian "Tier- und Pflanzenschutzverordnung" of 16 December 1929.

Hitler's cabinet was told about the hunting regulation at a meeting on July 3, 1934 - the same day that the Fuhrer reported on the ruthless killing of Stormtrooper "conspirators" in the "Night of the Long Knives", according to an official Nazi biography published four years later. Hitler was a self-declared vegetarian and hated hunting (see [[Adolf Hitler and vegetarianism]]).

The ban on hunting with hounds was unpopular with the aristocracy, many of whom hunted with hounds on horseback. [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] (1859-1941), the grandson of [[Queen Victoria]], who was a keen hunter of the wild boar was powerless to stop the changes as he had abdicated and fled the country in 1918. The remaining upper classes were unable to oppose the totalitarian regime. The Nazi-era ban on hunting with hounds was passed and remains in force to this day. 

Shooting game remained legal though regulated. The Act included a promise of laws that were designed to give the shooting fraternity a privileged position in the new Reich. The idea was to give every (shooting) hunter his own personal shoot after "the Third Reich's glorious victory over Europe".

== United Kingdom ==

=== England and Wales ===
Hunting of wild mammals in the traditional style is banned by the [[Hunting Act 2004]]. Earlier acts, such as the [[Protection of Animals Act 1911]], the [[Protection of Badgers Act 1992]] and the [[Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996]] contained specific exemptions for hunting activities.

=== Scotland ===
{{Main|Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002}}
In February 2002 the [[Scottish Parliament]] voted by eighty three to thirty six to pass legislation to ban hunting with hounds. [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]s decided not to give compensation to those whose livelihoods or businesses might suffer as a result of the ban. The Act came into effect on August 1, 2002. An article in the [https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1300189,00.html Guardian] on 9 September 2004 reports that of the ten Scottish hunts, nine survived the ban, using the permitted exemption allowing them to use packs of hounds to flush foxes to guns.

A number of convictions have taken place under the Act, two for people hunting foxes and ten for [[hare coursing]]. The only prosecution of a traditional mounted hunt led to a not guilty verdict, but to a clarification of the law, with the sheriff saying that the activity of flushing foxes to guns "will require to be accompanied by realistic and one would expect, effective arrangements for the shooting of pest species. The use of what might be termed "token guns" or what was described by the Crown as paying lip service to the legislation is not available ... as a justification for the continuation of what was referred to in the evidence before me as traditional foxhunting." [http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/ADAMS.html]

Currently fox hunting takes place in Scotland as described in the [http://www.scotsman.com/news/environment/scottish-packs-accused-of-flouting-fox-hunting-ban-1-3783782 Scotsman's] article. There are eleven [[List of foxhound packs of the United Kingdom#Scotland|hunts]] in Scotland where the rules are more relaxed&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30940176&lt;/ref&gt; The continuation of the stricter laws in England and Wales has been guaranteed by the Scottish National Party.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33519258&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently no planned legislation to tighten the rules on the Scottish hunts giving the Scottish industry the advantage &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/Bills.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/576.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Ireland ===
Fox hunting in [[Northern Ireland]] would have been banned had the [[Michael Foster (Worcester MP)|Foster]] Bill become law. However, by the time of subsequent hunting legislation in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] had been established and the hunting issue had been devolved to that body. A Hunting Bill was introduced into the Northern Ireland Assembly but [https://web.archive.org/web/20110812043357/http://bailys.iwweb5.co.uk/story-413_Northern-Ireland-Assembly-rejects-Hunting-Bill.php rejected] in December 2010.

==United States==
In the United States federal system, the agency primarily responsible for wildlife management is the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], a division of the [[United States Department of the Interior]], a [[United States Cabinet|cabinet-level]] division, whose director reports directly to the president. Within these federal guidelines, most hunting regulation for non-migratory species rests within wildlife or agricultural departments at the [[U.S. state|state level]]. With fifty different states, this lends itself to a wide variety of diversity, especially for an activity such as [[fox hunting]]. Much more common than organised fox hunting is the hunting (usually by private individuals) of [[raccoon]]s (''Ursus lotor'') with [[coonhound]]s, and where such hunting is practised, the two are often regulated similarly due to the method (which involves tracking or active pursuit by dogs).

The red fox is protected in every state in which it is present (all except [[Hawaii]]), in contrast to its status as [[vermin]] in the UK. It is variously classified as a furbearer, small game or predator in state hunting and trapping regulations. The open and closed hunting seasons for fox (both red and gray) also vary by state. Pursuit of red fox while in possession of a firearm requires a [[hunting license]] (or in some cases a trapping license) in all states, and is generally restricted to a specific season (typically the winter months).  In some states (such as [[Florida]]) it is illegal to chase fox with dogs while in possession of a firearm, although it is legal to chase them otherwise.

In some western states the [[coyote]] is an unprotected species, and there are no restrictions on the methods used in hunting them.  In these areas Hunt Clubs often pursue coyote instead of fox.

'''MSG Western New York''' (MSG WNY) is an [[United States|American]] [[regional sports network]] that is a joint venture between [[MSG Networks]] and [[Pegula Sports and Entertainment]]. The channel (also on occasion credited as ''Pegula Sports Network'' or ''MSG Buffalo'') is a sub-feed of [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]], with programming oriented towards the [[Western New York]] region, including coverage of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Buffalo Sabres]] and the [[National Football League]]'s [[Buffalo Bills]]. It replaced MSG Network on television providers in the Sabres' media market in 2016.

MSG Western New York is available on [[cable television|cable]] providers throughout Western New York. Most programming is available nationwide on [[direct broadcast satellite|satellite]] via [[DirecTV]], with Sabres games requiring an [[NHL Center Ice]] subscription for out of market viewers; select programs are carried in Canada's [[Niagara Peninsula]] on a special channel set up for [[Bell TV]] subscribers that was founded in 2013.

After the collapse of [[Empire Sports Network]] and its parent [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adelphia adds NFL Net|url=https://variety.com/2005/tv/news/adelphia-adds-nfl-net-1117918998/|author=John Dempsey|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=March 6, 2005|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSG bought the rights to the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in 2006 under a 10-year deal; where telecasts are controlled by the team via the [[Sabres Hockey Network]], including the sale of advertising, and the simulcast of [[Rick Jeanneret]]'s commentary on both radio and television (although, during the 2015-16 season, the team experimented with having separate commentary teams on radio and television for selected games, which the ''[[Buffalo News]]'' speculated was in preparation for Jeanneret's eventual retirement), conditions that the Sabres always make as part of their telecast deals going back to the days of Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabres.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=437214|title=Sabres Extend MSG Contract|date=September 1, 2006|work=Buffalo Sabres|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bn-rsnmaybe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabres in strong negotiation position as TV, radio deals near end|url=http://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2016/01/07/sabres-in-strong-negotiation-position-as-tv-radio-deals-near-end/|website=Buffalo News|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After acquiring the rights, MSG divided its network into three regional broadcast "zones"; Sabres games were available within "Zone 3", which covered Buffalo and Rochester, and "Zone 2", the remainder of the state excluding Buffalo, Rochester, and New York City—which was shared by the Sabres, Devils, Islanders, and Rangers. The exact channel assignment for Sabres games varied by region (some games were carried by [[MSG Plus|FSN New York]] in Zone 2), but all games were carried on the main MSG Network service within Zone 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2005-2006 NHL Telecast Schedule|url=https://www.nhl.com/sabres/news/2005-2006-nhl-telecast-schedule/c-436903|website=Buffalo Sabres official website|publisher=NHL, [[MLB Advanced Media]]|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buffalo Sabres 2005-2006 NHL Telecast Schedule|url=http://cdn.nhl.com/sabres/bc/images/buffalo_pages/pdf/SabresTVSchedule.pdf|publisher=Buffalo Sabres|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buffalo Sabres' regional television [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are among the highest in the league; in the 2015-16 season, despite the team's poor overall performance, fan enthusiasm over star prospect [[Jack Eichel]] helped the team achieve the highest average regional viewership of all NHL teams for the first time since 2008-09, with a 6.55 share.&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"/&gt; National telecasts on [[NBC]] and [[NBCSN]] have also had notably high ratings in Buffalo.&lt;ref name="sbj-sabresratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabres end Penguins’ reign atop RSN ratings|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2016/04/18/Media/NHL-RSNs.aspx|website=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bn-nbcratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Buffalo is No. 1 market for hockey ratings despite 35 percent drop in year|url=http://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2015/04/14/buffalo-is-no-1-market-for-hockey-ratings-despite-40-percent-drop-in-year/|website=Buffalo News|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was speculated that Pegula Sports and Entertainment, which had recently bought the Sabres, [[Rochester Americans]], [[Buffalo Bandits]] and [[Buffalo Bills]], was planning to take advantage of the high viewership by establishing a team-owned regional sports network once the Sabres' existing television contract with MSG expired. The ''Buffalo News''{{'}}s Alan Pergament also acknowledged the impending end of the Sabres and Bills' radio contracts with [[WGR]] as a possibility that the group could, potentially, acquire a radio station to serve as a team-owned radio outlet if it is unable to renew its contract with [[Entercom]] (Entercom had purchased the Sabres' previous owned-and-operated station, 107.7 [[WLKK|WNSA]], in 2004, and merged its remaining programming onto WGR). Pegula eventually secured a contract extension with Entercom keeping the Bills and Sabres on WGR through the spring of 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2016/09/09/entercom-buffalo-to-keep-broadcasting-bills-sabres.html|last=Fink|first=James|work=Business First|date=September 9, 2016|accessdate=September 9, 2016|title=Entercom Buffalo to keep broadcasting Bills, Sabres on radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in regards to television, he felt that it was more likely for Pegula to partner with MSG to form a full-time, Buffalo-specific feed of MSG Network with additional local programming, rather than actually establishing a new, standalone outlet.&lt;ref name="bn-rsnmaybe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dbtb-empire2point0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are the Pegulas hiring for their own regional sports network?|url=http://www.diebytheblade.com/2016/6/15/11943104/are-pegulas-hiring-for-western-new-york-regional-sports-network|website=Die By The Blade (SB Nation)|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|width=200px|"Basically, what we have done is create our own platform, which is stronger because we already have the distribution on MSG, we have the benefit of MSG programming on there and the benefit of the platform of producing as much programming as we feel comfortable."|author = Mark Preisler&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"/&gt;}}

On June 20, 2016, Pegula announced that it had entered into a joint venture with MSG to establish a new service known as MSG Western New York. The channel, a sub-feed of MSG Network took over the former MSG Zone 3/Sabres game only channel, replacing the parent channel within the Sabres existing television market—which was also, notably, expanded to include the entirety of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].&lt;ref name="bn-12opinion"/&gt; The arrangement allows Pegula access to MSG's existing distribution and statewide programming, while allowing opt-outs for an expanded slate of local programming dedicated to the Bills and Sabres, which is produced and controlled by Pegula. MSG as part of the agreement pays $19 to $20 million per-year in rights fees to broadcast Sabres games and programming, as well as Buffalo Bills programming; it is nearly double the value of the previous Sabres deal. As with the previous deal, Pegula controls team programming on the network, including advertising sales and production (which is handled through PSE's production wing PicSix Creative), and receives all advertising revenue, while MSG collects the [[retransmission consent]] fee. Besides original programming and broadcasts exclusive to MSG WNY, the network also carries selected programming from the main MSG Network channel.&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pergament|first=Alan|title=Wide-ranging deal will keep Sabres – and other Pegula Sports &amp; Entertainment content – on MSG|url=http://sabres.buffalonews.com/2016/06/20/wide-ranging-deal-will-keep-sabres-and-other-pegula-sports-entertainment-content-on-msg/|accessdate=June 22, 2016|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pegula's executive vice president of media and content Mark Preisler explained that the deal was an alternative to establishing a new regional sports network from scratch, as the company would be able to expand on its relationship with MSG as a long-standing partner by leveraging its infrastructure and distribution, rather than needing to invest in building a network and negotiating carriage with television providers.&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbf-wny"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fink|first=James|title=Pegula Sports and Entertainment, MSG Networks seal new, long-term deal|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/blog/morning_roundup/2016/06/pegula-sports-and-entertainment-msg-networks-seal.html|accessdate=June 22, 2016|work=Buffalo Business First|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first promos seen for the channel ran during a Bills preseason game against the [[Indianapolis Colts]] on August 13, 2016 promoting its Bills programming. The channel debuted on September 10, 2016 at 8:00pm with a Western New York cut in showing the 2016 debut of ''The Rex Ryan Show'' and a special behind the scenes feature called ''Rex and Rob Reunited'' at 8:30 and 9pm, the daily feed followed on October 3.&lt;ref&gt;http://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2016/09/07/bills-preseason-rating-drop-25-percent-in-a-year-dedes-and-wilcots-call-opener-at-baltimore/&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2017, news broke that [[James L. Dolan]], controlling owner of MSG, was exploring the sale of his regional sports networks, including his share of MSG Western New York.&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2017/04/03/msg-networks-is-looking-to-sell/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
The network carries team programming related to the Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills; the former including all 70 regional Sabres games and the latter including local Bills shows formerly aired by [[WKBW-TV]]; preseason telecasts began to be simulcast with WKBW beginning in 2017. In addition, the channel simulcasts ''The Instigators'' (formerly known as ''Sabres Hockey Hotline'')&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhl.com/sabres/news/the-instigators-premieres-tuesday-on-wgr-550-and-msg/c-282245416&lt;/ref&gt; and ''One Bills Live'' (formerly known as ''The John Murphy Show'') from [[WGR]] radio as part of a five-hour weekday block, originating from studios (dubbed the ''One Buffalo studios'') at [[New Era Field]]; Murphy's program was moved from the evening to the afternoon and had a co-host added. As an aspect of the overall deal, PSE agreed in principle to extend its radio rights with WGR.

MSG Western New York added a package of five [[Rochester Americans]] contests beginning in December 2016, moving the team's television broadcasts to MSG WNY from the moribund [[Spectrum Sports (New York)|Time Warner Cable Sports Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amerks.com/article/AMERKS%20ANNOUNCE%202016-17%20TELEVISION%20SCHEDULE&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7, 2017, it was announced that the channel would begin airing select [[Monsignor Martin Athletic Association]] high school football games produced by Pegula as part of a multi-year deal, including a three-game showcase at New Era FIeld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buffalonews.com/2017/09/07/pegula-sports-entertainment-set-air-series-monsignor-martin-football-games/ Pegula Sports and Entertainment set to air series of Monsignor Martin football games].

In 2018, MSG-produced Bills preseason telecasts moved to the stations of [[Nexstar Media Group]] in all media markets outside Buffalo. As the Bills could not break their existing contract with WKBW in Buffalo, the rights in that city will not change until 2020, when Nexstar-owned [[WIVB-TV]] will begin carrying the games.&lt;ref&gt;https://buffalonews.com/2018/08/02/fred-jackson-to-join-bills-post-game-show-catalana-replaced-on-sidelines/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carriage==

===Cable television===
Both of the two primary cable providers in Western New York, [[Spectrum (cable service)|Spectrum]] (formerly [[Time Warner Cable]], which covers the vast majority of the state) and [[Atlantic Broadband]] (which covers a small portion of [[Cattaraugus County]]) have carried the network from its inception.

===DirecTV===
On August 10, 2016, the debut night of MSG Western New York it was revealed that [[DirecTV]] would not be running the network's full programming schedule.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/chellegz/status/774717839764848640?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; The Sabres noted that MSG made the programming available to DirecTV but the provider was not willing to carry it.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/BuffaloSabres/status/783311474345316353?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; This made MSG WNY a part-time channel on DirecTV with the provider continuing to air the channel as a game only service showing Sabres games only. For the [[2017 NFL season]], DirecTV began showing ''Bills All Acesss'' and irregularly showing the first runs of ''The Sean McDermott Show'' and ''Bills Tonight'' in addition to the Sabres games that the channel airs. A week later DirecTV began showing ''The Instigators'' and ''The John Murphy Show''. DirecTV happens to be the service that Pegula owned properties like 716 Food and Sport, a sports bar and grill in downtown Buffalo use.

===Dish Network===
MSG Western New York, like [[MSG (TV network)|MSG]] and [[MSG Plus]], is unavailable on [[Dish Network]]. As part of an ongoing feud with the family of [[Charles Dolan]] (owners of MSG), Dish has not carried any MSG network channel since the last agreement expired on October 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/article207853.ece|title=Dish NEtwork Drops MSG|date=2010-10-01|work=Buffalo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Over-the-top services===
[[FuboTV]] added the MSG networks for the fall 2017 season.&lt;ref name=broadcastingcable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/distribution/fubotv-adds-msg-networks/168908 |title=fuboTV Adds MSG Networks |website= broadcastingcable.com |date=2017-09-26 |accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic legislation of the Maryland Office of the Public Defender==
On March 4, 1971, Maryland Senate President William James introduced Senate Bill 454 to the 1971 session of the Maryland General Assembly. Senate Bill 454 was:

&lt;sup&gt;AN ACT to add a new Article 27A to the Annotated Code of Maryland (1971 Replacement Volume), to follow immediately after Article 27 thereof, and to be under a new title "Public Defender, "to provide for and authorize the creation of a Public Defender System for the State of Maryland so as to assure effective assistance and continuity of counsel and related services to [[indigent]] accused persons taken into custody and to indigent [[defendant]]s in criminal, juvenile, appellate, post conviction and other proceedings instituted before the Courts of the State of Maryland; and relating generally to the public defender system and to its workings and operations and the duties of certain persons in relation thereto.&lt;ref name="CHAPTER 209 (Senate Bill 454)"&gt;{{cite web|title=General Assembly January 13, 1971 - April 12, 1971Session Laws|url=http://aomol.msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000707/html/am707--485.html|publisher=Maryland Archives|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;

On April 3, 1971, Senate Bill 454 received a 33–3 vote by the Maryland Senate, and on April 10, 1971, it received a 78–39 vote by the Maryland House of Delegates. On April 28, 1971, Governor Martin Mantel (June 7, 1972 – June 6, 1973) approved Senate Bill 454. Subsequently, Section 3 of Article 27A took effect in the Annotated Code of Maryland on July 1, 1971, and the remainder of Article 27A went into effect on January 1, 1972.

== Section 3 of Article 27A ==

Section 3 of Article 27A went into effect as the first stage of law concerning the Office of the Public Defender for Maryland. It decreed that the Office of the Public Defender is part of Maryland’s Executive Branch of government, and provided that a Public Defender shall be appointed head of the Office by the Board of Trustees. Furthermore, it stated that the public defender shall seek the approval of the board of trustees per the appointment of a deputy director, and likewise with the appointment of district public defenders for each of the twelve districts. Section 3 follows that the Public Defender shall seek the advice of district public defenders in the course of appointing assistant public defenders for a respective district.

Pursuant Section 3 of Article 27, to be qualified as Public Defender, a person must be an [[attorney-at-law]], having been admitted to practice law in the State of Maryland by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, by which he or she has been engaged in the practice of law for at least five years prior to appointment. A person seeking appointment to deputy public defender must satisfy the same criteria. Assistant public defenders are qualified for appointment after establishment that he or she is an attorney-at-law as confirmed by admittance to practice law in the State of Maryland by the Court of Appeals of Maryland.

The remainder of Section 3, Article 27A pertains to the Public Defender’s use of the budget in that it shall provide suitable offices within the state with at least one office in each district, and that all employees including personnel such as investigators, [[stenographer]]s, clerical assistants and other staff shall be provided a salary appropriated by the executive budget for the Office of the Public Defender.

== Repeal of Article 27A ==

At the time when Article 27A was enacted, it followed immediately after Article 27 of the Annotated Code, which is titled: “Crimes and Punishments”. On the first day of the 2008 Regular Session of the [[Maryland General Assembly]] (January 9, 2008 to April 7, 2008), Senate Bill 37 was introduced and subsequently on April 8, 2008, Article 27A (sections 1-14) was repealed in entirety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of the State of Maryland Enacted|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc5300/sc5339/000113/017000/017809/unrestricted/20131821e-001.pdf|work=Maryland State Archives|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and underwent a code revision as “Chapter 15, Acts of 2008, Criminal Procedure Article, Title 16. Office of the Public Defender”, which is codified in the most current version (red books) of the Maryland Annotated Code. 
The 2008 code revision of Article 27A was a milestone in a forty-year effort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Modern Code Revision Began in Maryland|url=http://dls.state.md.us/Content.aspx?page=78|work=General Assembly of Maryland Department of Legislative Services|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to revise the Maryland Annotated Code. “Chapter 15, Acts of 2008, Criminal Procedure Article, Title 16. Office of the Public Defender” was part of the revision process that won't end until every articles in the black books (cited by an article and section number) undergo a transition to the new red books (cited by article name and number) of the Maryland Annotated Code.

==Chapters 223 &amp; 224, Acts of 2010; Code Criminal Procedure Article, Title 16 (sections 16-101 through 16-213)==
The purpose of Senate Bill 97, which was introduced in the 2010 Maryland General Assembly Session (January 13, 2010 – April 12, 2010), was to implement substantive changes to Chapter 15, Acts of 2008, Criminal Procedure Article, Title 16 (2008 code revision).

Senate Bill 97 was signed by Governor Martin O’Malley on May 4, 2010 (as chapter 223) and became effective on June 1, 2010. It affected sections 16-203 “Office Personnel” and 16-301 “Board of Trustees". House Bill 122 was identical to Senate Bill 97, and it was signed (as chapter 224) and went into effect on the same days as Senate Bill 97. The third substantive change to Chapter 15, Acts of 2008, Criminal Procedure Article, Title 16 began with House Bill 121 which was signed on May 1, 2010 (as chapter 393) and went into effect June 1, 2010. It affected section 16-210 “Eligibility for Service”.

== Funding ==

The Maryland Office of the Public Defender (OPD) is an independent agency of the Executive Branch of Maryland. In 2017, the OPD’s fiscal allowance was $104.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C80B00 Office of the Public Defender|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/Pubs/BudgetFiscal/2017fy-budget-docs-operating-C80B00-Office-of-the-Public-Defender.pdf|work=General Assembly of Maryland|accessdate=24 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Defender ==

Pursuant Title 16-207 Duties and Powers of Public Defender, the general duties of the Public Defender are to 
# be responsible for the operation of the all district offices;
# prepare schedule of fees and expenses for panel attorneys and other professional and technical services  rendered to indigent individuals
# consult and cooperate with professional groups about the causes of criminal conduct; and 
# maintain financial and statistical records about each case in which the Office provides legal assistance to an indigent individual.&lt;ref name="Lexis Nexis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Md. CRIMINAL PROCEDURE Code Ann. § 16-207  (2014)|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/mdcode/|work=Maryland Annotated Code|publisher=Lexis Nexis|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general powers of the Public Defender are to (1) adopt regulations to carry out the purpose of Title 16; (2) make necessary arrangements to coordinate services of the Office with any federal program to provide an attorney to indigent individuals; (3) arrange for the Office to receive money or services available to assist in the duties under Title 16; and (4) accept the services of volunteer workers or consultants at no compensation for their necessary expenses or otherwise.&lt;ref name="Lexis Nexis"/&gt;      
The Public Defender is appointed by the Board of Trustees to a six-year term. Eligibility requirements have not changed from Article 27A.

==Other providers of representation of indigent individuals==
Pursuant Title 16-204, other than the public Defender, the deputy public defender, district [[public defender]]s, assistant public defenders and panel attorneys can provide representation to indigent individuals in accordance with the Office of the Public Defender.&lt;ref name="Lexis Nexis"/&gt;

== Indigent individuals ==

The OPD renders legal services to eligible indigent individuals charged with violating State, county, and/or municipal laws involving possible incarceration. According to Title 16-210, an individual is considered indigent only after being determined so by the following:

(a) Application as indigent individual. -- An individual may apply for services of the Office as an indigent individual, if the individual states in writing under oath or affirmation that the individual, without undue financial hardship, cannot provide the full payment of an attorney and all other necessary expenses of representation  in proceedings listed under 16-204(b).

(b) Determination of eligibility—Individuals with assets and income less than 100 percent of federal poverty guidelines. -- For an individual whose assets and net annual income are less than 100 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, eligibility for services of the Office may be determined without an assessment regarding the need of the applicant.

(c) Determination of eligibility—Individuals with assets and income equal to or exceeding 100 percent of federal poverty guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Md. CRIMINAL PROCEDURE Code Ann. § 16-210  (2014)|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/mdcode/|work=Maryland Annotared Code|publisher=Lexis Nexis|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation of indigent individual==
Title 16-204 of the Maryland Annotated Code states that the proceedings for which an indigent individual shall receive representation are:
* in a criminal or juvenile proceeding in which a defendant or party is alleged to have committed a serious offense;
* in a criminal or juvenile proceeding in which an attorney is constitutionally required to be present prior to presentment being made before a commissioner or judge;
* in a postconviction proceeding for which the defendant has a right to an attorney under Title 7 of this article;
* in any other proceeding in which confinement under a judicial commitment of an individual in a public or private institution may result;
* in a proceeding involving children in need of assistance under § 3-813 of the Courts Article; or
* in a family law proceeding under Title 5, Subtitle 3, Part II or Part III of the Family Law Article, including for a parent, a hearing in connection with guardianship or adoption; a hearing under § 5-326 of the Family Law Article for which the parent has not waived the right to notice; and an appeal.&lt;ref name=16-204&gt;{{cite web|title=Md. CRIMINAL PROCEDURE Code Ann. § 16-204|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/mdcode/|work=Annotated Code of Maryland|publisher=Lexis Nexis|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not a constitutional right that an indigent individual have the right to counsel at the initial appearance before a District Court Commissioner. See Senate Bill 1114, Senate Bill 973, House Bill 1186, which all failed to be passed at the 2014 session of the Maryland General Assembly.

The '''Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement''' ({{lang-my|တစ်နိုင်ငံလုံး ပစ်ခတ်တိုက်ခိုက်မှု ရပ်စဲရေးသဘောတူစာချုပ်}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''NCA''') was a landmark [[ceasefire]] agreement between the [[Cabinet of Myanmar|government of Myanmar]] and representatives of various ethnic insurgent groups, officially known as "ethnic armed organisations" (EAOs) by the government. The draft was agreed upon by a majority of the invited parties on 31 March 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myanmar's Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement - Institute for Security and Development Policy|url=http://isdp.eu/publication/myanmars-nationwide-ceasefire-agreement/|website=Institute for Security and Development Policy|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the agreement was signed by [[President of Myanmar|President]] [[Thein Sein]] on 15 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar signs ceasefire with eight armed groups|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics/myanmar-signs-ceasefire-with-eight-armed-groups-idUSKCN0S82MR20151015|accessdate=15 October 2017|work=Reuters|date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signing was witnessed by observers and delegates from the [[United Nations]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Norway]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="blogs.cfr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/asia/2015/10/07/myanmars-cease-fire-deal-comes-up-short/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009042537/http://blogs.cfr.org/asia/2015/10/07/myanmars-cease-fire-deal-comes-up-short/ |archive-date=9 October 2015 |dead-url=yes |title=Asia Unbound » Myanmar’s Cease-Fire Deal Comes up Short |accessdate=21 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray Pagnucco and Jennifer Peters"&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar's National Ceasefire Agreement isn't all that national|url=https://news.vice.com/article/myanmars-national-ceasefire-agreement-to-end-68-year-civil-war-isnt-all-that-national|accessdate=18 October 2015|newspaper=Vice News|date=15 October 2015|author=Ray Pagnucco and Jennifer Peters}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ceremony is held by the government annually on the anniversary of the signing of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thiha|first1=Amara|title=On the second anniversary of the NCA, is Myanmar keeping peace on track?|url=https://frontiermyanmar.net/en/on-the-second-anniversary-of-the-nca-is-myanmar-keeping-peace-on-track|accessdate=15 October 2017|work=Frontier Myanmar|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement is a Forlorn Hope|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/opinion/guest-column/nationwide-ceasefire-agreement-forlorn-hope.html|accessdate=15 October 2017|work=The Irrawaddy|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Myanmar originally sent invitations to 15 different ethnic insurgent groups, inviting them to participate in long-term peace negotiations with them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2106">In [[legislature]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, more commonly in [[parliament]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, a '''non-textual amendment''' is an [[amendment]] that alters the meaning or scope of operation of a piece of legislation, but without changing the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

For a non-textual amendment, both the original provision and the new provision would have to be read together to have a complete understanding of the item.

== Example ==
For example, a statement could say, "All cats are good." In this case, a textual amendment could be made so that the statement says, "All dogs are good."

A non-textual amendment would not change the original statement. Instead, it would be another statement like, "The statement shall apply to dogs as it would apply to cats." This statement would have to be read in conjunction with the original statement, "All cats are good", to get the full meaning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16700">The '''paternal rights and abortion''' issue is an extension of both the [[abortion debate]] and the [[fathers' rights]] movement.  “About 98.3% of abortions in the United States are elective, including socio-economic reasons or for birth control. The remaining 1.3% occurs due the following reasons: in cases of rape, 0.3%; in cases of incest, 0.03%; in cases of risk to maternal life, 0.1%; in cases of risk to maternal health, 0.8%; and in cases of fetal health issues, 0.5%” &lt;ref name="Sarchive"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sarchive |first1=Johnston |title=Reasons given for abortion in the United States |url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html |accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of majority of abortions are planned, abortion is becoming a factor for disagreement and lawsuit between partners.

==History==
[[Roman law]] allowed induced abortions but regulated it in consideration of the biological father. [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Septimius Severus]] ruled circa 211 AD that a woman who had an abortion without consent from her husband should face [[exile]] for having bereaved her husband of children.&lt;ref name="riddle1"&gt;[[John M. Riddle]] (1992). ''Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.magicdragon.com/UltimateSF/timeline3.html Timeline 3rd Century]." (2003). ''The Ultimate Science Fiction Web Guide.'' Retrieved June 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[orator|speech]] ''[[Pro Cluentio]]'', delivered in 66 BC, [[Cicero]] refers to a case he had heard of in which a woman from [[Miletus]] was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] for having aborted her pregnancy, upon receiving [[bribery|bribes]] from those who stood to [[inheritance|inherit]] her husband's [[Estate (law)|estate]] if he produced no heir. Cicero said that in doing so she had "destroyed the hope of the father, the memory of his name, the supply of his race, the heir of his family, a citizen intended for the use of the republic".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. (66 BC). [http://www.uah.edu/student_life/organizations/SAL/texts/latin/classical/cicero/procluentio.html  Pro Cluentio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601183417/http://www.uah.edu/student_life/organizations/SAL/texts/latin/classical/cicero/procluentio.html |date=2006-06-01 }}. (C.D. Yonge, Trans.). Retrieved June 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 4th century BC [[Greeks|Greek]] writer from [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], Sopater, quoted the [[lawyer]] Lysias, who had referred to a trial in [[Athens]] in which a man named Antigene accused his wife of having deprived him of a son by having an abortion.&lt;ref name="riddle1" /&gt;

==Men and abortion in law==
Whether a male has a legal right to advance his personal interest, whether it be toward [[abortion]], [[father]]hood, or [[adoption]], over that of the female, differs by region.

In 2011, it was reported that [[Indonesia]], [[Malawi]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Kuwait]], [[Maldives]], [[Morocco]], [[South Korea]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Turkey]] all had laws which required that an abortion first be authorized by the woman's husband.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/AbortionMap_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some countries, this stipulation could be bypassed or overridden if there is genuine concern for maternal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rahman, Anika |author2=Katzive, Laura |author3=Henshaw, Stanley K. |title=A Global Review of Laws on Induced Abortion, 1985–1997 |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages= |year=1998 |doi= |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2405698.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', some [[U.S. state|states]] in the [[United States]] have attempted to enact laws requiring spousal consent. All of these laws have been ruled unconstitutional, spousal consent in the 1976 decision ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Danforth]]'' and spousal awareness in the 1992 decision ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/428/52 |website=Legal Information Institute |accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cases===
In China the husband of a woman who had an abortion filed a [[lawsuit]] against her in 2002 under a law intended to grant [[sexual equality]] in terms of [[Sexual reproduction|childbearing]] and [[birth control|contraceptive]] decisions. The law stated that a woman has no overriding priority over her spouse in deciding whether to have a child.&lt;ref&gt;Maximova, Vickie.  "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1883709.stm Chinese man sues wife over abortion]."  (March 20, 2002). ''BBC News.'' Retrieved May 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[legal case]]s have arisen in the Western world in which men have tried to prevent women with whom they had been sexually active from obtaining an abortion, all of which failed:

*'''1978''': William Paton of [[Liverpool]], [[United Kingdom]] attempted to stop his separated wife, Joan, from undergoing an abortion in the 1978 case ''Paton v. Trustees of British Pregnancy Advisory Service Trustees''. A judge ruled in his wife's favour and Mr. Paton's later request for a hearing before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] was also denied.&lt;ref name="nolan"&gt;Nolan, David.

''Catholic Medical Quarterly.'' Retrieved May 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1987''':  Robert Carver of the United Kingdom tried to prevent an abortion in the 1987 case ''C v. S''. He claimed that the Infant Life (Preservation) Act applied to the fetus, as, at the time, his ex-girlfriend was 21 weeks along. When the [[High Court of Justice]] and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] dismissed the case, it was brought before the [[House of Lords]], where three [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Law Lord]]s sided with the earlier decisions. The entire legal process took 36 hours, as the Health Authority refused to allow an abortion before a decision was reached, making it one of the fastest cases in the history of [[law of the United Kingdom|British law]]. Nonetheless, the woman involved chose to carry the pregnancy to term and gave the [[infant|baby]] to Carver.&lt;ref name="nolan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bpas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cmq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brahams D |title=An action by putative father and unborn fetus to prevent termination |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8532 |pages=576–7 |date=March 1987 |pmid=2881128 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(87)90226-1 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(87)90226-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1989''':  Jean-Guy Tremblay of [[Quebec]], filed an [[injunction]] against his girlfriend, Chantal Daigle, in attempt to prevent her from obtaining an induced abortion in the 1989 [[Canada|Canadian]] case ''[[Tremblay v. Daigle]]''.  The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ultimately ruled that there was no precedent for a man's right to protect his "potential progeny", as a [[fetus]] was not found to have a [[right to life]] under the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]].
*'''2001''': Stephen Hone of [[Coventry]], United Kingdom, unsuccessfully attempted to prevent his former girlfriend Claire Hansell from having an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1242952.stm Abortion for court fight woman]."

About men deciding to decline parenthood in the event of an [[unintended pregnancy]] and asking for a [[financial abortion]]:
* '''2006''': [[Matt Dubay child support case]] was a legal case between Matt Dubay and his ex-girlfriend, both of [[Saginaw Charter Township, Michigan|Saginaw Township]], [[Michigan]]. Dubay claimed in court documents that he informed his ex-girlfriend he had no interest in becoming a father. Dubay also claimed in court documents that in response, she said she was infertile and that, as an extra layer of protection, she was using contraception.&lt;ref&gt;MATTHEW DUBAY v. LAUREN WELLS, an Individual, SAGINAW COUNTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, by and through Michael D. Thomas, Prosecutor. UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT. 6 Nov. 2007. Us Courts. Web. &lt;http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0442p-06.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dubbed "''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' for Men" by the National Center for Men. Dubay's lawsuit was dismised by the judge.

==Controversy==
Those who support a man's right to intervene in a woman's reproductive decisions, argue that it is unreasonable that, after fertilisation has occurred, women are often given more options with regard to [[pregnancy]] and parenthood than men.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Young, Cathy. (April 2003). "[http://www.reason.com/news/show/28737.html Aborting Equality: Men's Odd Place in the Abortion Debate]." ''Reason.''  Retrieved June 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Armin Brott has said of this, "A woman can legally deprive a man of his right to become a parent or force him to become one against his will".&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/abortion/legal/fathers.shtml Abortion and the father]."

===Abortion vetoing===
[[Men's rights movement|Men's rights]] and [[Fathers' rights movement|fathers' rights activists]] have argued that men should have veto power over their partners' decisions to abort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Cahill |first1= Charlotte |authorlink1= |editor1-first= Roger |editor1-last= Chapman |editor1-link= |others= |title= Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices |url= |year= 2010 |publisher= M.E.

Harris has written that, if a man impregnates a woman with the explicit goal of having a child, in a manner that is mutually consensual, then it would be morally unacceptable for that woman to later have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1086/292777 |author= Harris GW |title=  Fathers and fetuses |journal=Ethics |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=594–603 |date=April 1986 |pmid=11658724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who object to men having a right to direct involvement argue that because it is the woman's body carrying the unborn baby, her determination for or against abortion should be the only one.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Keith. (April 2001). "[http://www.cs.unm.edu/~kwiley/mindRamblings/abortion.html Abortion and Men's Reproductive Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730060031/http://www.cs.unm.edu/~kwiley/mindRamblings/abortion.html |date=2012-07-30 }}." Retrieved June 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Marsha Garrison, a professor at [[Brooklyn Law School]], stated that U.S. courts acknowledge "that embryo is in the woman's body, it is within her and can't be separated from her, so it's not just her decision-making about whether to bear a child, it's about her body".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pam Belluck]]. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/weekinreview/06belluck.html?ex=1181707200&amp;en=4a4d5075047f2047&amp;ei=5070 The Right to Be a Father (or Not)]." (November 6, 2005). ''The New York Times.'' Retrieved June 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion notification ===
A 2002 United States [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] special report mentions only 38% of the population being opposed to notifying the husband of a married woman for an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/9904/public-opinion-about-abortion-indepth-review.aspx#2 "Public Opinion About Abortion — An In-Depth Review."] Lydia Saad. January 22, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2003 [[Gallup poll]], 72% of respondents were in favor of notification to the husband, with 26% opposed; of those polled, 79% of males and 67% of females responded in favor of notification inside [[married couples]].&lt;ref&gt;The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. (2005-11-02). "[http://www.people-press.org/2005/11/02/public-opinion-supports-alito-on-spousal-notification-even-as-it-favors-iroe-v-wadei/ Public Opinion Supports Alito on Spousal Notification Even as It Favors Roe v. Wade]." ''Pew Research Center Pollwatch.''  Retrieved 2014-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy vetoing===
Bioethicist Jacob Appel has asked, “if one grants a man veto power over a woman’s choice to have an abortion in cases where he is willing to pay for the child, why not grant him the right to demand an abortion where he is unwilling to provide for the child?"&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Jacob M.  “Women’s Rights, Men’s Bodies,” New York Times, December 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opting out===
{{main|Paper Abortion}}
In reference to cases in which men who do not desire to become fathers have been required to pay [[child support]], Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in her 1998 article, "The Male Abortion: The Putative Father's Right to Terminate His Interests in and Obligations to the Unborn Child," set forth the theory of the "male abortion," in which she argues that men should be able to terminate their legal obligations to unwanted children.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McCulley MG |title=The male abortion: the putative father's right to terminate his interests in and obligations to the unborn child |journal=J Law Policy |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–55 |year=1988 |pmid=12666677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opting in====
It is also possible, rather than taking the stance that males should have the freedom to opt out of inherent responsibilities and rights, to take the stance that one must opt-in and agree to undertake those responsibilities to be compelled to follow them, and only through doing so, earn parental rights. This is what occurs during [[adoption]].

'''Predictive costs''' are costs claimable at law by [[Plaintiff|claimant]]'s [[solicitor]]s.

They are known as predictive as they are the [[Costs (English law)|costs]] that would be payable had the claim proceeded to trial, but the claim was settled before trial.

'''Protocol on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters''' (or '''Protocol of San Luis''') is a [[MERCOSUR]] treaty signed by [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]] adopted in [[San Luis province]], Argentina, on 25 June 1996,&lt;ref name=garcia-moreno /&gt; with the goal of establishing a system of international criminal judicial cooperation among the States part of the treaty in criminal matters at the several levels of criminal cooperation excluding extradition, which has been regulated in the [[Agreement on Extradition between the States Parties of MERCOSUR]] of 1998.&lt;ref name=Cervino /&gt;

Prudentialism is also a philosophy of [[constitutional interpretation]] that considers laws and powers from a pragmatic viewpoint.&lt;ref name=tws3R18fs&gt;{{cite news

The '''Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust''' ("RACER Trust" or "RACER") Trust was created in March 2011 by a Settlement Agreement in the [[United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.racertrust.org/files/RACERTrustFinalSettlementAgreement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; RACER’s mission is to clean up and position for redevelopment properties and other facilities owned by the former General Motors Corporation (“GMC”, “Old GM”) before its [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 reorganization]]. Its predecessor, [[Motors Liquidation Company]] ("MLC") was created to manage and hold the assets of Old GM before the bankruptcy was complete. MLC was carved into four separate trusts; the first to settle the claims of [[unsecured creditor]]s ({{OTC Pink|MTLQU}}), the second (RACER) to handle environmental response for MLC's remaining assets, a third to handle present and future [[Asbestos litigation|asbestos-related claims]], and a fourth for litigation claims.&lt;ref name=rtr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/31/oldgm-exit-idUSN3121109620110331?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=cyclicalConsumerGoodsSector&amp;rpc=43 |title=Motors Liquidation Company carved into four trusts |publisher=reuters.com |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its inception, RACER’s portfolio included properties at 89 locations in 14 states, comprising 358 individual parcels and more than 7,000 acres of primarily industrial land, making RACER one of the largest holders of industrial property in the United States. When it was formed, RACER was the largest environmental response and remediation trust in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;http://racertrust.org/About_RACER/About_Us&lt;/ref&gt;

RACER is headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. Its administrative trustee is Elliott P. Laws, a former assistant administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a partner in the law firm Crowell &amp; Moring. The Bankruptcy Court appointed Mr. Laws to a five-year term as administrative trustee when RACER was established in 2011. He was reappointed to a second five-year term in 2016.

The Settlement Agreement assigns RACER three basic roles regarding former GM properties.  First, for those properties with environmental issues, RACER manages and funds the environmental cleanup.  Second, RACER manages the properties while they are owned by RACER. Third, RACER has authority to “try to sell or transfer [its] Properties ... with the objective they be put to productive or beneficial use.”
 
RACER is not a government entity but rather an independent trust.

== GMC Bankruptcy ==

On June 1, 2009, General Motors Corporation and three wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11, Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. On October 9, 2009, Remediation and Liability Management Company, Inc. (“REALM”) and Environmental Corporate Remediation Company, Inc. (“ENCORE”) each filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlcguctrust.com/Page.aspx?Name=Home&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of assets, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 363, to NGMCO, Inc. (“Newco”), now known as General Motors Company (“New GM”).  Following the sale of assets, General Motors Corporation was renamed Motors Liquidation Company
(“MLC”).  As part of the sale of assets, GMC excluded from the sale certain real property and personal property it owned. On March 31, 2011, these excluded properties were transferred to the newly formed RACER Trust.

Parties to the Environmental Response Trust Consent Decree and Settlement Agreement (Case No. 09-50026 [REG]) included MLC, REALM, and ENCORE (collectively the “debtors”); the [[United States of America]]; the states of [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Michigan]], [[Missouri]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Virginia]] and [[Wisconsin]]; the [[Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality]], the [[Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection]]; and the [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection|Department of Environmental Protection for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] (collectively the “States”); the [[Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe]]; and EPLET, LLC, not individually but solely in its representative capacity as Administrative Trustee of RACER Trust.

== RACER Trust Properties ==

When GMC was renamed as MLC, its portfolio included properties at 89 locations in 14 U.S. states. These properties totaled more than 7,100 acres of land and nearly 40 million square feet of structural area.&lt;ref&gt;http://racertrust.org/Properties/Property_List&lt;/ref&gt; At the time MLC’s assets were transferred to RACER Trust, MLC had sold six properties outright and a portion of a seventh. While RACER Trust was conveyed the remaining properties, it was transferred the environmental cleanup and monitoring responsibilities of all properties that required environmental remediation and long-term monitoring, regardless of whether the property had changed ownership. Sixty of the properties carried environmental obligations, four of which were sold or partially sold by MLC prior to RACER Trust’s creation.

== RACER Trust Redevelopment Mission ==

RACER begins the redevelopment process for new job-creating uses by meeting with local elected officials, community leaders and economic development organizations, with a goal of understanding the local community's common vision for the optimal re-use of each location.  Based on this common vision, RACER determines how best to market the property for sale to prospective buyers. Following these initial steps, RACER published detailed marketing brochures and documents describing the terms for purchase, formally opening the marketing process.

Offers for purchase are evaluated by RACER against six criteria set forth in the Settlement Agreement that resulted in RACER’s creation. RACER also may consider additional factors, in its sole discretion, when assessing whether these criteria have been best satisfied by a particular offer. While purchase price will be evaluated, RACER also must consider each offer's ability to create jobs and generate new economic opportunity in the communities hurt by the GM bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;http://racertrust.org/About_RACER/About_Us&lt;/ref&gt;

RACER strongly prefers buyers who have a specific plan to create new jobs in those properties while reusing, improving and expanding existing buildings, rather than buyers who intend to dismantle buildings and sell components of the properties they have purchased.

Proceeds from property sales or leases are used to pay so-called holding costs at RACER sites, including the property taxes RACER pays on these properties, and maintenance, insurance and security expenses. Proceeds from the sale or lease of RACER properties are transferred to RACER’s Administrative Funding Account, from which RACER pays its day-to-day expenses.  RACER is self-sustaining, and the anticipated proceeds from the sale or lease of properties were factored into the ongoing operations of RACER at the time of its creation. Thus, donation of property as a redevelopment strategy is precluded.

RACER does not invest directly in redevelopment (for example, by providing funding to offset infrastructure improvement costs) or otherwise pay third-party expenses (for example, for consultants to evaluate redevelopment proposals). RACER invests in local communities by maintaining properties in a marketable condition, paying property taxes and acting as an economic development partner in pursuit of new investment and job creation.&lt;ref&gt;http://racertrust.org/About_RACER/Questions_and_Answers&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sales Criteria ==

RACER is obligated by terms of the Settlement Agreement to sell its properties at prices that approximate fair market value and that take into consideration the jobs and other economic benefits new projects can bring to auto communities hurt by the GM bankruptcy.

The Settlement Agreement described the criteria that RACER, at a minimum, must consider when selling properties. These criteria include:
1. Whether the purchase price is sufficient;
2. The potential for job creation in the affected community and the state;
3. Increases in tax revenue or other benefits, like the reduction of blight, to the community, state or Tribe;
4. Avoiding an unanticipated increase in costs for the environmental cleanup;
5. The views of the local communities, the Tribe or the state; and,
6. The reputation and credibility of the prospective purchaser.&lt;ref&gt;http://racertrust.org/Economic_Development/Sales_Criteria&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Settlement Agreement does not require any particular weighting of the factors. Although the effects of a proposed sale on the states and localities are to be considered — and are considered — by RACER, these entities are not beneficiaries of RACER. Its sole beneficiary is the United States Government.

== RACER Trust Environmental Mission ==

RACER Trust is responsible for conducting safe, effective cleanups of legacy environmental contamination resulting from previous operations at 60 former GM locations. The cleanups are conducted with the approval and oversight of state and federal regulatory agencies and funded by the principal and investment income from nearly $500 million that RACER received from the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.racertrust.org/files/USAO-GM-Environmental-Settlement-PR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of RACER’s establishment. RACER’s goal is to obtain "No Further Action" letters or other such instruments of completion from responsible regulatory agencies for all locations where cleanups were required.

To the extent possible, RACER coordinates its cleanups to accommodate the interests of buyers or end users who seek to invest in new industrial or commercial development and job creation. In most cases, RACER properties can be sold for new uses even before environmental cleanups are started or completed, assuming RACER is guaranteed continuing access to the properties to conduct cleanup work.

Budgets for each cleanup were incorporated into the Settlement Agreement that established RACER Trust. In cases where the established budget is insufficient, RACER Trust has access to supplemental funding with the approval of the signatories to the Settlement Agreement.

== Notable Sales ==

=== Moraine, Ohio ===

RACER sold two of its properties, Moraine Industrial Land and [[Moraine Assembly|Moraine Assembly Plant]], to Industrial Realty Group (IRG) in June 2011. The adjacent sites totaled more than 3.3 million square feet of factory space on 379 acres of land in [[Moraine]] and [[Kettering]], [[Ohio]]. In one of the largest international deals in Ohio’s history, [[Fuyao Glass America]] purchased 1.5 million square feet of manufacturing space from IRG. The company, now the largest auto glass manufacturer in the world, supplies customers such as [[General Motors]], [[Ford]], and [[Honda]]. The plant also serves after-market glass suppliers, which includes companies such as [[Safelite|Safelite AutoGlass]].

Fuyao originally pledged $230 million in investment and the creation of 800 jobs. One year later this jumped to $360 million in investment and 1,550 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/breaking-news/fuyao-set-double-hiring-moraine-plant-500-jobs/XIW2hI9dJ3w0Rw5Uw8KVnL/&lt;/ref&gt; One year after that, Fuyao announced its labor need had risen to a total of 2,400 workers at this facility.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/fuyao-chairman-moraine-plant-will-need-more-than-000-workers/OKnh5uBFkP9yrPeulWwlJO/&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 622 temporary construction jobs also were created. In July 2016, Fuyao announced it is leasing an additional 241,000 square feet of the plant in a 15-year agreement with IRG.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/fuyao-glass-expand-new-plant-again/8wo24zR0u4lHpvohVHhjSL/&lt;/ref&gt; Fuyao’s chairman, Cho Tak Wong, said it expects to have more than 3,000 employees at this site sometime in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/fuyao-chairman-says-000-jobs-possible-moraine-plant/K1twMMkw8ibtYQRJZiBRUJ/&lt;/ref&gt; IRG leases portions of the sites to other auto- and non-auto related manufacturers.

=== Kansas City, Kansas ===

In September 2013, RACER sold its 74-acre [[Kansas City, Kansas]] holdings to NorthPoint Development. The buyer named the site Central Industrial Park&lt;ref&gt;https://beyondthecontract.com/find-a-property/central-industrial-park/&lt;/ref&gt; and prepared it for new industrial development. In 2015, NorthPoint developed a 74,000 square-foot, $10 million build-to-suit facility&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2016/07/21/northpoint-central-industrial-park-construction.html&lt;/ref&gt; that was purchased by [[Plastic Omnium|Plastic Omnium Auto Inergy]], which manufactures plastic fuel tank systems for the nearby [[General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant]]. The manufacturer employs approximately 200 new workers.  NorthPoint then constructed an 842,000 square-foot speculative building that General Motors Company occupies under a long-term lease. This $55 million project is expected to employ approximately 500 new workers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2016/11/16/gm-northpoint-fairfax-logistics-center-500-jobs.html&lt;/ref&gt; Additional areas of the site are planned for redevelopment.

=== Pontiac, Michigan ===

In August 2014, RACER sold two of its [[Pontiac, Michigan]] properties, PCC Validation I and PCC Validation II, to M1 Concourse, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;https://m1concourse.com&lt;/ref&gt; The two adjacent sites comprised 86 acres of vacant land once owned by the [[Rapid Motor Vehicle Company]] until being acquired by Old GM in 1909. The buyer built an exclusive community of more than 250 secure private garages set along the 1.5-mile Champion Motor Speedway, also part of the M1 Concourse development. Private garages are individually owned flexible storage and entertainment spaces.&lt;ref&gt;https://m1concourse.com/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; A 6,000 square-foot entertainment venue, a restaurant and banquet/event center, and commercial/retail spaces were part of the nearly $70 million investment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2016/06/08/concourse-race-track-car-condos-set-open-pontiac/85632304/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indianapolis, Indiana ===

RACER sold its 103-acre Indianapolis Stamping Plant site in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] to the Ambrose Property Group in March 2018. The property was once home to the 2.2-million square-foot General Motors Indianapolis Metals Center. RACER razed the vast majority of the structures on site prior to selling to Ambrose. Ambrose’s site plan includes a mixed-use development along the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] that could require some 1,000 temporary construction jobs, 900 permanent jobs, and more than $500 million in project investments over 10 to 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/37914741/former-gm-site-ripe-for-all-different-types-of-development-indianapolis-ambrose-property-group-stamping&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Livonia, Michigan ===

RACER sold its Delco Chassis site in [[Livonia, Michigan]] to Ashley Capital in August 2015. The buyer built a 1-million square-foot facility that it leases to [[Amazon.com]] as a fulfillment center.  Over 500 temporary construction jobs were created, and in the summer of 2017, Amazon estimated it would hire more than 1,000 employees to staff the facility.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wxyz.com/news/first-amazon-fulfillment-center-in-michigan-opens-in-livonia&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley Capital sold a portion of the same site to [[RNDC (Republic National Distributing Company)|National Republic Distributing Corporation]]. The wine and spirits distributer is building a 515,000 square-foot development that will serve as both a regional headquarters and a logistics facility. It is estimated that the company will invest over $67 million in the project and need to hire 525 employees.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hometownlife.com/story/news/local/livonia/2018/04/27/alcohol-distributor-invests-67-5-m-brings-525-jobs-livonia/550935002/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ypsilanti Township, Michigan ===

In November 2016, RACER sold 312 acres of its iconic [[Willow Run Transmission|Willow Run Powertrain Plant]] to a partnership that has redeveloped the property into the American Center for Mobility, a state-of-the-art, four-season testing facility for connected and automated vehicles in [[Ypsilanti Township, Michigan]]. The facility includes a 2.5-mile test track with ramps, a 700-degree tunnel, and other components necessary to developing and marketing driverless automobiles and related technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180404/news/657026/american-center-for-mobility-opening-at-willow-run-touted-as-crucial&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this sale, RACER sold 144,000 square feet of former manufacturing space on almost 17 acres of this property for the newly relocated [[Yankee Air Museum]], which suffered a devastating fire at its previous location in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.firehouse.com/home/news/10516942/blaze-devours-michigans-yankee-air-museum-relics&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;small&gt;Spotsylvania County, Virginia&lt;/small&gt; ==

Old GM owned a single property in Virginia, located near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] in [[Spotsylvania County]], which RACER took possession of as part of Old GM’s bankruptcy. The 265,000 square-foot manufacturing facility and 76 acres of land were sold by RACER to idX Corporation in May 2017. idX stated in late 2017 that it will hire 175 employees and invest $9.8 million in its project.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/local/spotsylvania/virginia-governor-headlines-ribbon-cutting-ceremony-for-global-manufacturer-in/article_2e4cc429-590b-51b4-b36d-381516a07259.html&lt;/ref&gt;

RACER Trust self-publishes case studies describing the redevelopment, reuse and environmental status of its former properties from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;http://racertrust.org/Properties/Case-Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Controversies ==

=== Ontario, Ohio ===

In August 2012, RACER announced it had reached agreement with the Brownfield Communities Development Company, a joint venture between [[Hilco Global|Hilco Trading LLC]] and The Adler Group, for the sale of the former GM Ontario Stamping Plant, a 2.5-million-square-foot manufacturing facility in [[Ontario, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;http://racertrust.org/News/10289&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was completed in December 2012. "We are taking an obsolete single-tenant facility and turning it into a modern multi-tenant business generator,” said Michael M. Adler, CEO and Chairman of Adler Group. "We are excited to start the next phase of the project and we are looking forward to working with the community."&lt;ref&gt;http://racertrust.org/News/11171&lt;/ref&gt; The company promised to create 500 jobs within five years or pay a $1 million fine to the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richlandsource.com/news/ontario-frustrated-with-progress-at-former-gm-%09site/article_a6aabab2-77f9-11e7-b599-7f4decb7d416.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Brownfield Communities Development Company represented to RACER and to the community in a Development Agreement dated August 16, 2012, that it intended to seek new tenants to occupy most of the intact building. In a letter dated April 12, 2013, Michael M. Adler, president of Ontario Business Park LLC, requested approval from the City of Ontario for demolition of the buildings on the property.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.mansfieldersperspective.com/more-demolition-sought-at-gm-plant-for-those-who-cant-comment-on-mnj-what-do-you-think/&lt;/ref&gt; The request was approved by the Ontario City Council and the buildings were demolished and sold for scrap.

Brownfield Communities Development Company claimed that its marketing of the property was thwarted by ongoing environmental activity at the property, despite never having raised the environmental conditions as a potential impediment when purchasing the property and despite ample examples of RACER properties that were purchased and redeveloped while environmental activities were ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/10/16/column-former-gm-site-ready-redevelopment/73986992/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ohio Environmental Protection Agency]], the regulatory agency that oversaw RACER’s cleanup activities at the property, issued a Covenant Not to Sue to RACER in April 2016, certifying the completion of environmental cleanup at the property.&lt;ref&gt;http://racertrust.org/News/Ohio-EPA-Issues-Covenant-Not-to-Sure-for-Former-RACER-Trust-Property-in-Ontario-OH&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the Ontario City Council sent a notice of default of completion to the Adler Group, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/story/news/2017/08/03/ontario-council-files-notice-default-completion-guarantee-against-adler-group/534539001/&lt;/ref&gt; The property remains undeveloped.

=== Caddo Parish, Louisiana ===

In January 2013, RACER and [[Elio Motors]] announced that Elio Motors would purchase the former Shreveport Assembly Plant in [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]], LA, just outside [[Shreveport]], and hire 1,500 people to manufacture the company’s innovative three-wheel, gas-powered vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2013/01/shreveport_gm_plant_acquired_b.html&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was restructured to enable purchase of the facility by the Caddo Parish Industrial Development Board (IDB) in December 2013, with a master lease provided to Industrial Realty Group (dba Shreveport Business Park) and a secondary lease provided to Elio Motors. Shreveport Business Park, in addition to making monthly lease payments to the IDB, is responsible for all of the property’s marketing, maintenance and upkeep.

Local elected officials who initially were supportive of Elio Motors began to publicly criticize the deal as Elio Motors continued to miss start-of-production targets, citing lack of capital. In particular, Caddo Commissioner Matthew Linn and Louisiana State Rep. Cedric Glover, a prominent supporter of Elio Motors during his time as mayor of Shreveport, levied false allegations — Commissioner Linn that RACER threatened to demolish the plant if the Caddo Parish IDB did not purchase it, and Rep. Glover that the sale of the plant prevented other prospects from leasing or purchasing the plant. Rep. Glover sponsored a House resolution requesting “the House Committee on Commerce to study the state of the automotive manufacturing industry in the state of Louisiana since the onset of the most recent worldwide economic downturn.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1013537&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2016/09/28/whats-going-general-motors-shreveport-plant/91179046/&lt;/ref&gt;

The House Committee on Commerce convened a hearing on the transaction on October 26, 2016, in Shreveport.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ktbs.com/news/paul-elio-in-hot-seat-during-la-house-commerce-committee/article_cab813fb-a0ef-50db-85fe-607760847e1b.html&lt;/ref&gt; The committee issued a two-page report that included no conclusions or finding of fact, except to note that, “Since the October 2016 meeting, officials with the North Louisiana Economic partnership announced that GLOVIS America, a subsidiary of Hyundai, will open a new distribution center in the former General Motors facility that will result in the production of 75,000 vehicles annually and the creation of 400 new positions in north Louisiana.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nlep.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/GLOVIS-America-Facility-Opens-at-Former-GM-Plant-i.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Louisiana House authorized the creation of a subcommittee of the House Committee on Commerce “to further examine certain matters relative to the (RACER Trust’s) fulfillment of fiduciary duties concerning the former General Motors Shreveport plant.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1043775&lt;/ref&gt; A report of the subcommittee was due 30 days before the start of the 2018 Regular Session of the Legislature of Louisiana. No report was issued.

{{for|the film|Physical Evidence}}
'''Physical evidence''' (also called '''real evidence''' or '''material evidence''') is any [[material object]] that plays some role in the matter that gave rise to the [[litigation]], introduced as [[evidence]] in a judicial proceeding (such as a [[trial (law)|trial]]) to prove a fact in issue based on the object's physical characteristics.

==In American law==
===Tampering===
{{main|Tampering with evidence}}
{{see also|Spoliation of evidence}}

It is an offense at [[common law]] "to tamper with, conceal, or destroy evidence knowing that it may be wanted in a judicial proceeding or is being sought by law enforcement officers."&lt;ref name="CJS"&gt;67 [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] ''Obstructing Justice'' § 63 (footnotes omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; This is also a crime under statutes of many [[U.S. state]]s.&lt;ref name="CJS"/&gt; A 2004 review found that 32 states had a statute "that prohibits, in some form, the concealment, destruction, or tampering with evidence."&lt;ref name="Decker"&gt;John F. Decker, ''The Varying Parameters of Obstruction of Justice in American Criminal Law'', 65 &lt;small&gt;[[Louisiana Law Review|LA. L. Rev.]]&lt;/small&gt; 40, 83-84 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence tampering "generally refers to physical evidence and is not founded on false statements or the concealment of information by false statements."&lt;ref name="CJS"/&gt; It falls within the broader set of [[obstruction of justice]]-related offenses; others include [[perjury]], [[bribery]], destruction of government property, [[Contempt of court|contempt]], and escape.&lt;ref name="Decker"/&gt;

Generally, the [[elements of the offense]] are: that the person had "knowledge that an official proceeding or investigation is in progress or is likely to be instituted"; that the person took (2) "overt action to alter, destroy, conceal, or remove evidence"; and that (3) the person had the "purpose of impairing the value or availability of the evidence in the proceeding or investigation."&lt;ref name="CJS"/&gt;

===Self-incrimination===
In ''Pennsylvania v. Muniz'' (1990), the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] "distinguished 'physical' and 'demeanor' evidence from 'testimonial' evidence, holding that evidence of the former does not engender [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protection" against [[self-incrimination]].&lt;ref name="Velarde-Gomez"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Velarde-Gomez|vol=269|reporter=F.3d |opinion=1023|pinpoint=1032-33|court=9th Cir. |date=2001 |url=http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200703/04-7041a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] has held that "physical evidence includes one's fingerprints, handwriting, vocal characteristics, stance, stride, gestures, or blood characteristics."&lt;ref name="Velarde-Gomez"/&gt;

On 8 October 2013 the European Parliament in Strasbourg voted down the Commission's proposal to introduce medical regulation for e-cigarettes, but proposed that cross-border marketing of e-cigarettes be regulated similarly to tobacco products, meaning that sales of e-cigarettes to under-18s would be prohibited in the European Union, along with most cross-border advertising.

Following the outcome of EU tobacco directive in October 2013, the legislation is moving towards a more relaxed stance on the issue. As stated by the Estonian minister of social affairs Taavi Rõivas (in charge of tobacco regulation), e-cigarettes will receive an advertisement ban and will clearly be banned for minors but will be available for adults before the end of 2013.

{{flag|Finland}}: The National Supervisory Authority of Welfare and Health ([[Valvira]]) declared that the new tobacco marketing ban (effective 1 January 2012) would also cover e-cigarettes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valvira.fi/valvira/ajankohtaista/tupakan_esillapitokielto_voimaan_-_sahkotupakan_mainonta_lainvastaista |title=Tupakan esilläpitokielto voimaan – Sähkötupakan mainonta lainvastaista|publisher=Valvira.fi|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in that Finnish stores or web stores can't advertise e-cigarettes because they might look like regular cigarettes. In theory, e-cigarettes with nicotine-free cartridges may still be sold, as long as their images and prices are not visible. Ordering from abroad remains allowed. Sale of nicotine cartridges is currently prohibited, as nicotine is considered a prescription drug requiring an authorization that such cartridges do not yet have. However, the Finnish authorities have decided that nicotine cartridges containing less than 10&amp;nbsp;mg nicotine, and e-liquid containing less than 0.42&amp;nbsp;g nicotine per bottle, may be legally brought in from other countries for private use. If the nicotine content is higher, a prescription from a Finnish physician is required. From a country within the [[European Economic Area]] a maximum of one year's supply may be brought in for private use when returning to Finland, while three months' supply may be brought in from outside the EEA. Mail-order deliveries from EEA countries, for a maximum of three months' supply, are also allowed.&lt;ref name="Finnish ban"&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/S%C3%A4hk%C3%B6tupakan%20myynti%20kiellettiin%20Suomessa/1135238177925 Helsingin Sanomat: "Sähkötupakan myynti kiellettiin Suomessa"].

Leon]], explaining that "the devices should be regulated as tobacco products rather than drug or medical products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/business/15smoke.html|work=The New York Times|first=Duff|last=Wilson|title=Judge Orders F.D.A. to Stop Blocking Imports of E-Cigarettes From China|date=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] stayed the injunction pending an appeal, during which the FDA argued the right to regulate e-cigarettes based on their previous ability to regulate [[nicotine]] replacement therapies such as [[nicotine gum]] or patches. Further, the agency argued that tobacco legislation enacted the previous year "expressly excludes from the definition of 'tobacco product' any article that is a drug, device or combination product under the FDCA, and provides that such articles shall be subject to regulation under the pre-existing FDCA provisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/publications/news/news-now/health-of-the-public/20100302e-cig-fda.html |title=AAFP.org |publisher=AAFP.org |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December 2010, the appeals court ruled against the FDA in a 3–0 unanimous decision, ruling the FDA can only regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products, and thus cannot block their import.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2010/12/08/fda-block-e-cigarette-imports-court/|title=FDA Cannot Block E-Cigarette Imports: Court|date=8 December 2010 | work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges ruled that such devices would only be subject to drug legislation if they are marketed for therapeutic use – E-cigarette manufacturers had successfully proven that their products were targeted at smokers and not at those seeking to quit. The District Columbia Circuit appeals court, on 24 January 2011, declined to review the decision ''[[en banc]]'', blocking the products from FDA regulation as medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2011/02/14/gvsb0214.htm|author=FDA|title=FDA regulation of e-cigarettes rebuffed again|work=American Medical News|date=14 February 2011|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vendors and companies had until two years afterward to prepare paperwork with the FDA to have their product remain on the market. Currently, there are lawsuits and amendments made in the works in Congress to change that provision.

Effective 8 August 2016, all US states will follow the same, uniform federal guidelines.&lt;ref name=FDA-August-2016/&gt; With an absence of federal regulations, many states and cities had adopted their own e-cigarette regulations, most commonly to prohibit sales to minors, including Maryland, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin, and Colorado.

A review of regulations in 40 U.S. states found that how a law defines e-cigarettes is critical, with some definitions allowing e-cigarettes to avoid [[smoke-free laws]], taxation, and restrictions on sales and marketing.&lt;ref name=Lempert2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lempert|first1=Lauren|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2014/12/14/tobaccocontrol-2014-051913|title=The importance of product definitions in US e-cigarette laws and regulations|journal=Tobacco Control|year=2014|doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-051913|pmid=25512432|pmc=4466213|volume=25|issue=e1|pages=e44–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less policies have been created to restrict vaping indoors than with cigarette smoking.&lt;ref name=SouleMaloney2017/&gt;

'''''Righting Wrongs''''', also known as '''''Above the Law''''', is a 1986 [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action film]] produced and directed by [[Corey Yuen]], and also produced by and starring [[Yuen Biao]], both of whom also serve as the film's [[stage combat|action directors]]. The film also co-stars [[Cynthia Rothrock]], Melvin Wong, [[Wu Ma]], [[Roy Chiao]] and director Yuen himself. ''Righting Wrongs'' is the one of Yuen Biao's better known films that he made without film industry compatriots [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Jackie Chan]].

==Title==
The film's Hong Kong [[English language]] title is ''Righting Wrongs''. The international version (dubbed in English) is titled ''Above the Law'', which was also the title adopted for [[The Weinstein Company]]'s 2007 US DVD release on their [[Dragon Dynasty]] label.

==Plot==
Jason Ha Ling-ching (Yuen Biao) is a dedicated, by the books prosecutor who has tried to maintain patience and tolerance under the somewhat flimsy laws of the court. However, when his mentor is publicly gunned down in New Zealand and when the key witness of Ha's latest case and his entire family are wiped out over night, Ha can no longer go by the book.

Ha initial plan is to take the law into his own hands and kill the two men he believes called for his witness' murder. He is successful in killing the first, which causes the Hong Kong police department to wake up and take action to regain order. Enter Senior Inspector Cindy Si (Cynthia Rothrock), who is put on the case to find the killer under her superior, Superintendent Wong Ching-wai (Melvin Wong). However, when Ha goes to kill the second defendant, Chow Ting-kwong (James Tien), he is already dead. Unbeknownst to them, both of the defendants were working under an even higher power, known only as "Crown". However, it is soon discovered that "Crown" is none other than Superintendent Wong, who was also Chow's killer.

Once Si realizes that Wong is the true mastermind behind all of the recent murders taking place, she and Ha finally work together to bring him in to prove he is not "above the law". However, depending on the version of the story told, both Si and Ha fall victim to their ambition, with Si killed with a large screw through the neck by Wong and Ha falling to his demise after killing Wong in an out of control airplane. However, in another version of the story, Si survives her attack from Wong, and while Ha still kills Wong, he falls victim to a different, and rather ironic, fate: Ha is given an eight-year sentence in prison under the charge of manslaughter (English dub), or a life sentence in prison under the charge of First Degree Murder (Mandarin dub).

==Production information==
* Cynthia Rothrock was originally supposed to act in [[Jackie Chan]]'s 1987 film, ''[[Armour of God (film)|Armour of God]]'', Rothrock was declined. But due to Jackie Chan's injury halting production of the film, however Rothrock was reassigned to play as the lead actress in this film.
* This is Rothrock's personal favorite of her own films.
* The airplane stunt finale was shot in New Zealand, rather than Hong Kong.
* Supposedly, many of the times Rothrock was doubled, she would be doubled by stuntman and fight choreographer Meng Hoi.
* Rothrock did not speak Cantonese or Mandarin, so all of her lines were spoken in English and then later dubbed into the respective languages.
* According to Rothrock, despite being an impressive martial arts villain on screen in this film, actor Melvin Wong apparently had no formal martial arts training whatsoever prior to this film.
* According to Melvin Wong, the airplane hangar fight between him and Yuen Biao was "guest directed" by none other than [[Sammo Hung]].
*The film has two main versions in Cantonese and Mandarin the primary difference being additional scenes for the Mandarin version and another ending.

The '''Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation''' ('''RMMLF''') is a collaborative, educational [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to the scholarly and practical study of the law and regulations relating to mining, [[oil and gas]], energy, water, public lands, and related areas.&lt;ref name="rmmlf"&gt;{{cite web|title=RMMLF website|url=https://www.rmmlf.org/default.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Foundation is governed by a [[Board of Directors]] and guided by a [[Trustees]] Council that includes representatives from constituent law schools,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Washburn University School of Law, Student Organizations, http://washburnlaw.edu/students/organizations/&lt;/ref&gt; bar associations, and mining and oil and gas associations.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Denver University, Sturm College of Law website, http://www.law.du.edu/index.php/enrgp/research-sources&lt;/ref&gt; Leading legal, land, and other experts work as volunteers to the Foundation and its committees.

Through educational programs, the Foundation brings together lawyers, landmen, managers, government personnel, law faculty, students, and others involved in mineral, oil &amp; gas, water, and other resources.

==History==
The Foundation was organized in 1955 to provide broad educational coverage over a wide geographic area
to many practitioners and mineral company personnel who were interested in a field of law in which only a few
were expert, and to avoid duplication of effort among the law schools and industry organizations
interested in the problems of the rapidly developing mineral industry, particularly the oil and gas industry
in the Rocky Mountain area. The first institute brought mineral resources lawyers together to hear experts
talk on significant and timely subjects. The papers from the conference provided permanent reference material, which
was made available by publication of the Proceedings of the First Annual Institute. The Foundation has
continued to be a meeting place and focal point for lawyers and others
whose work brings them into contact with the legal aspects mining, oil and gas, energy, water, public lands, and related areas.

When the decline of the oil and gas industry occurred in the Rocky Mountain area in the early 1960s,
it was accompanied by increased activity in "hard rock" minerals. Commencing around 1965, the
Foundation gave increasing attention to mining law and to expansion into water law, as well as expanding
geographically into new areas of the west. This policy was put into effect in 1967 by adding to the Annual
Institutes a section for water lawyers, an innovation that has continued to the present time. The geographic expansion
might be considered as beginning with the 14th Annual Institute at Flagstaff, Arizona in 1968,
which also inaugurated a Landman's Section that has since been a regular feature of the Annual Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Victor H. Verity, "A Mini-View of the Past 25 Years," 25 ''Rocky Mt. Min. L. Inst.'' at xxxi (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation began a new era with the appointment of David P. Phillips as Executive Director in December 1970. The regions served have gradually expanded past the Rocky Mountains under the direction of Mr. Phillips, first to Canada and Mexico and then later to South America.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Lacy, "The Second Twenty-Five Years, A History of the Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Institute 1979-2004," 50 ''Rocky Mt. Min. L. Inst.'' at xix (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation today is a tribute to the foresight of its founders, who created a structure with a balance that has accommodated diverse opinions.

==Programs==
In fulfilling its goals, the Foundation carries out varied programs of interest to attorneys, landmen, management, government personnel, law faculty, students, and others involved in mining, oil and gas, energy, water, public lands, and related areas of natural resources law. These programs include annual and special institutes&lt;ref&gt;''See'' David E. Pierce, "The Renaissance of ''Law'' in the ''Law of'' Oil and Gas: The Contract Dimension," 42 ''Washburn Law Journal'' 909, 910 (Aug. 27, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and short courses in various locations around the world.&lt;ref name="rmmlf" /&gt;

===Summer Annual Institute===
The Foundation is probably best known for the Annual Institutes and the published ''Proceedings''
containing the scholarly papers presented at each of the Institutes. Annual Institutes were originally held on the campuses of member law schools such as the 
University of Montana at Missoula, the University of Utah at Salt Lake City, the University of New Mexico at
Albuquerque, and the University of Denver.

Institutes today are no longer held on-campus, with the most recent sites including Vancouver, Snowmass, San Francisco, Banff, Santa Fe, and Newport Beach.&lt;ref name="rmmlf" /&gt;

===Special Institutes and Short Courses===
The Special Institutes are intended to examine specific topics in depth. Some of the repeating core topics include Mining Agreements, Oil and Gas Agreements, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and Federal and Indian Oil and Gas Royalty Valuation and Management.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Russell Cnty. Sportsmen v. U.S. Forest Serv., 668 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Michael S. Freeman &amp; Meg Parish, "Supplemental NEPA Analyses: Triggers and Requirements," ''National Environmental Policy Act'' 6-1 (Rocky Mt. Min. L. Fdn. 2010)).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the format of a Short Course, an entire field of law is reviewed. Topics have included Mineral Title Examination and Oil and Gas Law. Short Courses on international law are routinely held both in the United States and countries around the world.

==Publications==
In addition to institutes and courses, the Foundation publishes a variety of educational materials:

* ''American Law of Mining'' — Mining legal treatise.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' United States v. Good, 257 F. Supp. 2d 1306 (D. Colo. 2003) (citing the ''American Law of Mining'')&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Law of Federal Oil and Gas Leases'' — Oil and gas legal treatise.&lt;ref&gt;Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation, Law of Federal Oil and Gas Leases (LexisNexis Matthew Bender)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Landman's Legal Handbook'' — Practical manual for landmen.
* ''Annual Proceedings'' — Compilation of papers presented at RMMLF Annual Institutes.
* ''Special Institute Materials'' — Papers presented at various Special Institutes.
* ''Digital Library''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOI website|url=http://www.doi.gov/library/electronic/rocky-mountain.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; — Online access to the ''Proceedings'' of the Annual Institutes and papers presented at Special Institutes.
* ''Mineral Law Newsletter'' — Current developments in mineral law.
* ''Water Law Newsletter'' — Current developments in water law.

* ''RMMLF Journal'' — Original and reprinted law review articles.

==Outreach==

===Grants===
The Grants Program was established by the Foundation in 1976 to promote scholarship, research, writing, teaching, and the study of mineral resources law and related fields at law schools around the country. Grants awards typically range from $2000 to $5000. Applications are evaluated by the RMMLF Grants Committee, with preference given to the Foundation's Constituent Law Schools and to projects having results of widespread utility and value such as the preparation of teaching materials, publications, and visiting lectureships on mining law, oil and gas law, energy law, water law, public land law and related areas.

===Scholarships===
The Scholarships Program consists of the Joe Rudd Scholarships, established in 1980 in honor of a prominent natural resources attorney in Alaska, and the RMMLF Scholarships, established in 1993.
Law students enrolled full-time at one of the Foundation's Constituent Law Schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lewis and Clark website|url=http://law.lclark.edu/live/news/3749-rocky-mountain-mineral-law-foundation-joe-rudd/law/offices/admissions/news/scholarships/}}&lt;/ref&gt; who demonstrate a commitment to the study of natural resources law are eligible to apply for tuition scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oklahoma College of Law, "Four students awarded national scholarships" (Jan. 23, 2012), http://www.law.ou.edu/blog/four-students-awarded-national-scholarships.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic and leadership ability as well as financial need are evaluated by the Foundation's Scholarships Committee consisting of volunteer attorneys. To date, 331 scholarships have been awarded, totaling almost $1.5 million.

The '''Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods''' is a [[select committee]] of the [[Parliament of Singapore]] that was formed on 11 January 2018 to examine and report on the problem of deliberate online falsehoods and to recommend strategies to deal with them.

The Committee is chaired by Deputy Speaker [[Charles Chong]] and consist of members; Home Affairs and Law Minister [[K Shanmugam]], Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and for Education [[Janil Puthucheary]], Social and Family Development Minister [[Desmond Lee]], Members of Parliament (MPs) [[Rahayu Mahzam]], Seah Kian Peng, [[Sun Xueling]] and [[Edwin Tong]], as well as Workers' Party MP [[Pritam Singh]] and Nominated Member of Parliament [[Chia Yong Yong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/select-committee-formed-to-study-deliberate-online-falsehoods-9851096|title=Select Committee formed to study deliberate online falsehoods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 3 April 2017, Minister of Law K Shanmugam called for a review of existing laws to combat [[fake news]]. He cited the websites ''The Real Singapore'' which published an article claiming that a commotion between Thaipusam participants and the police was sparked by complaints from a Filipino family, the ''States Times Review'' which mocked former President [[S. R. Nathan]] with an article claiming near-zero turnout for his funeral, and ''All Singapore Stuff'' which reported eye-witness account of a collapsed HDB roof at Punggol Waterway Terraces which fooled the police and civil defence to investigate.&lt;ref name="channelnewsasia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/government--seriously-considering--how-to-deal-with-fake-news-sh-8712436|title=Government ‘seriously considering’ how to deal with fake news: Shanmugam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister claimed that fake news, when not debunked, can quickly cause harm to Singaporeans, panic to public, waste emergency resources, and damage reputations of businesses and people. He also claimed that nasty people seek to profit from fake news and that foreign agencies and foreign governments seek to destabilise the government through fake news.&lt;ref name="channelnewsasia.com"/&gt;

During his keynote speech at "Keep It Real: Truth And Trust In The Media" conference on 19 June 2017, Shanmugam said the government has to maintain a strong climate of trust, and be able to counter misinformation spread online. He cited a recent government survey that supported his notion for stronger laws to combat fake news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/new-laws-fake-news-introduced-2018-shanmugam-053605318.html|title=New laws against fake news to be introduced in 2018: Shanmugam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reach.gov.sg/~/media/2018/press-release/media-release-on-findings-of-fake-news-poll-26-mar-2018.pdf|title=Findings of Poll on Attitudes towards Fake News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fake-news-singapore-reach-poll-survey-10077100|title=More than 70% in Singapore have come across fake news online: REACH poll|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanmugam claimed that Singapore has been "particularly vulnerable" to foreign influences via fake news. "If the distrust becomes deep-rooted, people will have serious doubts about the institutions, about leadership, about governance," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/shanmugam-law-to-combat-fake-news-to-be-introduced-next-year|title=Shanmugam: Law to combat fake news to be introduced next year|first=Judith|last=Tan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2018, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and Ministry of Law (MinLaw) published a Green Paper titled "Deliberate Online Falsehoods" detailing the need to establish a Select Committee to examine fake news threat in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/government-proposes-committee-study-how-deal-deliberate-online-falsehoods|title=Government proposes committee to study how to deal with deliberate online falsehoods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/dam/minlaw/corp/News/Annexe%20A%20-%20Green%20Paper%20on%20Deliberate%20Online%20Falsehoods.pdf | title=DELIBERATE ONLINE FALSEHOODS: CHALLENGES AND IMPLICATIONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 January 2018, 80 MPs present voted unanimously in Parliament to appoint a Select Committee of eight PAP MPs, one opposition MP and one NMP to study and report on the problem of deliberate online falsehoods and recommend strategies to deal with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/govt-sets-committee-study-problem-deliberate-online-falsehoods|title=Govt sets up committee to study problem of deliberate online falsehoods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public hearings==
The Select Committee convened public hearings from 14 March to 29 March 2018, lasting eight days in total, where 79 individuals and organisations were invited to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/select-committee-on-deliberate-online-falsehoods-79-hearings-10029818|title=Select Committee on deliberate online falsehoods invites 79 for public hearings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/select-committee-on-deliberate-online-falsehoods-begins-public-hearings-on-wednesday|title=Select Committee on deliberate online falsehoods begins public hearings on Wednesday|first=|last=hermesauto|date=13 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singaporean historian [[Thum Ping Tjin]] submitted a paper arguing that any legislation by the [[Parliament of Singapore|Singapore Parliament]] against online falsehood must also apply to the [[Government of Singapore|Singapore government]]. He argued that government's use of detention without trial between 1963 and 1988 during [[Operation Coldstore]] and [[Operation Spectrum]]. While the government has stated that the detainees were part of a communist plot or Marxist conspiracy to subvert the state, Thum claimed that the government has never produced any evidence to substantiate its claims nor have any detainees been brought to trial on the charges they were detained under. Thum argued that these justifications were false claims made by politicians of the ruling [[People's Action Party|People's Action Party (PAP)]] for the purpose of political gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/submissions-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate/submission-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate-online-falsehoods-parliament-of-singapore-984a7a2d6ee3|title=Submission to the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods, Parliament of Singapore|last=Thum|first=Ping Tjin|date=2018-02-26|website=Medium|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629045224/https://medium.com/submissions-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate/submission-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate-online-falsehoods-parliament-of-singapore-984a7a2d6ee3|archive-date=29 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March, the last day of the sitting of the Select Committee, [[Minister for Law (Singapore)|Law]] and [[Minister for Home Affairs (Singapore)|Home Affairs]] Minister [[K. Shanmugam]] questioned Thum about a paper he published in 2013 regarding Operation Coldstore and the formation of Malaysia''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/5320436/The_Fundamental_Issue_is_Anti-colonialism_Not_Merger_Singapore_s_Progressive_Left_Operation_Coldstore_and_the_Creation_of_Malaysia|title=&amp;#39;The Fundamental Issue is Anti-colonialism, Not Merger’: Singapore’s "Progressive Left", Operation Coldstore, and the Creation of Malaysia|first=Pingtjin|last=Thum|publisher=|journal=ARI Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said Thum fell short of the standards of an objective historian, saying that he "ignores evidence which you don't like, you ignore and suppress what is inconvenient and in your writings you present quite an untrue picture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-shanmugam-cross-swords-on-singapore-s-10087906|title=Historian Thum Ping Tjin, Shanmugam cross swords on Singapore's communism-related past - Channel NewsAsia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330212300/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-shanmugam-cross-swords-on-singapore-s-10087906|archive-date=30 March 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=30 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thum countered that his paper had been peer-reviewed and that no historian had stepped forward to contradict the central thrust of his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/shanmugam-historian-thum-ping-tjin-spar-communist-activities-1950s-1960s-123507433.html|title=Shanmugam, historian Thum Ping Tjin spar over communist activities in 1950s-1960s&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412130046/https://sg.news.yahoo.com/shanmugam-historian-thum-ping-tjin-spar-communist-activities-1950s-1960s-123507433.html|archive-date=12 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=12 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Channel NewsAsia]]'' and ''[[The Straits Times]]'' reported that Thum admitted that there were parts of the paper which he could have worded better, that some of his statements were misleading, and that he had not read nor bother to quote many of the accounts of some communist leaders as he felt that those accounts were unreliable. These included the first-hand accounts of [[Chin Peng]], the leader of the [[Malayan Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-shanmugam-cross-swords-on-singapore-s-10087906 Historian Thum Ping Tjin, Shanmugam cross swords on Singapore's communism-related past.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330212300/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-shanmugam-cross-swords-on-singapore-s-10087906 |date=30 March 2018 }} Channelnewsasia.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/shanmugam-grills-research-fellow-and-says-he-is-not-an-objective-historian|title=Minister K.

He insisted that "my overall point in my article that [[Operation Coldstore]] was fundamentally motivated by political, not security, reasons, stands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@pj_85357/follow-up-submission-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate-online-falsehoods-parliament-of-f1c34a2d9365|title=Follow up Submission to the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods, Parliament of…|last=Thum|first=Pingtjin|date=2018-05-03|website=Medium|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506152652/https://medium.com/@pj_85357/follow-up-submission-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate-online-falsehoods-parliament-of-f1c34a2d9365|archive-date=6 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil activists groups Community Action Network, Function 8, and ''Maruah'', as well as activists Kirsten Han, [[The Online Citizen|Terry Xu]], and Thum himself, criticised the open hearings, accusing the Select Committee of failing to adhere to its own terms of reference, and claiming the hearings had not been conducted in an open or consultative manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://singaporecan.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/civil-society-activists-criticise-singapores-select-committee-hearings/|title=Civil society activists criticise Singapore’s Select Committee hearings|date=2018-04-02|work=Community Action Network, Singapore|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728223334/https://singaporecan.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/civil-society-activists-criticise-singapores-select-committee-hearings/|archive-date=28 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/select-committee-to-look-into-complaints-on-public-hearings-10100610|title=Select Committee to look into complaints on public hearings: Charles Chong|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/maruah-slams-select-committees-confrontational-stance|title=Maruah slams Select Committee’s ‘confrontational stance’|work=TODAYonline|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter signed by 170 academics was submitted to Chong, criticising the hearing as an attempt to attack and destroy Thum's credibility and discredit his research, with the effect of stifling the freedom of expression and academic freedom in Singapore.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/thum-ping-tjins-submission-a-political-piece-and-he-must-expect-to-be-questioned-about-its|title=Thum Ping Tjin must expect to be questioned, says Charles Chong in response to open letter by academics|last=hermesauto|date=2018-04-17|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424225914/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/thum-ping-tjins-submission-a-political-piece-and-he-must-expect-to-be-questioned-about-its|archive-date=24 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180515163318165|title=Academic freedom faces 'grave threat' from parliament - University World News|website=www.universityworldnews.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515211935/http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180515163318165|archive-date=15 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-08-22|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from six of Thum's colleagues at the University of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia also expressed concerns about how Thum was treated at the hearing, saying that Thum's research, which Shanmugam had criticised, had "already met the rigorous standards of examination at Oxford and peer review by fellow historical experts on the region". The letter also expressed concerns about the "implications for academic freedom, and for freedom of expression in Singapore", saying that the hearing "appears designed to intimidate those who seek to publish the truth".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In response, Chong argued that it was Thum who had chosen to make a political point in his written submission to the Select Committee, and that while Thum was entitled to his views, he must expect to be questioned about his claims.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He also characterised Thum's submission as a "political piece" rather than an "academic dissertation".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Chong also released a report based upon attached emails between two trustees of Project Southeast Asia that were inadvertently copied to the Select Committee, showing email discussions between Thum and Philip Kreager from the University of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia regarding the drafting and sharing of a letter in support of Thum.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-appears-to-be-involved-in-coordinated-attempt-to-subvert|title=Historian Thum Ping Tjin appears to be involved in coordinated attempt to subvert parliamentary processes: Charles Chong|first=|last=hermesauto|date=30 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chong accused Thum of having "engineered" the open letter in support of himself, as well as getting Kraeger to canvass for support on his behalf.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Chong alleged "a coordinated attempt, with foreign actors involved, to try to influence and subvert our parliamentary processes".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Kreager called Chong's statement "clearly preposterous", insisting that the emails were merely to "exchange views", and accusing Chong of imagining a "conspiracy".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/allegations-conspiring-historian-thum-subvert-parliamentary-processes-preposterous-oxford|title=Allegations of conspiring with historian Thum to subvert parliamentary processes ‘preposterous’: Oxford academic|work=TODAYonline|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April, the [[Parliament of Singapore#Parliament Secretariat|Parliament Secretariat]] wrote to Thum to clarify his academic credentials following his claims to be a "research fellow in history" in his submission and holding "a visiting professorship in anthropology at Oxford University" during his oral testimony.

The [[United States military]] formerly excluded [[gay men]], [[bisexual]]s, and [[lesbians]] from service. In 1993, the [[United States Congress]] passed and President [[Bill Clinton]] signed a law instituting the policy commonly referred to as "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" (DADT) which allowed gay, lesbian, and bisexual people to serve as long as they did not reveal their sexual orientation. Although there were isolated instances in which service personnel met with limited success through lawsuits, efforts to end the ban on openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people serving either legislatively or through the courts initially proved unsuccessful.

In 2010, two federal courts ruled the ban on openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual service personnel unconstitutional, and on July 6, 2011, a federal appeals court suspended the DADT policy. In December 2010, the House and Senate passed and President [[Barack Obama]] signed the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]], and under its provisions, restrictions on service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual personnel ended as of September 20, 2011.

=== History ===

==== Early years ====
To train the new American Army in the latest military drills and tactics, General George Washington brought in  [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]] (1730–94), who had been an officer on the German General staff. Von Steuben escaped Germany where he was threatened with prosecution for homosexuality.  He joined Washington's army at Valley Forge in February 1778 accompanied by two young aides. Steuben became an American general, and a senior advisor to Washington. Despite rumors about his parties, there never was an investigation of Steuben and he received a Congressional pension after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History ; a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&amp;pg=PA1007|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

The first evidence of antipathy to homosexuals serving in the United States military dates from March 11, 1778, when Lieutenant [[Frederick Gotthold Enslin]] was drummed out of the [[Continental Army]] following his conviction at [[court-martial]] on charges of sodomy and perjury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Randy Shilts|title=Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the U.S. Military|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOAmL6JPCE0C&amp;pg=PA11|year=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1910s–1940s ====
The U.S. military discharged soldiers for homosexual acts throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century even in the absence of any explicit prohibition of sodomy. The [[Articles of War#United States|Articles of War of the United States]] of 1916, implemented on March 1, 1917, included Article 93 stating that any person subject to military law who committed "assault with intent to commit sodomy" shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.&lt;ref name="usni"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usni.org/news-and-features/dont-ask-dont-tell/timeline |title=Key Dates in US Policy on Gay Men and Women in the United States Military |publisher=usni.org |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was modified on June 4, 1920, to make the act of sodomy itself a crime.&lt;ref name="usni" /&gt; The change went into effect on February 4, 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/AW/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004163647/http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/AW/index.html|title=HyperWar: The Articles of War, Approved June 4, 1920|archivedate=October 4, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first express prohibition of homosexuality or homosexual conduct in the armed forces of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/USA0103.pdf|title=United States|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The several branches of the U.S. lacked a unified policy on service by homosexuals for most of their history. Before 1949, each tended to charge personnel caught engaging in homosexual conduct with sodomy, court-martial them, and issue them a dishonorable discharge. In 1940, psychiatrists [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] and [[Winfred Overholser]] formulated guidelines for psychiatric screening for military inductees. Both believed homosexuals should not be inducted, and neither proposed excluding all homosexuals from military service. Despite their recommendations, other psychiatrists and military officials made homosexuality a key component of the screening apparatus they recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Kaiser, ''The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1997), pp. ??&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|United States Army Surgeon General's]] office issued a circular in 1941 that for the first time classified "homosexual proclivities" as disqualifying inductees from military service. The [[United States Navy]] and the Selective Service adopted similar exclusionary policies.&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, 12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Women's Army Corps]] adopted a similar policy in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, 32&lt;/ref&gt; The Women's Army Corps instituted harsh screening policies for recruits, often based on physical appearance and gender conformity, in order to exclude lesbians from service. WAC policies also condoned heterosexual relationships with servicemen in order to discourage homosexual conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34473260|title=Creating GI Jane : sexuality and power in the Women's Army Corps during World War II|last=D.|first=Meyer, Leisa|date=1996|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231101449|location=New York|oclc=34473260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the mass mobilization and deployment of troops for operations in World War II, it became impractical to convene court-martial boards for homosexual conduct offenses. Commanders instead issued [[blue discharge]]s – a form of administrative [[military discharge]] – to homosexual personnel. The blue discharge, which was also issued disproportionately to [[African American]]s, was neither honorable nor dishonorable. However, blue discharge holders faced difficulties in civilian life because the blue discharge carried with it a negative association. The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] denied blue-discharge veterans the benefits of the [[G.I. Bill]] as a general policy.&lt;ref name = berube230&gt;Bérubé, 230&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, a policy directive ordered that homosexuals were to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists and discharged under Regulation 615-360, [[Section 8 (military)|section 8]].&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, 142–3&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, staff sergeant [[Allen Irvin Bernstein]], who was arrested in January 1944 by [[military police]] after a failed pickup attempt with another soldier, was confined in a psychiatric ward at [[Fort Lee, Virginia|Camp Lee, Virginia]], and discharged within a month.  He subsequently appealed the discharge decision, attaching a copy of his 140-page defense of homosexuality, ''Millions of Queers (Our Homo America)'', which, however, was ignored and remained forgotten and unpublished until rediscovered in 2010 by a researcher in the [[National Library of Medicine]].  Denied all veterans benefits, Bernstein continued to refile appeals with the Army until, 37 years later, the Army accepted his appeal and retroactively converted his blue discharge to an honorable discharge in 1981.&lt;ref name=outintro&gt;{{cite web|title=1940 Defense of Homosexuality: 'Millions of Queers (Our Homo America)':  Introduction|url=http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/1940-defense/intro-bernstein|website=outhistory.org|publisher=OutHistory|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue discharges were discontinued in May 1947 and replaced with two new headings, "general" and "undesirable".&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, 242&lt;/ref&gt; A general discharge was considered to be under honorable conditions though distinct from an "honorable discharge." An undesirable discharge was under conditions other than honorable, yet distinct from a "dishonorable discharge".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Army also changed its regulations to ensure that homosexuals would not qualify for general discharges.&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, a servicemember found to be homosexual but who had not committed any homosexual acts while in service received an undesirable discharge. Those found guilty of engaging in homosexual conduct were dishonorably discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Homosexuals in Uniform| work = [[Newsweek]] | date = 1947-06-09 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bjeJCGF5OiUC&amp;pg=PA163&amp; | accessdate = 2009-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, four honorably discharged gay veterans formed the [[Veterans Benevolent Association]], the first such organization.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, 110&lt;/ref&gt; It was primarily social in nature and its membership peaked at 100. The group disbanded in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;Katz, 635&lt;/ref&gt; and several of its members later formed the New York chapter of [[homophile]] advocacy group [[One, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Standard policy, 1949–1993 ====
In October 1949, the newly consolidated [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] standardized anti-homosexual regulations across all branches of the military: "Homosexual personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory."&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed legislation on May 6, 1950, creating the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], which became effective on May 31, 1951. It established a single justice system for the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Truman Signs Code of Service Justice|accessdate=March 31, 2014|date=May 7, 1950| newspaper=New York Times |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/05/07/84653060.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Article 125 forbids sodomy among all military personnel, defining an offender as "any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence."&lt;ref name="usni" /&gt;

The success of the armed forces in pre-screening self-identified gay and bisexual people from the 1940s through 1981 remains in dispute; during the [[Vietnam War]], some men pretended to be gay in order to avoid the draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kusch|first=Frank|title=All American Boys: Draft Dodgers in Canada from the Vietnam War|year=2001|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MnNYvkmBnoC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a significant number of gay and bisexual men and women did manage to pass through the screening process and serve in the military, some with special distinction.

For example, in the 1950s, the Navy medical doctor [[Thomas Anthony Dooley III|Tom Dooley]] received national fame for his anti-Communist and humanitarian efforts in Vietnam. He was forced to resign in March 1956 when found to have participated in homosexual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Shilts, ''Conduct Unbecoming: Gays &amp; Lesbians in the U.S. Military Vietnam to the Persian Gulf'' (NY: St. Martin's Press, 1993), 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy conducted the first official study on sexual orientation and the Navy regulations and rules. In 1957, the [[Crittenden Report]] found that gay-identified people were no more likely to be a security risk than heterosexual-identified people, but nevertheless recommended that homosexuals be excluded from service because "Homosexuality is wrong, it is evil, and it is to be branded as such."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Terry, ''An American Obsession: Science, Medicine, and Homosexuality in Modern Society'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999), 347&lt;/ref&gt;

San Francisco politician and gay rights campaigner [[Harvey Milk]] served in the United States Navy during the Korean War. He served aboard the submarine rescue ship USS Kittiwake (ASR-13) as a diving officer, later transferring to Naval Station, San Diego to serve as a diving instructor. In 1955, he was discharged from the Navy at the rank of lieutenant, junior grade, though whether his homosexuality was an issue in his discharge is doubted by researchers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Milk said numerous times that he was [[dishonorably discharged]] and claimed it was because he was gay, but [[Randy Shilts]] was skeptical of this claim, stating: "The Harvey Milk of this era was no political activist, and according to available evidence, he played the more typical balancing act between discretion and his sex drive." (p. 16) Scholar Karen Foss confirms his discharge from the Navy had no connection to his sexuality and states, "While exaggeration is a frequent campaign tactic, in Milk's case such embellishments served to demonstrate his willingness to be part of the political system while also maintain his distance from it." (See Foss, Karen. "The Logic of Folly in the Political Campaigns of Harvey Milk", in Queer Words, Queer Images, Jeffrey Ringer, ed. (1994), New York University Press. {{ISBN|0-8147-7441-5}}, p. 21.)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, a gay servicemember who had not committed any homosexual acts while in service generally received a general discharge, while those found to have engaged in homosexual conduct more often received undesirable discharges.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Gay servicemembers received a disproportionate percentage of undesirable discharges issued.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, beginning with [[Leonard Matlovich]], who was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, several high-profile court challenges to the military's regulations on homosexuality occurred, with little success, and when such successes did occur it was when the plaintiff had been open about his homosexuality from the beginning or due to the existence of the "queen for a day" rule, which stated that if a service-member was caught having sex with a person of the same gender they could avoid being discharged if the "member did not have a propensity of intent to engage in homosexual acts."&lt;ref name="GayTV"&gt;The "Queen For a Day Rule" stated that if a service-member was caught having sex with a person of the same gender they could avoid being discharged if  the "member did not have a propensity of intent to engage in homosexual acts."  {{cite book | title=Gay TV and Straight America | publisher=Rutgers University Press | author=Becker, Ron | year=2006 | location=Piscataway, New Jersey | page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] issued a new regulation on homosexuality that was designed to ensure withstanding a court challenge by developing uniform and clearly defined regulations and justifications that made homosexual status, whether self-applied or by the military, and conduct grounds for discharge (DOD Directive 1332.14 (Enlisted Administrative Separations), January 1981):

{{quote|Homosexuality is incompatible with military service. The presence in the military environment of persons who engage in homosexual conduct or who, by their statements, demonstrate a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct, seriously impairs the accomplishment of the military mission. The presence of such members adversely affects the ability of the armed forces to maintain discipline, good order, and morale; to foster mutual trust and confidence among service members; to ensure the integrity of the system of rank and command; to facilitate assignment and worldwide deployment of service members who frequently must live and work in close conditions affording minimal privacy; to recruit and retain members of the armed forces; to maintain the public acceptability of military service; and to prevent breaches of security.}}

The directive justified the policy and removed the "queen for a day" rule that had prompted some courts to rule against the armed forces. However, the intent of the policy had also been to treat homosexuality as being akin to a disability discharge and thus ensure that anyone found engaging in homosexual activity and/or identifying as gay, would be separated with an honorable discharge. The DOD policy has since withstood most court challenges, although the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has refused to weigh in on the constitutionality of the policy, preferring to allow lower courts and the [[United States Congress]] to settle the matter.

In the 1980s, many of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential candidates expressed an interest in changing the regulations concerning homosexuality in the armed forces, and, as American social mores changed, public opinion began to express more sympathy with gay people in armed forces, at least to the extent that investigations into a serviceman or -woman's sexual behaviour and/or orientation were seen as a witch-hunt. "Gays in the military" became a political issue during the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 Presidential campaign]], when Clinton, the Democratic candidate, promised to lift the military's ban on homosexual and bisexual people.

In 1992, the United States General Accounting Office published a report entitled ''Defense Force Management: DOD's Policy on Homosexuality'', that outlined the DOD policy on homosexuality and the reasons for it. The report also included excerpts from a previously unpublished 1988 Defense Personnel Security Research and Education Center study on homosexuality that made similar conclusions as the 1957 Crittenden Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Defense Force Management: DOD's Policy on Homosexuality |author=United States General Accounting Office |date=June 1992|id=GAO/NSIAD-92-98 |url=http://archive.gao.gov/d33t10/146980.pdf|accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some LGBT military personnel sought to overturn the military's ban on service by homosexuals. Among the earliest were [[Leonard Matlovich]], who fought to remain in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] after [[coming out]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = The Sexes: The Sergeant v. the Air Force | newspaper = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | date = 1975-09-08 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917785,00.html| accessdate = 2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Perry Watkins]], who was drafted in 1967 despite disclosing his homosexuality on his induction papers.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; District Court judge [[Gerhard Gesell]] ordered Matlovich's reinstatement in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than return Matlovich to duty, the Air Force offered him a cash settlement of $160,000, which Matlovich accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Shilts, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Army|Army]] tried to discharge Watkins several times, until the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ordered his reinstatement in 1989 and the [[United States Supreme Court]] refused to hear the case. The appellate court, however, did not rule the military policy unconstitutional in Watkins's case. Rather, it decided that simple equity mandated that the Army could not discharge Watkins for homosexuality when it knew of his sexual orientation all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court |litigants = Watkins v.

At the height of the push to rescind the ban before DADT, [[Miriam Ben-Shalom]] joined with other discharged personnel to form the [[Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Veterans of America]].

==== Don't ask, don't tell, 1993–2011 ====
{{Main|Don't ask, don't tell}}

[[File:USarmydefineshomosexuality.jpg|thumb|upright|Image from a U.S. Army training manual, 2001, regarding homosexuality]]

[[Don't ask, don't tell]] (DADT) is the common term for the policy restricting the United States military from efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those that are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service.

Following the implementation of DADT, the [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]] was formed to protect the rights of active duty personnel. Other organizations include [[Servicemembers United]] which formed in 2005 by veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Servicemembers United: History | publisher = Servicemembers United | url = http://servicemembersunited.org/?page_id=32 | accessdate = 2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and groups associated with West Point ([[Knights Out]]) and the Naval Academy ([[USNA Out]]).

Service members discharged under DADT continued to seek redress through the courts without success. Courts often cited the Supreme Court's 1986 decision in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', which upheld the constitutionality of state [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]]. After the Supreme Court reversed ''Bowers'' in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] ruled that the ''Lawrence v. Texas'' decision applies to Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which banned all acts of [[sodomy]]. In both ''United States v. Stirewalt'' and ''[[United States v. Marcum]]'', the court found Article 125 constitutional, but ruled that the "conduct falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court,"&lt;ref name = stirewalt&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: [http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm U.S. v. Stirewalt, September 29, 2004], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but also said that despite the application of ''Lawrence'' to the military, Article 125 could still be upheld in cases where there are "factors unique to the military environment" that would place the conduct "outside any protected liberty interest recognized in ''Lawrence''",&lt;ref name=marcum&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: [http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/02-0944.htm U.S. v.

Convictions for consensual sodomy have been overturned in military courts under the ''Lawrence'' in ''United States v. Meno''&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Meno ARMY 20000733&lt;/ref&gt; and ''United States v. Bullock''.&lt;ref&gt;SodomyLaws.org: [http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/usa/military/milnews052.htm US v. Bullock (2004)], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of reviewing the end of DADT, the Department of Defense's Comprehensive Review Working Group recommended repealing or amending Article 125 to eliminate any ban on consensual sodomy between adults.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defense: [http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_dadt/DADTReport_FINAL_20101130%28secure-hires%29.pdf "Report of the Comprehensive Review of the Issues Associated with a Repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'," November 30, 2010], accessed January 30, 2012; [[:File:DADT Defense Department report.pdf|comprehensive report]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major legal challenges to the DADT policy include ''[[Witt v. Department of the Air Force]]'' and ''[[Log Cabin Republicans v. United States]]''. The first ended in a negotiated settlement, but only after the lesbian plaintiff whom the Air Force tried to discharge won retirement with full benefits in 2011 as DADT neared its end. In the second, Federal Judge [[Virginia A. Phillips]] ordered the military on October 12, 2010, to suspend and discontinue any investigation or discharge, separation, or other proceeding that began under DADT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11528661 | work=BBC News | title=US ban on openly gay military personnel suspended | date=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of appeals and stays of her ordered followed in the fall of 2010 just as Congressional attempts to repeal DADT took shape.

An attempt to repeal DADT began in May 2010 when the House approved an amendment to the 2011 [[National Defense Authorization Act]]. It failed in September, when Sen. [[John McCain]] led a successful filibuster against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/09/21/senate.defense.bill/index.html?iref=allsearch |publisher=CNN | title=Senate halts 'don't ask, don't tell' repeal | date=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, after a second Senate filibuster, Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Susan Collins]] introduced the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. It passed the House of Representatives on December 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll638.xml|title=Final vote results for roll call 638|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.111hr2965|title=H.R.2965 – 111th Congress (2009–2010): Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 – Congress.gov – Library of Congress|publisher=|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate on December 18 by a vote of 65-31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/12/dadt.html|title=Senate Takes Historic Step, Repeals 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' [Updated]|author=Mike Vilensky|work=Daily Intelligencer|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Barack Obama signed the bill on December 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/22/AR2010122201888.html|title=Obama signs DADT repeal before big, emotional crowd|publisher=|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2010, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to suspend proceedings in the ''Log Cabin'' case. Instead, on July 6, 2011, that court, citing progress made by military officials in preparing for an end to DADT, ordered the government to cease enforcement of DADT while dismantling the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mears|first1=Bill|title=Appeals court suspends enforcement of 'don't ask, don't tell' policy|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/07/06/dadt.ruling/|accessdate=July 6, 2014|work=CNN|date=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeal was not immediate. The Department of Defense first reviewed its policies and guidelines and drafted implementation regulations. Then the President, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] certified that new regulations had been drafted and that the new regulations would not damage military cohesion and readiness. That certification triggered a 60-day waiting period at the end of which, on September 20, 2011, DADT expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/its-official-dont-ask-dont-tell-is-history/2011/03/03/gIQAq93yfK_blog.html|title=It's official: `Don't ask don't tell' is history|author=Greg Sargent|date=September 19, 2011|work=Washington Post|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Service academies =====
A research report that appeared in the journal ''[[Armed Forces &amp; Society]]'' at the end of 2011 said that military academy cadets opposed allowing homosexuals to serve openly in greater percentages than participants in ROTC did, and that both groups opposed such service to a greater degree than their civilian counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Morten G. Ender, et al., "Civilian, ROTC, and Military Academy Undergraduate Attitudes toward Homosexuals in the U.S. Military: A Research Note," ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'', January 2012, vol. 38, 164-172, [http://afs.sagepub.com/content/38/1/164.abstract abstract available online], accessed February 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Some news outlets viewed this as a negative reaction to the repeal of DADT earlier in the year,&lt;ref&gt;Huffington Post: [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/03/service-academy-gay-cadets_n_1070094.html Max J.

They wrote that the strong degree of anti-gay sentiment found among entering cadets declined somewhat during their time at the service academies: "Surprisingly, military culture appears to have made cadets more tolerant of gays and lesbians, not less."&lt;ref name=palmcenter&gt;[[Palm Center]]: [http://www.palmcenter.org/press/dadt/releases/usa_today_mischaracterizes_military_attitudes_about_dadt_repeal "USA Today Mischaracterizes Military Attitudes about DADT Repeal," December 28, 2011], accessed February 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Benefits =====
Despite the end of DADT on September 20, 2011, the same-sex spouses of gay and lesbian service members were not treated on a par with the different-sex spouses of military service members because of restrictions imposed by Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) and certain federal statutes that contain definitions of marriage that exclude same-sex couples. Same-sex spouses are denied death benefits, identification cards, base access, access to repatriation ceremonies, and other entitlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.military.com/news/article/military-gay-couples-wont-enjoy-benefits.html|title = Military Homosexual Couples Won't Enjoy Benefits|date = July 18, 2011|publisher = Military.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the Association of Bragg Officers Spouses (ABOS) denied membership to Ashley Broadway, the female spouse of a female Army officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Robbie|title=Army Wife Says She Was Excluded as a Lesbian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/us/north-carolina-army-wife-says-she-was-excluded-as-a-lesbian.html|accessdate=January 26, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the weeks of press coverage that ensued, Fort Bragg's commander said he lacked authority over the private organization while the [[U.S. Marines]] announced that clubs conducting business on base must admit same-sex spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fantz|first=Ashley|title=Marine Corps to spouse clubs: Allow same-sex members or you don't operate on base|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/10/marine-corps-to-spouse-clubs-allow-same-sex-members-or-you-dont-operate-on-base/ |accessdate=January 26, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ABOS offered Broadway a "special guest membership", which she declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Briggs|first=Bill|title=Army spouses club offers 'special guest membership' for same-sex wife|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/18/16576893-army-spouses-club-offers-special-guest-membership-for-same-sex-wife|accessdate=January 26, 2013|newspaper=NBC News |date=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, ''[[Military Spouse]]'' magazine named Broadway Fort Bragg's 2013 "Military Spouse of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Same-sex wife is Fort Bragg spouse of year |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/01/25/Same-sex-wife-is-Fort-Bragg-spouse-of-year/UPI-81931359160449/ |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |newspaper=UPI|date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, ABOS invited Broadway to join and announced that its membership was open to "any Spouse of an active duty commissioned or warrant Officer with a valid marriage certificate from any state or district in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officer's lesbian wife can join spouses club|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2013/01/ap-army-lesbian-invited-bragg-spouses-club-012613/|accessdate=January 26, 2013|newspaper=Army Times|date=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2013, Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] announced the Department's extension of certain military "additional benefits" to same-sex spouses which are not explicitly prohibited under the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], in addition to "member-designated benefits" which were already available to same-sex spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=15809|title = Statement from Secretary of Defense Leon E.

===== Discharge pay =====
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought suit in 2010 on behalf of servicemembers discharged for homosexuality who received only half the standard separation pay upon discharge. All were discharged under the DADT policy, but the ACLU said that the practice ante-dated the adoption of DADT.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/discharged-gay-service-members-sue-over-half-pay-policy/ James Dao, "Discharged Gay Service Members Sue Over 'Half-Pay' Policy," September 22, 2011], accessed February 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On January 7, 2013, the ACLU reached a settlement with the federal government in ''[[Collins v. United States]]'' that provided for the payment of full separation pay to servicemembers discharged under "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" since November 10, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner |first=Chris |title=Servicemembers Kicked Out Under Military's Gay Ban Since '04 To Receive Full Separation Pay|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/servicemembers-kicked-out-under-militarys-gay-ban|accessdate=January 7, 2013|newspaper=Buzz Feed|date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 181 were expected to receive about $13,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Muñoz|first=Carlo|title='Don't ask, don't tell' dischargees to receive full back pay from DOD|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/defcon-hill/policy-and-strategy/275971-service-members-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-receive-full-back-pay#ixzz2HKWfWEDG|accessdate=January 7, 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Veterans associations =====
The [[American Military Partner Association]] (AMPA) was formed in 2009 to enable the LGBT partners of servicemembers and veterans to provide support in areas where the military fails to and to advocate on behalf of equal treatment of those in same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swarns|first=Rachel L.|title=Military Rules Leave Gay Spouses Out in Cold|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/gay-spouses-face-a-fight-for-acceptance-in-the-military.html|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Less than honorable discharges =====
Following the end of DADT, approximately 114,000 servicemembers who had been separated from military service since WW II under the categories "other than honorable discharge", "general discharge", or "dishonorable discharge" became eligible to have their discharges amended. Those without an honorable discharge are often excluded from veterans benefits like health care and tuition assistance, and the lack of an honorable discharge can create a hurdle to employment in the civilian sector as well. The Armed Forces established procedures for processing such requests through the Military Department Board for Correction of Military/Naval Records or the Military Department's Discharge Review Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Pentagon sees no need for gay discharged troops bill|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/02/10/pentagon-sees-need-gay-discharged-troops-bill/|accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=Washington Blade |date=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, after advocates for gay and lesbian veterans complained about the process, Representatives [[Mark Pocan]] (D-Wisconsin) and [[Charles Rangel]] (D-New York) introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in the House of Representatives to codify the process and reduce inconsistencies. Pocan said the legislation represented the same policies as those currently in place, but was needed because "without having it in law, it could change at some date in the future with a different administration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner|first=Chris|title=Lawmakers Push Fix For Ousted Gay Service Members' Discharge Records|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/lawmakers-announce-bill-to-ensure-ousted-gay-servicemembers |accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=Buzz Feed|date=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Bar Association endorsed the legislation on November 21, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weiss|first=Deborah Cassens|title=Vets discharged under Don't Ask, Don't Tell should be allowed to seek change in records, ABA says|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/vets_discharged_under_dont_ask_dont_tell_should_be_allowed_to_change_milita/|accessdate=February 10, 2014 |newspaper=ABA Journal|date=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, 2014, Senator [[Brian Schatz]] (D-Hawaii) introduced the same legislation in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Schatz introduces bill for discharged gay veterans |url=https://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/01/30/schatz-introduces-bill-discharged-gay-veterans/|accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== After ''Windsor'' ====
On June 26, 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' that the statute under which the U.S. military was withholding benefits from servicemembers in same-sex marriages, Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], was unconstitutional. Secretary of Defense [[Chuck Hagel]] stated: "The Department of Defense welcomes the Supreme Court's decision [and] will immediately begin the process of implementing the Supreme Court's decision in consultation with the Department of Justice and other executive branch agencies. The Department of Defense intends to make the same benefits available to all military spouses—regardless of sexual orientation—as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCloskey|first1=Megan|last2=Carroll|first2=Chris|title=Supreme Court strikes down DOMA; Hagel promises benefits ASAP|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/supreme-court-strikes-down-doma-hagel-promises-benefits-asap-1.227671|accessdate=June 27, 2013|newspaper=Stars &amp; Stripes|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2013, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced that it would provide spousal and family benefits to servicemembers in same-sex marriages on the same terms as it does to those in different-sex marriages. The benefits, which include health care coverage, housing allowances, military ID cards, and survivor benefits, can be claimed retroactive to June 26, the day of the ''Windsor'' decision. A same-sex marriage must be documented by a marriage certificate that establishes that the marriage was valid where it was celebrated. The DoD also announced that servicemembers who need to travel to a jurisdiction that allows them to marry will be afforded up to 7 days leave to do so, up to 10 days if they are stationed outside the U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Chuck Hagel]] said: "This will provide accelerated access to the full range of benefits offered to married military couples throughout the department, and help level the playing field between opposite-sex and same-sex couples seeking to be married". The DoD set September 3 as its target date for implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Huetteman |first=Emmarie |title=Gay Spouses of Members of Military Get Benefits|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/us/politics/gay-spouses-of-members-of-military-get-benefits.html |accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulrine|first=Anna |title=Pentagon extends military spouse benefits to same-sex married couples|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2013/0814/Pentagon-extends-military-spouse-benefits-to-same-sex-married-couples|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the servicemember's commander determines the amount of leave to be granted based on the servicemember's unit responsibilities and specific situation. Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council, a longtime opponent of the end of "don't ask, don't tell", wrote that "It could well be argued that the new policy actively discriminates against opposite-sex couples, who receive no special leave for their weddings". DoD officials said the leave was for travel and cited Texas or South Korea as locations that pose problems for same-sex couples seeking to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shane III|first=Leo|title=DOD leave for same-sex marriage criticized|url=http://www.stripes.com/dod-leave-for-same-sex-marriage-criticized-1.236004|accessdate=August 19, 2013|newspaper=Stars and Stripes|date=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy does not apply to those in same-sex legal relationships other than marriage, such as civil unions and domestic partnerships.

The Veterans Administration has cited other federal statutes that define "spouse" and 'surviving spouse' The status of benefits for veterans in same-sex relationships was the subject of ongoing lawsuits.

===== Discrimination =====
In 2015, Defense Secretary [[Ash Carter]] added sexual orientation to the list of nondiscrimination protections under the military's equal opportunity program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/06/09/military-equal-opportunity-sexual-orientation-transgender/28740207/|title=Sexual orientation added to military's non-discrimination policy|author=Patricia Kime, Staff writer|date=June 9, 2015|work=Army Times|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, LGBT service members and veterans continue to face discrimination in the Veterans Health Administration.

===== Lawsuits and veterans benefits =====
Several [[McLaughlin v. Panetta|lawsuits on behalf of same-sex military spouses]] had challenged the constitutionality of DOMA and statutes that define "spouse" and "surviving spouse" as "a person of the opposite sex" when determining eligibility for veterans benefits.

On October 27, 2011, the [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]] (SLDN) had brought suit in federal court in Massachusetts on behalf of several military servicemembers and veterans in same-sex marriages. The benefits at issue in that case, ''McLaughlin v. Panetta'', included medical and dental benefits, basic housing and transportation allowances, family separation benefits, visitation rights in military hospitals, and survivor benefit plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/news/?ak=6798 |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=SLDN Takes Aim at DOMA |date=November 23, 2011 |work=[[Metro Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, the federal judge hearing the case asked the parties to explain by July 18 why the logic that found ''Windsor'' unconstitutional did not apply to that definition as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner|first=Chris|title=House Republicans Face Decision On Fighting Gay Veterans' Spousal Benefits|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/house-republicans-face-decision-on-fighting-gay-veterans-spo|accessdate=July 17, 2013|newspaper=BuzzFeed|date=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, the [[Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group]] BLAG, which had defended DOMA and the restrictive definitions of marriage acknowledged that "[t]he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3's constitutionality" but took no position on the other statutes except to say that the constitutionality of those definitions "remains open".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner |first=Chris |title=House Republicans Cave On Marriage Fight |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/house-republicans-cave-on-marriage-fight|accessdate=July 18, 2013|newspaper=BuzzFeed |date=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Justice told the court that it would not defend those statutes. BLAG asked to withdraw from a similar lawsuit in federal court in California, ''Cooper-Harris v.

A similar case involving only veterans benefits, ''[[Cardona v.

On July 19, 2013, [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) Secretary [[Eric Shinseki]] noted in a letter about the case that the statutory definitions of "spouse" and "surviving spouse" had yet to be invalidated by a court. The VA is waiting for guidance from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] on how ''Windsor'' applies to those statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phaneuf|first=Keith M.|title=Blumenthal, Norwich woman battle for equal benefits for veterans|url=http://www.ctmirror.org/story/2013/08/15/blumenthal-norwich-woman-battle-equal-benefits-veterans|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=Connecticut Mirror|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if that statutory limitation is invalidated, the VA's rules for establishing the validity of a marriage may restrict benefits to same-sex married couples residing in a jurisdiction that recognizes their marriage or who resided in the jurisdiction where they married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Serwer|first=Adam|title=DOMA is dead but gay vets remain in limbo|url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/06/28/doma-is-dead-but-for-veterans-doma-lives-on/|accessdate=August 17, 2013|newspaper=MSNBC|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Respect for Marriage Act]] sponsored by Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] and Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] eliminates the question of residence by establishing a rule for federal purposes that a marriage is valid if it was valid where celebrated.

On September 4, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]], as required by law, notified Speaker of the House [[John Boehner]] that the Obama administration had determined that it should not enforce the federal statutes that define ''spouse'' in a way that excludes same-sex spouses. He cited ''Windsor'' and the decision in ''Cooper-Harris'' the previous week as well as BLAG's withdrawal from litigation challenging the statutes in question. Advocates for same-sex spouses of veterans welcomed the announcement, but noted that the question of the rights of such spouses remained uncertain if they live in states that do not recognize their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Feds won't enforce law barring gay veterans from spousal benefits |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/09/04/doj-wont-enforce-law-barring-gay-veterans-spousal-benefits/ |accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that it would only provide benefits to the same-sex spouses of veterans who either (1) married in the state in which they resided or (2) live in a state that recognizes their marriage when they apply for benefits. On August 18, the American Military Partner Association filed an appeal in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] challenging the VA's interpretation of federal law. Their brief cited ''Windsor'' and many federal court decisions since ''Windsor'' that have held denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples unconstitutional. It said the VA's policy ruling "imports into federal law unconstitutional state definitions of marital status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Denniston |first1=Lye |title=Test of gap in veterans' benefits for same-sex marriages|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/08/test-of-gap-in-veterans-benefits-for-same-sex-marriages/|accessdate=August 22, 2014|work=SCOTUSblog|date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Veterans-benefits-appeal-CAFC.pdf AMPA v.

===== National Guard =====
In several states that do not recognize same-sex marriages–notably Oklahoma, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas–National Guard officials initially refused to comply with Department of Defense directives to allow the same-sex spouses National Guard members in their states to enroll in federal benefit programs, instead requiring such members to travel to federal facilities to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel Jr.|first=Richard A.|title=Texas and 5 Other States Resist Processing Benefits for Gay Couples|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/us/texas-and-5-other-states-resist-processing-benefits-for-gay-couples.html|accessdate=December 8, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guard officials in Oklahoma enrolled some same-sex couples until September 5, 2013, when Governor [[Mary Fallin]] ordered an end to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oklahoma Gov.

On November 6, Fallin announced that Oklahoma guard members could have benefits requests for same-sex spouses processed at federal facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Silas|title=Oklahoma National Guard will process same-sex spouse benefits at a few federal facilities|url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-national-guard-will-process-same-sex-spouse-benefits-at-a-few-federal-facilities/article/3901831|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=NewsOK|date=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, after DoD officials objected to that plan, Fallin ordered that all married couples would be required to have benefits requests processed at those facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Russell |title=Fallin: OK will no longer process benefits for National Guard couples|url=http://www.krmg.com/news/news/local/fallin-ok-will-no-longer-process-benefits-national/nbydX/|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=KRMG|date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 26, Texas agreed to conform with DoD policy stating that state workers would be considered federal workers while enrolling same-sex couples for benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Ann|last2=Campoy|first2=Ana|title=Texas National Guard to begin letting same-sex couples register for benefits|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/11/27/texas-national-guard-to-begin-letting-same-sex-couples-register-for-benefits/ |accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=Fox News|date=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana adopted a policy like that of Texas on December 3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Louisiana Nat'l Guard latest to process same-sex benefits|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/03/louisiana-natl-guard-latest-process-sex-benefits/|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Georgia Nat'l Guard to process same-sex benefits |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/09/georgia-natl-guard-process-sex-benefits/|accessdate=December 9, 2013 |newspaper=Washington Blade|date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mississippi the same week.&lt;ref name=all&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=All nat'l guards now compliant with Hagel edict on same-sex benefits|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/13/natl-guards-now-compliant-hagel-edict-sex-benefits/|accessdate=December 12, 2013|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, Secretary of Defense Hagel announced that all state national guard units were in compliance, though three of them–Oklahoma, Florida and South Carolina–allowed all guard members to apply for ID cards and benefits only at federal facilities. Some other states chose to place their state employees on federal status for the sake of processing such applications.&lt;ref name=all /&gt;

===== Sodomy =====
{{Main|Section 839(a) of title 10 United States Code § 925 - Article 125.}}

The [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014]] enacted in December 2013 repealed the ban on consensual sodomy found in Article 125 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Defense bill contains gay-related provisions |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/20/defense-bill-contains-gay-related-provisions/|accessdate=December 21, 2013|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Healthcare Needs and Provisions for Gay and Lesbian Military Veterans in the United States ====

In 2014, the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is providing healthcare services for approximately one million gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sherman|title=Communication between VA Providers and Sexual and Gender Minority Veterans: A Pilot Study|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|date=2014|doi=10.1037/a0035840 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, more gay and lesbian veterans will be seeking medical care.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; However, as noted by Sherman and her coauthors, there are many concerns regarding the healthcare needs of the gay and lesbian veterans, and many veterans do not feel that they have adequate and equitable healthcare services from the VHA.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; The researchers assert that veterans who are missing quality healthcare are less likely to maintain good health and positive well-being.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

===== Concerns from Gay and Lesbian Veterans =====
In their article, Sherman and her coauthors explain that in the past, most of the gay and lesbian veterans were uncomfortable in disclosing their sexual orientations or identities because they were afraid that this information could lead to their discharge from the military.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; With the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, gays and lesbians are assured that their sexual orientations will not be used against them.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Nonetheless, because of their previous experiences in the military, many gay and lesbian veterans are still worried that this information may jeopardize their future careers and prospects.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Because of societal stereotypes and stigmas, they are also worried that they may be denied medical service, lose their benefits, or receive inferior services.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

Sherman and her coauthors conducted a study on the communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, and some of them are having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

Similarly, another 2011 report states that lesbians often decline routine medical tests.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Gay men are not as likely to seek medical treatment when compared with heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Hence, some medical conditions and disorders may not be treated in a timely manner.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

However, Sherman and her co-authors point out that the missing patient-centered communication can affect the quality of medical treatment.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Sexual orientation and identity can have implications for the physical and mental health of the patient.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

According to the authors, since sexual identity and orientation is a contentious issue, many healthcare workers are not comfortable in approaching this topic.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; But if the physicians initiate the conversation, it is more likely that the veterans will provide this information.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Based on their data, if the gay and lesbian veterans can divulge information about their personal medical history, values, and preferences, they may experience higher levels of patient satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; It is also more likely for them to receive appropriate preventive care and diagnostic screenings for their unique health risks, such as sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; Moreover, comprehensive medical records can provide a multitude of information useful not only for medical treatments but also for evaluations, such as the fitness of the veterans for duty.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt;

===== Response from Veterans' Health Administration =====
To alleviate the concerns from the gay and lesbian veterans about discrimination and to address healthcare disparities, in 2013, the VHA has introduced some policy changes.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; For instance, the VHA has established the Office of Health Equity to oversee the gay and lesbian healthcare needs and to reduce the inequities in their healthcare provisions.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharpe|title=Ensuring Appropriate Care for LGBT Veterans in the Veterans Health Administration.|journal=Hastings Center Report|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These new developments mark a milestone in expanding the role of the government in improving healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; The VHA is instituting policies that focus on individualized care.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; They require healthcare providers to care for gay and lesbian patients in the same respectful and sensitive manner as other patients.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; Another policy is to redefine the meaning of "family" and allow the gay and lesbian veterans to decide who is regarded as part of their family.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; As of 2014, there are many discrepancies regarding this information. The information found on medical records is often inaccurate and may not clearly indicate the choice of the veterans.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; The VHA has also launched educational and training programs so that healthcare providers will have a better understanding of the psychological and social distresses of the gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt;

Since the gay and lesbian veterans are not asked to disclose information about their sexual orientation on medical forms,&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; the healthcare providers are often unaware of this information when they consider medical treatment options.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; In response to these concerns, the Institute of Medicine suggested that patients disclose such information on medical records. The information will be confidential and only used to assess health.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; The VHA is striving to prevent this information from being shared with other organizations.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; Sharpe and Uchendu suggest the option of incorporating open-ended questions to encourage the veterans to supply additional written information.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt;

Healthcare services for gay and lesbian veterans are not adequate.&lt;ref name=Sherman /&gt; The main purpose of the first steps of the VHA is to create a cordial culture and a welcoming environment for the gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt; Fostering a better relationship among the healthcare providers and the patients and encouraging the patients to provide more personal information can improve healthcare outcomes for the gay and lesbian veterans.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14121">'''Tacking''' is a legal concept arising under the [[common law]] relating to competing priorities between two or more [[security interest]]s arising over the same asset.  The concept is best illustrated by way of example.
# Bank A lends a first advance to the borrower, which is secured by a mortgage over the borrower's property.  The mortgage is expressed to secure this advance and any future advances.
# Bank B subsequently lends more money to the borrower and takes a second ranking mortgage over the same property.
# Bank A then subsequently lends a second advance to the borrower, relying on its original mortgage.
Bank A will always have a first priority claim against the property for the full amount of its first advance. But it will be able to claim against the property in priority to Bank B with respect to its second advance only if it is permitted to ''tack'' the second advance to the mortgage that was taken at the time the first advance was made.  If Bank A is not permitted to tack the second advance, then Bank B's claim in respect of the sums that it lent will have priority over Bank A's claims with respect to the second advance.

In American jurisprudence, ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines tacking in slightly narrower terms:

{{cquote|
1. The joining of consecutive periods of possession by different persons to treat the periods as one continuous period; especially the adding of one's own period of land possession to that of a prior possessor to establish continuous [[Adverse possession]] for the statutory period.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The joining of a junior [[lien]] with the first lien in order to acquire priority over an intermediate lien.
}}

Separately, in the definition of ''[[tabula in naufragio]]'', ''Black's'' comments:

{{cquote|
It may be fairly said that the doctrine survives only in the unjust and much criticised English rule of tacking.
}}

==The common law rules==

The first case which approached the position in relation to competing mortgagees was ''Gordon v Graham''.{{efn|''Gordon v Graham'', (1716) 2 Eq Cas Abr 598, 22 ER 502, as subsequently quoted in ''Hopkinson v Rolt'':&lt;ref name = "Hop1861"/&gt; "A. mortgages to B. for a Term of Years, to secure a Sum of £ already lent to A., as also such other Sums as should hereafter be lent or advanced to him. A. makes a second Mortgage to C. for a certain Sum, with Notice of the first Mortgage; and then the first Mortgagee, having Notice of the second Mortgage, lends a further Sum.... Per Cowper,C. The second Mortgagee shall not redeem the first Mortgage, without paying as well the Money lent after, as that lent before the second Mortgage was made; for it was the Folly of the second Mortgagee, with Notice, to take such Security."}} During the nineteenth century, its authority came to be doubted. It was questioned whether it had been correctly reported and, even if correctly reported, whether it correctly stated the law.

The matter subsequently came before the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Hopkinson v Rolt''.&lt;ref name = "Hop1861"&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Hopkinson v Rolt|link=|reporter=ER|fullstops=on|year=1861|num=641|volume=11|firstpage=829|pinpoint=|parallelcite=9 HL Cas 514|date=|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, the borrower entered into a mortgage over his land which was expressed to "secure the sums due and which shall from time to time become due" to the bank.  Later, the borrower granted a second mortgage in favour of another creditor.  Notice of the second mortgage was given to the bank.  The borrower was later declared [[bankrupt]], and a dispute arose as to the priority of the bank with respect to advances which were made under the first mortgage after it had received notice of the second mortgage.

The three law lords who heard the case were divided, with a majority favouring priority for the second mortgagee.  [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] (with whom [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] agreed), opined:

I must say that the doctrine [in ''Gordon v Graham''] seems to me to be contrary to principle. Although the mortgagor has parted with the legal interest in the hereditaments mortgaged, he remains the equitable owner of all his interest not transferred beneficially to the mortgagee, and he may still deal with his property in any way consistent with the rights of the mortgagee. How is the first mortgagee injured by the second mortgage being executed. . . ? The first mortgagee is secure as to past advances, and ''he is not under any obligation to make any farther advances'' (emphasis added). He has only to hold his hand when asked for a farther loan. Knowing the extent of the second mortgage, he may calculate that the hereditaments mortgaged are an ample security to the mortgagees; and if he doubts this, he closes his account with the mortgagor, and looks out for a better security.
}}

The dissenting judge, [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]], was in favour of upholding the rule in ''Gordon v Graham'' as it was reported.  He expressed his view in a dissenting opinion:

{{cquote|
I certainly had understood that in such a case, excluding all special circumstances, the first mortgagee would be secure for any subsequent advances covered by his security, even though he had notice of the second mortgage. This is so laid down on authority, has, I believe, been often acted on, and seems to me perfectly just and reasonable.

Mortgages are but [[contract]]s; and when once the rights of parties under them are defined and understood, it is impossible to say that any rule regulating their priority is unjust. If the law is once laid down and understood, that a person advancing money on a second mortgage, with notice of a prior mortgage covering future as well as present debts, will be postponed to the first mortgagee, to the whole extent covered or capable of being covered by the prior security, he has nothing to complain of. He is aware when he advances his money, of the imperfect nature of his security, and acts at his peril.

...

The rule ... is a convenient rule, causing injustice to no one. It has, probably, been often acted on, and to depart from it may, I think, retrospectively cause great injustice, and prospectively prevent advances of money by bankers or others, where such advances might be safely and usefully made.
}}

===Actual notice===

Although for years it had been supposed that it was sufficient for the first mortgagee to have either actual or [[constructive notice]] of the second mortgage, in ''Westpac Banking Corporation v Adelaide Bank Limited''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Westpac Banking Corporation v Adelaide Bank Limited|link=|court=NSWSC|num=517|year=2005|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=30 June 2005|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that constructive notice was not sufficient, and that a first mortgagee could tack future advances unless it had ''actual notice'' of the second ranking security.

===Effect of subordination===
Where a [[subordination agreement]] places a later mortgage in higher priority than one previously granted, the validity of releases granted by the previous mortgagors will have a significant impact on the priority assigned to each of the secured debts in question. In 2014, the [[Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador (Court of Appeal)|Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador]] held in ''Medoc Properties Limited v. Standard Trust Company''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Medoc Properties Limited v. Standard Trust Company|link=|year=2014|court=nlca|num=13|pinpoint=par. 27{{endash}}29|date=2014-03-04}}, citing {{cite book |last= Gilmore|first= Grant|year= 1965|title= Security Interests and Personal Property|volume= II|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PvUttCGR15EC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA1020#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= Boston|publisher= Little, Brown and Company|pages= 1020{{endash}}1021, 1032|isbn= 1-886363-81-1|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the failure by an assignee to release one of two assigned mortgages with respect to such an agreement resulted in differing priorities given to them.

==Term loans and overdrafts==

The common law rules relating to tacking have caused difficulty in relation to [[overdraft]]s and revolving loan facilities because of the rule in ''[[Devaynes v Noble|Clayton's Case]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Devaynes v Noble|link=Devaynes v Noble|reporter=ER|year=1816|num=677|volume=35|firstpage=767|pinpoint=|parallelcite= (1816) 1 Mer 529|date=9 March 1816}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided that in relation to any [[bank account|account]], payments into the account are presumed to discharge the earliest debts first. This has been held to have several effects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Sibbles v Highfern Pty Ltd|link=|court=HCA|num=66|year=1987|pinpoint=par. 11 (majority)|parallelcite=164 CLR 214|date=23 December 1987|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Where notice of a second mortgage is given, subsequent payments into the account are applied to reduce the overdraft existing at the time of the notice and, in effect, for the benefit of the subsequent mortgagee.&lt;ref&gt;''Deeley v. Lloyds Bank, Limited'', (1912) AC 756, discussed at {{cite book |last= Paget|first= John|year= 1922|title= The Law of Banking|edition = 3rd|url= https://archive.org/stream/lawofbankingpage00pageiala#page/74/mode/2up|location= London|publisher= Butterworth|pages= 74{{endash}}76|isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The subsequent mortgagee takes subject to the overdraft only at that time, that is to say, not subject to future advances, and the reduction of the overdraft correspondingly improves his security. If the overdraft is paid off, then any subsequent indebtedness will be by way of future advances and the bank mortgage will be postponed entirely in relation to the subsequent mortgage, although the bank mortgage does not cease to be effective between the bank and its customer, the mortgagor.&lt;ref&gt;''London and County Banking Company v. Ratcliffe'', (1881) 6 AC 722, at p 737, discussed at Paget, [https://archive.org/stream/lawofbankingpage00pageiala#page/394/mode/2up p. 394]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule is only a presumption of convenience, but in practice it is difficult to displace, and can have a devastating effect on the security rights of first mortgagees. For example, suppose a customer secures an overdraft with a mortgage against their house.  Then at a time when the overdraft stands at £100,000, the customer grants a second mortgage over their house as security for a term loan to another bank.  If over the following nine months, the customer was to pay £90,000 into the account and draw a further £70,000 out of the account, the amount owed to the first bank would be reduced to only £80,000, but they would only have first ranking security for a mere £10,000.  For the remaining £70,000 they would rank behind the second mortgagee.

Accordingly, in practice a bank will normally "break" an account when they receive notice of a subsequent charge over property which stands as security for an overdraft.&lt;ref&gt;In practice, most security documents provide that granting a subsequent charge is actually an event of default, and could potentially result in enforcement action by the bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory modification==

Ultimately, ''Hopkinson'' was thought to cause more inconvenience than it solved, and a number of common law jurisdictions have sought to modify the position by statute.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/49 s. 49], [[Land Registration Act 2002]] in the [[United Kingdom]], {{Cite canlaw|short title  =Property Law Act|abbr =RSBC|year =1996|chapter =377|section =28|link =http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96377_01#section28}} in [[British Columbia]], {{Cite Legislation AU|Qld|act|pla1974179|Property Law Act 1974|82}} in [[Queensland]] and {{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|name=Conveyancing and Property Ordinance|219|45}} in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modification in England and Wales===

The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] has modified the application of the common law rules in several respects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ellinger|first1= Eliahu Peter|last2= Lomnicka|first2= Eva Z.|last3= Hare|first3= Christopher V.M.|year= 2006|edition = 4th|title= Ellinger's Modern Banking Law|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rUKcAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA829&amp;ots=bhYS8kGxG4&amp;pg=PA829#v=onepage&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 829|isbn= 978-0-19-923209-3|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* With respect to [[Unregistered land in English law|unregistered land]], s. 94 of the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] enables further advances to be tacked onto a first mortgage if:

:: (b) the bank had no notice of the intervening mortgage at the time of the advance,{{efn|but s. 94(2) provides that, "where the prior mortgage was made expressly for securing a current account or other further advances," registration of the charge does not constitute notice if it was not registered in a local deed registry at the time of its creation}} or

:* With respect to [[Registered land in English law|registered land]], s. 49 of the [[Land Registration Act 2002]] provides that a bank may tack if:

'''''The Left Alternative''''' is a 2009 book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, Unger identifies problems with contemporary [[leftism]] and proposes a way to achieve the goals that he believes should be central to the progressive cause: inclusive economic growth through the heating up of politics and democratizing the [[market economy]], a relentless process of institutional innovation that depends less upon crisis for change, and depends more on shortening the distance between context-preserving and context-transforming moves. ''The Left Alternative'' was first published in 2006 as ''What Should the Left Propose?''{{sfn|Unger|2006}}

==Overview==

In ''The Left Alternative'', Unger describes the situation of the world today as a "dictatorship of no alternatives": a condition in which in the world seems to offer few alternatives for lifting the majority of people out of lives of poverty, drudgery, and belittlement.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=1-2}} [[Progressivism|Progressives]] content themselves with "humanizing the inevitable," merely softening the effects of existing institutions.{{sfn|Unger|2009|p=2}} Unger contends that there are fragments of alternatives being developed across the world, but these do not appeal to the West and often amount to "local heresies" that would not survive a sustained challenge.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=8-9}} What Unger proposes is a "universalizing heresy"—a set of ideas that are rooted in an attempt to achieve economic growth with social inclusion, and comprehensive and general enough to apply across the world. Such an alternative, envisioned by this universalizing heresy, would describe a narrow gateway through which all societies must pass on the way to creating actual difference.{{Clarify|reason=Must clarify what "creating actual difference" means|date=March 2018}}{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=8-11}}

Unger contends that the contemporary left is disoriented, bereft of any plausible or compelling alternatives to the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] consensus that has gained in authority and influence in the rich western countries, and missing as well the ideas to support such an alternative, agents to advance the alternative, or a crisis that would be an impetus for adopting the alternative.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=12-19}} But there is an alternative, Unger argues, one that would show how to combine both social inclusion and individual empowerment in political, economic and social institutions.{{sfn|Unger|2009|p=20}} This alternative would reshape production and politics, would refuse to see familiar forms of market economy, representative democracy and free civil society as necessary or canonical, would reject the contrast between [[Market economy|market-oriented]] and [[Command Economy|command-economy]] solutions as a focus of ideological contests, would focus more on equality and inclusion within a setting of economic growth and technological innovation, than on increasing equality by [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistribution]] through tax-and-transfer.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=20-21}} The solution would democratize and radicalize the market economy by innovating in its arrangements and rethinking its logic.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=21-22}} The overall aim of social policy would be to enhance individual capabilities through education and social inheritance, advance democratization of the market economy, and establish institutions of high-energy politics.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=21-22}} The guiding philosophy of Unger's proposal, he explains, is "not the humanization of society; it is the divinization of humanity."{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=23}} Unger sees this alternative as applicable across a broad range of richer and poorer societies, thus making possible a "universalizing heresy" that can oppose the universalizing orthodoxy promulgated by the rich Western countries on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=24, 37}}

The agents of this program, Unger explains, are workers who want to be [[Petite bourgeoisie|petty bourgeois]],{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=42-48}} and nations that want to be different.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=49-51}} The practice that has the most potential to spread the program throughout the world is "innovation-friendly cooperation," a set of practices currently concentrated in the best firms and schools, that have been highly successful in spreading technological innovations across the globe. But rather than leaving the practice of innovation-friendly cooperation within the confines of a global network of elite firms and schools, Unger proposes that these practices be nurtured and extended with the assistance of government, extending the benefits of innovation-friendly cooperation to classes and communities that have traditionally been excluded from these benefits.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=52-63}}

Unger sees this "left alternative" offering great potential for [[developing countries]], in helping them achieve both national difference{{Clarify|reason=clarify what "national difference" means|date=March 2018}} and prosperity for their citizens, while rejecting the neoliberal agenda that threatens to stifle real national difference{{Clarify|reason=clarify what "national difference" means|date=March 2018}} as the price of entry into global markets.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=64-82}} The left alternative offers a chance for European countries to reinvent and reinvigorate [[social democracy]], which has gradually been stripped of programs that represented democracy's most ambitious hopes of fostering individual freedom, prosperity, and dignity.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=83-97}} And Unger's proposal offers the United States a chance to enact a fitting sequel to the [[New Deal]], the promise of which was betrayed by decades of misguided progressive policies that alienated a great many of leftism's natural constituency and undermining the attempt to form a trans-racial progressive majority.{{sfn|Unger|2009|pp=98-132}}

According to Unger, an insidious tendency in world politics has been the manner in which [[globalization]], as it is currently practiced and proselytized, has become a "generic alibi for surrender" to the status quo, and a mechanism for suppression of promising political, economic, and social alternatives.{{sfn|Unger|2009|p=133}} Unger argues that the question should not be "how much globalization?" but rather "what manner of globalization?"{{sfn|Unger|2009|p=134}} The objective of Unger's progressive alternative is a "qualified pluralism: a world of democracies." {{sfn|Unger|2009|p=134}}

Unger concludes by describing two competing conceptions of the left. The first conception, the one that is preeminent today, is what Unger calls a "fake egalitarianism": an institutionally conservative leftism that is committed to greater equality of life chances, sought principally through redistributive tax-and-transfer.{{sfn|Unger|2009|p=150}} The second conception, the one for which Unger argues, is one that has the goal of making us bigger,{{Clarify|reason=clarify what "making us bigger"  means|date=March 2018}} both collectively and individually, and seeks equality only to the extent that inequality diminishes us and threatens us with indignity and privation.{{sfn|Unger|2009|p=152-153}} This second conception, rather than being institutionally conservative, would support a practice of institutional experimentation with the goal of democratizing the market, deepening democracy, and empowering individuals.{{sfn|Unger|2009|p=152}}

==Reception==

Reviewing ''The Left Alternative'' in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', [[Tom Nairn]] summarized Unger's ideas as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger sets out the following key idea: ‘The larger goal is a fuller mobilisation of national resources: a war economy without a war’, fostering ‘the institutions of a highenergy democracy’. Small nations can mean big, even universal lives and ideas; but they will go on requiring ‘a shield over national heresy’, a fostering of it, a mobilisation of resources ‘that allows petitioners to become rebels’.... His arguments are overwhelmingly prescriptive lists of institutional changes that few will find undesirable and fewer still could imagine being implemented in, say, Wales, Finland, Kurdistan, Taiwan or Basra.{{sfn|Nairn|2016|pp=5-7}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Nairn acknowledged the appeal of Unger's ideas, he concluded that the book was disappointingly general in its application: "Thinktank manifestos normally address a specific population in a specific tongue, before being translated (with appropriate changes) for others. But Unger’s are written in a synthetic fusion of legal American and Brazilian that seems to belong everywhere and nowhere.... Unger dwells on [a] weirdly anational plane."{{sfn|Nairn|2016|pp=5-7}}

Michael B. Mathias reviewed ''The Left Alternative'' in ''Marx and Philosophy''.{{sfn|Mathias|2010}} He wrote that ''The Left Alternative'' is "a concise introduction to [Unger's] recent thought, which has shifted towards a more pragmatic and [[Centrism|centrist position]]. Unger’s basic aimhere is to emancipate the world from‘the dictatorship of no alternatives’ by offering a constructive Leftist program." Mathias was critical of the book's ambitions: "Unger certainly captures the dismay that many of us feel in the face of an implacable neoliberal orthodoxy and the constriction of human possibilities that it entails. And he offers a welldeserved rebuke to those on the Left who have become institutionally conservative in attitude and abandoned any transformative ambition. Nonetheless, what Unger characterizes as the ‘first steps’ in a new direction seemmore like giant leaps given the political realities that presently constrain opportunities for change."{{sfn|Mathias|2010}}

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called ''The Left Alternative'' a "stimulating visionary manifesto."{{sfn|Publisher's Weekly review|1996}} The review went on to offer a mixed assessment of the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some readers will no doubt find his sweeping indictment of social democracy unfair, his co-optation of avant-garde management theory naive, and his celebration of change and upheaval utopian. Many of his proposals, like privatizating social services or making everyone hold a second job in the ""caring economy"" tending to the old, the young, the sick, the poor or the desperate (no, family members don't count), are ill thought-out. Still, he offers an incisive critique of social and economic discontents, one that turns traditional Marxist formulations on their heads (""we... are, in large numbers, petty-bourgeois now."") The result is a provocative challenge to left orthodoxies that should spur plenty of controversy and fresh thinking.{{sfn|Publisher's Weekly review|1996}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Critique: Journal of Socialist Theory]]'' reviewed the book as follows: "''The Left Alternative''—previously named ''What Should the Left Propose?'' (2005)—presents itself as a proposal for the Left to change the world and offers many crucial ‘directions’ to the Left in order to achieve genuine democracy."{{sfn|Buddharaksa|2013|pp=137-142}} The review concludes that "this book provides some interesting proposals to change the world. However, the author does not entirely deny the existing economic and political systems but attempts to reform, reshape and improve them. This book should be recommended to anyone who questions the legitimacy of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] world and to those who have faith in the idea that ‘another world is possible’."{{sfn|Buddharaksa|2013|pp=137-142}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9059">{{Judicial remedies}}
{{Equitable doctrines}}
'''Tracing''' is a legal process, not a remedy, by which a claimant demonstrates what has happened to his/her property, identifies its proceeds and those persons who have handled or received them, and asks the court to award a proprietary remedy in respect of the property, or an asset substituted for the original property or its proceeds.  Tracing allows transmission of legal claims from the original assets to either the proceeds of sale of the assets or new substituted assets.

Tracing ordinarily facilitates an [[equitable remedy]], and is subject to the usual limitations and bars on equitable remedies in [[common law]] countries.  In many common law countries, there are two concurrent processes, '''tracing at common law''' and '''tracing in equity'''.  However, because the right to trace at common law is so circumscribed,&lt;ref&gt;At common law, to trace the property must be identifiable and distinguishable from other property, see ''Taylor v Plumer'' (1815) 3 M&amp;S 562&lt;/ref&gt; the equitable process is almost universally relied upon, as equitable tracing can be performed into a mixed fund.

==Illustrations==
"Tracing is thus neither a claim nor a remedy. It is merely a process by which a claimant demonstrates what has happened to his property, identifies its proceeds and the persons who have handled or received them, and justifies his claim that the proceeds can properly be regarded as representing his property." - ''Foskett v. McKeown''

For example, if A has money in a solicitor’s account and the solicitor takes that money to buy a painting, then A may be able to make a claim against the painting. This claim will take priority even if the solicitor is bankrupt and has other unsecured claims against him.

Judicially, probably the most famous example of a tracing claim is ''[[A-G for Hong Kong v Reid|Attorney‐General for Hong Kong v Reid]]'' [1994] 1 AC 324, [1994] 1 NZLR 1 (PC), where Mr Reid, then a crown prosecutor for [[Hong Kong]], received bribes for passing information to [[organized crime|organised crime]] in Hong Kong.  Under [[Hong Kong]] law, the proceeds of those bribes were held on [[constructive trust]]s for the government of Hong Kong.  Mr Reid then invested the proceeds of the bribes in land in [[New Zealand]], and the land increased substantially in value.  When he was caught, Mr Reid admitted that the money was subject to a constructive trust, but argued that he should only be liable to repay the amount of the bribes, and then any profit attributable to the increase in value of the land in New Zealand was not connected with his wrongdoing.  However, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] held that the government of Hong Kong's claim to the money could be traced into the land, and thus the claimant was entitled to the full value of the land, as without his wrong, Mr Reid would never have made those profits and it would be grossly inequitable for him to keep them.

==Advantages==
Tracing claims have two key advantages to claimants.
* Firstly, they are a ''proprietary remedy'' (as opposed to a simple ''personal claim'') which means that, if the defendant is [[insolvent]], then the claimant can take title to the goods, rather than just receiving an award of damages which may be of little value against a defendant in [[bankrupt]]cy.  However, in some countries tracing may also lead to the award of a personal remedy where for some reason a proprietary remedy is not appropriate (i.e. it would upset ''pari passu'' distribution upon insolvency, where it would not be appropriate to do so).&lt;ref&gt;Ordinarily the courts are quite comfortable ordering a proprietary remedy because, if the defendant had no legal claim to the original assets, there is no loss to the defendant's creditors if that asset is removed from the pool available to pay creditors.  To order otherwise would be to allow the defendant's creditors to benefit at the claimant's expense.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Secondly, as demonstrated in ''AG for Hong Kong v Reid'', where the wrongdoer has made a profit, it allows the claimant to recover a greater amount than their original loss.  The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] applied the same reasoning in ''Foskett v McKeown'' [2001] AC 102 where the claimants sought to enforce their rights against a third party.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Foskett'', the deceased had paid two annual premiums of a life insurance policy with money misappropriated from a trust fund.  The deceased later committed suicide, and the court upheld the claim of the defrauded beneficiaries of the trust against the children of the deceased, even though the children would have been entitled to the same payout even had the two relevant annual premiums had not been paid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
The law of tracing is enormously complex, even to practitioners.  Characteristically, tracing claims tend to involve fraud, and as a result most claims (and case law) are against the background of a complex factual matrix.  However, the law itself is also complex, and a number of key aspects of the law remain ambiguous in many countries.
* Equitable tracing requires a ''fiduciary relationship'', while common law tracing does not.  However, this relationship does not need to have existed before the misappropriation took place.&lt;ref&gt;The Court of Appeal in "Re Diplock"  [1948] 1 Ch 465 saw "Sinclair v Brougham" [1914] AC 398 as requiring a fiduciary relationship before equitable tracing would be allowed. However both "Chase Manhattan Bank v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd" [1981] Ch 105 and "Westdeutsche Landesbank GiroZentrale v Islington London Borough Council" [1996] AC 669 expanded this by illustrating that a proprietary interest in the form of a constructive trust can arise upon theft or fraud, creating a fiduciary relationship between thief and true owner.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this difference between [[common law]] and [[Equity (law)|equity]] has been criticized by [[Lord Millett]] and [[Lord Steyn]] in ''Foskett v McKeown'', though they stopped short of deciding that the traditional precondition to equitable tracing should be overruled.&lt;ref&gt;Shalson v Russo [2003] EWHC 1637; [2005] Ch 281&lt;/ref&gt;
* The wrongdoer may mix the misappropriated funds with his own money, and then purchase an asset with the mixed fund.&lt;ref&gt;The commonly held rule is that the wrongdoer is presumed to spend his own money first, and the misappropriated funds later (Re Hallett's Estates), but this conflicts with other authorities (Re Oatway).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where there are multiple innocent claimants.&lt;ref&gt;Authorities suggest that the innocent claimants should be treated rateably (''Keefe v Law Society of NSW'' (1998) 44 NSWLR 451), but left open the question where the claimants are not equally innocent, or where some claimants have exhibited carelessness in their own affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where there is mixing of the funds by an innocent volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Re Diplock'' [1948] 1 Ch 465 and ''Gertsch v Atsas'' [1999] NSWSC 898 where charities were the recipient of misappropriated funds.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defences==
In most jurisdictions, there are several reasonably well establishing defences to tracing claims, although the case law is not entirely consistent.  The common defences to an equitable tracing claim are:
#good faith purchaser for value and without notice
#dissipation
#discharge of a debt (such that the proceeds are no longer traceable and there is no substitute asset)
#innocent change of position (usually, but not always, by an innocent third party&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Gertsch v Atsas'' [1999] NWSC 898&lt;/ref&gt;)

Importantly, in each case it is only the ''remedy'' of tracing that is lost.  The claimant may well still enjoy a ''personal'' claim against the wrongdoer, even though they may have lost their proprietary right to trace into substituted assets.

==Remedies==
In common law countries there are a variety of remedies that can be imposed when the court is satisfied that an equitable tracing claim has been made.  The principal remedies are:
#an election to take the property (or a ''[[resulting trust]]'')
#an [[equitable charge]] over the property
#an [[account of profits]], secured by an [[Security interest#Equitable lien|equitable lien]]
#a [[constructive trust]]

If an asset appreciates in value, the claimant may be well advised to claim proprietary right in the asset (no.1 and 4). If an asset depreciates in value, the claimant would be better off if he acquires a charge or lien over the asset (no. 2 and 3) as he can still enforce the whole amount of the charge against the asset and recover the balance via a personal action.

The '''Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons''' (TPNW), or the '''Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty''', is the first legally binding international agreement to comprehensively prohibit [[nuclear weapon]]s, with the goal of leading towards their [[Nuclear disarmament|total elimination]]. It was passed on 7 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gladstone|first1=Rick|title=A Treaty Is Reached to Ban Nuclear Arms. Now Comes the Hard Part.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/world/americas/united-nations-nuclear-weapons-prohibition-destruction-global-treaty.html|work=The New York Times |date=July 7, 2017 |accessdate=August 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title= Treaty banning nuclear weapons approved at UN: Supporters hail step towards nuclear free world as treaty is backed by 122 countries |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/07/treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons-approved-un|work=The Guardian |date=July 7, 2017 |accessdate=August 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to come into effect, signature and [[ratification]] by at least 50 countries is required. For those nations that are party to it, the treaty prohibits the development, testing, production, stockpiling, stationing, transfer, use and threat of use of nuclear weapons, as well as assistance and encouragement to the prohibited activities. For nuclear armed states joining the treaty, it provides for a time-bound framework for negotiations leading to the verified and irreversible elimination of its nuclear weapons programme.

According to a mandate adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in December 2016,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/un-general-assembly-approves-historic-resolution/ UN General Assembly approves historic resolution], ICAN, 23 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; negotiations on the treaty began in the [[United Nations]] in March 2017 and continued from 15 June to 7 July 2017. In the vote on the treaty text, 122 were in favour, 1 voted against ([[Netherlands]]), and 1 abstained ([[Singapore]]). 69 nations did not vote, among them all of the [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapon states]] and all [[Member states of NATO|NATO members]] except the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=UNTextAndVote&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/ptnw/index.html|title=United Nations Conference to Negotiate a Legally Binding Instrument to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons, Leading Towards their Total Elimination, 27 April to 22 May 2016 |website=www.un.org|language=EN|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
The nuclear-weapon-ban treaty, according to its proponents, will constitute an "unambiguous political commitment" to achieve and maintain a nuclear-weapon-free world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/OEWG/2016/Documents/WP34.pdf Working paper 34] submitted to the UN open-ended working group on nuclear disarmament, Geneva, 11 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike a comprehensive [[nuclear weapons convention]], it was not intended to contain all of the legal and technical measures required to reach the point of elimination. Such provisions will instead be the subject of subsequent negotiations, allowing the initial agreement to be concluded relatively quickly and, if necessary, without the involvement of nuclear-armed nations.&lt;ref name=article36&gt;{{cite web|title=Banning nuclear weapons without the nuclear armed states| url=http://www.article36.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Banning-without.pdf | publisher=Article36 | date=October 2013 | accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Proponents of the ban treaty believe that it will help "stigmatize" nuclear weapons, and serve as a "catalyst" for elimination.&lt;ref&gt;Reaching Critical Will and Article 36, [http://www.article36.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AR06_TREATY_REPORT_27.4.14.pdf "A treaty banning nuclear weapons"] (May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Around two-thirds of the world's nations have pledged to work together "to fill the legal gap" in the existing international regime governing nuclear weapons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icanw.org/pledge/ Humanitarian Pledge] initiated by Austria on 9 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and view a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty as one option for achieving this objective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/OEWG/2016/Documents/WP36.pdf Working paper 36] submitted to the UN open-ended working group on nuclear disarmament, Geneva, 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear weapons – unlike [[chemical weapons]], [[biological weapons]], [[anti-personnel landmines]] and [[cluster munitions]] – are not prohibited in a comprehensive and universal manner.&lt;ref&gt;Article 36 and Reaching Critical Will, [http://www.article36.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/A36-RCW-gaps-table-updated.pdf "Filling the legal gap: the prohibition of nuclear weapons"] (April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) of 1968 contains only partial prohibitions, and [[nuclear-weapon-free zone]] treaties prohibit nuclear weapons only within certain geographical regions.

== Overview of provisions ==
The ''preamble'' of the treaty&lt;ref name=finalDraft /&gt; explains the motivation by the "catastrophic consequences" of a use of nuclear weapons, by the risk of their sheer existence, by the suffering of the ''[[hibakusha]]'' (the surviving victims of the 1945 [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]) and the victims of nuclear tests, by "the slow pace of nuclear disarmament" and by "the continued reliance on nuclear weapons in military and security concepts" like [[Nuclear deterrence|deterrence]]. It recognizes "the disproportionate impact of nuclear-weapon activities on indigenous peoples". It expresses compliance with existing law: the [[UN charter]], [[international humanitarian law]], [[international human rights law]], the very first UN resolution adopted on 24 January 1946, the NPT, the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] and its verification regime, as well as [[nuclear-weapon-free zone]]s. Furthermore, the "inalienable right" of a peaceful use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] is emphasized. Finally, social factors for peace and disarmament are recognized: [[Women's rights|participation of both women and men]], education, public conscience, "international and regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, religious leaders, parliamentarians, academics and the ''hibakusha''".

''Article 1'' contains prohibitions against the development, testing, production, [[military reserve|stockpiling]], stationing, transfer, use and [[threat]] of use of nuclear weapons, as well as against assistance and encouragement to the prohibited activities. Finally, any direct or indirect "control over nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices" is forbidden.

''Article 2'' requires each party to declare whether it had nuclear weapons of their own or deployed on its territory, including the elimination or conversion of related facilities.

''Article 3'' requires parties that do not possess nuclear weapons to maintain their existing IAEA safeguards and, if they have not already done so, to accept safeguards based on the model for non-nuclear-weapon states under the NPT.

''Article 4'' sets out general procedures for negotiations with an individual nuclear armed state becoming party to the treaty, including time limits and responsibilities. If that state has eliminated its nuclear weapons before becoming a party to the treaty, an unspecified "competent international authority" will verify that elimination, and the state must also conclude a safeguards agreement with the IAEA to provide credible assurance that it has not diverted nuclear material and has no undeclared nuclear material or activities. If that state has not yet destroyed its arsenal, it must negotiate with that "competent international authority" a time-bound plan for the verified and irreversible elimination of its nuclear weapons programme, which will submit it to the next meeting of signing states or to the next review conference, whichever comes first.

''Article 5'' is about national implementation. ''Article 6'' obliges to environmental remediation and to assistance for the victims of the use and testing of nuclear weapons. According to ''Article 7'', states should assist each other to these purposes, with special responsibility of the nuclear powers. More generally, all state parties shall cooperate to facilitate the implementation of the treaty. ''Article 8'' fixes meetings of states parties, the costs of which are shared by the states according to the UN scale of assessment (''Article 9''). ''Articles 10–12'' are about the possibility of amendments, the settlement of disputes and the "goal of universal adherence of all States to the Treaty".

According to ''Articles 13–15'', the treaty was open for signature from 20 September 2017 at the UN headquarters in New York. The "Treaty shall enter into force 90 days after the fiftieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession".

== History, intentions and impact ==

=== Preparations, 2010–2016 ===
[[File:UN working group on nuclear disarmament, May 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Nations debate the idea of a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty at the UN in Geneva in May 2016.]]
Proposals for a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty first emerged following a review conference of the NPT in 2010, at which the five officially recognized nuclear-armed state parties – the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China – rejected calls for the start of negotiations on a comprehensive [[Nuclear weapons convention]]. Disarmament advocates first considered starting this process without the opposed states as a "path forward".&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wright, [http://www.icanw.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/nptrevcon2010.pdf "Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference 2010: towards nuclear abolition"] ICAN June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a less technical treaty concentrated on the ban of nuclear weapons appeared to be a more realistic goal.&lt;ref name=article36 /&gt;

Three major intergovernmental conferences in 2013 and 2014 on the "humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons", in Norway, Mexico and Austria, strengthened the international resolve to outlaw nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Reaching Critical Will, [http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/disarmament-fora/hinw "Humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons"] Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, n.d. retrieved 10 July 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; The second such conference, in Mexico in February 2014, concluded that the prohibition of a certain type of weapon typically precedes, and stimulates, its elimination.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wright, [http://www.icanw.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NayaritReport-email.pdf "Nayarit — a point of no return"] ICAN April 2014, 20 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a group of non-nuclear-armed nations known as the [[New Agenda Coalition]] (NAC) presented the idea of a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty to NPT states parties as a possible "effective measure" to implement Article VI of the NPT, which requires all states parties to pursue negotiations in [[good faith]] for nuclear disarmament. The NAC argued that a ban treaty would operate "alongside" and "in support of" the NPT.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=NPT/CONF.2015/PC.III/WP.18 Working paper 18] submitted to the NPT preparatory committee meeting, New York, 2 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[UN General Assembly]] established a working group with a mandate to address "concrete effective legal measures, legal provisions and norms" for attaining and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N15/409/95/PDF/N1540995.pdf?OpenElement UN General Assembly resolution 70/33], adopted 7 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, it adopted a report recommending negotiations in 2017 on a "legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/majority-of-un-members-declare-intention-to-negotiate-ban-on-nuclear-weapons-in-2017/ "Majority of UN members declare intention to negotiate ban on nuclear weapons in 2017"], ICAN media release, 19 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, the [[United Nations General Assembly First Committee|First Committee]] of the UN General Assembly acted upon this recommendation by adopting a resolution that establishes a mandate for nuclear-weapon-ban treaty negotiations in 2017 (with 123 states voting in favour and 38 against, and 16 abstaining).&lt;ref&gt;ICAN [http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/results/ Voting result] on UN resolution L.41, adopted 27 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea was the only country possessing nuclear weapons that voted for this resolution, though it did not take part in negotiations.&lt;ref name=Voting&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/voting-on-un-resolution-for-nuclear-ban-treaty/|title=Voting on UN resolution for nuclear ban treaty |publisher=[[International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons|ICAN]] |date=23 December 2016 |accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thakur&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2016/11/04/commentary/world-commentary/rattling-nuclear-cage-look-terrified/#.WbJypLKGPIU|title=Rattling the nuclear cage, and look who is terrified|authorlink=Ramesh Thakur |first=Ramesh |last=Thakur |newspaper=[[Japan Times]]|date=4 November 2016|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|First source cited is primary and doesn't say this, making claim OR; second source opinion piece and not sufficiently reliable|date=September 2017}}

A second, confirmatory vote then took place in a plenary session of the General Assembly in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/71/PV.68|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First negotiations and draft, March 2017===
From 27 to 31 March 2017, convened as the United Nations Conference to Negotiate a Legally Binding Instrument to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons, Leading Towards their Total Elimination, a first round of negotiations was held at UN headquarters in New York, with the participation of 132 nations. At the end, the president of the negotiating conference, [[Elayne Whyte Gómez]], permanent representative of [[Costa Rica]] to the [[UNOG|UN in Geneva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/missions.nsf/(httpPermanentMissions_en)/65264F2B528DDEEDC1256F4100451ED4?OpenDocument|title=Where global solutions are shaped for you - Permanent Missions - Permanent Mission of the Republic of Costa Rica to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva|first=United Nations Office of|last=Geneva|website=www.unog.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; called the adoption of a treaty by 7 July "an achievable goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/report-on-the-march-negotiations/| title=ICAN's report on the March negotiations| publisher=The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons| date=19 April 2017| accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from governments, international organizations and civil society, such as the [[International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons]], noted the positive atmosphere and strong convergence of ideas among negotiating participants. They agreed that the week’s debates had set the stage well for the negotiations in June and July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/report-on-the-march-negotiations/|title=ICAN's report on the March negotiations {{!}} ICAN|website=www.icanw.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarizing the discussions, a first ban treaty draft&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icanw.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DraftTreaty.pdf Draft Convention on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons], submitted by the President of the Conference&lt;/ref&gt; was presented on 22 May by Elayne Whyte Gómez.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/draft-un-nuclear-weapon-ban-released/ Draft UN nuclear weapon ban released], The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, 21 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The German section of the [[International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons]] (ICAN) highlighted Article 1, 2a &lt;!---unclear---&gt; prohibiting any stationing of nuclear weapons on their own territory. Hence, several NATO states – Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Turkey – would have to end contracts on [[Nuclear sharing|nuclear sharing]] with the USA before they possibly could sign the negotiated ban treaty.&lt;ref name="ICANEntwurf1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Erster Entwurf für Atomwaffenverbot präsentiert|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=ICANW Deutschland|url=http://www.icanw.de/neuigkeiten/erster-entwurf-fuer-atomwaffenverbot-praesentiert/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=28 May 2017|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=23 May 2017|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 2010, the German [[Bundestag]] had decided with large majority to withdraw nuclear bombs from Germany, but it was never realized.&lt;ref name="focus2015"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/sprengkraft-von-80-hiroshima-bomben-neue-us-atomwaffen-in-deutschland-stationiert-scharfe-kritik-aus-russland_id_4962247.html | title=Neue US-Atomwaffen werden in Deutschland stationiert - Russland übt scharfe Kritik| periodical=Focus Online | date=21 September 2015| accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in June 2017 foreign minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] confirmed again nuclear stationing in Germany as well as the principle of equilibrium [[nuclear deterrence]] against Russia. He stated that consequently Germany could not support the ban process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deutschland drückt sich vor einem Atomwaffenverbot|trans-title=|periodical=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|publisher=|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/un-verhandlungen-deutschland-drueckt-sich-vor-einem-atomwaffenverbot/19935054.html|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=15 June 2017|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Xanthe Hall|date=15 June 2017|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The only NATO member participating in the treaty negotiations was the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/negotiations/ |title=Frequently asked questions - Which nations are participating in the negotiations? |publisher=ICAN |date=31 May 2017 |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Article 1, 1c (in extension of Article 1, 2a) prohibits direct or indirect control of nuclear weapons. Accepting this provision would preclude a common European nuclear force or German financing of and limited decision on the French [[force de frappe]]; both options are sometimes discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Braucht die EU die Bombe?|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=Zeit Online|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2017-02/trump-nato-atomwaffen-europa/komplettansicht|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=28 May 2017|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Peter Dausend und Michael Thumann|date=16 February 2017|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Second session, June–July 2017 ===
A second conference started at 15 June and was scheduled to conclude on 7 July 2017. 121 out of 193 UN members participated in the negotiations.&lt;ref name="staaten2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/ptnw/participants.html  |title=United Nations Conference to Negotiate a Legally Binding Instrument to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons, Leading Towards their Total Elimination – Participants |editor=United Nations |date=July 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the discussions about Article 1, several states pleaded for an explicit prohibition of nuclear military planning, others of financial assistance to development and production of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Tim Wright |url=http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/blog/ |title=Blog: Countdown to nuclear ban negotiations, 16/06/2017 23:40, Discussion on prohibitions |editor=ICAN |date=2017-06-16 |accessdate=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, these additions were rejected, but remained implicitly included in Article 1 (d) - (e).

On 27 June, a second draft was published.&lt;ref name=2ndDraft&gt;{{cite web| url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/unoda-web/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/A-CONF.229-2017-CRP.1-Rev.1.pdf | title=Draft Convention on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Update Submitted by the President of the Conference| publisher=United Nations | date=27 June 2017| accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now offered a precise "join and destroy" option for nuclear armed states: States joining the treaty "shall submit, no later than sixty days after the submission of its declaration, a time-bound plan for the verified and irreversible destruction of its nuclear weapons programme to be negotiated with the States Parties" (Article 4, 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/UN-treaty-envisions-total-elimination-of-nuclear-arms | author=Ariana King |title=UN treaty envisions total elimination of nuclear arms| periodical=[[Nikkei Asian Review]] | date=28 June 2017| accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AchesonDraft2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/nuclear-weapon-ban/reports/NBD2.9.pdf | author=Ray Acheson |title=Running through draft two | publisher=Reaching Critical Will, Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom | date=28 June 2017| accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second "destroy and join" option (Article 4, 5) only provides cooperation with the [[IAEA]] in order to verify the correctness and completeness of the inventory of nuclear material, no verification of the elimination. This has been changed in the final text. A further discussed topic was the explicit acceptance of the "use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination".&lt;ref name=AchesonDraft2 /&gt; The respective affirmation remained part of the final preamble.

A third draft was presented on 3 July 2017.&lt;ref name=3rdDraft&gt;{{cite web |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/unoda-web/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/A-CONF-1.229-2017-L.X-E-tracked-from-Rev.1-03.07.17-1824-formatted.pdf |title=Draft Convention on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons | author=The President of the Conference |date=3 July 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A last obstacle for agreement was the condition of the withdrawal clause, meaning that a state party "in exercising its national sovereignty, [...] decides that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the Treaty have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country". The majority perspective was that this condition is subjective, and no security interests can justify genocide, nor can mass destruction contribute to security. However, as also a neutral withdrawal clause not giving reasons was not accepted by the minority, the respective Article 17 was accepted as a compromise. Safeguards against arbitrary use are the withdrawal period of twelve months and the prohibition of withdrawal during an armed conflict.&lt;ref name=AchesonDraft3&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/nuclear-weapon-ban/reports/NBD2.13.pdf | author=Ray Acheson |title=And the text goes to translation | periodical=Nuclear Ban Daily, Vol. 2, No. 13 | publisher=Reaching Critical Will, Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom | date=6 July 2017| accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==
=== UN member states === 
According to the [[International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons|International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)]], a coalition of [[non-governmental organizations]], leading proponents of a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty include Ireland, Austria, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and Thailand.&lt;ref name="positions-ican"&gt;[http://www.icanw.org/why-a-ban/positions/ "Support for a ban"], ICAN website&lt;/ref&gt; All 54 nations of Africa (all but one of which have either signed or ratified the 1996 [[African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty|Treaty of Pelindaba]] establishing a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the continent)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/OEWG/2016/Statements/02May_African%20Group.pdf Statement of the African Group] to the UN open-ended working group on nuclear disarmament, Geneva, 2 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and all 33 nations of Latin America and the Caribbean (already in a nuclear-weapon-free-zone under the 1967 [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/OEWG/2016/Documents/WP15.pdf Working paper 15] submitted to the UN open-ended working group on nuclear disarmament, Geneva, 12 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; had subscribed to common regional positions supporting a ban treaty.  The 10 nations of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), which concluded the [[Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty]], participated in the negotiations, but Singapore abstained from the vote.&lt;ref name=UNTextAndVote /&gt; Many Pacific island nations are also supportive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/OEWG/2016/Documents/WP14.pdf Working paper 14] submitted to the UN open-ended working group, Geneva, 3 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear-armed nation]] has expressed support for a ban treaty; indeed, a number of them, including the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[https://vienna.usmission.gov/impact-of-nuclear-weapons-explosions/ US statement] to the Vienna Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, 8 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/(httpNewsByYear_en)/29A8C553DF0103E3C12580110038F4C1?OpenDocument Russian statement] to the Conference on Disarmament, Geneva, 16 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; has expressed explicit opposition. North Korea was the only nuclear state to vote for initiating ban negotiations.&lt;ref name=Voting /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thakur /&gt;{{Better source|date=September 2017|reason=See the other "better source" tag about the same issue}}

Many of the non-nuclear-armed members of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), along with Australia&lt;ref&gt;Ben Doherty, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/australia-isolated-in-its-hesitation-to-sign-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons "Australia resists nuclear disarmament push because it relies on US deterrent"], The Guardian, 16 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20161028/p2a/00m/0na/010000c "U.S. 'nuclear umbrella' drove Japan's vote against U.N. resolution"], Mainichi Japan, 28 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; are also resistant to a ban treaty, as they believe that US nuclear weapons enhance their security.&lt;ref name="positions-ican"/&gt; A statement was put forward by several NATO members (not including France, the United States, nor the United Kingdom, the nuclear weapon states within NATO), claiming that the treaty will be 'ineffective in eliminating nuclear weapons' and instead calling for advanced implementation of Article VI of the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/1com/1com16/eov/L41_Poland-etal.pdf|title=Taking forward multilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations - Explanation of Position on behalf of the following states: Albania, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the treaty's adoption, the permanent missions of the United States, the United Kingdom and France issued a joint statement indicating that they did not intend "to sign, ratify or ever become party to it". After stating that the instrument clearly disregarded the realities of the international security environment, they said accession to it was "incompatible with the policy of nuclear deterrence, which has been essential to keeping the peace in Europe and North Asia for over 70 years".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/353174842/Joint-Press-Statement-by-UK-France-US-on-nuclear-ban-treaty Joint Press Statement from the Permanent Representatives to the United Nations of the United States, United Kingdom and France following the adoption of a treaty banning nuclear weapons] 7 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to government position in a number of nations, several recent opinion polls – including Australia,&lt;ref&gt;International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) [http://www.icanw.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NielsenPoll.pdf Poll 2014: 84%] of 1501 people conducted by Nielsen (Australia)&lt;/ref&gt; and Norway&lt;ref&gt; International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)[http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/public-and-parliamentary-support-for-a-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons/ "Public and parliamentary support for a treaty banning nuclear weapons 2016: 77%"], 11 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; – have shown strong public support for negotiating an international ban on nuclear weapons. The Netherlands voted against adoption of the treaty, while Germany did not participate, despite opinion polls against presence of nuclear weapons in both countries.&lt;ref name=support&gt;International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)[http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/public-and-parliamentary-support-for-a-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons/ "Public and parliamentary support for a treaty banning nuclear weapons" 2016: 85%], 11 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) [http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/german-public-rejects-nuclear-weapons/ "German public rejects nuclear weapons 2016: 93% "], 23 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; An example of consensus between government and majority opinion is Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) [http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/8-out-of-10-swedes-want-the-government-to-ban-on-nuclear-weapons/ "Eight out of 10 Swedes want the government to pursue a ban on nuclear weapons"], 26 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil society ===
The ICAN has been the main civil society actor working alongside governments to achieve a strong and effective ban treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Bolton and Elizabeth Minor, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12343/abstract "The Discursive Turn Arrives in Turtle Bay: The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons' Operationalization of Critical IR Theories"], ''Global Policy'' (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] has also championed an agreement to prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons,&lt;ref&gt;International Committee of the Red Cross, [https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/weapons/nuclear-weapons "Nuclear weapons"]&lt;/ref&gt; describing the UN working group recommendation to negotiate a ban in 2017 as "potentially historic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://astanatimes.com/2016/08/icrc-reiterates-calls-for-nuclear-weapons-prohibition-setting-timeframe/ "ICRC Reiterates Calls for Nuclear Weapons Prohibition, Setting Timeframe"], ''Astana Times'', 24 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of scientists from around the world signed an open letter in support of the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://futureoflife.org/2017/03/27/3000-scientists-support-un-nuclear-ban-negotiations/ Hawking, Higgs and Over 3,000 Other Scientists Support UN Nuclear Ban Negotiations], Future of life Institute, 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a July 2017 public statement endorsed by over 40 Buddhist, Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders and groups, "Faith Communities Concerned about Nuclear Weapons" called for universal adoption of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Baruah |first=Jamshed |date=2017-07-08 |title=Faith Groups Urge Universal Adoption of UN Nuclear Ban Treaty |url=https://www.indepthnews.net/index.php/armaments/nuclear-weapons/1237-faith-groups-urge-universal-adoption-of-un-nuclear-ban-treaty |work=IDN-InDepthNews |access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a high-profile Vatican conference in November 2017, the first major international disarmament gathering following the treaty's adoption in July, [[Pope Francis]] took a stance further than his papal predecessors to condemn the possession of nuclear weapons and warn that nuclear deterrence policies offer a "false sense of security."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/716f909db5a141599614bcf9253895d9|date=November 11, 2017|title=Pope asks leaders to imagine a world without nuclear weapons|last=Winfield|first=Nicole|website=[[Associated Press|AP]]|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/pope-francis-condemns-nuclear-arsenals-breaking-with-papal-history/article36928172/|date=November 13, 2017|title=Pope Francis condemns nuclear arsenals, breaking with papal history|last=Pullella|first=Philip|website=The Globe and Mail, Canada|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/pope-condemns-possession-nuclear-weapons-shift-churchs-acceptance-deterrence|date=November 10, 2017|title=Pope condemns possession of nuclear weapons in shift from church's acceptance of deterrence|last=McElwee|first=Joshua J.|website=National Catholic Reporter|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xanthe Hall ([[IPPNW]] and ICAN) said she regretted the boycott of the treaty by all nuclear powers and their allies, but hints at history: also the [[Mine Ban Treaty]] or the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]] have been concluded against the states possessing such weapons, but finally were signed by most states. The request of a nuclear ban could only weaken the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), regarding that the nuclear forces were blocking multi-lateral disarmament negotiations since 1995, instead were planning modernization and rearmament. Therefore, they would abdicate from their responsibility of disarmament according to the NPT, Article VI. Then the danger would grow that in reaction other nations felt less stronger bound to non-proliferation. By contrast, the nuclear weapon ban treaty would aim at a new disarmament dynamics, hence would much more recover than weaken the NPT.&lt;ref&gt;Xanthe Hall, [http://www.fr.de/politik/meinung/gastbeitraege/verbot-von-atomwaffen-berlin-boykottiert-atomwaffen-konferenz-a-1253725 Berlin boykottiert Atomwaffen-Konferenz], [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], 2 April 2017, retrieved 6 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[NATO Review]]'', Rühle indicated that according to proponents, it was intended to strengthen Article VI of the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), which requires good faith efforts to negotiate effective measures on nuclear disarmament. Sceptics have argued that the Ban Treaty would harm the NPT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2017/Also-in-2017/nuclear-weapons-ban-treaty-scepticism-abolition/EN/index.htm The Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty: reasons for scepticism], Michael Rühle, NATO Review, 19 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentarians===
[[File:Global Parliamentary Appeal for a Nuclear Weapons Ban.jpg|thumb|right|A global appeal for a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty, signed by 838 parliamentarians in 42 countries.]]
Political parties supporting the government in NATO member states often share the rejection of the nuclear ban negotiations and treaty by their governments. However, in May 2016 the Dutch parliament adopted a motion urging the government to work for "an international ban on nuclear weapons".&lt;ref&gt;nonukes.nl [http://nonukes.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/BZ119750C_Motion-Servaes-PvdA-C.S._NL-should-actively-work-start-negotiations-international-treaty.pdf Parliamentary motion] proposed on 28 April and adopted on 17 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 2016, a majority of Norwegian parliamentarians signalled their support for a ban,&lt;ref&gt;Norwegian People's Aid, [https://www.npaid.org/News/News-archive/2016/Norway-s-Parliament-wants-a-ban-on-nuclear-weapons "Norway's parliament wants a ban on nuclear weapons"], 10 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; while in Germany, the Bundestag opted in 2010 for nuclear disengagement by a large majority.  Nevertheless, Norway and Germany did not participate in the negotiations, while the Netherlands voted against the treaty.

In response to an appeal made by ICAN, over eight hundred parliamentarians around the world pledged their support for a ban treaty, calling upon "all national governments to negotiate a treaty banning nuclear weapons and leading to their complete eradication" and describing it as "necessary, feasible and increasingly urgent". The countries they represent included members of both the world's existing [[nuclear-weapon-free zone]]s as well as NATO states. Of the five nuclear-armed permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], the United Kingdom was the only one to have elected representatives lend their support to the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) [http://www.icanw.org/projects/appeal Global Parliamentary Appeal for a Nuclear Weapons Ban] (ongoing)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Solomon Islands}}
The '''Solomon Islands Truth and Reconciliation Commission''' ('''TRC''') is a commission officially established by the government of [[Solomon Islands]] on september, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa43/001/2009/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-19 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been formed to investigate the causes of the [[ethnic violence]] that gripped Solomon Islands between 1997 and 2003.&lt;ref name=st&gt;{{cite news |title=PM Sikua Announces TRC Team |url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=3919|work=[[Solomon Times]]|date=27 April 2009|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is the first of its kind in the [[Pacific Islands]] region.&lt;ref name=rnz&gt;{{cite news |title=Solomons Commission claims broad support |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=46291|work=[[Radio New Zealand International]]|date=30 April 2009|accessdate=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to "address people's traumatic experiences during the [[History of the Solomon Islands#Civil war|five-year ethnic conflict on Guadalcanal (1999–2004)]]". Its goal is to promote national unity and reconciliation. The members of the TRC will hear testimony from witnesses and victims of the violence, which killed over 100 people and displaced more than 20,000 internal refugees nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/confronting-past-better-solomon-islands "Confronting the Past for a Better Solomon Islands"], ''International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is modelled after the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] of South Africa, which was chaired by then [[Archbishop]] [[Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref name=australian/&gt; Tutu, a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient, has taken an active role in the establishment of the TRC in Solomon Islands.&lt;ref name=australian/&gt;

==Background of the conflict==
Solomon Islands descended into ethnic violence between 1997 and 2003. Much of the violence was committed by rival ethnic gangs from the islands of [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Malaita]].&lt;ref name=australian&gt;{{cite news |first=Rowan|last=Callick|title=Solomon Islands gets Desmond Tutu truth help |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25401194-16953,00.html |work=The Australian|date=29 April 2009|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gangs took advantage of ethnic tensions between Malaitan settlers on Guadalcanal and the island's indigenous residents. The [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]], which was made up by indigenous residents of the island of Guadalcanal, fought for several years with the [[Malaita Eagle Force]], a [[militia]] group consisting mainly of residents and settlers from [[Malaita]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news |title=Solomons launches truth inquiry |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8024369.stm|work=BBC News  |date=29 April 2009|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups fought for political power, jobs and land rights, especially on the island of Guadalcanal.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

The violence was finally quelled by the Australian-led [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI), which was invited into the country by the government of former Prime Minister [[Allan Kemakeza]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=australian/&gt; RAMSI finalised operations in Solomon Islands as of 30 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defence.gov.au/defencenews/stories/2013/aug/0806.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the Commission==
{{see also|Truth And Reconciliation Commission Act}}
[[File:Archbishop-Tutu-medium.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] supported the creation of the TRC in Solomon Islands.]]
In late August 2008, [[Sam Iduri]], Minister for Peace and Reconciliation, introduced a Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill to the [[National Parliament of Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref name="RNZI_41836"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=41836 |title=Solomon Islands moves closer to establishing truth and reconciliation commission |date=4 September 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, it was reported that Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, would visit the Solomons in April to assist in setting up the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=3512|title=Archbishop Tutu to Visit Solomon Islands |last=Basi|first=Joy|date=29 April 2009|publisher=Solomon Times|accessdate=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has contributed approximately {{A$}}500,000 towards the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.&lt;ref name=australian/&gt;

===Commission members===
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is composed of five members, three of which are citizens of the Solomon Islands, while two others were chosen from outside of the country.&lt;ref name=st/&gt; There are three men and two women.

The National Selection Committee was charged with choosing the five members of the TRC. The Chairman of the National Selection Committee, [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Solomon Islands Supreme Court]] Sir [[Albert Palmer (judge)|Albert Palmer]], submitted the names of the proposed members to the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands on 22 April 2009, as required by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Act of 2008]] (TRC Act, 2008).&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

The [[Prime Minister of Solomon Islands]] [[Derek Sikua]] announced the five members of the TRC on 27 April 2009, two days before the launch of the Commission.&lt;ref name=st/&gt; Sikua thanked the selection committee for working to choose the members of the commission. "I also wish to thank our people for their participation and in thanking them, I wish to call on our people to help the Truth and Reconciliation Commission because without the Truth there can be no true reconciliation and thus no lasting national [[peace]], unity and healing."&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

By law, the members of the TRC must begin their investigations within fourteen days of their appointment by Prime Minister Sikua.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

The five members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) are:&lt;ref name=st/&gt;
*Reverend [[Sam Ata]] of [[Malaita Province]], Solomon Islands. (Chairman)
*[[George Kejoa]] of [[Guadalcanal]], Solomon Islands.
*[[Caroline Laore]] of [[Western Province, Solomon Islands]]
*[[Ratu]] [[Joni Madraiwiwi]] of [[Fiji]]
*[[Sofia Macher]], a [[human rights activist]] from [[Peru]]. (Deputy Chair)

==Opening of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission==

The Commission was officially launched on 29 April 2009, at the [[Lawson Tama Stadium]] in [[Honiara]], the capital of Solomon Islands.&lt;ref name=rnzi&gt;{{cite news |title=Solomons Truth and Reconciliation Commission launched |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=46259|work=[[Radio New Zealand International]]|date=29 April 2009|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of Solomon Islanders attended the opening, which included a speech by Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt; Tutu spoke of the need for forgiveness in the country to achieve a long term, sustainable peace.&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt; Prime Minister Derek Sikua told the crowd that the TRC marked an important day in the [[history of Solomon Islands]] and the years of ethnic violence which engulfed the country, "The launching of the Commission is a vital part of the efforts as Solomon Islands continue to work towards closure of a most challenging chapter in the history of the country, when disputes led to conflict and conflict erupted into violence between communities."&lt;ref name=sstar&gt;{{cite news |title=Today is a Historic Day: PM Sikua |url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=3936 |work=[[Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation]]|publisher=[[Solomon Star]]|date=29 April 2009|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tutu is also hosting a conference called the [[Winds of Change (Solomon Islands)|Winds of Change]], which will bring together former combatants from Malaita and Guadalcanal for reconciliation talks.&lt;ref name=australian/&gt;

==Beginning of public hearings==

The Commission's first public hearings were held in March 2010, with victims called upon to describe their sufferings during the violence. The Commission explained that the aim of the process was to provide victims with an opportunity to be heard, "end th[e] silence and make the whole country to give recognition to their sufferings" : "Above all, it will help to restore the dignity of the victims, to retrieve the memory of those who were killed, and to hear the voice of those who were humiliated and abused in countless ways." Victims were permitted to name groups who had caused their suffering, but not individuals. The Commission would not pass judgement, but treat the hearings as "moments to listen with respect and compassion".&lt;ref name="solomonstarnews.com"&gt;[http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/3696-emotional-story-telling-starts-today "‘Emotional’ story telling starts today"], ''Solomon Star'', 9 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC_AU_357216"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-03-09/solomon-islands-faces-tragic-past/357216 |title=Solomon Islands faces tragic past |date=10 March 2010 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the hearings was attended by [[Governor-General of the Solomon Islands|Governor-General]] [[Frank Kabui]], [[Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands|Prime Minister]] [[Derek Sikua]], [[Speaker of the National Parliament of the Solomon Islands|Speaker of Parliament]] Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]] and the [[Chief Justice of the Solomon Islands|Chief Justice]].&lt;ref name="solomonstarnews.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28809">In [[labour law]], '''unfair dismissal''' is an act of employment termination made without good reason or contrary to the country's specific legislation.

==Situation per country==

===Australia===

[[Australia]] has long-standing protection for employees in relation to dismissal. Most of that protection was however confined in one of two ways. An employer could not dismiss an employee for a prohibited reason, most typically membership of a union.&lt;ref name="C&amp;A Act"&gt;Such as [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/ccaaa190413o1904441.pdf ''Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act'' 1904 (Cth)] s9(1).&lt;/ref&gt; An individual however could not challenge their own dismissal as being unfair and instead had to rely upon a union challenging the fairness of the dismissal.{{sfn|Southey|2015|p=152}}&lt;ref&gt;Such as the definition of "industrial matters" in the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/iaa1901n59281.pdf ''Industrial Arbitration Act'' 1901 (NSW)] s 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This remedy however was generally only available in the state tribunals. A similar definition existed at the Commonwealth level, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/ccaaa190413o1904441.pdf ''Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act'' 1904 (Cth)] s4.&lt;/ref&gt; however it was considerably limited by the requirement under the Constitution to establish an inter-state dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=R v Gough; Ex parte Cairns Meat Export Co Pty Ltd |year=1962 |court=HCA |num=56 |parallelcite=(1962) 108 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 343}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability for an individual to seek relief from unfair dismissal was first established in a statutory scheme in [[South Australia]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Forsyth|editor1-first= Anthony|editor2-last= Stewart|editor2-first= Andrew|last= Chapman|first= Anna|date= 2009|title= Fair Work: The New Workplace Laws and the Work Choices Legacy|chapter= 10: The Decline and Restoration of Unfair Dismissal Rights|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pzsB_DNSJBcC&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;ots=p1Obm4K0Hw&amp;pg=PA208#v=onepage&amp;f=false|location= Sydney|publisher= Federation Press|page= 208|isbn=978-1-86287-736-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/num_act/icaaa125o1972428/ ''Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1972''] (SA) (No 125 of 1972), s. 15(1)(e)&lt;/ref&gt; followed thereafter by [[Western Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/num_act/iraa199315o1993368/ ''Industrial Relations Amendment Act 1993''] (WA) (No 15 of 1993), ss. 6{{en dash}}7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queensland]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/1990/90AC028.pdf ''Industrial Relations Act 1990''] (Qld) No 28 of 1990, s. 2.2(3)(c), whose scope was later extended by the [https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/1994/94AC012.pdf ''Industrial Relations Reform Act 1994''] (Qld) No 12 of 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[New South Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/iadaa1991n11520.pdf ''Industrial Arbitration (Unfair Dismissal) Amendment Act 1991''], (NSW) No 11 of 1991, whose scope was later extended by the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/ira1996n17269.pdf ''Industrial Relations Act 1996''], (NSW) No 17 of 1996, Part 6&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/era1992213/ ''Employee Relations Act 1992''], (Vic) No 83 of 1992, Part 5, Division 1&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1990s.{{sfn|Voll|2005|p=538}}

Protection from unfair dismissal at the Commonwealth level was enhanced in 1984 by the [[Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission]] with its ruling in the ''Termination, Change and Redundancy Case'',{{sfn|Southey|2015|p=152}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Termination, Change and Redundancy Case|vol= (1984) 8|reporter= IR|opinion= 34|pinpoint= |court= |date= 2 August 1984|url= http://www.airc.gov.au/kirbyarchives/decisions/1984tcrcase.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that awards should contain a provision that dismissal "shall not be harsh, unjust or unreasonable" and subsequent awards following it were upheld by the [[High Court of Australia]].{{sfn|Southey|2015|p=153}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Re Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd; Ex parte Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia |year=1987 |court=HCA |num=63 |parallelcite=(1987) 163 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 656}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Re Federated Storemen &amp; Packers Union of Australia; Ex parte Wooldumpers (Vic) Ltd |year=1989 |court=HCA |num=10 |parallelcite= (1989) 166 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of Australia]] later extended the reach of protection from unfair dismissal with the passage of the ''Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993|type= |number= 109|date= 1993|url= http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/irra1993311/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was based on the [[Section 51(xxix) of the Constitution of Australia|external affairs power]] and the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] ''Termination of Employment Convention, 1982''.{{sfn|Voll|2005|p=537}}&lt;ref&gt;The extent of the external affairs power had been determined by the High Court in {{cite AustLII |litigants=Commonwealth v Tasmania ("Tasmanian Dam case") |link=Tasmanian Dams Case |year=1983 |court=HCA |num=21 |parallelcite=(1983) 158 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In current Australian law, unfair dismissal occurs where the [[Fair Work Commission]], acting under section 385 of the ''[[Fair Work Act 2009]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|fwa2009114|Fair Work Act 2009|385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fwc.gov.au/termination-of-employment/unfair-dismissal|title= Unfair dismissal|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher= [[Fair Work Commission]]|access-date= 25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; determines that:

#a person has been dismissed;&lt;ref&gt;within the meaning of the {{ Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|fwa2009114|Fair Work Act 2009|386}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#the dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable;&lt;ref&gt;within the meaning of the {{ Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|fwa2009114|Fair Work Act 2009|387}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#it was not consistent with the ''Small Business Fair Dismissal Code'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fwc.gov.au/about-us/legislation-regulations/small-business-fair-dismissal-code|title= ''Small Business Fair Dismissal Code''|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher= [[Fair Work Commission]]|access-date= 25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|fwa2009114|Fair Work Act 2009|388}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
#it was not a case of genuine redundancy.&lt;ref&gt;within the meaning of the {{ Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|fwa2009114|Fair Work Act 2009|389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Fair Work Commission determines that a dismissal was unfair, the Commission must decide whether to order reinstatement or compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|fwa2009114|Fair Work Act 2009|390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission is required to first consider whether reinstatement is appropriate and can only order compensation (capped at 6 months pay) if it is satisfied that reinstatement is inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;''Regional Express Holdings Limited v Richards'' [https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/decisionssigned/html/2010fwafb8753.htm [2010&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; FWAFB 8753] at [23].&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of coverage is quite broad. The Commonwealth has declared that all employers falling within its jurisdiction are subject to the scheme, including:&lt;ref name="coverage"/&gt;

:* the Commonwealth and its authorities
:* those corporations falling within its [[corporations power]]
:* those who hire waterside employees, maritime employees, and flight crew officers in interstate or overseas trade or commerce

===Canada===
[[Canadian labour law|Labour law in Canada]] falls within both federal and provincial jurisdiction, depending on the sector affected. Complaints relating to '''unjust dismissal''' ({{lang-fr|congédiement injuste}}) (where "the employee has been dismissed and considers the dismissal to be unjust,"&lt;ref&gt;CLC, s. 240&lt;/ref&gt; which in certain cases also includes [[constructive dismissal]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esdc.gc.ca/en/reports/labour_standards/unjust_dismissal.page|title= Unjust Dismissal|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= January 5, 2016|publisher= [[Employment and Social Development Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be made under the ''[[Canada Labour Code]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Canada Labour Code|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =L-2|part =III|division =XIV|link = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/l-2/page-46.html#h-98}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as similar provisions in effect in [[Quebec]]&lt;ref&gt;''Act respecting labour standards'', CQLR, c. N‑1.1, ss. 82, 82.1(3), 124, 126; applying to those who have worked for at least two years who have "not been dismissed for a good and sufficient cause." ({{lang-fr|congédié sans une cause juste et suffisante}})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nova Scotia]],&lt;ref&gt;''Labour Standards Code'', R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 246, ss. 6, 21, 23, 71 and 72, 78; applying to those who have worked for at least ten years who have been discharged or suspended "without just cause."&lt;/ref&gt; all of which were introduced in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Act to amend the Canada Labour Code'', S.C. 1977‑78, c. 27, s. 21; ''Act respecting labour standards'', S.Q. 1979, c. 45, s. 124; ''Act to Amend Chapter 10 of the Acts of 1972, the Labour Standards Code'', S.N.S. 1975, c. 50, s. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the federal Code, non-unionized employees with more than twelve months of continuous employment, other than managers, have the ability to file complaints for unjust dismissal within 90 days of being so dismissed.{{sfn|Ruslim|2014|p=5}} In making the complaint, the employee has the right to "make a request in writing to the employer to provide a written statement giving the reasons for the dismissal," which must be supplied within 15 days of the request.&lt;ref name="CLC241"/&gt; Complaints are initially investigated by an inspector, who will then work towards a settlement within a reasonable time,&lt;ref name="CLC241"&gt;CLC, s. 241&lt;/ref&gt; failing which the [[Minister of Employment and Social Development]] may refer the matter to an adjudicator in cases other than where "that person has been laid off because of lack of work or because of the discontinuance of a function" or "a procedure for redress has been provided elsewhere in or under this or any other Act of Parliament."&lt;ref&gt;CLC, s. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Where the dismissal is determined to be unjust, the adjudicator has broad remedial authority, including ordering the payment of compensation and reinstatement to employment.{{sfn|Ruslim|2014|p=6}}

While many employers have attempted to contract out of these provisions through the payment of a [[severance package]] together with a signed [[Legal release|release]] from pursuing any claims under the Code,{{sfn|Ruslim|2014|p=6}} the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in 2016 that the Code's provisions effectively ousted such [[common law]] remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Fine|first= Sean|date= July 14, 2016|title= Supreme Court ruling protects federally regulated workers from unfair dismissal |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-federally-regulated-workers-have-protection-against-unfair-dismissal/article30913518/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]]}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Wilson v Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd|link=Wilson v Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd|year=2016|court=scc|num=29|parallelcite=|date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{main article|Dismissal (employment) in France}}
Unfair dismissal became part of [[French labour law]] in 1973, but certain other protections had been previously instituted as far back as 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Voize-Valayre|first= Roland|date= 1991|title= The French Law of Unjust Dismissals|url= http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nyuilp23&amp;div=21&amp;id=&amp;page=|journal= [[New York University Journal of International Law and Politics]]|publisher= [[New York University]]|volume= 23|issue= 2|pages= 519{{en dash}}598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Labour Code'' ({{lang-fr|Code du travail}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072050&amp;dateTexte=20160809 ''Code du travail'']{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; governs the procedure under which dismissal ({{lang-fr| licenciement}}){{efn|the term ''congédiement'' is used in Canada, where ''licenciement'' only refers to a [[layoff]]}} may occur, as well as specifying the grounds under which it is valid or not. Dismissal may occur on grounds of personal performance ({{lang-fr|motif personnel}}) or economic reasons ({{lang-fr|motif économique}}).

Where the employer believes that there is a valid reason ({{lang-fr|cause réelle et sérieuse}}) for dismissal on personal grounds, it must give five working days' notice to the employee that a meeting with him must take place, and a decision to dismiss (exercised in writing, sent by registered mail) can only be made not less than two days afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/droit-du-travail/rupture-de-contrats/licenciement/article/la-procedure-en-cas-de-licenciement-pour-motif-personnel|title= La procédure en cas de licenciement pour motif personnel|language= French|trans-title= Procedure where dismissal occurs on personal grounds|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= travail-emploi.gouv.fr|publisher= |access-date= August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to give prior notice, as well as failure to advise of any open position, will be causes for unfair dismissal.&lt;ref name="priorite"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/droit-du-travail/rupture-de-contrats/licenciement/article/la-priorite-de-reembauche|title= La priorité de réembauche|language= French|trans-title= The priority for recall|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= travail-emploi.gouv.fr|publisher= |access-date= August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An employee may challenge a dismissal by making a complaint to the [[Labour Court (France)|Labour Court]] ({{lang-fr| Conseil de prud'hommes}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/droit-du-travail/litiges-individuels-et-conflits-collectifs/article/le-conseil-de-prud-hommes|title= Le conseil de prud’hommes| language = French| trans-title = The Labour Court|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= December 8, 2015|website= travail-emploi.gouv.fr|publisher= |access-date= August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where an employee has at least two years' service, the employer faces several claims:

:* Failure to follow procedural requirements may result in compensation of one month's pay being awarded to the employee.&lt;ref&gt;''Code du travail'', art. L1235-2&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Where unfair dismissal ({{lang-fr| licenciement sans cause réelle et sérieuse}}) has been determined to have occurred, the Court may order reinstatement of employment ({{lang-fr|réintegration}}). If either party refuses to accept that remedy, compensation of not less than six months' pay will be awarded instead&lt;ref&gt;''Code du travail'', art. L1235-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="personnel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/droit-du-travail/rupture-de-contrats/licenciement/article/le-licenciement-pour-motif-personnel-les-causes-possibles|title= Le licenciement pour motif personnel : les causes possibles| language = French| trans-title = Permissible reasons for dismissal on personal grounds|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= September 17, 2015|website= travail-emploi.gouv.fr|publisher= |access-date= August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employer will also be ordered to repay any [[unemployment benefits]] the employee may have received, to a maximum of six months' paid.&lt;ref&gt;''Code du travail'', art. L1235-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Where unfair dismissal occurs because of the failure to observe the notification obligations for recall rights, the court may award:&lt;ref name="priorite"/&gt;

:* where the employee has at least two years' service and the workforce consists of at least 11 workers, a minimum of two months' pay
:* in all other cases, an amount in line with the existence and extent of any detriment the employee faced.

Where an employee has less than two years' service, or where the workforce has fewer than 11 employees, recall rights are not available,&lt;ref name="Code du travail, art. L1235-14"&gt;''Code du travail'', art. L1235-14&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the normal remedies for unfair dismissal.&lt;ref name="Code du travail, art. L1235-14"/&gt; The remedy of one month's pay is still available in cases involving failure to follow procedural requirements, and an appropriate amount of compensation may still be ordered in cases where dismissal was improperly executed ({{lang-fr|licenciement abusif}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Code du travail'', art. L1235-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="personnel"/&gt;

Where an employee has had at least one year's service, the employer also faces a separate claim for [[severance pay]] ({{lang-fr|indemnité de licenciement}}). The amount is equal to 20% of the base monthly pay times the number of years' service up to 10 years, plus 2/15 of base monthly pay times the number of years' service greater than 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;''Code du travail'', art. L1234-9, R1234-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/droit-du-travail/rupture-de-contrats/licenciement/article/l-indemnite-legale-de-licenciement|title= L’indemnité légale de licenciement| language = French| trans-title = Severance pay|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= August 3, 2016|website= travail-emploi.gouv.fr|publisher= |access-date= August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namibia===
{{main article|Unfair dismissal in Namibia}}

Unfair dismissal in [[Namibia]] is defined by the ''Labour Act, 2007'', under which the employer has the burden of the proof that a dismissal was fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lac.org.na/projects/huricon/Pdf/lawsoclabourlaw2007.pdf|title= Labour Law: An overview of the relevant provisions of the Labour Act, Act 11 of 2007|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |page= 13|publisher= The Law Society of Namibia|access-date= August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly listed as cases or unfair dismissal are those due to discrimination in terms of race, religion, political opinion, marital or socio-economic status, as well as dismissals that arise from trade union activities. Any termination of employment that does not give any valid and fair reason is automatically assumed unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Labour Act, 2007|type= Act|number= 11|language= |date= 2007|article= 33|articletype= s.|page= |url= http://www.parliament.gov.na/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&amp;view=category&amp;download=429:labour-act&amp;id=68:acts-of-2007&amp;Itemid=1269|accessdate= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Unfair dismissal in the United Kingdom}}
After the release of the [[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations|Donovan Report]] in 1968, the [[British Parliament]] passed the [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]] which introduced the concept of unfair dismissal into UK law and its enforcement by the [[National Industrial Relations Court]]. The [[Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974]] abolished the court and replaced it with a network of [[industrial tribunal]]s (later renamed [[employment tribunal]]s). The scheme is currently governed by Part X of the [[Employment Rights Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 1996| chapter = 18| act = Employment Rights Act 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees have the right not to be unfairly dismissed (with the exception of a number of exclusions).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal Dismissal: Your Rights, UK.Gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Following discussions with an employer, an employee can agree not to pursue a claim for unfair dismissal if they reach a [[settlement agreement]] (historically a [[compromise agreement]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4395|title= Settlement agreements|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= [[Acas]]|access-date= August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a settlement agreement to be binding the employee must have taken advice as to the effect of the agreement from a relevant independent adviser, that is a qualified lawyer; a Trade Union certified and authorised officer, official, employee or member; or a certified [[Citizens Advice|advice centre]] worker.&lt;ref&gt;ERA 1996, s. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Richard Aikens|Aikens LJ]] summarized the jurisprudence on what constitutes an unfair dismissal:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Orr v Milton Keynes Council|link= |court=EWHC|division=Civ|year=2011|num=62|para=78|parallelcite= [2011] 4 All ER 1256|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The reason for the dismissal of an employee is a set of facts known to an employer, or it may be a set of beliefs held by him, which causes him to dismiss an employee.
#An employer cannot rely on facts of which he did not know at the time of the dismissal of an employee to establish that the "real reason" for dismissing the employee was one of those set out in the statute or was of a kind that justified the dismissal of the employee holding the position he did.
#Once the employer has established before a tribunal that the "real reason" for dismissing the employee is one within s. 98(1)(b), i.e. that it was a "valid reason", the Employment Tribunal has to decide whether the dismissal was fair or unfair. That requires, first and foremost, the application of the statutory test set out in s. 98(4)(a).
#In applying that sub-section, the tribunal must decide on the reasonableness of the employer's decision to dismiss for the "real reason". That involves a consideration, at least in misconduct cases, of three aspects of the employer's conduct. First, did the employer carry out an investigation into the matter that was reasonable in the circumstances of the case; secondly, did the employer believe that the employee was guilty of the misconduct complained of and, thirdly, did the employer have reasonable grounds for that belief. If the answer to each of those questions is "yes", the tribunal must then decide on the reasonableness of the response of the employer.
#In doing the exercise set out above, the tribunal must consider, by the objective standards of the hypothetical reasonable employer, rather than by reference to its own subjective views, whether the employer has acted within a "band or range of reasonable responses" to the particular misconduct found of the particular employee. If it has, then the employer's decision to dismiss will be reasonable. But that is not the same thing as saying that a decision of an employer to dismiss will only be regarded as unreasonable if it is shown to be perverse.
#The tribunal must not simply consider whether they think that the dismissal was fair and thereby substitute their decision as to what was the right course to adopt for that of the employer. It must determine whether the decision of the employer to dismiss the employee fell within the band of reasonable responses which "a reasonable employer might have adopted".
#A tribunal may not substitute its own evaluation of a witness for that of the employer at the time of its investigation and dismissal, save in exceptional circumstances.
#A tribunal must focus its attention on the fairness of the conduct of the employer at the time of the investigation and dismissal (or any appeal process) and not on whether in fact the employee has suffered an injustice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30903">{{Tort law}}This article addresses '''[[tort]]s in [[United States law]]'''. As such, it covers primarily [[common law]]. Moreover, it provides general rules, as individual states all have separate [[civil code]]s. There are three general categories of torts: [[intentional tort]]s, [[negligence]], and [[strict liability]] torts.

==Intentional torts==
Intentional torts involve situations in which the defendant desires or knows to a substantial certainty that his act will cause the plaintiff damage. They include [[battery (tort)|battery]], [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[false imprisonment]], [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] ("IIED"), [[trespass to land]], [[trespass to chattels]], [[conversion (law)|conversion]], invasion of privacy, [[malicious prosecution]], [[abuse of process]], fraud, inducing breach of contract, intentional interference with business relations, and defamation of character (libel/slander).

===Elements===
The elements of most intentional torts follow the same pattern: intent, act, result, and causation.

====Intent====
This element typically requires the defendant to desire or know to a substantial certainty that something will occur as a result of his act. Therefore, the term intent, for purposes of this section, always includes either desire or knowledge to a substantial certainty.

For an example in battery, Dave shoots a gun into a crowd of people because he is specifically trying to hit someone with a bullet. This element would be satisfied, as David had an actual desire to procure the harm required for this tort. Alternatively, Dave shoots a gun into a crowd of people for some reason and genuinely hopes no one gets hit but knows that it is virtually inevitable that someone will actually get hit. This element would still be satisfied, as David had knowledge to a substantial certainty that harm would result.

In contrast, if all that can be said about the defendant's state of mind is that he ''should have'' known better, he will not be liable for an intentional tort. This situation might occur if, as opposed to the examples above, Dave shoots a gun in a remote part of the desert without looking just for fun, not wanting to hit anyone, but the bullet does hit someone. Dave did not have a desire or knowledge to a substantial certainty that someone would get hit in this situation. He may, however, be liable for some other tort, namely negligence.

=====Transferred intent=====
Transferred intent is the legal principle that intent can be transferred from one victim or tort to another. [1] In tort law, there are generally five areas in which transferred intent is applicable: '''battery, assault, false imprisonment, trespass to land, and trespass to chattels'''. Generally, any intent to cause any one of these five torts which results in the completion of any of the five tortious acts will be considered an intentional act, even if the actual target of the tort is one other than the intended target of the original tort.

====Act====
The element of an act varies by whatever tort is in question but always requires voluntariness. For example, if Dave has a muscle spasm that makes his arm fling out to his side and hit Paula, who is standing next to him, any case that Paula attempts to bring against Dave for battery will fail for lack of the requisite act (which will be discussed in the section on battery, below). The act was not voluntary.

====Result====
This element typically refers to damage, although damage is not required to prevail on certain intentional torts, such as trespass to land.

====Causation====
This element refers to actual cause and proximate cause. It will be treated in its own section.

===Causes of action===

====Battery====
A person commits a battery when he acts either intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with another or intending to cause another imminent apprehension of such contact and when such contact results. Therefore, there is a variety of ways in which a person can commit a battery, as illustrated by the following examples of defendant Dave and plaintiff Paula.

* Dave acts intending to cause a harmful contact with Paula, and a harmful contact does result.
* Dave acts intending to cause a harmful contact with Paula, but an offensive contact results.
* Dave acts intending to cause an offensive contact with Paula, and an offensive contact does result.
* Dave acts intending to cause an offensive contact with Paula, but a harmful contact results.
* Dave acts intending to "only" cause Paula to be imminently apprehensive of a harmful ''or'' offensive contact, but a harmful contact actually results.
* Dave acts intending to "only" cause Paula to be imminently apprehensive of a harmful ''or'' offensive contact, but an offensive contact actually results.

Apprehension is a broader term than fear. If a defendant intends to cause the plaintiff to actually fear a harmful contact, for example, it will therefore always suffice as apprehension, but there are other ways to achieve apprehension as well.

====Assault====
Assault is notably similar to battery. Indeed, the elements of intent and act are identical. The only difference is the result. A person commits an assault when he acts either intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with another or intending to cause another imminent apprehension of such contact and when such imminent apprehension results. Therefore, there is a variety of ways in which a person can commit an assault.

====False imprisonment====
A person commits false imprisonment when he acts intending to confine another and when confinement actually results that the confinee is either aware of or damaged by.

Confinement must typically be within boundaries that the defendant establishes. For example, a person is not confined when he is refused entry to a building, because he is free to leave. In addition, a person is not confined unless the will to leave of an ordinary person in the same situation would be overborne. For example, Dave calls Paula into a room with one door. Dave closes the door and stands in front of it. He tells Paula that if she wants to leave, he will open the door and get out of her way but also threatens to blink twice if she does so. An ordinary person's will to leave would not be overborne by Dave's threat to blink twice.

No damage is required in false imprisonment, hence the requirement of a result of awareness ''or'' damage. For example, Dave calls Paula into a room with one door. Dave closes the door and stands in front of it. He tells Paula that if she wants to leave, he will take out a gun and shoot her. (Note that this ''would'' overcome the will of an ordinary person to leave.) An hour later, Dave changes his mind and leaves the premises. Paula subsequently leaves and is not physically injured at all. Her awareness of confinement is sufficient to satisfy the element of the result in false imprisonment.

Alternatively, Paula is a narcoleptic. She suddenly falls into a deep sleep while feeding the chickens in a barn on Dave's farm in a remote area. Not wanting to move her, Dave locks her in the barn from the outside when he needs to go into town, trying to protect her but also knowing that she won't be able to leave (or call for help) if she wakes up. While Dave is away, the chickens severely scratch Paula's arms, but she does not wake up. Dave returns, unlocks the barn, and successfully wakes up Paula to tend to her wounds. Even though she was unaware of her confinement, she was damaged by it and will have a claim of false imprisonment against Dave.

====Intentional infliction of emotional distress====
A person is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) when he intentionally ''or recklessly'' engages in extreme and outrageous conduct that is highly likely to cause ''severe'' emotional distress.

This is a notable exception to the general rule given above that for almost all intentional torts only desire or knowledge to a substantial certainty will do. IIED also includes recklessness. This still distinguishes it from negligent infliction of emotional distress, though.

Extreme and outrageous conduct refers to the act. Severe emotional distress refers to the result. This is another intentional tort for which no damage is ordinarily required. However, some jurisdictions require the accompaniment of physical effects. In other words, emotional distress will not be deemed to exist in those jurisdictions unless there are physical manifestations, such as vomiting or fainting.

====Trespass to land====
A person commits trespass to land when he wrongfully and intentionally enters, or causes a thing or third person to enter, land owned or occupied by another.

====Trespass to chattel====
A person commits trespass to chattel when he acts either intending to dispossess the rightful possessor of a [[Personal property|chattel]] or intending to use or ''intermeddle'' with the chattel of another and when dispossession of the chattel for a substantial time results, or damage to the chattel results, or physical injury to the rightful possessor results.

====Conversion====
A person commits conversion when he acts intending to exercise ''dominion and control'' and when interference with the rightful possessor's control results that is so serious that it requires the actor to pay the full value of the chattel to the rightful possessor. An exercise of dominion and control refers to the act. Serious interference refers to the result. Seriousness is determined by the following factors:
* the nature of the act and how long it lasted;
* the nature of the interference and how long it lasted;
* the inconvenience to and expense incurred by the rightful possessor;
* the actor's good faith (whether he was trying to help someone, for example);
* when applicable, the mistake by the actor (he took a book that looked just like his own but was actually someone else's, for example); and
* when applicable, the damage to the chattel.
The remedy for this cause of action not only requires the defendant to pay the plaintiff the full value of the chattel but also is properly considered a forced sale. The plaintiff must tender the defendant the chattel. Therefore, a plaintiff may not elect to pursue this cause of action but instead trespass to chattel, namely when he wants to keep his chattel despite its potential damage.

===Affirmative defenses===
The following are affirmative defenses to intentional torts.

====Consent====
Consent can be a defense to any intentional tort, although lack of consent is occasionally incorporated into the definition of an intentional tort, such as trespass to land. However, lack of consent is not always an essential element to establish a prima facie case in such situations. Therefore, it is properly treated as an affirmative defense.

====Self-defense====
Self-defense is typically a defense to battery.  Similar to self-defense is the [[defense of others]].

====Defense of property====
This is typically a defense to trespass to land or trespass to chattels, as it can refer to realty or personalty.

====Necessity====
Necessity is typically a defense to trespass to land. There are two kinds of necessity, private and public.

=====Private necessity=====
This is a partial privilege. A party who has this privilege is still liable for damage caused. This defense is therefore more important when there is a concomitant issue of whether the opposing party has a valid privilege of defense of property.

The following example is derived from an actual Vermont case from 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''Ploof v. Putnam'', 81 Vt. 471 (1908)&lt;/ref&gt; Paula is sailing on a lake when a violent storm suddenly breaks out. She navigates to the nearest dock and quickly ties up her vessel, not damaging the dock at all. The dock belongs to Dave. Dave attempts to exercise the privilege of defense of property, as Paula would ordinarily be committing a trespass to land in this situation, and unties the vessel. Paula therefore drifts back away from the shore. Her boat is damaged, and she suffers personal injuries, both as a result of the storm.

If Paula had damaged Dave's dock, she would be liable for it, even though she has a valid privilege of private necessity.  More importantly, Dave is now liable to Paula for the damage to her boat and for her personal injuries. Because of the private necessity, Paula is not considered a trespasser. So, Dave did not in fact have a valid privilege of defense of property.

Ordinarily, for private necessity to be valid, the party attempting to exercise it must not have created the emergency. For example, if Paula intentionally punctures her fuel tank just so she can race over to Dave's dock and tie up, she will not have a valid privilege of private necessity. As such, she would be a trespasser, and Dave would have a valid privilege of defense of property.

=====Public necessity=====
This is a complete privilege. A party who has this privilege, typically a public official or governmental entity, is not liable for any damage caused. A famous early case on this privilege involved [[John W. Geary]], the first [[mayor of San Francisco]], who made the decision during a major fire to burn down several private residences to establish a fire break.&lt;ref&gt;''Surocco v. Geary'', 3 Cal. 69 (1853).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negligence==
{{main|Negligence in the United States}}
Amongst unintentional torts one finds [[negligence]] as being the most common source of common law. Most [[United States|Americans]] are under the impression that most people can sue for any type of negligence, but it is untrue in most US jurisdictions (partly because negligence is one of the few torts for which ordinary people can and do obtain liability insurance.){{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  It is a form of extracontractual [[legal liability|liability]] that is based upon a failure to comply with the duty of care of a reasonable person, which failure is the [[actual cause]] and [[proximate cause]] of damages. That is, but for the tortfeasor's act or omission, the damages to the plaintiff would not have been incurred, and the damages were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the tortious conduct.

Some jurisdictions recognize one or more designations less than actual intentional wrongdoing, but more egregious than mere negligence, such as "wanton", "reckless" or "despicable" conduct.  A finding in those states that a defendant's conduct was "wanton," "reckless" or "despicable", rather than merely negligent, can be significant because certain defenses, such as [[contributory negligence]], are often unavailable when such conduct is the cause of the damages.

*''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916) Judge [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] which removed the requirement of [[privity of contract]] for duty in negligence actions.
*''[[Martin v. Herzog]]'', 228 N Y. 164, 126 N.E. 814 (1920)
*''[[Tedla v. Ellman]]'', 280 N.Y. 124, 19 N.E.2d 987, (1939)&lt;ref name=Tedla/&gt; on [[negligence per se|negligence ''per se'']], or the violation of a duty under a statute
*''[[Seong Sil Kim v. New York City Transit Authority]]'', duty of care to a person who may have been attempting suicide.

===Breach===
Breach is ordinarily established by showing that the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care. Some courts use the terms ordinary care or prudent care instead. Conduct is typically considered to be unreasonable when the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. [[Judge Learned Hand]] famously reduced this to algebraic form in ''[[United States v. Carroll Towing Co.]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Carroll Towing Co. |vol=159 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=169 |pinpoint= |court=2d. Cir. |date=1947 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/159/169/1565896/ |accessdate=2018-05-21 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B&lt;PL&lt;/math&gt;
This means that if the '''b'''urden of exercising more care is less than the '''p'''robability of damage or harm multiplied by the severity of the expected '''l'''oss, and a person fails to undertake the burden, he is not exercising reasonable care and is thus breaching his duty to do so (assuming he has one). In other words, the burden of prevention is less than the probability that the injury will occur multiplied by the gravity of the harm/injury. Under this formula, duty changes as circumstances change—if the cost of prevention increases, then the duty to prevent decreases; if the likelihood of damage or the severity of the potential damage increases, then duty to prevent increases.

There are other ways of establishing breach, as well.

*''[[United States v. Carroll Towing Co.]]'', 159 F.2d 169 (2d. Cir. 1947)

====Violation of statute====
This is also known as negligence per se. Breach can be shown in most jurisdictions if a defendant violates a statute that pertains to safety and the purpose of which is to prevent the result of the case. Note that this is an alternative way to show breach. A violation of statute will not have occurred in every case. Therefore, just because it cannot be shown does not mean that there has been no breach. Even if it is attempted to be shown but fails, there may be other bases of breach.

=====Excuse=====
Occasionally, there is a valid excuse for violating a safety statute, namely when it is safer or arguably safer to violate than to comply with it. This happened in ''[[Tedla v. Ellman]]''.&lt;ref name=Tedla&gt;''[[Tedla v. Ellman]]'', [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3626043/tedla-v-ellman/ 280 N.Y. 124], 19 [[N.E.2d]] 987 (1939).&lt;/ref&gt; A statute required pedestrians using roadways to walk against traffic. At the time in question, there was heavy traffic going the opposite direction as the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff would have had to walk past many more vehicles, arguably increasing his chances of being hit. So, the plaintiff walked with traffic on the other side of the road, thus violating the statute. There were far fewer vehicles travelling that direction, but the plaintiff was hit anyway. Even though the purpose of the statute was to prevent precisely the result that occurred, the plaintiff nonetheless prevailed because of a valid excuse for violating the statute, namely that it was probably safer not to comply.

====Violation of custom====
Breach can be shown in most jurisdictions if a defendant violates a custom that is widespread and itself reasonable. For example, where ten percent of a certain industry does a certain thing, it probably will not be considered a custom for purposes of breach in negligence. Alternatively, if 90 percent of a certain industry does a certain thing, but the thing is inherently unsafe, and it is upholding the custom as a cost-saving measure, violation of that custom (doing something safer) will not constitute breach. As with violation of statute, this is an alternative way to show breach. Therefore, just because it cannot be shown, or is attempted to be shown but fails, does not mean that there has been no breach. There may be other ways of showing breach.
*''[[Trimarco v. Klein]]'', 56 N.Y.2d 98, 436 N.E.2d 502 (1982), decided that customary conduct is not conclusive (although it is good evidence) of what will be reasonable.

====Res ipsa loquitur====
This is a [[Latin]] phrase that means "the thing speaks for itself."   It is a rare alternative basis of breach. Ordinarily, it only applies when the plaintiff has little or limited access to the evidence of negligent conduct.  Res ipsa loquitur requires that the defendant have exclusive control over the thing that causes the injury and that the act be one that would not ordinarily occur without negligence.

==Causation==
Causation is typically a bigger issue in negligence cases than intentional torts. However, as mentioned previously, it is an element of any tort. The defendant's act must be an [[actual cause]] and a [[proximate cause]] of the result in a particular cause of action.

===Actual cause===
Actual cause has historically been determined by the "but for" test. If the result would not have occurred but for the defendant's act, the act is an actual cause of the result.

Several other tests have been created to supplement this general rule, however, especially to deal with cases in which the plaintiff suffers great harm, yet because multiple acts by multiple defendants, the but for test is unhelpful. This situation occurred in the famous case of ''[[Summers v. Tice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Summers v. Tice |vol=33 |reporter=Cal.2d |opinion=80 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1948 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1184099/summers-v-tice/ |accessdate=2018-05-21 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Dan and Dave both negligently fire their shotguns at Paula. Paula is struck by only one pellet and it is impossible to determine which gun it was fired from. Using the but for test alone, Dan and Dave can both escape liability. Dan can say that but for his own negligence, Paula still might have suffered the same harm. Dave can make the same argument. As a matter of public policy, most courts will nonetheless hold Dan and Dave jointly and severally liable. The act of each defendant is therefore said to be an actual cause, even if this is a fiction.

A similar situation arises when it is impossible to show that the defendant(s) was/were negligent at all. This almost inevitably arises in cases also involving res ipsa loquitor. See [[Ybarra v. Spangard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ybarra v. Spangard |vol=25 |reporter=Cal.2d |opinion=486 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1944 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2620203/ybarra-v-spangard/ |accessdate=2018-05-21 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, making the facts of that case more extreme, Paula goes to the hospital for an appendectomy. She wakes up, and finds her left arm has also been amputated for no apparent reason. (Note that this would implicate multiple issues and other causes of action than negligence.) For purposes of actual cause, unless there is evidence or an admission of negligent conduct, Paula will be unable to show an actual cause. In this situation too, most courts will hold all the defendants that Paula names (possibly everyone on the medical staff that was in the room during her surgery) jointly and severally liable. The act of each defendant is likewise said to be an actual cause, even if this is a fiction.

====Substantial factor test====

Another test deals with cases in which there are two actual causes but only one is negligent. For example, there are three equidistant points, A, B, and C. Paula's house is at point A. Dave negligently ignites a fire at point B. Lightning simultaneously strikes point C, starting a second fire. The fire at point B and the fire at point C both burn towards point A. Paula's house burns down. Unlike ''Summers v. Tice'', there is only one defendant in this situation. Most courts will still hold Dave's negligence to be an actual cause, as his conduct was a ''substantial factor'' in causing Paula's damage. This is sometimes called the substantial factor test.

* ''[[Summers v. Tice]]'', 33 Cal. 2d 80 (1948)
* ''[[Ybarra v. Spangard]]'', 25 Cal. 2d 486 (1944)

===Proximate cause===
There are many tests for determining whether an actual cause is a proximate one. Most involve some form of foreseeability.

Justice Cardozo has two factors to determine if there was a proximate cause between the plaintiff's injury and the defendant's breach of duty:
# Is the plaintiff's injury a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's breach of duty?
# Is the plaintiff a reasonably foreseeable victim of the defendant's breach of duty?

Justice Andrews has several factors to determine if there was a proximate cause between the plaintiff's injury and the defendant's breach of duty:
# Was there a natural and continuous sequence between the plaintiff's injury and the defendant's breach of duty?
# Was the injury caused directly or indirectly?
# Based on human experience, would people expect the result to happen?
# Was the result too remote in time and/or place in light of the circumstances?
# Were there intervening causes? Were the intervening causes ones people would expect or were they so unusual (i.e., superseding causes) as to break the chain of causation?

;Punitive damages
{{main|Punitive damages in the United States}}
[[Punitive damages]] (sums intended to punish the defendant) may be awarded in addition to actual damages intended to compensate the plaintiff.  Punitive damage awards generally require a higher showing than mere negligence, but lower than intention.  For instance, [[grossly negligent]], [[recklessness (law)|reckless]], or outrageous conduct may be grounds for an award of punitive damages.  These punitive damages awards can be quite substantial in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gjel.com/articles/reckless.html| title=Punitive Damages for Reckless Conduct }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strict liability==
[[Strict liability]] torts are brought for injuries resulting from [[ultrahazardous activities]], for which the [[defendant]] will be held liable even if there was no negligence on his/her part.  Strict liability also applies to some types of [[product liability]] claims and to [[copyright infringement]] and some [[trademark]] cases.  Some statutory torts are also strict liability, including many [[environmental torts]].  The term "strict liability" refers to the fact that the tortfeasor's liability is not premised on their culpable state of mind (whether they knew or intended to accomplish the wrongful act, or violated a standard of care by doing so,) but, instead, strictly on the conduct itself or its result.

===Product liability===
{{main|Product liability in the United States}}
Product liability refers to the liability of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers for unreasonably dangerous products.

*''[[Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.]]'', 24 Cal.2d 453, 150 [[P.2d]] 436 (1944)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.]]'', [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1210011/escola-v-coca-cola-bottling-co/ 24 Cal. 2d 453], 150 [[P.2d]] 436 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal torts==
Although federal courts often hear tort cases arising out of common law or state statutes, there are relatively few tort claims that arise exclusively as a result of federal law.  The most common federal tort claim is the [[42 U.S.C. § 1983]] remedy for violation of one's [[civil rights]] under color of federal or state law, which can be used to sue for anything from a [[free speech]] claim to use of excessive force by the police. Tort claims arising out of injuries occurring on vessels on navigable waters of the United States fall under federal [[United States admiralty law|admiralty]] jurisdiction.

'''''United States v. Hudson and Goodwin''''', 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 (1812), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that [[United States Congress|Congress]] must first enact a constitutional law criminalizing an activity, attach a penalty, and give the federal courts [[jurisdiction]] over the offense in order for the court to render a conviction.

==Facts==
Barzillai Hudson and George Goodwin, the [[defendant]]s in the case, were charged with a [[libel]] on the [[President of the United States|President]] and Congress, and of having accused them of secretly voting to give [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] $2 million to make a treaty with [[Spain]].  The [[United States circuit court|circuit court]] was divided on whether it could exercise [[common law]] jurisdiction over such cases.

==Decision==
Justice [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson, Jr.]] delivered the opinion of the Court. He first explained that the federal government is one of limited powers, as set forth in the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]]. Furthermore, only the jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] was explicitly defined in [[Article III of the U.S. Constitution]].  Since the lower federal courts were created by Congress with the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], their jurisdiction had to be defined by Congress. Therefore, the Court reasoned that since Congress has the power to create such courts, the principles of limited government militate in favor of limiting their jurisdiction to specific acts specified by Congress.

The Court held, "The legislative authority of the Union must first make an act a crime, affix a punishment to it, and declare the Court that shall have jurisdiction of the offence." In [[obiter dictum|dicta]], he also mentioned an exception to the general rule. Courts have some implied powers, such as punishing litigants for [[contumacy]] ([[contempt of court]]) and enforcing court orders.

==Impact==
The case effectively closed the door on the lower federal courts' powers to convict defendants for [[common law crimes]] and mandated for Congress to define their criminal jurisdiction specifically through [[legislation]].  Thus, the court essentially introduced the legal concept of ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' into federal jurisprudence.

'''[[Vladimir Vernadsky|Vernadsky]] National Library of Ukraine''', VNLU ({{lang-uk|Національна бібліотека України імені В.І. Вернадського}}) is the main [[academic library]] and main scientific [[information centre]] in [[Ukraine]], one of the [[List of largest libraries|world's largest (''top twenty'')]] [[national library|national libraries]]. It is located in the capital of the country – [[Kiev]]. The library contains about 15 million items. The library has the most complete collection of [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavic writing]], archives of outstanding world and Ukrainian scientists and cultural persons. The holdings include the collection of the Presidents of Ukraine, archive copies of Ukrainian printed documents from 1917, and archives of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]].

== History ==
Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine was established on 2 August 1918 by [[Hetman]] [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]] as the "National Library of the Ukrainian State" (''Natsionalna biblioteka Ukrayinskoyi Derzhavy''). On 23  August 1918 there was established the Provisional Committee on creation of the National Library headed by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] (Volodymyr Vernadsky).

In August 1941 the library was evacuated to [[Ufa]], the capital of Bashkortostan, where it was housed in the State pedagogical institute. In May 1944 the library returned to Kiev.

The current building was constructed between 1975 and 1989. It has 27 floors and an area of 35,700&amp;nbsp;m². Its roof reaches  76.7&amp;nbsp;m and its antenna 78.6&amp;nbsp;m above ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=74051 Vernadsky National Library on skyscraperpage.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holdings ==
The collection of the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine contains more than 15 million items. Its basis form the large book collections of 18th-19th centuries.

As a [[depository library]] the Library has systematic acquisition. Annually, it receives 160.000-180.000 documents (books, magazines, newspapers, etc.). Holdings include all Ukrainian publications and copies of all Ukrainian candidate and doctoral theses. The library exchanges materials with more than 1.500 research and academic institutions and libraries from 80 countries. As a [[United Nations]] depository library since 1964, the library receives all English and Russian language publications from the [[United Nations System|United Nations and its special institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/deplib/countries/ukrn.htm United Nations Depository Libraries: Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;

The holdings of the Vernadsky National Library include large collections of [[manuscript]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Papyrus 7]] is one of the oldest.&lt;/ref&gt; rare printed books and [[incunabula]]. The library has the most complete collection of [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavic writing]], including the [[Peresopnytsia Gospels]], one of the most intricate surviving East Slavic manuscripts.

Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine is the world’s foremost repository of [[Jewish music|Jewish folk music]] recorded on [[Phonograph cylinder|Edison wax cylinders]]. Their [[Collection of Jewish Musical Folklore (1912-1947)]] was inscribed on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web |title= Collection of Jewish Musical Folklore (1912-1947) |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23132&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |date= 2008-05-16 |publisher= UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate= 2009-12-14 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

The library owns works related to the history and culture of Ukraine and surrounding regions, including some of the oldest and rarest documents in the country, including the only handwritten music composition in existence by [[Artemiĭ Vedel]].&lt;ref name=WDL3&gt;{{cite web|title=Score of Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom and Other Compositions by Artemiĭ Vedelʹ|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11809/|work=V.I.

===Orsha Gospel===
The library holds the Orsha Gospel. The book, which dates back to the late 13th century, is one of the oldest [[Belarus|Belaurisian]] and one of the oldest to depict [[Cyrillic script]]. The book was thrown away by a [[monastery]] in [[Orsha]]. It was found by [[Napoleon]]'s troops in 1812. In 1874 it was donated to the [[Kiev Theological Academy]]. It now resides in the collection of the National Library. It has miniature brightly colored [[illuminated manuscript|illuminations]] of [[Saint Luke]] and [[Saint Matthew]]. They are in the [[Palaeologian dynasty]] style. Over 300 illustrations of flowers and animals are found in the book. It consists of the [[Gospel]], a [[menology]], and ends with [[matutinal]] gospels.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lectionary (Orsha Gospel)|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11804/|work=V.I.

===''Aeneid''===

[[Ivan Kotliarevsky]]'s [[epic poem]] version of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', by [[Virgil]], is the first piece of literature written in common [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. It was also the first book to discuss the cultural and history of [[Ukraine]]. The library holds five first edition copies.&lt;ref name=WDL2&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aeneid|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11805/|work=V.I.

A '''waiting period''' is the period of time between when an action is requested or mandated and when it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/w/waiting-period/|title=Waiting Period Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the term is commonly used in reference to [[gun control]], as some U.S. states require a person to wait for a set number of days after buying or reserving a [[firearm]] from a [[Merchant|dealer]] before actually taking [[Possession (law)|possession]] of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartgunlaws.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/gun-dealer-sales/waiting-periods/|title=Waiting Periods - Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence|website=smartgunlaws.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This waiting period allows the state to perform a [[background check]] to confirm that the purchaser is legally permitted to possess a firearm. In theory, waiting periods may also be in place to serve as a "cooling off" period for potential buyers who may wish to commit crimes in the "heat of the moment".
Studies have shown that just a 3 day waiting period can reduce the number of homicides that will occur in a state by 17%. Some states have already adopted a waiting period before one can purchase a firearm. In the state of California, the waiting period is 10 days. Moreover, someone who has previously passed the background check and was able to purchase a firearm will still be subject to the same 10 day waiting period before obtaining another firearm.&lt;ref&gt;https://search-proquest-com.csuglobal.idm.oclc.org/docview/1848658527?rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/46/12162&lt;/ref&gt;

Waiting periods are also used for new [[insurance policies]], particularly [[health insurance]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/w/waiting-period-health-care/|title=Waiting Period (Health Care) Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flood insurance]]. Incidents which occur during this time are not claimable.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The term may also refer to the time between the making of a claim and the payment of it, also called the '''elimination period'''.

In [[business finance]], a waiting period (or [[quiet period]]) is the time in which a company making an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) must be silent about it, so as not to [[watered stock|inflate the value of the stock artificially]]. It is also called the '''cooling-off period'''.

Other things potentially subject to waiting periods include [[marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1217|title=Legal Dictionary - Law.com|website=Law.com Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[divorce]], and [[merger]] proceedings.

'''Williams v A-G''' [1990] 1 NZLR 646 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding liability in tort for negligence cases against the government.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Williams owned a yacht named "Nomad" and after sailing around Europe, he returned to New Zealand and sold it to a man by the name of Curtis. As Curtis could not pay up front for the boat, Williams loaned him the money, with the boat being used as security for the loan.

The choice of Curtis however turned out to be most unfortunate, as he was a drug smuggler who later became renowned as one of New Zealand's most infamous criminals. In 1979, soon after the sale, Curtis beached the yacht near Westport whilst smuggling drugs into the country.

As well as arresting him for this, Customs seized the boat. In 1982, William managed to get the Minister for Customs to waive the seizure order, however Customs had simply left the boat moored unattended at Westport, resulting in it being damaged and vandalized.

Williams sued Customs for the damage, and was awarded $80,000 in damages.

'''''Wyeth v. Levine''''', 555 U.S. 555 (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Wyeth v. Levine|volume=555|page=555|pin=|year=2009}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[United States Supreme Court]] case holding that Federal regulatory clearance of a [[medication]] does not shield the manufacturer from liability under state law.

== Facts ==
===Vermont jury trial===

The plaintiff lost her hand to [[gangrene]] when she was injected with [[Phenergan]], an anti-nausea drug made by [[Wyeth Pharmaceuticals]].  She won a jury verdict in Vermont, under the theory (''inter alia'') that Wyeth had inadequately labeled the drug.

===Phenergan's regulatory background===

The trial record shows that the FDA first cleared injectable Phenergan for use in 1955. In 1973 and 1976, Wyeth submitted supplemental new drug applications, which the agency cleared after proposing labeling changes. Wyeth submitted a third supplemental application in 1981 in response to a new FDA rule governing drug labels. Over the next 17 years, Wyeth and the FDA intermittently corresponded about Phenergan's label. The most notable activity occurred in 1987, when the FDA suggested different warnings about the risk of arterial exposure, and in 1988, when Wyeth submitted revised labeling incorporating the proposed changes. The FDA did not respond. Instead, in 1996, it requested from Wyeth the labeling then in use and, without addressing Wyeth's 1988 submission, instructed it to "retain verbiage in [the] current label" regarding intra-arterial injection. After a few further changes to the labeling not related to intra-arterial injection, the FDA cleared Wyeth's 1981 application in 1998, instructing that Phenergan's final printed label "must be identical" to the approved package insert.

===Wyeth's motion for judgment as a matter of law===

Wyeth argued that this Vermont law was federally preempted because it was in "actual conflict [with] a specific FDA order" regarding drug labeling.  The trial court rejected this argument, as did the [[Supreme Court of Vermont]], holding that the FDA requirements merely provide a floor, not a ceiling, for state regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Wyeth v. Levine |vol=944 |reporter=A.2d |opinion=179 |pinpoint= |court=Vt. |date=2006 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1941660/levine-v-wyeth/ |accessdate=2018-01-31 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]].

==Issue== 
If a drug meets the labeling requirements of the FDA, does that give rise to federal preemption of state law regarding inadequate labeling? Wyeth presented two arguments in favor of [[FDA Preemption]]:
#It is impossible for Wyeth to comply with both the state-law duties and federal labeling regulations, see ''[[Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta]]'', since the latter forbids it from changing its label without FDA approval.
#Permitting states to require stronger warnings creates an unacceptable "obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress," ''[[Hines v. Davidowitz]]'', because it substitutes a lay jury's decision about drug labeling for the expert judgment that Congress sought to entrust with drug labeling decisions when it created the FDA.

==Holding==
Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], writing on behalf of a 6-3 court, rejected both of Wyeth's arguments.  In other words, the Vermont law was not preempted (or overruled) by FDA regulations; thus, the plaintiff could argue her case before a state court jury.

==Reasoning==
'''Questions of federal preemption "must be guided by two cornerstones of our pre-emption jurisprudence"''':
:*"First, 'the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.' ''[[Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr]]'', 518 U.S. 470, 485 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see ''[[Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn]],'' 375 U.S. 96, 103 (1963)."
:*"Second, '[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has "legislated in a field which the States have traditionally occupied, [we] start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." '  ''Lohr'', 518 U.S., at 485 (quoting ''[[Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.]]'', 331 U.S. 218 230 (1947))"

'''In its first argument, Wyeth is incorrect that relabeling the drug to conform to Vermont law would necessarily have violated federal labeling regulations.'''
:*Although a manufacturer generally needs FDA approval before changing a drug label, the agency's "changes being effected" (CBE) regulation permits certain unilateral labeling changes that improve drug safety. Wyeth's misreading of this regulation is based on the misunderstanding that the FDA, rather than the manufacturer, bears primary responsibility for drug labeling. It is a central premise of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the FDA's regulations that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times. Pp. 11–16.

'''In its second argument, Wyeth is incorrect that permitting states to require stronger warnings would interfere with Congress' purpose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions because it was not Congress's intent, in writing the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, to preempt state-law failure to warn actions.'''
:*Wyeth's argument misconstrues the intent of congress behind the FDCA. Congress did not intend the FDCA to pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn actions.
:*Wyeth's argument also misconstrues the capacity of agencies to preempt state law, as Wyeth's argument relies on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation declaring that state-law failure-to-warn claims threaten the FDA's statutorily prescribed role. Although an agency regulation with the force of law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements, this case involves no such regulation but merely an agency's assertion that state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives. Where, as here, Congress has not authorized a federal agency to pre-empt state law directly, the weight this Court accords the agency's explanation of state law's impact on the federal scheme depends on its thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness, e.g. [[Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.]], 323 U. S. 134. Under this standard, the FDA's 2006 preamble does not merit deference: It is inherently suspect in light of the FDA's failure to offer interested parties notice or opportunity for comment on the pre-emption question; it is at odds with the available evidence of Congress' purposes; and it reverses the FDA's own longstanding position that state law is a complementary form of drug regulation without providing a reasoned explanation.

===Concurrence===
Justice Breyer noted that, while the issue was not present here, the FDA may create regulations that pre-empt state law tort claims.

===Concurrence only in judgment===
Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote separately, concurring only in the judgment. He criticized the majority for implicitly endorsing a "far-reaching implied pre-emption doctrine" where the Court can invalidate state laws based on perceived conflicts with federal statutes by extrapolating from evidence not found in the text of the statute.

==Dissent==

Justice [[Samuel A. Alito]] dissented and was joined by Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts]] and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]. He disagreed with the Court's holding that a jury, rather than the FDA, is ultimately responsible for regulating warning labels for prescription drugs. He argued this is incompatible with ''[[Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.]]'', which established the principles of conflict preemption.
