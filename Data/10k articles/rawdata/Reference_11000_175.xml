'''museum''' is a [[sponsored top-level domain]] (sTLD) in the [[Domain Name System]] of the Internet used exclusively by [[museum]]s, museum associations, and individual members of the museum profession, as these groups are defined by the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archimuse.com/mw2001/papers/hamma/hamma.html | title=A Top Level Museum Domain | publisher=[[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics]] |work=MW2011: [[Museums and the Web]] | date=2001 |accessdate=20 July 2011 | author =Karp, Cary | author-link =Cary Karp | author2 =Hamma, Kenneth | last-author-amp =yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In joint action with the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], ICOM established the [[Museum Domain Management Association]] (MuseDoma), headed by [[Cary Karp]], for the purpose of submitting an application to [[ICANN]] for the creation of the new [[generic top-level domain]] (gTLD), and to operate a registry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/museum/ The .museum Sponsorship Agreement], [[ICANN]].&lt;/ref&gt; The {{mono|museum}} domain was entered into the [[DNS root]] on 20 October 2001, and was the first sponsored top-level domain to be instituted through ICANN's action.

The purpose of this domain is to reserve a segment of the DNS name space reserved for the use of museums; a name space whose conventions are defined by the museum community.  The {{mono|museum}} TLD grants users a quick and intuitive way to verify the authenticity of a museum site.  Conversely, since it is a type of formal third-party certification, museums using this name space obtain a way to assure visitors of the site's validity.

In addition to the eligibility requirements specified in the {{mono|museum}} charter, naming conventions apply to the labeling of subdomains. Extensive support is also being introduced for [[internationalized domain names]], as described at {{mono|about.museum}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.museum/idn/ Internationalized domain names (IDNs) in .museum – Introduction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218013204/http://about.museum/idn/ |date=18 February 2011 }}, [http://about.museum/ about.museum].&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration are processed via accredited registrars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.museum/registrars/ List of .museum accredited registrars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211121127/http://about.museum/registrars/ |date=11 December 2005 }}, about.museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Macc Congail, rí na Rend.png|thumb|An excerpt (Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 503, folio 30r). The text refers to an event dated 1094, and reads in Irish "Macc Congail, rí na Rend, do marbad", which translates into English as "Congal's son, king of [[Kingdom of the Rhinns|Na Renna]], was slain".]]

The '''Annals of Inisfallen''' are a [[chronicle]] of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] history of [[Ireland]]. There are more than 2,500 entries spanning the years between 433 and 1450. The manuscript is thought to have been compiled in 1092, as the chronicle is written by a single scribe down to that point but updated by many different hands thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Evans|Evans, Present and the Past]], pp.&amp;nbsp;12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by the [[monk]]s of Innisfallen Abbey, on [[Innisfallen Island]] on [[Lakes of Killarney|Lough Leane]], near [[Killarney]] in [[Munster]], but made use of sources produced at different centres around [[Munster]] as well as a [[Clonmacnoise]] group text of the hypothetical [[Chronicle of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hughes|Hughes, Early Christian Ireland]], pp.&amp;nbsp;99–162, esp. 99-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the chronological entries, the manuscript contains a short, fragmented narrative of the history of pre-[[Christian]] Ireland, known as the ''pre-Patrician section'', from the time of [[Abraham]] to the arrival of [[Saint Patrick]] in Ireland. This has many elements in common with [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]. It sets the history of Ireland and the [[Gaels]] within [[Eusebius|Eusebian]] universal history, which is provided both by a Latin world chronicle and extracts from ''Réidig dam, a Dé, do nim'', a [[Middle Irish]] poem attributed to [[Flann Mainistrech]] in later manuscripts.

The annals are now housed in the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]]. In 2001, Brian O'Leary, a [[Fianna Fáil]] councillor in Killarney, called for the annals to be returned to the town.

'''Anti-miscegenation laws''' or '''miscegenation laws''' are laws that enforce [[racial segregation]] at the level of marriage and intimate relationships by [[criminalization|criminalizing]] [[interracial marriage]] and sometimes also sex between members of different [[Race (classification of humans)|races]]. Such laws  were first introduced in North America from the late seventeenth century onwards by several of the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and subsequently by many [[US states]] and [[US territories]] and remained in force in many US states until 1967. After the Second World War, an increasing number of states repealed their anti-miscegenation laws. In 1967, in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', the remaining anti-miscegenation laws were held to be unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Similar laws were also enforced in [[Nazi Germany]] as part of the [[Nuremberg laws]], and in [[South Africa]] as part of the system of [[Apartheid]]. In the United States, interracial marriage, cohabitation and sex have been termed "[[miscegenation]]" since the term was coined in 1863. Contemporary usage of the term is less frequent, except to refer to historical laws banning the practice.

==United States==
{{Main|Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States}}
While there have been no nationwide anti-miscegenation laws in the United States, there were [[state law]]s in individual states, particularly in the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] and the [[Plains States]], that prohibited miscegenation. These laws were a part of American law since before the United States was established and remained so until ruled unconstitutional in 1967 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''.  Typically defining miscegenation as a [[felony]], these laws prohibited the solemnization of weddings between people of different races and prohibited the officiating of such ceremonies. Sometimes, the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of miscegenation itself, but felony charges of [[adultery]] or [[fornication]] would be brought against them instead.  All anti-miscegenation laws banned the marriage of whites and non-white groups, primarily blacks, but often also Native Americans and Asians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=283998|title=Preserving Racial Identity: Population Patterns and the Application of Anti-Miscegenation Statutes to Asian Americans, 1910-1950|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the state of [[Oklahoma]] in 1908 banned marriage "between a person of African descent" and "any person not of African descent"; [[Louisiana]] in 1920 banned marriage between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and African Americans (and from 1920 to 1942, [[concubinage]] as well); and [[Maryland]] in 1935 banned marriages between blacks and [[Pinoy|Filipinos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==South Africa==
Early prohibitions on interracial marriages date back to the rule of the [[Dutch East India Company]] when High Commissioner [[Hendrik van Rheede|Van Rheede]] prohibited marriages between European settlers and ''heelslag'' or full-blooded slave women (that is, of pure Asian or African origin) in 1685.  The ban was never enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giliomee|first1=Hermann|title=The Afikaners: Biography of a People|date=2009|publisher=Tafelberg|isbn=978-0-624-04823-7|page=19|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the Pact coalition government passed a law prohibiting marriages between whites and blacks (thought not between whites and "coloured" people).  An attempt was made to extend this ban in 1936 to marriages between whites and coloureds when a bill was introduced in parliament, but a commission of inquiry recommended against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giliomee|first1=Hermann|title=The Afikaners: Biography of a People|date=2009|publisher=Tafelberg|isbn=978-0-624-04823-7|page=344|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Africa]]'s [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]], passed in 1949 under [[Apartheid]], forbade marriages between whites and anyone deemed to be non-whites. The [[Population Registration Act]] (No. 30) of 1950 provided the basis for separating the population of South Africa into different races. Under the terms of this act, all residents of South Africa were to be classified as white, [[coloured]], or native (later called [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]) people. Indians were included under the category "Asian" in 1959. Also in 1950, the [[Immorality Act]] was passed, which criminalized all [[human sexual behavior|sexual relations]] between whites and non-whites. The Immorality Act of 1950 extended an earlier ban on sexual relations between whites and blacks (the Immorality Act [No. 5] of 1927) to a ban on sexual relations between whites and any non-whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Egypt===
In Egypt the government reviews{{Explain|date=October 2015}} all marriages between [[Egypt]]ian men and [[Israelis|Israeli]] women to decide on an individual basis whether to strip the men of their Egyptian [[citizenship]]. The cabinet takes into consideration whether the Israeli woman is an [[Arab]] or a [[Jew]]. This is, however, done for political reasons considering Israelis are not a race and there are Israelis of Egyptian descent. 

Egyptian law says citizenship can only be revoked if the citizen is proven to be [[Espionage|spying]] on his country, and marrying an Israeli is considered an act of spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10247437|title=Cairo court rules on Egyptians married to Israeli women|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2010-10-19|date=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
Within [[Israel]], [[Jews]] can not legally marry non-Jews, although such marriages are generally recognized if performed abroad. &lt;ref name="JC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/family/wedding-woes-1.438450 |title=Getting married in Israel — it's more complicated than you think |last=Ferber |first=Alona |date= |website=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |publisher= |access-date=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi men require a government permit to marry a foreign woman and must be at least 25 years old to apply for such a permit. They may obtain a permit to take a foreign woman as a second wife only if their first wife has cancer, is disabled, or is unable to bear children. Saudi men are forbidden to marry women from [[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]], [[Chad]] and [[Pakistan]].{{why|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=67478 Saudi Arabia toughens restrictions on marriage with foreigners&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Around 1500 BC, the [[Indian subcontinent]] was [[Indo-Aryan migration|settled]] by [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] from the north, who called themselves [[Aryan]]s ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|[[wikt:आर्य#Sanskrit|आर्य]]}} ''{{IAST|ārya}}'' "noble").&lt;ref name="Caste"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/caste-social-differentiation#ref219067 |title=Caste |last=Madan |first=T.

==Europe==
===France===
In 1723, 1724 and 1774 several administrative acts forbade interracial marriages, mainly in colonies, although it is not clear if these acts were lawful. On 2 May 1746, the [[Parlement|Parlement de Paris]] validated an interracial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikicite|reference=M. Allemand in "Traité du Mariage", imprimerie E. Leboyer (Riom France, 1847)|ref={{harvid|Allemand|1847}} }} p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[King Louis XVI]], the order of the [[Conseil du Roi]] of 5 April 1778, signed by [[Antoine de Sartine]], forbade "whites of either sex to contract marriage with blacks, [[mulatto]]s or other people of color" in the Kingdom, as the number of blacks had increased so much in France, mostly in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Arrest du Conseil d'état du Roi concernant les mariages des noirs, mulâtres, ou autres gens de couleur, du 5 avril 1778  (Lille: NJB Peterinck-Cramé, 1778).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was an interracial marriage prohibition, not an interracial sex prohibition. Moreover, it was an administrative act, not a law. There was never any racial law about marriage in France,&lt;ref&gt;{fr} Pétition des hommes de couleur de la Martinique et de la Guadeloupe, Impriperie E. Duverger, Paris (feb. 1829), p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana code, art.&lt;/ref&gt; But some restricted rules were applied about [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and [[nobility]]. In any case, nobles needed the King's authorization for their marriage.

On 20 September 1792, all restrictions regarding interracial marriage were repealed by the Revolutionary government.&lt;ref&gt;Law of September 20th, 1792&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 January 1803, a Napoleonic governmental circular forbade marriages between white males and black women, or black men and white women,&lt;ref&gt;Archives nationales (henceforward A.N.) BB15–211, R4, no 3266&lt;/ref&gt; although the 1804 [[Napoleonic code]] did not mention anything specific about interracial marriage. In 1806 a French court validated an interracial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Allemand|1847|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818, the highest French court (''[[Cour de Cassation|cour de cassation]]'') validated a marriage contracted in [[New York (state)|New York]] between a white man and a colored woman.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Beguin and Emilie born slave in Guadeloupe&amp;mdash;{{harvnb|Allemand|1847|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; All administrative prohibitions were canceled by a law in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Law of April 24th, 1833&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi Germany===
Discrimination against miscegenation mostly followed the mainstream Nazi [[anti-Semitism]], {{citation needed|date=August 2014|reason=the discrimination was against all "non-Aryans", including the Roma and Sinti, who speak an [[Aryan]] language, unlike the Germans}} which considered the Jews to be a group of people supposedly bound by close genetic (blood) ties to form a unit which one could neither join nor secede from. The influence of [[Jew]]s had been declared to have detrimental impact on [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], in order to justify the discriminations and persecutions of Jews. To be spared, one had to prove one's affiliation with the group of the [[Aryan]] race (cf. [[Aryan certificate]]).

[[File:Pflichten der polen.jpg|thumb|right|230px|1940 poster in German and Polish describing "Obligations of [[Poles|Polish]] workers in Germany" including [[Polish decrees|death sentence]] to every man and woman from Poland for sex with a German.]]
Although [[Nazism|Nazi]] doctrine stressed the importance of physiognomy and genes in determining race, in practice race was determined only through the religions followed by each individual's ancestors. Individuals were considered non-Aryan (i.e. Jewish) if at least three of four of their grandparents had been enrolled as members of a Jewish congregation; it did not matter if those grandparents had been born to a Jewish family or had converted to Judaism in adulthood. The actual religious beliefs of the individual himself or herself were also immaterial, as was the individual's status under [[Halachic]] law.

An anti-miscegenation law was enacted by the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] government in September 1935 as part of the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. The ''Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre'' (Protection of German Blood and German Honor Act), enacted on 15 September 1935, forbade marriage and extramarital sexual relations between persons ''racially'' regarded as non-Aryans and Aryans (persons of "German or related blood"); this included all marriages, where at least one partner was a German citizen.&lt;ref&gt;The existence of an Aryan race and other non-Aryan races as conceived and categorised by Nazism was an arbitrary and unscientific figment of Nazi racism.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Non-Aryans'' comprised mostly Jewish Germans and [[Gentile]] Germans of Jewish descent. However, Germans of extra-European and especially of African descent and Germans regarded as belonging to the minority group of [[Sinti and Roma]] (Insultingly referred to as Gypsies) were also considered as non-Aryans. On the 26 November 1935, the laws were extended to "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = S. H.

''race-disgrace'') and could be punished by imprisonment – later usually followed by the deportation to a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], often entailing the inmate's death. Germans of African and other extra-European descent were classified following their own origin or the origin of their parents. Sinti and Roma were mostly categorised following police records, e.g. mentioning them or their forefathers as Gypsies, when having been met by the police as travelling peddlers.

The existing 20,454 (as of 1939) marriages between persons ''racially'' regarded as Aryans and so-called non-Aryans – called ''mixed marriages'' ({{lang-de|Mischehe}}) – would continue.&lt;ref&gt;Beate Meyer, ''Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der Hamburger Juden 1933–1945'', Landeszentrale für politische Bildung (ed.), Hamburg: Landeszentrale für politische Bildung, 2006, p. 80. {{ISBN|3-929728-85-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government eased the conditions for the divorce of mixed marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Before 1933 the term Mischehe referred to interfaith marriages, which was a tax office phenomenon. German tax offices deducted [[church tax]] from taxpayers, enrolled with a religious body, with the general tax collection by a surcharge on the income tax and then transferred it to the respective religious body. Interfaith mixed marriages, who were taxed as a unit, would have the charged church tax halved among the two respective religious bodies. Mostly the Roman Catholic Church, the respective Protestant [[Landeskirche|regional church bodies]] and the Jewish congregations (in their case ending by Nazi act in March 1938) collected contributions from their members by way of church tax. Since the Nazis gave the term ''Mischehe'' a new meaning the tax offices were ordered to change their terminology to ''konfessionsverschiedene Ehe'' ({{lang-en|denominationally different marriage}}). Cf. Cornelia Schmitz-Berning, ''Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus'', Berlin et al.: de Gruyter, 1998, p. 409. {{ISBN|3-11-013379-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning the Nazi authorities hoped to make the Aryan partner get a divorce from their non-Aryan-classified spouses, by granting easy legal divorce procedures and opportunities for the Aryan spouse to withhold most of the common property after a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;By the "Gesetz zur Vereinheitlichung des Rechts der Eheschließung und der Ehescheidung (EheG)" ("Act on standardisation of the law of contraction and divorce of marriages", as of 6 July 1938) divorce on so-called racial grounds was enabled. Cf. Reichsgesetzblatt (RGBl., i.e. the Reich's law gazette) 1938 I, p. 807, § 37 EheG (Bedeutungsirrtum), cf. also Alexandra Przyrembel, ''"Rassenschande": Reinheitsmythos und Vernichtungslegitimation im Nationalsozialismus'', Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2003, (Veröffentlichungen des Max-Planck-Instituts für Geschichte; vol. 190), p. 86 ({{ISBN|3-525-35188-7}}) or – as to contesting or dissolving a marriage – see Bernhard Müller, ''Alltag im Zivilisationsbruch: Das Ausnahme-Unrecht gegen die jüdische Bevölkerung in Deutschland 1933–1945; eine rechtstatsächliche Untersuchung des Sonderrechts und seiner Folgewirkungen auf den "Alltag" der Deutschen jüdischer Abstammung und jüdischen Bekenntnisses'', Munich: Allitera-Verlag, 2003, simultaneously Bielefeld, Univ., Diss., 2002, pp. 344–348. {{ISBN|3-935877-68-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who stuck to their spouse would suffer discriminations like dismissal from public employment, exclusion from civic society organisations, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Based on an evaluation of divorce decrees, however restricted to only one former [[Reichsgau]], the discriminations and easements caused a divorce rate of mixed marriages 20% above the general average. Many divorces followed after the couple succeeded in achieving a visa and thus emigration for the Jewish-classified spouse, so the divorce would lift the discriminations hitting the Aryan-classified spouse, who stayed at home. Cf. Beate Meyer,'' 'Jüdische Mischlinge' – Rassenpolitik und Verfolgungserfahrung 1933–1945'' (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;1999), Hamburg: Dölling und Galitz, (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;2002), (Studien zur jüdischen Geschichte; vol. 6), simultaneously Hamburg, Univ., Diss., 1998, {{ISBN|3-933374-22-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any children – whenever born – within a mixed marriage, as well as children from extramarital mixed relationships born until July 31, 1936, were discriminated against as ''[[Mischling]]e''. However, children later born to mixed parents, not yet married at passing the Nuremberg Laws, were to be discriminated against as ''[[Geltungsjude]]n'', regardless if the parents had meanwhile married abroad or remained unmarried. Any children who were enrolled in a Jewish congregation were also subject to discrimination as ''Geltungsjuden''.

According to the Nazi family value attitude, the husband was regarded the head of a family. Thus people living in a [[interracial marriage|mixed marriage]] were treated differently according to the sex of the Aryan spouse and according to the religious affiliation of the children, their being or not being enrolled with a Jewish congregation. Nazi-termed mixed marriages were often not [[interfaith marriage]]s, because in many cases the classification of one spouse as non-Aryan was only due to her or his grandparents being enrolled with a Jewish congregation or else classified as non-Aryan. In many cases both spouses had a common faith, either because the parents had already converted or because at marrying one spouse converted to the religion of the second ([[marital conversion]]). Traditionally the wife used to be the convert.&lt;ref&gt;This was maintained by the pre-1939 practice of Jewish congregations in Germany, which denied Jewesses who married Gentiles, to be precise non-converts to Judaism, to keep their membership in a congregation. This turned the Jewesses, if they did not convert to another faith, legally into irreligionists. On the other hand, Jews marrying Gentile women could (stay) enroll(ed) as member of a Jewish congregation.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in urban areas and after 1900, actual interfaith marriages occurred more often, with interfaith marriages legally allowed in some states of the [[German Confederation]] since 1847, and generally since 1875, when [[civil marriage]] became an obligatory prerequisite for any religious marriage ceremony throughout the [[German Empire|united Germany]].

Most mixed marriages occurred with one spouse being considered as non-Aryan, due to his or her Jewish descent. Many special regulations were developed for such couples. A differentiation of privileged and other mixed marriages emerged on 28 December 1938, when [[Hermann Göring]] discretionarily ordered this in a letter to the ''Reich's Ministry of the Interior''.&lt;ref&gt;Beate Meyer, "Geschichte im Film. Judenverfolgung, Mischehen und der Protest in der Rosenstraße 1943", in: ''Zeitschrift für Geschichtswissenschaft'', vol. 52 (2004), pp. 23–36, footnote 23 on p. 28. {{ISSN|0044-2828}}. Some historians judge this intervention of Göring as a tactical measure, in order not to arouse protests by so-called Aryan kinship, since after secret service reports the government organised [[November Pogrom]] in 1938 the regime did not feel so safe about the public's opinion on further anti-Semitic discriminations. Cf. Ursula Büttner, "Die Verfolgung der christlich-jüdischen 'Mischfamilien{{'"}}, in: Ursula Büttner, ''Die Not der Juden teilen. Christlich-jüdische Familien im Dritten Reich. Beispiel und Zeugnis des Schriftstellers Robert Brendel'', Hamburg: Christians, 1988, p. 44. {{ISBN|3-7672-1055-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Gesetz über die Mietverhältnisse mit Juden" ({{lang-en|Law on Tenancies with Jews}}) of 30 April 1939, allowing proprietors to unconditionally cancel tenancy contracts with Germans classified as Jews, thus forcing them to move into houses reserved for them, for the first time enacted Göring's creation. The law defined ''privileged mixed marriages'' and exempted them from the act.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Reichsgesetzblatt (RGBl., i.e. the Reich's law gazette) 1939 I, 864 § 7 [http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19390007&amp;zoom=2&amp;seite=00000864&amp;x=15&amp;y=7 law text]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal definitions decreed: The marriage of a Gentile husband and his wife, being a Jewess or being classified as a Jewess due to her descent, was generally considered to be a ''privileged mixed marriage'', unless they had children, who were enrolled in a Jewish congregation. Then the husband was obviously not the dominant part in the family and the wife had to wear the [[yellow badge]] and the children as well, who were thus discriminated against as ''Geltungsjuden''. Without children, or with children not enrolled with a Jewish congregation, the Jewish-classified wife was spared from wearing the yellow badge (else compulsory for Germans classified as Jews as of 1 September 1941).

In the opposite case, when the wife was classified as an Aryan and the husband as a Jew, the husband had to wear the yellow badge, if they had no children or children enrolled with a Jewish congregation. In case they had common children not enrolled in a Jewish congregation (irreligionist, Christian etc.) they were discriminated as ''Mischlinge'' and their father was spared from wearing the yellow badge.

Since there was no elaborate regulation, the practice of exempting ''privileged mixed marriages'' from anti-Semitic invidiousnesses varied amongst [[Nazi Germany|Greater Germany]]'s different [[Reichsgau]]e. However, all discriminations enacted until December 28, 1938 remained valid without exemptions for ''privileged mixed marriages''. In the Reichsgau Hamburg, for example, Jewish-classified spouses living in ''privileged mixed marriages'' received equal food rations like Aryan-classified Germans. In many other Reichsgaue they received shortened rations.&lt;ref name="Beate Meyer 2006, p. 83"&gt;Beate Meyer, ''Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der Hamburger Juden 1933–1945'', Landeszentrale für politische Bildung (ed.), Hamburg: Landeszentrale für politische Bildung, 2006, p. 83. {{ISBN|3-929728-85-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some Reichsgaue in 1942 and 1943, privileged mixed couples, and their minor children whose father was classified as a Jew, were forced to move into houses reserved for Jews only; this effectively made a privileged mixed marriage one where the husband was the one classified as Aryan.

The inconsistent application of  ''privileged mixed marriages'' led to different compulsions to forced labour in 1940: Sometimes it was ordered for all Jewish-classified spouses, sometimes for Jewish-classified husbands, sometimes exempting Jewish-classified wives taking care of minor children. No document or law indicated the exemption of a mixed marriage from some persecutions and especially of its Jewish-classified spouse.&lt;ref&gt;''Meldungen aus dem Reich: Auswahl aus den geheimen Lageberichten des Sicherheitsdienstes der SS 1939–1944'' (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;1965; Reports from the Reich: Selection from the secret reviews of the situation of the [[SS]] 1939–1944; 1984 extended to 14 vols.), Heinz Boberach (ed. and compilator), Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv), &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1968, (dtv-dokumente; vol. 477) p. 208. ISBN B0000BSLXR&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if arrested, non-arrested relatives or friends had to prove their exemption status, hopefully fast enough to rescue the arrested from any deportation.

Systematic [[Deportation#Deportation in the Holocaust|deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent]] started on October 18, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;The earlier deportations of Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent from [[Austria]] and [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania Province]] (both to [[General Government|occupied Poland]]) as well as [[Baden]] and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] (both to [[Military Administration in Belgium and North France|occupied France]]) had been organized in those specific areas and not generally throughout the Reich.&lt;/ref&gt; German Jews and German Gentiles of Jewish descent living in ''mixed marriage'' were in fact mostly spared from deportation.&lt;ref&gt;At the [[Wannsee Conference]] the participants decided to include persons classified as Jews, but married to persons classified as Aryans, however, only after a divorce. In October 1943 an act, facilitating compulsory divorce imposed by the state, was ready for appointment, however, [[Hitler]] never granted the competent referees an audience. Pressure by the [[NSDAP]] headquarters in early 1944 also failed. Cf. Uwe Dietrich Adam, ''Judenpolitik im Dritten Reich'', Düsseldorf: 2003, pp. 222–234. {{ISBN|3-7700-4063-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case a mixed marriage ended by death of the Aryan spouse or divorce, the Jewish-classified spouse residing within Germany was usually deported soon after, unless the couple still had minor children not counting as Geltungsjuden.&lt;ref name="Beate Meyer 2006, p. 83"/&gt;

In March 1943, an attempt to deport the Berlin-based Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent living in non-privileged mixed marriages, failed due to public protest by their relatives-in-law of Aryan kinship (see [[Rosenstraße protest]]). Also, the Aryan-classified husbands and Mischling-classified children (starting at the age of 16) from mixed marriages were taken by the [[Organisation Todt]] for forced labour, starting in autumn 1944.

A last attempt, undertaken in February/March 1945 ended, because the [[extermination camp]]s already were liberated. However, 2,600 from all areas of the Reich, not yet captured by the Allies, were deported to [[Theresienstadt]], of whom most survived the last months until their liberation.&lt;ref&gt;8,000 Berliners whom the Nazis had classified as Jews because of 3 or 4 grandparents survived to the summer of 1944. Their personal faith – Jewish, Protestant, Catholic or irreligionist – is mostly not recorded, since only the Nazi files report on them, which use the Nazi racial definitions. 4,700 out of the 8,000 survived due to their living in a mixed marriage. 1,400 survived by hiding, out of 5,000 who tried. 1,900 had returned from Theresienstadt. See Hans-Rainer Sandvoß, ''Widerstand in Wedding und Gesundbrunnen'', Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand (ed.), Berlin: Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand, 2003, (''Schriftenreihe über den Widerstand in Berlin von 1933 bis 1945'', No. 14), p. 302. {{ISSN|0175-3592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 the laws banning mixed marriages were lifted again. Marriage dates could be backdated, if so desired, for couples who lived together unmarried during the Nazi era due to the legal restrictions, upon marrying after the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Bundesgesetz über die Anerkennung freier Ehen'' (as of 23 June 1950, Federal law on recognition of free marriages).&lt;/ref&gt; Even if one spouse was already dead, the marriage could be retroactively recognised, in order to legitimise any children and enable them or the surviving spouse to inherit from their late father or partner, respectively. In the [[West Germany|West German Federal Republic of Germany]] 1,823 couples applied for recognition (until 1963), which was granted in 1,255 cases.&lt;ref&gt;Beate Meyer, ''{{'}}Jüdische Mischlinge' – Rassenpolitik und Verfolgungserfahrung 1933–1945'' (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;1999), Hamburg: Dölling und Galitz, (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;2002), (Studien zur jüdischen Geschichte; vol. 6), simultaneously Hamburg, Univ., Diss., 1998, p. 469. {{ISBN|3-933374-22-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
After the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the late 5th century, the [[Ostrogoths]] under the [[Theodoric the Great]] established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] at [[Ravenna]], ruling [[Italy]] as a [[dominant minority]].&lt;ref name="Theodoric"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodoric-king-of-Italy |title=Theodoric |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher= |access-date=August 23, 2018 |quote=With his people, who may have numbered 100,000 persons, Theodoric arrived in Italy in late August 489... his people could not legally intermarry with Romans... He never missed an opportunity to propagate the idea of civilitas (“civilized life” or “civilization”), a concept that includes the maintenance of peace and order, racial harmony, and the outlawing of oppression and violence. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Italy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Italy/History#ref27619 |title=Italy: The Ostrogothic Kingdom |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher= |access-date=August 23, 2018 |quote=Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, conquered Italy and killed Odoacer in 493.

Theodoric, who did not want the Ostrogoths to become Romanized, encouraged them to keep their distance from the Romans. Yet such apartheid did not last. Some Romans joined the army; many more Goths became landowners, legally or illegally, and adopted civilian Roman cultural traditions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ancient Rome"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome/The-Later-Roman-Empire#ref26709 |title=Ancient Rome: The Barbarian Kingdoms |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher= |access-date=August 23, 2018 |quote=The barbarians were everywhere a small minority.

As part of the [[Manifesto of Race]] in [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], laws prohibiting marriage between Aryans ([[Italians]]) and non-Aryans ([[Africans]] and [[Jews]]) were passed in Italy and its foreign colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno (3 August 2006). Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War. Cambridge University Press. p. 65. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century, the [[Visigoths]] established the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in [[Iberia]], ruling the peninsula as a dominant minority. The Visigoths were subjected to their own [[Code of Euric|legal code]], and were forbidden from intermarrying with the Romans. This law was abolished in the 6th century.&lt;ref name="Spain"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain/Iberians |title=Spain: Visigothic Spain to c. 500 |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher= |access-date=August 23, 2018 |quote=Despite the collapse of imperial rule in Spain, Roman influence remained strong.

'''Batavianization'''{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} or '''Batavianisation'''{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|-ise vs -ize]]) also known as '''Dutchification'''&lt;ref name="Fase"/&gt; and; historically, as '''Belgianization''',{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} is the spread of the Dutch language, people and/or culture either by force or assimilation. In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] it is known as ''vernederlandsing'' or ''neerlandisatie''.

==Terminology==
The term ''Batavianization'', derives its name from the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], a Germanic tribe living in the Netherlands, and long regarded as the mythical ancestors of the [[Dutch people]]. The term ''Dutchification'' is mostly used in English publications by Dutch authors, less so by native English-speakers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This likely has to do with the fact that ''Dutch'' isn't a [[Latin]]-derived term and hence sounds somewhat childish to some ears in combination with the (Latinate) [[suffix]] ''-fication''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=OR}} As for ''Belgianization'', ''Belgae'' was the standard term in Latin to refer to the Dutch (compare the [[Leo Belgicus]], [[United Belgian States]] and [[Belgic Confession]] for example) in the [[Late Middle Ages]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=OR}} After the establishment of Belgium, its use generally shifted to mean [[Belgian nationalism|Belgicism]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=OR}}

==Historical Batavianization==

===The Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, most of the Batavianization was of a linguistic and, to a lesser extent cultural nature, and was focused on the [[Frisia|Frisian region]]. Beginning at the end of the [[migration period]], Dutch nobles sought to conquer the Frisian lands, in which they largely succeeded around the end of the [[High Middle Ages]]. The conquest was gradual and moved from the West to the East. By the time the Frisian heartland (the modern province of [[Friesland]]) was conquered, many Frisians formerly living in [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Frisia]] had already fled and the region was subsequently colonized by Dutch settlers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In the remaining Frisian territory, a ruling Dutch upper class was instituted, the legacy of which can still be found in [[Stadsfries]]. The [[West Frisian language]] has since adopted large amounts of Dutch vocabulary, to such an extent that many objects or concepts originating after the Dutch conquest are nearly all [[calque]]s or [[loanword]]s from Dutch.

Despite Batavianization and the general idea that Frisians were underdeveloped and rural, Frisians never were the subject of ethnic discrimination or willful linguistic or cultural oppression.

Between the 1950s and early 1980s, primarily due to migration of rural West Frisian speakers to the non-West Frisian urban areas, and the settling of Dutch speakers from outside the province in the Frisian countryside, the percentage of inhabitants of Friesland using West Frisian as their home language dropped from 71% to 59%. The West Frisian language itself gradually dutchified as well.&lt;ref name="Fase"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fase |first=Willem |author2=Koen Jaspaert |author3=Sjaak Kroon |date=2013 |title=The State of Minority Languages. International Perspectives on Survival and Decline |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LB9mAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293 |publisher=Routledge |page=293 |isbn=9781134379422 |accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniglot.com/writing/frisian.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] study by linguist Geert Driessen showed that the percentage of West Frisian speakers steadily declined between 1994 and 2014 in favour of Dutch. During those twenty years, the number of West Frisian-speaking children within families decreased from 48% to 32%, and outside families (amongst their friends) from 44% to 22%. The percentage of parents talking West Frisian amongst themselves dropped from 58% to 35%. According to Driessen, 'in two generations, there won't be much left', because people will no longer be able to read and especially write in West Frisian. The Dutch language would hang on for a few generations longer than West Frisian, but Driessen expects 'everything to switch to [[English language|English]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2116603-friese-taal-met-uitsterven-bedreigd.html |title=Friese taal met uitsterven bedreigd? |author=Menno de Galan &amp; Willem Lust |work=[[Nieuwsuur]] |publisher=NOS |date=9 July 2016 |accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniglot.com/writing/frisian.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
In Belgium, batavianization was an essential part of the political objectives of the [[Flemish movement]], a [[social movement]] seeking acknowledgement of the Dutch language and culture. When Belgium was established in 1830, the Francophone government oppressed the Dutch populace. Dutch was banned from higher education, politics and justice in favour of [[French language|French]]. Hence Batavianization in Belgium largely refers to the process of replacing French as the language of education in universities and as the language of culture among the elite.

===New Netherland===
In the [[toponymy of New Netherland]], a 17th-century province in North America, Batavianization is seen in many [[place names]] based in [[Delaware languages]].

For the concept of "Batavianization" in colonial North America, see:
*John M. Murrin, "English Rights as Ethnic Aggression: The English Conquest, the Charter of Liberties of 1683, ...  suggests that "Batavianization" played as significant a role as "Anglicization" in early New York.

[[Image:Libro del conocimiento.jpg|thumb|Title page illustration of the "Z" manuscript, with the [[Heraldry of Castile#Quartering with the arms of León|Coat of arms of Castile and León]] and the [[Royal Bend of Castile]] of [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]].]]
The ''''' Libro del Conosçimiento de todos los rregnos''''' or '''''Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms''''', also known as the '''''Book of All Kingdoms''''', is an anonymous 14th-century [[Spanish language|Castilian]] geographical and armorial  manual (dated to ca. 1385). 
It is written in the form of imaginary autobiographical travelogue of a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] [[mendicant orders|mendicant friar]], as he travels through the entire world, known and fanciful, from the westernmost [[Atlantic islands]], through Europe, Asia, Africa and the Arctic, identifying all the lands, kings, lords and their [[coat of arms|armorial devices]] as he passes them.
The only explicit information is that the anonymous author claims to have been born in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] in 1305.

The full title is also cited as {{lang|es|Libro del conosçimiento de todos los reynos y tierras y señoríos que son por el mundo, et de las señales et armas que han cada tierra y señorío por sy y de los reyes y señores que los proueen}} "Book of the Knowledge of all the Kingdoms, Lands and Lordships that are in the World, and the arms and devices of each land and lordship, or of the kings and lords who possess them"  (Markham 1912).

The book's principal objective may have been as an [[roll of arms|armorial]] roll. Its choice of presenting itself in the form of an imaginary travelogue may have been whimsical, to tap into the fashionable [[travel literature]] of the era, popularized by [[Marco Polo]] and [[John Mandeville]]. 
Its geographical features are closely related to those of the [[Medici Atlas]] (notionally dated 1351, but probably c.1370). Also near-contemporary is the [[Catalan Atlas]].

Four manuscripts of the work are known, designated "Z", "N", "R" and "S".

A manuscript copy of the ''Libro'', once owned by the 16th-century historian [[Jerónimo Zurita y Castro]], and subsequently held by the count of San Clemente in Zaragoza, was reported lost sometime around 1680.  It is believed this was the manuscript that resurfaced in London in 1978, popularly known as Manuscript "Z", currently held by the [[Bavarian State Library]] in [[Munich]], as "Cod.hisp. 150".  This manuscript, written in the late 14th century, is replete with miniature [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations]] drawn by an [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] illustrator.  
A facsimile was published in 1999.  In the introduction to that edition, editor Lacarra doubts the original c.1350 dating, and proposes instead that the ''Libro'' was probably composed a bit later, probably around 1385.

Manuscripts "N" and "R"  are kept in the [[British Library]].

A further manuscript of the ''Libro'' was discovered in 1874 and compiled and published in 1877 in [[Madrid]], by Marcos Jiménez de la Espada.
This is  the most complete of the extant copies, known as Manuscript "S", kept in the [[Spanish National Library]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Libro del Conosçimiento de todos los rregnos et tierras e señoríos que son por el mundo et de las señales et armas que han cada tierra y señorío por sy y de los reyes y señores que los proueen, escrito por un franciscano español á mediados del siglo XIV'' (Marcos Jiménez de la Espada ed., 1877, Madrid: Impr. de T. Fortanet [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lMEEgk1U-kC&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online])&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction, the editor presented the book as an authentic travelogue of a Castilian [[Franciscan]] mendicant friar written around 1350. However, immediately upon its appearance, contemporary scholars (not without a touch of mockery at the editor) noted the travelogue was largely fantastical and imaginary, and that there was no clear indication that the author was a friar, Franciscan or otherwise.

'''[[British Museum]] leather dressing''' has been used by many conservators since its publication&lt;ref &gt;(Plenderleith, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to protect and conserve leather.

== Formulation ==
The basic formulation is:
{|
|-
| 200 g || anhydrous [[lanolin]]
|-
| 30 ml || [[cedar oil]] (acts as a fungicide)
|-
| 15 g || [[beeswax]] (optional)
|-
| 330 ml || [[Petroleum ether|X-4]] solvent or [[hexane]] (solvent)
|}

The first three ingredients are mixed warm, then added to the cold solvent and allowed to cool while constantly stirring.&lt;ref name="Amol"&gt;{{cite web

  |archivedate=6 April 2007
  |df=dmy-all
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Care should be exercised, as hexane is highly flammable.

== Variations ==
There are several variations in the formulation.

Sometimes 60% of the lanolin was replaced by [[neatsfoot oil]]. 

One disadvantage of the solvent hexane is its tendency to evaporate rapidly. Before the fat/hexane mixture has been able to penetrate deep into the leather the hexane evaporates to the surface of the leather, taking most fat with it. 

While beeswax prevents air pollutants from penetrating the leather it does this by closing off the leather, thus disturbing the water balance and causing the leather to dry out.&lt;ref name="Koninklijke Bibliotheek" &gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2007-04-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In use ==
The British Museum leather dressing was part of an elaborate leather conservation programme. Other steps entailed cleaning the leather, if necessary with soap and water, and applying an aqueous solution of 7% [[potassium lactate]] as a [[buffer solution|buffer]]. A warning was given about the dangers of using too much lactate, which made books sticky and could cause fungal growth. The books had to be absolutely dry when the leather dressing was applied.

Apply sparingly to the leather and rub well. Wait two days, then polish the treated leather with a soft cloth. Very hard leather can be soaked in a solution of one part British Museum leather dressing: three parts [[Stoddard solvent]].&lt;ref name="TAMU" &gt;{{cite web

British Museum leather dressing darkens leather, but it is a treatment with a good success record.&lt;ref name="Amol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TAMU" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2744">The '''Canadian Language Museum''' ([[French language|French]]: Le Musée canadien des langues), founded in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumsontario.ca/museum/Canadian-Language-Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/canadian-language-museum/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://chimp.net/charities/canadian-language-museum&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[museum]] and registered Canadian charity. It has the mission to promote an appreciation of all of the [[languages]] spoken in Canada, and of their role in the development of the country.

Since its founding, the Canadian Language Museum has curated a bilingual, [[traveling exhibit]] each year. The exhibits that have been produced so far include:
* ''[[Canadian English]], Eh?'' (2012)
* ''Speaking the [[Inuit]] Way'' (2013)
* [[Canadian French|''French in Canada'']] (2014)
* [[Cree language|''Cree'']]'': The People's Language'' (2015)

Each exhibit is produced with the assistance of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information|Faculty of Information]], and the [[University of Toronto]] Department of [[Linguistics]]; as well as relevant academic and community stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;http://utlinguistics.blogspot.ca/2015/03/report-from-canadian-language-museums.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its exhibits travel across Canada, from Victoria to St. Johns, touring schools, universities, community centres, libraries and other similar public institutions.

The Museum has also been present at the annual meeting of the [[Canadian Linguistic Association]] each late May &lt;ref&gt;http://cla-acl.ca/congres-de-2015-2015-conference/&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences|Congress for the Humanities and Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congress2013.ca/program/events/canadian-language-museum-speaking-inuit-way-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum also supports its mission online by operating a website, where interested parties can request exhibit loans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languagemuseum.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; It also promotes language revitalization, the work of Canadian linguists, and language research more broadly through its Twitter account,&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/CanLangMuseum&lt;/ref&gt; and with its blog,&lt;ref&gt;https://langmusecad.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes original interviews with people from across Canada working to protect and promote the languages of Canada.

The Canadian Language Museum opened its office in [[Toronto]] in the summer of 2015.

'''[[Charis (name)|Charis]] Global School''' is a private [[National Plus school]] in [[Lippo Cikarang]], Bekasi City, [[West Java]], [[Indonesia]]. Essentially, the school programs are developed into three categories: Early Childhood Program ([[Preschool|Nursery]] 1-2 and [[Kindergarten]] 1-2), [[Primary School|Primary Program]] (Grade 1 to 6)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dapo.dikdasmen.kemdikbud.go.id/sekolah/E77E1D88181E50799A32|title=Profil SDS Charis Global|date=8 November 2010|publisher=kemdikbud.go.id|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Secondary School|Secondary Program]] (Grade 7 to 9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dapo.dikdasmen.kemdikbud.go.id/sekolah/1F5958E29DF6055E43E7|title=Profil SMPS Charis Global|date=29 November 2016|publisher=kemdikbud.go.id|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school provides an [[English-medium education]] system besides [[Bahasa Indonesia]] as the language of instruction for Indonesian-based subjects. The student composition is primarily Indonesian but includes other nationalities. There are expatriate students mainly from Korea, Japan, China, Malaysia, and India.

== History ==
Charis Global School was established in 2007 for local and expatriate students living in [[Lippo Cikarang]].

The school has grown rapidly after initially opening only a pre-school level that offers the Early Childhood Programs. In 2009, the school started its Primary Program. The school changed its name to Charis Global School from Charis Global International School to comply with the Indonesian government's regulations on prohibiting the use of word "international" in school names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edukasi.kompas.com/read/2015/02/17/21385591/Sekolah.Internasional.Berganti.Label.|title=Pelarangan sekolah dan rumahsakit berlabel internasional}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, the school had expanded into its Secondary Program.

This is a compendium of '''continuous integration software''' that supports a [[software engineering]] practice, [[continuous integration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Continuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk|last=Integration|first=Continuous|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2007|isbn=9780321630148|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which developers' changes are immediately tested and reported when they are added to the mainline code base. The comparison of various continuous integration tools is done on the basis of [[Computing platform|platform]], [[Software license|license]], [[Software build|builders]] and [[System integration|Integration]] [[Integrated development environment|IDEs]].

'''Denbigh Cockpit''' is a reconstructed building at [[St Fagans National Museum of History]] in [[Cardiff]], the capital of [[Wales]]. The [[cockpit (cockfighting)|cockpit]] formerly stood in the yard of the Hawk and Buckle Inn at Vale Street, [[Denbigh]], and is thought to date from the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.peoplescollectionwales.co.uk/Item/60538-hawk-and-buckle-cockpit-denbigh People's Collection Wales: Hawk and Buckle cockpit, Denbigh]. Accessed 6 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a Grade II listed building.

[[Cockfighting]] became illegal in Britain in 1849, and the cockpit was used for other purposes over the years, such as a garage.  In 1911 it was visited by members of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Constructions in Wales and Monmouthshire, and was found to be "preserved with much care".&lt;ref &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=98kHnuPa-JIC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=hawk+and+buckle+inn+cockpit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E5wV5uTcF0&amp;sig=rARd36k7yaMbqVktlrvVWaZycSU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xH96Us7FIseJ0AXSzIHQDA&amp;ved=0CIgBEOgBMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=hawk%20and%20buckle%20inn%20cockpit&amp;f=false ''An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire'', 1911]. Accessed 6 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It was in a poor state of repair by 1965, when a decision was made to move it to St Fagans.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/stfagans/buildings/cockpit/?display_mode=mobile Cockpit – National Museum Wales]. Accessed 6 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The cockpit was opened to the public at St Fagans in 1970.

[[File:The Ooser 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|One of only two known photographs of the original Ooser, taken between 1883 and 1891 by J.W. Chaffins and Sons of Yeovil]]

The '''Dorset Ooser''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|s|ər}}) is a wooden head that featured in the 19th-century [[folk culture]] of [[Melbury Osmond]], a village in the southwestern English county of [[Dorset]]. The head was hollow, thus perhaps serving as a [[Mask#Europe|mask]], and included a humanoid face with horns, a beard, and a hinged jaw which allowed the mouth to open and close. Although sometimes used to scare people during practical jokes, its main recorded purpose was as part of a local variant of the [[charivari]] custom known as "[[Charivari#England|skimity riding]]" or "rough music", in which it was used to humiliate those who were deemed to have behaved in an immoral manner.

The Dorset Ooser was first brought to public attention in 1891, at which time it was under the ownership of the Cave family of Melbury Osmond's Holt Farm. After travelling with Edward Cave to [[Somerset]], the Ooser went missing around 1897. Since then, various [[folkloristics|folklorists]] and historians have debated the origins of the head, which has possible connections to the horned costumes sometimes worn by participants in English [[Mummers play]]s. The folklorists [[Frederick Thomas Elworthy]] and H. S. L. Dewar believed that the head was a representation of the [[Devil]] and thus was designed to intimidate people into behaving according to the local community's moral system. Conversely, the folklorist [[Margaret Murray]] suggested that it represented a [[Celtic polytheism|pre-Christian]] [[List of fertility deities#Celtic mythology|god of fertility]] whose worship survived in Dorset into the modern period, although more recent scholarship has been highly sceptical of this interpretation. The etymology of ''Ooser'' is also disputed, with various possibilities available.

In 1975 a replica of the original Ooser was produced by John Byfleet, which has since been on display at [[Dorset County Museum]] in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]. This mask retains a place in Dorset folk culture, being removed from the museum for use in local [[Morris dance|Morris dancing]] processions held by the Wessex Morris Men on both [[St. George's Day]] and [[May Day]]. The design of the Ooser has also inspired the production of copies which have been used as representations of the [[Horned God]] in the [[Modern paganism|modern Pagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] in both the United Kingdom and United States.

==Description and etymology==
A wooden head, the Dorset Ooser had been cut from a single block of timber, with the exception of the lower jaw, which was movable and connected to the rest of the mask by leather hinges.{{sfn|May|1891|p=289}} The lower jaw could be moved by pulling on a string which passed through a hole in the upper jaw to connect to the lower.{{sfn|May|1891|p=289}} The mask also contained locks of hair on either side of its head, a beard on its chin, and a pair of bullock's horns.{{sfn|May|1891|p=289}} Between the Ooser's eyes was a rounded boss, the meaning of which is unknown.{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=178}} The Ooser was hollow, allowing someone to place their own head within it, potentially permitting it to be worn as a mask whilst being supported on the shoulders; however, there were no holes allowing for the wearer to see while wearing it in this way.{{sfn|May|1891|p=289}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] described the Ooser as "a terrifying horned mask with human face, staring eyes, beard, and gnashing teeth".{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=88}} Similarly, the folklorist H. S. L. Dewar stated that "the expression of the eyes [conveyed] a really agonized spirit of hatred, terror, and despair".{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=178}}

The term "Ooser" was pronounced with a short, quick ''s'' by villagers as ''Osser''.{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=180}} It is unclear if the head itself was the Ooser, or whether it instead was designed as a depiction of an entity called the Ooser.{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=179}} Dewar suggested the possibility that it might have been connected to the term ''Wurse'', used for the Devil in [[Layamon]]'s ''[[Layamon's Brut|Brut]]'', or to the 17th-century Italian term ''Oser'', again used for the Devil.{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=180}} Alternately, he suggested that it might be a derivative of ''Guisard'' or ''Guiser'', two old terms for a [[mummers play|mummer]].{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=180}} Hutton instead proposed that ''Osser'' possibly derived from ''Wooset'', a term used in the dialect around [[Wiltshire]] to refer to a pole upon which a horse's skull with deer's horns was affixed. This Wooset was recorded as having been paraded by youths in the [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] district until the 1830s, where it was used to mock neighbours whose partners were suspected of marital infidelity, the horns being a traditional sign of [[cuckold]]ry.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=88}} Similar traditions have been recorded in Wiltshire and Somerset, where they can be traced back to at least the early 17th century.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=88}}

==History==
The first public mention of the Dorset Ooser was in an 1891 edition of ''Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries'', where it was the subject of an article by the journal's editor, Charles Herbert May. The head was, at the time, in the possession of Thos Cave of Holt Farm in [[Melbury Osmond]]; the editor noted that it had been owned by Cave's family from "time out of mind".{{sfn|May|1891|p=290}} Cave had stated that it had formerly been kept in an "old malt-house" in the village, "where it was an object of terror to children who ventured to intrude upon the premises".{{sfn|May|1891|p=290}} May noted that it was "possibly the only example now in existence, or at any rate from one of the very few which may still survive in the County",{{sfn|May|1891|p=289}} adding that Cave was "willing to dispose of this mask to a lover of objects of antiquarian interest".{{sfn|May|1891|p=290}}

At some point before 1897, another member of the family, the doctor Edward Cave, left Holt Farm and moved to [[Crewkerne]] in [[Somerset]], taking the Ooser with him.{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=178}} In 1897, he relocated to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], leaving the Ooser with his family coachman; when Edward Cave subsequently tried to recover the head, he was informed that it had been "disposed of", with some suggestion that it had found its way to the United States.{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=178}} In 1935, a folklore collector named S. A. Ramsden undertook enquiries into the fate of the head at the prompting of the Egyptologist and folklorist [[Margaret Murray]]. His enquiries led him to meet with Cave's coachman, Lawrence, who &amp;ndash; after Cave left Crewkerne &amp;ndash; had subsequently served as the coachman for Cave's replacement, a doctor by the name of Webber. Lawrence said that Cave left the head in his house in the village, where it was hung up in a loft and began to fall apart; Lawrence recalled wearing it to frighten people during a parade around 1900, at which time the hair was falling out. He said that the house was later pulled down, with the head probably still inside it, in order for a local post office to be constructed in its place.{{sfn|Oates|Wood|1998|p=41}}

===Usage and origins===
In ''Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries'', May noted that "no recollection of its ever being made use of is retained",{{sfn|May|1891|p=290}} although thought that "it may plausibly be conjectured" that the Ooser was used in "village revels, and at similar times of rustic entertainment".{{sfn|May|1891|p=289}} The following year, a Dorchester-based writer, H. J. Moule, published a note in the same journal relating that their childhood nurse, who was from the village of [[Cerne Abbas]], had talked about the head, and had referred to it as the "Wurser".{{sfn|Moule|1892|p=27}} Moule added that it was "surely" used in Mummers plays performed at [[Christmas traditions#United Kingdom|Christmas]] time.{{sfn|Moule|1892|p=27}}
Dewar, after subsequent research, reported the recollections of K. G. Knight—a member of the Melbury Estate staff—that inhabitants of Melbury Osmond associated the head with a folk custom known as "Skimity Riding" or "Rough Music". In this custom, someone accused of "husband-beating, scolding, sexual unfaithfulness or irregularity, and cuckoldry" were made to ride on a donkey or horse, facing the direction of the animal's tail, while the assembled crowd made much noise by beating frying pans, kettles, bull's horns, and bones. In Melbury Osmond, the Ooser was brought out into the crowd at such an occasion.{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=179}} Similar forms of "mob-punishment" were recorded in parts of neighbouring [[Devon]], where the act was termed "Skimmety Riding", "Skimmington", and "Skivetton".{{sfn|Brown|1952|pp=107&amp;ndash;108}} As he deemed it too heavy to be carried or worn by an individual, the historian of folklore Peter Robson later suggested that the Ooser might originally have been mounted in a carnival procession.{{sfnm|1a1=Robson|1y=1988|1pp=145&amp;ndash;146|2a1=Hutton|2y=1996|2p=88}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="In my childhood [the Ooser] was doing service &amp;ndash; at Christmas mummings, surely it was. Our Cerne Abbas nurse was quite up in all relating to the "Wurser," as I should spell it phonetically. I did not know of the horns, indeed in our embryo Latinity we thought the word an attempt at Ursa, if I remember rightly. What crowds of odd bits I could note if, alas, I did but "remember rightly" all nurse's folk-lore and folk-speeches."|source=— H. J. Moule, Dorchester, 1892.{{sfn|Moule|1892|p=27}} }}

Dewar also recorded the villagers' claims that the Ooser was brought to the door of a [[wikt:tallat|tallet]] in order to scare the local children, and that it was also used to scare adults on some occasions.{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=179}} Knight came across the claim that it was once used to frighten a stable hand, who jumped through a window to escape it, and in doing so "so injured himself that his life was despaired of".{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=179}} Dewar further drew comparisons with the horned masks sometimes worn during Mummers plays. He noted that in a case of a group of Christmas [[Wassailing|Wassailers]] at [[Kingscote, Gloucestershire|Kingscote]], [[Gloucestershire]], a man was "dressed in a sack, his head in a real bull's face, head and horns complete".{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=180}} Another case highlighted by Dewar was taken from an account provided by G. W. Greening of Dorchester, in which a member of the Bradstock Mummers was dressed as [[Beelzebub]].{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=180}} Given these similarities, Dewar ultimately suggested that the Ooser was "likely enough an off-shoot from the 14th century and later Mummers' plays".{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=180}} The antiquary [[Frederick Thomas Elworthy]] expressed the view that the Dorset Ooser was "the probable head" of a [[hobby horse]].{{sfn|Elworthy|1900|p=141}} The folklorist E. C. Cawte, in his in-depth study of the hobby horse tradition in English folk culture, stated that although both entailed dressing up in an animalistic costume, the Ooser had no clear connection with this tradition.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=153}}

Elworthy suggested that the Ooser was a depiction of the [[Devil]],{{sfn|Elworthy|1900|p=139}} an idea supported by Dewar, who believed that, as the Devil, its imagery was "intended to inspire terror in the minds of the foolish and the wicked".{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=178}} Conversely, others have suggested that it is a depiction of a pre-Christian god. In her 1931 book ''The God of the Witches'', Margaret Murray connected the Ooser to her version of the [[witch-cult hypothesis]]—the idea that those persecuted in the [[Witch trials in the early modern period|Early Modern witch trials]] were adherents of a surviving pre-Christian fertility religion—claiming that the mask was a cult item that reflected continuing worship of the cult's [[Horned God]].{{sfnm|1a1=Murray|1y=1952|1pp=43&amp;ndash;44|2a1=Oates|2a2=Wood|2y=1998|2p=19}} Murray's hypothesis is now discredited. The historians [[Jeffrey Burton Russell|Jeffrey B. Russell]] and Brooks Alexander have stated that "today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong [regarding the existence of the witch-cult] &amp;ndash; she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises".{{sfn|Russell|Alexander|2007|p=154}} The Ooser's pre-Christian origin theory was echoed in the ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' encyclopedia of British folklore, ''Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain'', where it was described as "the idol of a former god of fertility".{{sfn|Reader's Digest Association|1973|p=164}} Although not believing that the Ooser was a specific depiction of a surviving pre-Christian deity, Dewar suggested that the imagery of the Devil, and thus of the Ooser, was originally drawn from the pre-Christian gods of "phallic or fertility worship".{{sfn|Dewar|1962|p=179}}

==Contemporary usage and influence==
[[File:The Dorset Ooser - modern version.JPG|thumb|right|Modern replica of the Dorset Ooser in the Dorset County Museum]]
In 1975 the local Morris dancer John Byfleet made a replica of the original Ooser, which he carved from a log using a penknife.{{sfnm|1a1=Anon|1y=2006|2a1=Anon|2y=2009}} This replica is on display at Dorset County Museum in Dorchester.{{sfn|Anon|2006}} It is taken from the museum twice a year, on [[May Day]] and [[St. George's Day]], when it is used by the [[Wessex Morris Men]] as part of their seasonal festivities.{{sfn|Anon|2009}} In 2005, a journalist from ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported on a dawn ceremony performed by the troupe on May Day atop [[Cerne Abbas Giant|Giant Hill]] near Cerne Abbas. The ceremony involved one member carrying the Dorset Ooser replica atop his head, with other Morris men dancing around him; after the rite they proceeded, still dancing, to a local pub, the Red Lion.{{sfn|Lewis|2005}} In summer 2006, the Wessex Morris Men took the replica to Melbury Osmond for the first time, where they performed a dance in a local street.{{sfn|Anon|2006}}

Murray's interpretation of the Ooser was embraced by [[Doreen Valiente]], an earlier practitioner of the [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion of [[Wicca]], who stated that the mask "is certainly connected with the Old Religion [i.e. the witch-cult], and that from a long way back".{{sfn|Valiente|1984|p=95}} The [[Gardnerian Wicca]]n Melissa Seims suggested that the iconography of the Ooser was an influence on the design of the Head of Atho, a statue of the Wiccan Horned God created by [[Raymond Howard (Wiccan)|Raymond Howard]] in mid-20th century England.{{sfn|Seims|2008}} Wiccans in the [[Minnesota]] area of the United States make use of a head with stag antlers that they term the Minnesota Ooser. Representing the religion's Horned God, it is kept on an altar and brought out for use in [[Wheel of the Year|Sabbat]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Blackwell|1y=2012|1pp=30&amp;ndash;31|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2015|2p=369}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2284">'''Early American Imprints''' is a digital and microopaque card (not the more common [[microfiche]]) collection produced by [[Readex]].  It is based on [[Charles Evans (librarian)|Charles Evan]]'s ''[[Charles Evans (librarian)#American Bibliography|American Bibliography]]'' and on Shaw-Shoemaker's ''American Bibliography'' and contains the full text of all known existing books, pamphlets, and broadsides printed in the United States (or British American colonies prior to Independence) from 1639 through 1819, some 72,000 titles.   It is now also available in electronic form as part of the [[Readex]] [http://www.readex.com/readex/?content=93 Archive of Americana].

==History==

The [[microprint]] edition was undertaken by the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1955 and edited by Dr. Clifford K. Shipton, then director of the Society. The extensive collection of early American imprints in the Society's library provided a substantial number of the imprints that were filmed. Many other major libraries in the United States and Europe also made texts available and provided editorial corrections to the original bibliographic work of [[Charles Evans (librarian)|Charles Evans]].  The series is available in two parts:

*Early American Imprints: Series I Evans, 1639–1800, 
*Early American Imprints: Series II Shaw-Shoemaker, 1801–1819

'''Fieldnotes''' refer to [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] notes recorded by [[scientist]]s or researchers in the course of [[field research]], during or after their [[observation]] of a specific [[phenomenon]] they are studying. The notes are intended to be read as evidence that gives meaning and aids in the understanding of the phenomenon. Fieldnotes allow the researcher to access the subject and record what they observe in an unobtrusive manner.

One major disadvantage of taking fieldnotes is that they are recorded by an observer and are thus subject to (a) memory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field Notes on Science &amp; Nature|last=Canfield|first=Michael|publisher=Harvard University Pres|year=2011|isbn=9780674057579|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (b) possibly, the conscious or unconscious [[Confirmation bias|bias]] of the observer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} It is best to record fieldnotes immediately after leaving the site to avoid forgetting important details.

Fieldnotes are particularly valued in descriptive sciences such as [[ethnography]], [[biology]], [[geology]], and [[archaeology]], each of which have long traditions in this area.

== Structure ==
There are two components of fieldnotes: descriptive information and reflective information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/fieldnotes|title=Research Guides: Organizing Your Social Sciences Research Paper: Writing Field Notes|last=Labaree|first=Robert V.|website=libguides.usc.edu|language=en|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptive information is factual data that is being recorded. Factual data includes time and date, the state of the physical setting, social environment, descriptions of the subjects being studied and their roles in the setting, and the impact that the observer may have had on the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Reflective information is the observer's reflections about the observation being conducted. These reflections are ideas, questions, concerns, and other related thoughts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fieldnotes can also include sketches, diagrams, and other drawings. Visually capturing a phenomenon requires the observer to pay more attention to every detail as to not overlook anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field Notes on Science &amp; Nature|last=Canfield|first=Michael|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780674057579|location=|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombia Global Reports, New York. {{ISBN|9780990976363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henley &amp; Partners has analysed the visa regulations of all the countries and territories in the world since 2006.&lt;ref name="henleyglobal.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Henley &amp; Partners Visa Restrictions Index 2016|url=https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/HP/hvri/HP%20Visa%20Restrictions%20Index%20160223.pdf|website=henleyglobal.com|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=2 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312121441/https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/HP/hvri/HP%20Visa%20Restrictions%20Index%20160223.pdf|archive-date=12 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of the Index==
The HPI consists of a ranking of passports according to how many other territories can be reached 'visa-free' (defined below). All distinct destination countries and territories in the IATA database are considered. However, since not all territories issue passports, there are far fewer passports to be ranked than destinations against which queries are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalin|first1=Christian H.|title=Global Residence and Citizenship Handbook|publisher=Ideos Publications|isbn=978-3-9524052-7-7|pages=147–148|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
To determine the score for each country or territory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalin|first1=Christian H.|title=Global Residence and Citizenship Handbook|publisher=Ideos Publications|isbn=978-3-9524052-7-7|pages=148–149|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the IATA database is queried in the following way:

1. Each of the 199 passports for which the score is to be determined, is checked against every one of the 227 possible travel destinations for which travel restriction information exists in the IATA database. These interrogations continue throughout the year so scores will continuously change.

2. Each query is made with the following conditions:
* passports are issued in the country of nationality
* passport holders are an adult citizen of the country which issued the passport and a lone traveller rather than in a tourist group
* entry is sought for tourism or business
* the stay is at least three days

3. Further conditions include:
* queries are made only for holders of normal passports rather than diplomatic, service, emergency, or temporary passports and other travel documents are disregarded
* passport holders do not meet any complex requirements for entry (for example, possessing a government-issued letter, translations or empty pages)
* passport holders have all necessary vaccinations and certificates;
* passport holders are arriving at and departing from the same airport
* passport holders are seeking a short stay rather than a transit
* the port of entry is a major city or capital, in cases where this is required
* requirements by the destination country or territory regarding a particular length of validity of passports are disregarded
* passport holders meet all basic requirements for entry (for example, holding a hotel reservation or having proof of sufficient funds or return tickets)
* advance passenger information and advance approval to board are not considered to be a visa requirement or travel restriction, neither is the requirement to pay airport tax

It is assumed that the visa policies of Greenland and the Faroe Islands are identical to Denmark.

4. If no visa is required for passport holders from a particular country or territory to enter the destination, then that passport scores 1. [The passport also scores 1 if a visa on arrival, a visitor's permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) can be obtained because they do not require pre-departure government approval, perhaps because of specific visa-waiver programs in place.]

5. Where visas are needed, or where passport holders have to get government-approved electronic visas (e-Visas) before departure, a score of 0 is given. If passport holders must get government approval before leaving in order to obtain a visa on arrival, this also scores 0.

6. The total score for a particular passport is then assigned according to the conditions defined above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Henley Passport Index 2006 to 2018 |url=https://www.henleypassportindex.com/methodology |website=Henley &amp; Partners Passport Index |publisher=Henley &amp; Partners Holdings Ltd |accessdate=7 July 2018 |date= |quote=The index and its contents are based on data provided by the International Air Transport Authority (IATA) and supplemented, enhanced, and updated using extensive in-house research and open-source online data. The index includes 199 different passports and 227 different travel destinations. Updated in real-time throughout the year, as and when visa-policy changes come into effect...On a fixed date each year, Henley &amp; Partners receives exclusive data from the International Air Transport Authority (IATA), which forms the basis of the Henley Passport Index. In order to maintain the accuracy of the data provided by IATA in the face of constant updates to visa policy, and in order to create detailed visa lists for all 199 passports in our database, the Henley &amp; Partners research team uses publicly available and reliable online sources to cross-check each passport against all 227 possible travel destinations. This research process is ongoing throughout the year. It is coupled with a rigorous monitoring system to pick up relevant visa-policy shifts. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709232312/https://www.henleypassportindex.com/methodology |archive-date=9 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offering its citizens visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to a record total of 189 destinations, {{As of|2018|05|22|lc=y}} Japan takes the top spot in the Henley Passport Index.

'''''How to Eat''''' is a 1998 book of [[English cuisine]] by the celebrity cook [[Nigella Lawson]].&lt;ref name="sweetandsour"&gt;Jones, Chris. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1336420.stm Nigella Lawson: A sweet and sour life]. [[BBC News]], 18 May 2001; retrieved 29 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It features culinary tips on preparation and saving time,&lt;ref name="itgirl"&gt;Dolce, Joe [http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2001/04/englandsitgirl England's It Girl], ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'', 2001; retrieved 31 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and sold 300,000 copies in Britain.&lt;ref name="hot"&gt;Hirschberg, Lynn. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02EEDA1338F93BA25752C1A9679C8B63 Hot Dish]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 November 2001; retrieved 29 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was praised by critics as a valuable guide to cooking.

==Book==

===Approach===

The book begins with Lawson's preface, which states plainly "I am not a chef", and that she is not interested in "strenuous originality".&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, page ix&lt;/ref&gt; She states that her goal, rather, is "to make you feel that I'm there with you".&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, page x&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided into themed chapters, such as cooking for "One or Two". Most of each chapter consists of recipes, but the chapters begin with a few pages of general advice on the theme, such as that while cooking for one may feel "[[onanism|onanistic]]", "it might be a good thing to consider yourself worth cooking for."&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, page 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Each recipe is headed with its name, generally in English, though with foreign words as needed, as "Pea Soufflé". A recipe like "Scallops and Bacon" then begins with a paragraph of advice on its suitability, in this case stressing that the dish strikes

{{quote|just the right balance between nursery comfort and dining-room elegance and takes hardly any time to cook&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;}}

followed by a paragraph about marketing, how to buy and store the ingredients.

The ingredients and quantities are tabulated in red boldface type. The recipe itself is given as a paragraph of instructions in light type.

The techniques used are not rigidly traditional: in her recipe for [[Ratatouille]], introduced to Britain by [[Elizabeth David]], Lawson admits that she is departing from David's prescriptions, but states that this does not seem to make much difference as she does not get a "soggy mush" by skipping the hour spent salting the [[aubergine]] and [[courgette]]s, but she explains the David method in an aside, just in case anyone want to try it.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, pages 115–117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

In her chapter ''Consuming Nigella'' in ''Feminism, Domesticity and Popular Culture'', Lise Shapiro Sanders observes that Lawson's early books including ''How to Eat'' and ''How to Be a Domestic Goddess'' (2001) "emphasize cooking and eating as sites of pleasure for women." Sanders explains that the pleasure is both "authentic" and "ironic, self-consciously reworking a mid-twentieth-century ideology of domestic femininity." In particular, baking gives Lawson "access to a fantasy of femininity that, instead of dooming women to lives of 'domestic drudgery', enables the performance of a 'weekend alter ego winning adoring glances and endless approbation from anyone who has the good fortune to eat in her kitchen'". Sanders notes Lawson's disclaimer in her preface that "I have nothing to declare but my greed (page xv)". She interprets Lawson as meaning to remind readers of "the joys of giving in to temptation". She notes from a passage by [[Simon Hoggart]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'' (about ''Nigella Bites'') that Lawson "becomes an object of desire, ready-made for the consumption of the heterosexual male audience", complete with [[double entendre]]s and sexually suggestive language, both of which Sanders calls trademarks of Lawson's style.&lt;ref name="GillisHollows2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sanders, Lise Shapiro |editor1=Stacy Gillis |editor2=Joanne Hollows |title=Consuming Nigella |work=Feminism, Domesticity and Popular Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbmSAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162 |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-89427-6 |pages=151–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' called the book "the most valuable culinary guide published this decade."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4716000/Take-one-leek-.-.-..html "Take one leek..."], telegraph.co.uk, 19 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Buchsbaum, writing in the ''January Magazine'', calls ''How to Eat'' "almost biblical, with countless recipes for just about anything one could name. It was all black ink on white pages, hardly the luxuriously art-directed volumes that would follow: How To Be a Domestic Goddess, Nigella Bites, Forever Summer..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchsbaum|first1=Tony|title=Confessions of a Food-Porn Addict|url=http://www.januarymagazine.com/cookbook/feast.html|publisher=January Magazine|accessdate=20 February 2016|date=November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I Love Bacon!''''' is a [[cookbook]] with over fifty recipes devoted to [[bacon]] and bacon dishes, many of them from [[celebrity chef]]s. The book was written by Jayne Rockmill and photography was provided by Ben Fink. Broken down into eight sections, the book covered how to make homemade bacon and moves onto "[[brunch]]" and "small bites" before covering soups, salads and sides, pasta, fish, meat, and desserts. ''I Love Bacon!'' was published in October 2010 by [[Andrews McMeel Publishing]] and met with favorable reviews for its unique dishes and helpful culinary tips for novices.

The remaining seven sections (''Brunch''; ''Small Bites''; ''Soups, Salads and Sides'', ''Pasta'', ''Fish'', '' Meat'' and ''Desserts'') contain recipes for dishes using bacon as one of the main ingredients.

The ''Brunch'' section begins with a recipe from [[Seattle]]-based Black Rock Spirits for "Bakon Bloody Mary", a variant on the traditional [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] [[cocktail]] using [[bacon vodka|bacon infused vodka]] with the glass rim dipped in lime juice and finely crumbled grilled bacon. Although the majority of recipes in this section feature bacon with its traditional brunch partner, eggs, there is also a recipe for "Mediterranean BLTs". This version of the classic [[BLT (sandwich)|BLT sandwich]] pairs the bacon, lettuce and tomato with toasted [[focaccia]] bread and red-pepper [[aioli]] in place of mayonnaise. Another version of the BLT using toasted [[brioche]] and [[sun-dried tomato]]es cut into mini-sandwiches appears in the ''Small Bites'' section which is devoted to bacon-based [[hors d'oeuvres]].

Among the recipes in ''Soups, Salads and Sides'' are "Egg [[Chowder]] with Bacon and New Potatoes", "Grilled Bacon and Cucumber Salad with Chili Caramel Dressing", and "Spicy Braised Bacon with Spagna Beans and [[Radicchio|Treviso Radicchio]]" which uses thickly sliced [[pork belly]] bacon.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Spagna beans are a variety of white bean commonly used in Italian cooking where they are known as {{lang|it|fagioli bianchi di Spagna}}.}} The ''Pasta'' section has a recipe for "Bacon Mac and Cheese" from Julie Taras Wallach, the chef and co-owner of the Tipsy Parson and Little Giant restaurants in New York City. Her variant on the traditional [[macaroni and cheese]] uses [[cavatelli]] pasta seasoned with [[dijon mustard]], thyme, rosemary, garlic, and nutmeg and incorporates sauteed onion and pieces of grilled bacon.&lt;ref name= "Johnson" /&gt; One of the recipes in the ''Meat'' section, "Veal and [[Foie Gras]] Meatloaf Wrapped in Bacon", comes from Mark Allen, who in 1997 became the youngest chef, and the first American, to have headed The Dining Room at the [[Ritz-Carlton]] in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Rockmill, Jayne. ''I Love Bacon!''. Andrews McMeel. 1999. pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; Allen also contributed a recipe for the ''Fish'' section, "Whole Roasted [[Branzino]] with Carrots and Bacon". Other dishes in that section include "[[Pancetta]]-Wrapped [[Monkfish]] with Cauliflower [[Flan]]" and "[[Bluefish]] with Corn, Avocado, and Bacon Salad".

Like its somewhat lengthier predecessors, Sara Perry's ''[[Everything Tastes Better with Bacon]]'' (2002), [[Joanna Pruess|Pruess]] and [[Bob Lape|Lape]]'s ''[[Seduced by Bacon]]'' (2006), and James Villas's ''[[The Bacon Cookbook]]'' (2007), Rockmill's ''I Love Bacon!'' includes sweet dishes using bacon. Among the recipes in the ''Desserts'' section are "Bacon [[Panna Cotta]] with [[Huckleberries]]", "Cane Sugar and Bacon-Iced Cupcakes", and Cat Cora's "Pig Candy Ice Cream". Cora's recipe uses a pound (.454 kilograms) of chopped applewood-[[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]] bacon per [[quart]] (.946 litres) of [[brown sugar]]-sweetened vanilla ice cream.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Kerry J.

==Reception==
Carol Johnson writing in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' described ''I Love Bacon!'' as both a cookbook with "inventive" recipes and "a mini-course in some of the country's top restaurants." Johnson noted that not all recipes were for beginners, but found the accompanying notes for many of the recipes with information about techniques and ingredients to be helpful. She described Ben Fink's photography as "vivid and mouth-watering, if a little spare."&lt;ref name= "Johnson" /&gt; The Republic of Bacon website favorably reviewed the cookbook for its ability to go beyond the standard classic cured bacon dishes and the added biographies of the leading industry chefs which contributed recipes to the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.republicofbacon.com/2010/11/07/i-love-bacon-by-jayne-rockmill-review-bacon-literature/ | title=I Love Bacon by Jayne Rockmill Review – Bacon Literature | publisher=Republic of Bacon | date=7 November 2010 | accessdate=11 November 2014 | author=Bacon, Andrew Back}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide''' ('''JCAG''') ({{lang-hy|Հայկական Ցեղասպանութեան Արդարութեան Մարտիկներ, ՀՑԱՄ}}) was an [[Armenian People|Armenian]] [[militant organization]] active from 1975 to 1987. They are widely considered a terrorist organization.

JCAG conducted an international campaign of attacks against Turkish representatives and interests, primarily in [[Europe]] and [[North America]], killing numerous [[attaché]]s of the [[Turkish government]]. It has been described as a [[terrorist organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Göçek |first1=Fatma Müge |title=The Transformation of Turkey: Redefining State and the Society from the Ottoman Empire to the Modern Era |date=2011 |publisher=I.B. Tauris |page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; JCAG's stated reason for these attacks was the establishment of an independent [[Armenia]] in historical Armenian areas, and the recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]] by [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Starving Armenians: America and the Armenian Genocide, 1915-1930 and After - Page 166 by Merrill D. Peterson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RIwBFpBi5noC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%C4%B0smail+Erez+JCAG&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mN6kTLKPM9Ol4QaAjqTvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%C4%B0smail%20Erez%20JCAG&amp;f=false Barry Rubin, Barry M. Rubin, Judith Colp Rubin, ''"Chronologies of modern terrorism''], M.E. Sharpe, 2008, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1983, JCAG is generally thought to have transformed into the [[Armenian Revolutionary Army]] (ARA) as either a renaming or continuation, with [[communique]]s and military activities claimed under that name until 1985.&lt;ref name=miptara&gt;[http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=264 MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050327013852/http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=264 |date=March 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization committed a single attack in 1986 under the name Greek-Bulgarian-Armenian Front, and is believed to have unofficially dissolved the following year.

== Affiliation with Armenian Revolutionary Federation ==
Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG) and the following Armenian Revolutionary Army (ARA) are generally thought to be the military branch of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (ARF), a [[left-wing]] [[Armenian nationalist]] and Pan-Armenian political party established in the 19th century, which at the time of sought the independence of [[Armenia]] from the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis P. Hyland, ''Armenian Terrorism: the Past, the Present, the Prospects'', Boulder-San Francisco-Oxford: Westview Press, 1991, pp. 61-62; Yves Ternon, ''La Cause arménienne'', Paris: Le Seuil, 1983, p. 218; ''The Armenian Reporter'', January 19, 1984, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The ARF was instrumental in the creation of the [[First Republic of Armenia]] in 1918, which existed for two years until it was annexed by the Soviet Union, the successor state of the [[Russian Empire]] which had previously ruled eastern Armenia. After the Soviets came to power, the ARF leadership was exiled, where the organization maintained its existence internationally through the [[Armenian diaspora]].

The existence of JCAG was discovered in May 1976, when a member was killed by his own bomb in the headquarters of ARF in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Yves Ternon, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; It was confirmed when French political scientist Gaïdz Minassian was allowed to consult the archives of ARF for his doctoral thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gaïdz Minassian, ''Guerre et terrorisme arméniens'', Paris, Presses universitaires de France, 2002, pp. 32-34 and 106-109.&lt;/ref&gt; In several occasions, the official newspapers of ARF in the [[United States]], [[France]] and [[Lebanon]] justified the "armed struggle" and published official [[communiqués]] of JCAG.&lt;ref&gt;''Asbarez'', April 24, May 1st and 22, 1973;  ''Haïastan'', July 1981 and special issue on Sassounian affair, February 1984; ''The Armenian Weekly'', August 21, September 17, December 10 and 24, 1983, January 14 and 28, 1984 and December 31, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Haïastan'', February and April–May, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The party had used [[terrorism]] many times, both against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Armenians opposed to the ARF, the most famous being Bedros Kapamciyan, mayor of [[Van, Turkey|Van]], assassinated in December 1912, and [[archbishop]] [[Leon Tourian]], assassinated in [[New York City]] on December 24, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Türkkaya Ataöv, "Procurement of Arms for Armenian Terrorists: Realities Based on Ottoman Documents", Heath W.

The legal branches of the ARF fundraised to pay the lawyer costs of arrested JCAG members, the most famous case being [[Harry Sassounian]], who was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for the assassination of the Turkish general consul in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Gunter, ''"Pursuing the Just Cause of their People". A Study of Contemporary Armenian Terrorism'', Westport-New York-London, Greenwood Press, 1986, pp. 70 and 74; [http://asbarez.com/46446/more-than-70-000-raised-for-hampig-sassounian-defense-effort/ "More Than $70 000 Raised for Hampig Sassounian Defense Effort"], ''Asbarez'', 25 février 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dashnak newspaper ''Asbarez'' (October 15, 1983), several dozens of thousands of Armenians (ARF sympathisers and militants) participated to the Sassounian solidarity groups. French ARF organized a demonstration in front of US consulate in [[Lyon]], in protestation against Sassounian's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;« Soutien à Sassounian (Lyon) », ''Haïastan'' ([[Paris]]), juin 1982, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The ARF also supported Harutyun Krikor Levonian and Alexander Elbekyan, who were sentenced to twenty years imprisonment for the [[assassination of Galip Balkar]], Turkish ambassador to [[Yugoslavia]], in [[Belgrade]], and Max Hraïr Kilndjian, sentenced to two years imprisonment as an accessory in the [[attempted murder]] of the Turkish ambassador to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Yves Ternon, pp. 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, an attempt to bomb the building of Turkish consulate in [[Philadelphia]] was stopped by the [[FBI]]. The leader of the group and now the main leader of ARF in the United States, Vicken Hovsepian, was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment, a sentence confirmed in appeal.&lt;ref&gt;"Court Finds Four Armenian Youth Guifly of '82 Attempt on Consulate", ''The Armenian Reporter'', October 18, 1984; [http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/841/841.F2d.959.85-5037-5039.html Verdict of appeal court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310145241/http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/841/841.F2d.959.85-5037-5039.html |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2001, another leader of the American ARF, [[Mourad Topalian]], was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment for illegal storing of weapons and [[explosives]] for JCAG.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a1c_5APvto Armenian Terrorists at Work in USA], NBC, 2005 ; {{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/010205/archive_005996.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201233420/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/010205/archive_005996.htm |archivedate=2011-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; JCAG's activities were concentrated in [[Europe]]an and [[North America]]n countries, targeting [[Turkey|Turkish]] interests, mainly the assassination of Turkish [[diplomats]].&lt;ref&gt;Geopolitical and -Economic Changes in the Balkan Countries - Page 75
by Nicholas V. Gianaris&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the JCAG took the name of "[[Armenian Revolutionary Army]] (ARA)", and like before, ARF-affiliated press published ARA communiqués as well as articles supporting its aims.&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Gunter, pp. 56-61; Francis P. Hyland, p. 62; Gaïdz Minassian, p. 92; [http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?perpetrator=3292 Global Terrorism Database].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Armenian Weekly'', July 14, October 12 and November 19, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aram Khaligian, "The Necessities of Violence and National Culture in the Liberation Struggle," ''The Armenian Weekly'', 31 December 1986, p. 15; ''Haïastan'', April and December 1985, December 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year the ARF organizes international ceremonies in honor of the five ARA members who attacked the Turkish embassy in [[Portugal]], especially in [[Glendale (California)|Glendale]], [[Los Angeles]], in [[New Jersey]], [[Beirut]], [[Paris]] and [[Décines-Charpieu]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaïdz Minassian, op. cit., p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Armenian Weekly'', February 6, 1984, pp. 6-7 ; [http://asbarez.com/50530/lisbon-5-commemoration-and-ceremony-for-the-repose-of-souls-held-in-lebanon/ "Lisbon 5 Commemoration and Ceremony for the Repose of Souls Held in Lebanon"], ''Asbarez'', July 27, 2004 ; [http://asbarez.com/57885/sacrifice-of-lisbon-5-remembered-at-glendales-saint-mary-church/ "Sacrifice of Lisbon 5 Remembered at Glendale’s Saint Mary Church"], ''Asbarez'', July 27, 2008 ; [http://asbarez.com/57935/community-remembers-sacrifice-of-lisbon-5/ "Community Remembers Sacrifice of Lisbon 5"], ''Asbarez'', August 1st, 2008 ; http://www.fra-france.com/index.php?page=article&amp;id=55 ; http://www.fra-france.com/index.php?page=article&amp;id=36 ; {{cite web |url=http://www.france-armenie.fr/agenda/agenda07b-2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720220258/http://www.france-armenie.fr/agenda/agenda07b-2008.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three ARA perpetrators of [[1985 Turkish embassy attack in Ottawa|attack against Turkish embassy in Ottawa]] were sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 25 years, ARF attacked the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''Haïastan'', December 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the name of "Greek-Bulgarian-Armenian Front", the JCAG perpetrated two attacks in [[Australia]]: the [[Melbourne Turkish consulate bombing|bombing of Melbourne's Turkish consulate]], for which ARF member Levon Demirian was sentenced and served 10 years in prison, and the bombing of a mail sorting facility in [[Brisbane]], on January 19, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.vic.gov.au/retrievemedia.asp?Media_ID=13483 ''Police Life Magazine''], December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/IncidentSummary.aspx?gtdid=198611230005|title=Incident Summary for GTDID: 198611230005|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flying pieces of metal and glass as well as flames from the blast injured five Americans. The explosion destroyed a vehicle parked across the street, and causes significant damage to the 11-story Turkish Center, and blows out the windows of nearby buildings, including [[B'nai B'rith]], [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], the African American Center, a travel agency and numerous apartment complexes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10382">This is a list of the British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]], and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] general election manifestos since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900 general election]].

From 1900 to 1918, the Liberal general election manifesto was usually published as a form of a short personal address by the [[Leader of the Liberal Party (UK)|leader of the Party]].  From 1922 the party usually published a more formal document.

From the 1900 election to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 election]] the party went to the polls as the Liberal Party. In 1983 and 1987, the party went to the polls under the banner of the "Alliance", as a result of the pact between the Liberals and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], which formed in 1981. Since 1992 it has polled as the Liberal Democrats, due to the merger of the Liberals and the SDP in 1988.

From 2010 to 2015, the Liberal Democrats, having signed [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|an agreement]] with the Conservatives, served as junior partner in the first [[coalition government]] since the Second World War.

The definition and the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. These ancient documents adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures since the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came into effect on June&amp;nbsp;9, 1951. The items are selected by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]], a special body of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]], based on their "especially high historical or artistic value".&lt;ref name="bunkapamphlet"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt; "Ancient documents" is one of thirteen categories of National Treasures recognized by the agency. The list presents 62 documents or sets of documents from classical to early modern Japan, from the [[Asuka period]] to the [[Meiji period]]. The actual number of items is more than 62 because groups of related objects have been combined into single entries. The list contains items of various type such as letters, diaries, records or catalogues, certificates, imperial decrees, testaments and maps. The documents record early Japanese government and Buddhism including early Japanese contact with China, the organization of the state and life at the Japanese imperial court. They are housed in 14 Japanese cities in [[Buddhist temple|temples]] (35), museums (13), libraries or archives (6), [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] (4), universities (2) and in private collections (2). Most entries (28) in the list are located in [[Kyoto]]. The documents in this list were made predominantly with a writing brush on paper and, in many cases, present important examples of [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref name="bunkacho"&gt;{{cite web

Writing was physically introduced to Japan from China in the form of inscribed artefacts at the beginning of the Christian era. Examples, some of which have been designated as [[List of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials)|archaeological National Treasures]], include coins of the reign of [[Wang Mang]] (AD 8–25), a 1st-century gold seal from Shikanoshima, a late 2nd century iron [[Tōdaijiyama Sword|sword from the Tōdaijiyama burial mound]], the [[Seven-Branched Sword]] with inscription from 369 and a large number of bronze mirrors—the oldest dating to the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="seeley-p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these artefacts originated on the continent, most likely in China. However, the written inscriptions on them may not have been recognized as writing but instead may have been mistaken for decorations by the Japanese.&lt;ref name="seeley-p9"/&gt; When the Japanese later manufactured locally copies of original Chinese mirrors, they may have continued to believe the written inscriptions to be merely decorative.&lt;ref name="seeley-p12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of [[Baekje]] in the form of classical Chinese books likely written on paper and in the form of manuscript rolls (''kansubon'').&lt;ref name="seeley-p9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"/&gt; This probably happened at the beginning of the 5th century (around 400), and certainly during the 6th century.&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keally-historic"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend the scholar [[Wani (scholar)|Wani]] introduced the Chinese writing system as well as [[Confucianism]] to Japan.&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"/&gt; The oldest texts of Japanese origin, which show a clear understanding of the concept of writing, date to the 5th century and are—like most texts from before 700—inscriptions on stone or metal.&lt;ref name="seeley-p16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples include three archaeological National Treasures: [[Suda Hachiman Shrine Mirror]] from about the 5th century, which is a poor copy of a Chinese original, the [[Inariyama Sword]] from 471 or 531 and the Eta Funayama burial mound sword from about the 5th century.&lt;ref name="seeley-p17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abrupt transition from an unfamiliarity with writing to reading and writing complicated works in a foreign language required the earliest Japanese texts be composed and read by people from the continent such as Wani.&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"/&gt; The Inariyama Sword is also the oldest example of [[man'yōgana]] use, a [[writing system]] that employs [[Chinese character]]s to represent the [[Japanese language]].&lt;ref name="seeley-p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the introduction of writing, scribes were appointed to the provinces to "record events and report conditions".&lt;ref name="seeley-p8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sakamoto-p3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sakamoto|1991|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing in Japan was limited during the 5th and 6th centuries, the number of documents written locally increased in the 7th century; though most of them have been lost.&lt;ref name="keally-historic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 7th century increased cultural dependence on China caused reading and writing, particularly in government and religion, to become an integral part of Japanese life.&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"/&gt; There were two major factors for this development: starting with the [[Taika Reforms]] (645–649) and continuing with the [[Asuka Kiyomihara Code]] (689) and censuses from 670 and 690, a Chinese style centralised state was formed, requiring the need for a large number of officials who were literate and educated in, among others, Confucian texts at the ''Daigakuryo'' ("University") founded under [[Emperor Tenchi]].&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"/&gt; The second factor was the increasing popularity of Buddhism, which had been introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century and strongly promoted by [[Prince Shōtoku]] (574–622).&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"/&gt; The [[Sangyō Gisho]] ("Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras"), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length.&lt;ref name="seeley-p41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism required the study of sutras written in Chinese and the state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (''shakyōjo'') before 727.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Probably much before this date.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"/&gt; The oldest Japanese books are two chronicles, [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]], from the early 8th century. While the [[man'yōgana|phonogram orthography]] enjoyed increasing popularity during the 8th century, it was not yet used for longer prose. The modern [[kana]], notably [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] were developed in the [[Heian period]].&lt;ref name="seeley-p55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''lost 116 pages'''" were the original manuscript pages of what [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], said was the translation of the Book of Lehi,&lt;ref&gt;Along with the Book of Lehi, [[Royal Skousen]], editor of The Book of Mormon Critical Text Project, says that in the [[Book of Mormon#Manuscripts|printer's manuscript]] of the [[Book of Mosiah]], the first chapter is listed as Chapter 3. Skousen proposes that all or part of the first two chapters were lost with the 116 pages.  Skousen notes that every other book in the [[Book of Mormon]] is named for its primary author; but the Book of Mosiah begins with [[King Benjamin]] and is not named for him.  Also, Mosiah does not begin with an introduction of the author or an explanatory introduction as is typical with other Book of Mormon books but "begins in the middle of things." Skousen speculates that the original first chapter related Mosiah's flight from the [[land of Nephi]] to [[Zarahemla]] and that the second chapter discussed King Benjamin's early reign and wars.{{Harvnb|De Groote|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the first portion of the [[golden plates]] revealed to him by an angel in 1827. These pages, which had not been copied, were lost by Smith's scribe, [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], during the summer of 1828 and are presumed to have been destroyed. Smith completed the Book of Mormon without retranslating the Book of Lehi, replacing it with what he said was an abridgment taken from the Plates of Nephi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/1/17 1 Nephi 1:17].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Joseph Smith said that on September 22, 1827, he had recovered a set of buried [[golden plates]] in [[Cumorah|a prominent hill]] near his parents' farm in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]]. Martin Harris, a respectable but superstitious&lt;ref&gt;A biographer of Harris wrote that his "imagination was excitable and fecund." Harris once imagined that a sputtering candle was the work of the devil. He told a friend that he had met Jesus in the shape of a deer and walked and talked with him for two or three miles. (John A. Clark letter, August 31, 1840 in ''Early Mormon Documents'', 2: 271.) The local Presbyterian minister called him "a visionary fanatic." ([[Ronald W. Walker]], "Martin Harris: Mormonism's Early Convert," ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' 19 (Winter 1986):34–35.) A friend, who praised Harris as  "universally esteemed as an honest man," also declared that Harris's mind "was overbalanced by 'marvellousness'" and that his belief in earthly visitations of angels and ghosts gave him the local reputation of being crazy. ([[Pomeroy Tucker]] reminiscence, 1858 in ''Early Mormon Documents'' 3: 71.) Another friend said, "Martin was a man that would do just as he agreed with you. But, he was a great man for seeing spooks." (Lorenzo Saunders Interview, November 12, 1884, ''Early Mormon Documents'' 2: 149); {{Harvnb|Turner|1851|p=215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; farmer from nearby [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]], became an early believer and gave Smith $50 to finance the translation of the plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tiffany|1859|pp=168&amp;ndash;169}}; {{Harvnb|Howe|1834|p=26
0}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=113}}; {{Harvnb|Roberts|1902|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucy Harris]], Martin's wife, also donated some of her own money and offered to give more, even though Smith denied her request to see the plates and told her that "in relation to assistance, I always prefer dealing with men rather than their wives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|pp=110–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (citation and bibliography are in conflict)

Smith and his wife, [[Emma Hale Smith|Emma]], moved to her hometown of [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Harmony, Pennsylvania]], in late October 1827, where he began transcribing the writing on the plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tiffany|1859|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Harris left Palmyra to visit Smith without taking his wife along, she became suspicious that Smith intended to defraud her and her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Harris returned, Lucy refused to share his bed, and she had a suitor of her daughter surreptitiously copy the characters on the [[Anthon transcript]] that Smith had given to Harris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=114}};{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy then accompanied her husband back to Harmony in April 1828, when Martin agreed to serve as Smith's scribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning home after two weeks, Lucy searched the Smith house and grounds for the plates but was unable to locate them. Smith said he did not need their physical presence to create the transcription&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stevenson|1882}}; {{Harvnb|Jessee|1976|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Could we get quotes from this and the next note? I'm curious if this was the case at this specific time (and whether the evidence that Smith didn't need the plates handy is compelling)--&gt; and that they were hidden in a nearby woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1853|pp=115&amp;ndash;116}};  {{Harvnb|Howe|1834|pp=264&amp;ndash;65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harris as Smith's scribe==

From April to June 1828, Harris acted as Smith's scribe as Smith dictated the manuscript using the [[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]] and [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stones]].&lt;ref&gt;During this early period of translation, Harris said that Smith used a seer stone Smith had located in a well years earlier, or to a lesser extent, a pair of "spectacles" made of two seer stones that Smith called the ''Urim and Thummim'', although Smith preferred the former out of convenience. {{Harv|Stevenson|1882|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of June, Smith had dictated about 116 manuscript pages of text.&lt;ref&gt;Smith later called this book the "Book of Lehi", and he was the first to say that the number of missing pages was 116. {{Harv|Roberts|1902|p=20}};{{Harv|Smith|1853|loc=sec. 36, v. 41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris continued to have doubts about the authenticity of the manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard L. Bushman]], ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 66: "Yet uncertainty still beset Harris."&lt;/ref&gt; and he "could not forget his wife's skepticism or the hostile queries of Palmyra's tavern crowd." Smith's mother, [[Lucy Mack Smith|Lucy]], "said that Harris asked Joseph for a look at the plates, for 'a further witness of their actual existence and that he might be better able to give a reason for the hope that was within him.' When that request was denied, he asked about the manuscript. Could he at least take it home to reassure his wife?"&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; After denying his request twice, Smith, with a great deal of uneasiness, said that the Lord had given permission, and he allowed Harris to take the manuscript pages back to Palmyra on condition that he show them to only five named family members. He even made Harris bind himself in a solemn oath.&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 66; {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=117}}; {{Harv|Roberts|1902|p=20}}; {{Harv|Smith|1853|pp=117&amp;ndash;118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The manuscript disappears==

[[Image:Martinharrisat87.jpg|thumb|left|Martin Harris at age 87, more than forty years after he lost the manuscript.]]
When Harris returned home, he showed the manuscript to his wife, who allowed him to lock them in her bureau. Harris then showed the pages not only to the named relatives but "to any friend who came along."&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion Harris picked the lock of the bureau and damaged it, irritating his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 67. Lucy Harris was described by [[Lucy Mack Smith]] as a woman of "irascible temper," but Harris may also have abused her. Lucy Harris also suggested that her husband may have committed adultery with a neighboring "Mrs. Haggart." {{Harv|Smith|1853|loc=1:367}} "Lucy Harris statement," in ''EMD'', 2: 34-36: "In one of his fits of rage he struck me with the butt end of a whip, which I think had been used for driving oxen, and was about the size of my thumb, and three or four feet long. He beat me on the head four or five times, and the next day turned me out of doors twice, and beat me in a shameful manner....Whether the Mormon religion be true or false, I leave the world to judge, for its effects upon Martin Harris have been to make him more cross, turbulent and abusive to me." In March 1830, a revelation from Smith warned Harris not to "covet thy neighbor's wife." ''D&amp;C'' 19: 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript then disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Pomeroy Tucker]] (1802-1870), who was an acquaintance of the Harris family, Lucy Harris took the manuscript while Harris was asleep and burned it, keeping that fact a secret until after publication of the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''. "A feud was thus produced between husband and wife, which was never reconciled." {{Harv|Tucker|1867|pp=46}}; also at ''EMD'', 3: 11. A neighbor in Harmony said that prior to burning it, Lucy Harris hid the manuscript and told Smith to find it with his seer stone, but that Smith was unsuccessful {{Harv|Mather|1880|p=202}}. For other theories of what happened to the missing pages see Dan Vogel, ''Early Mormon Documents'' (Salt Lake City: Signature, 2000), 3: 480-81. Master forger [[Mark Hofmann]] may have been working on a forgery of the 116 pages before he was convicted of murder. See Allen D. Roberts, "'The Truth Is the Most Important Thing': The New Mormon History According to Mark Hofmann," ''Dialogue'' 20 (1987), 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Harris left Harmony, Smith's wife gave birth to Smith's firstborn son, who was "very much deformed" and died less than a day after delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Sophia Lewis, 1834, quoted in ''EMD'' 4: 298. Lewis, who was present at the birth, said that the baby was stillborn.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emma Hale Smith|Emma Smith]] nearly died herself, and Smith tended her for two weeks. As she slowly gained strength, Smith left her in the care of her mother and went back to Palmyra in search of Harris and the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 66-67; {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=118}}; {{Harv|Howe|1834|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day Harris was dragged into the Smith family home in distress and without the pages. Smith urged Harris to search his house again, but Harris told him he had already ripped open beds and pillows. Smith moaned, "Oh, my God! ... All is lost! all is lost! What shall I do? I have sinned&amp;mdash;it is I who tempted the wrath of God".&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 67; {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Harmony]] without Harris, Smith dictated to Emma his first written [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]],&lt;ref&gt;The revelation is today [[Doctrine and Covenants]], section 3 (LDS Church ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; which both rebuked Smith and denounced Harris as "a wicked man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Phelps|1833|loc=sec. 2:5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the revelation assured Smith that if he was penitent, the interpreters would be returned to him during his annual visit with [[Angel Moroni|Moroni]] on September 22, 1828, and he would regain his ability to translate.&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 68; {{Harv|Phelps|1833|loc=2:7}};[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/3/10-11 D&amp;C 3:10-11]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resumed transcription and the witnesses==

Between the loss of the pages during the summer of 1828 and the rapid completion of the Book of Mormon in the spring of 1829, there was a period of quiescence as if Smith were waiting "for help or direction."&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1829, Smith was joined by [[Oliver Cowdery]], a fellow Vermonter and a distant relation who replaced Harris as scribe.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Mormon Documents'', 1: 599-600, 604, n. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The pace of the transcription increased so dramatically that, within two months, nearly the entire remainder of the manuscript of the [[Book of Mormon]] was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Smith, he did not retranslate the material that Harris had lost because he said that if he did, evil men would alter the manuscript in an effort to discredit him. Smith said that instead, he had been divinely ordered to replace the lost material with Nephi's account of the same events.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/10 D&amp;C| D&amp;C 10: 17-18, 31] for Smith's description of the plans to alter the manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; (Nevertheless, "evil men" might also have altered the lost manuscript to contradict the new account as well,&lt;ref&gt;http://mormonthink.com/lost116web.htm {{unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is evidenced by [[Mark Hofmann#Joseph Smith III blessing|Mark Hofmann]]'s supposed desire to do so.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Lindsey (journalist)|Robert Lindsey]], ''A Gathering of Saints'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1988), 300. "It was possible, George thought, that Hofmann could have destroyed Mormonism. Perhaps that is what he wanted to do—and to get rich at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt; When Smith reached the end of the book, he was told that God had foreseen the loss of the early manuscript and had prepared the same history in an abridged format that emphasized religious history, the Small Plates of Nephi.&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 74. The translated version of these "small plates" includes the books of [[First Book of Nephi|1]] &amp; [[2 Nephi]], [[Book of Jacob|Jacob]], [[Book of Enos|Enos]], [[Book of Jarom|Jarom]] and [[Book of Omni|Omni]]. The unabridged version, not retranslated, Smith called "The Book of Lehi."&lt;/ref&gt; Smith transcribed this portion, and it appears as the first part of the book. When published in 1830, the Book of Mormon contained a statement about the lost 116 pages, as well as the Testimony of [[Three Witnesses]] and the Testimony of [[Eight Witnesses]], who claimed to have seen and handled the [[golden plates]].

The loss of the manuscript provided opponents of Mormonism, such as the 19th-century clergyman M. T. Lamb, with additional reasons to dismiss the religion as a fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/bom_early_problems/goldenbible_stolenmanuscript.htm M. T. Lamb, ''The Golden Bible'' (1887)], an early critical view of the lost manuscript problem. Lamb noted that the plates from which the 116 pages were translated had been preserved for 1,400 years by the special providence of God, but that a "wrathful woman" had undone His plans; neither God nor the angel stopped Smith from translating the wrong plates until Harris lost the manuscript; God scolded Smith for his loss of the manuscript, even though its loss was "the best thing that could have happened for the cause of truth." Although Smith said that "evil men" would produce an altered manuscript if he were to translate the same part of the golden plates again, no such attempt has been uncovered. Nor did Smith ever announce what had become of the lost pages despite his followers' belief in his prophetic gift.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fawn Brodie]] has written that Smith "realized that it was impossible for him to reproduce the story exactly, and that to redictate it would be to invite devastating comparisons. Harris's wife taunted him: 'If this be a divine communication, the same being who revealed it to you can easily replace it.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Fawn Brodie]], ''[[No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet]]'' 2nd ed. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1986), 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-Mormons [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] argued that the lost manuscript suggested that Smith was not a misguided individual who believed in his own creative imagination but was at least minimally aware of his own deception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://utlm.org/newsletters/no72.htm UTLM Newsletter 72.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jeffrey R. Holland]], an [[apostle (Latter-day Saints)|apostle]] in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), "it was not tit for tat, this for that—you give me 116 pages of manuscript and I'll give you 142 pages of printed text. Not so. We got back more than we lost. And it was known from the beginning that it would be so."&lt;ref&gt;"At least six times in the Book of Mormon the phrase 'for a wise purpose' is used in reference to the making, writing, and preserving of the small plates of Nephi (see 1 Nephi 9:5; Words of Mormon 1:7; Alma 37:2,12,14,18). We know one such wise purpose—the most obvious one—was to compensate for the lost 116 pages of manuscript. But it strikes me that there is a 'wiser purpose' than that ....The key to such a suggestion is in verse 45 of Section 10 .... He says, 'Behold, there are many things engraven upon the [small] plates of Nephi which do throw ''greater views'' upon my gospel.' So clearly ... it was not tit for tat, this for that—you give me 116 pages of manuscript and I'll give you 142 pages of printed text. Not so. We got back more than we lost. And it was known from the beginning that it would be so. We do not know exactly what we missed in the 116 pages, but we do know that what we received on the small plates was the personal declarations of three great witnesses, [Nephi, Jacob, and Isaiah], ... testifying that Jesus is the Christ. ... I think you could make a pretty obvious case that the ''sole'' purpose of the small plates was to give a platform for these three witnesses." (''CES Symposium'', BYU, Aug. 9, 1994 as taken from ''Latter-day Commentary on the Book of Mormon'' compiled by K. Douglas Bassett, p. 198)&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Harris was permitted by Smith to be one of the [[Three Witnesses]]. He mortgaged his farm for $3000 as security in the event that the Book of Mormon did not sell, and when in fact, it did not, he lost both his farm and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 80. Lucy Harris swore (and had corroboration) that her husband intended to make money through his relationship to Smith and the Book of Mormon. ''EMD'' 2: 35.&lt;/ref&gt; He later disavowed Joseph Smith, left the church, joined several different varieties of early Mormon-related congregations, then at 87 joined the LDS Church and recanted what he'd earlier said about Smith. He never disavowed the gold plates, however. On his death bed, Harris said: "The Book of Mormon is no fake. I know what I know. I have seen what I have seen and I have heard what I have heard. I have seen the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon is written. An angel appeared to me and others and testified to the truthfulness of the record, and had I been willing to have perjured myself and sworn falsely to the testimony I now bear I could have been a rich man, but I could not have testified other than I have done and am now doing for these things are true."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Harris on his death bed. Cited by George Godfrey, "Testimony of Martin Harris," from an unpublished manuscript copy in the possession of his descendants, quoted in Eldin Ricks, ''The Case of the Book of Mormon Witnesses'' [Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1971], 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nachzehrer''' is a sort of [[Germany|German]] [[vampire]]. Nachzehrer translates "after (''nach'') living off (''zehren'')" likely alluding to their living after death or living off humans after death in addition to the choice of "nach" for "after" which is similar to "nacht" ("night"). The nachzehrer was prominent in the [[folklore]] of the northern regions of Germany, but even in [[Silesia]] and [[Bavaria]], and the word was also used to describe a similar creature of the [[Kashubes]] of Northern [[Poland]].

==Overview==
A Nachzehrer is created most commonly after [[suicide]], and sometimes from an accidental death. According to German lore, a person does not become a nachzehrer from being bitten or scratched; the transformation happens after death and is not communicable. Nachzehrers are also related to sickness and disease. If a large group of people died of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the first person to have died is believed to be a nachzehrer.

Typically, a nachzehrer devours its family members upon waking. It has also been said that they devour their own bodies, including their funeral shrouds, and the more of themselves they eat, the more of their family they physically drain. It is not unlikely that the idea of the dead eating themselves might have risen from bodies in open graves who had been partly eaten by scavengers like rats. 

The nachzehrer was similar to the Slavic vampire in that it was known to be a recently deceased person who returned from the grave to attack family and village acquaintances. 

{{quote|Some Kashubes believed that the Nachzehrer would leave its grave, shapeshifting into the form of a pig, and pay a visit to their family members to feast on their blood. In addition, the Nachzehrer was able to ascend to a church belfry to ring the bells, bringing death to anyone who hears them. Another lesser known ability of the Nachzehrer is the power it had to bring death by causing its shadow to fall upon someone. Those hunting the Nachzehrer in the graveyard would listen for grunting sounds that it would make while it munched on its grave clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Matthew (1993).

It usually originated from an unusual death such as a person who died by suicide or accident. They were also associated with epidemic sickness, such as whenever a group of people died from the same disease, the person who died first was labeled to be the cause of the group's death. Another belief was that if a person's name was not removed from his burial clothing, that person would be a candidate for becoming a nachzehrer.

Such a belief was found even in the [[Republic of Venice]], where the body of a woman, with a brick in her mouth, was recently discovered in a mass grave of [[Plague_(disease)|plague]]-dead people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.it/curiosita/storia/Il_vampiro_di_Venezia_2902191746_C12.aspx Vampire woman of Venice]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official killing myth says you can kill a nachzehrer by placing a coin in its mouth, and then chopping off its head. It can be discerned from this that a mere coin in the mouth may result in paralysis as some myths say that a stake through a vampires heart does. 

Finding nachzehrer in order to kill them is not difficult; it is characteristic of a nachzehrer to lie in its grave with its thumb in its opposite hand, and its left eye open. Additionally, they are easily found while eating their burial shroud due to the volume they produce in this act. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/nachzehrers-shroud-eating-vampires-germanic-folklore-006010?nopaging=1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Henry Fuseli - The Nightmare.JPG|thumb|280px|''[[The Nightmare]]'', by [[Henry Fuseli]] (1781) is thought to be one of the classic depictions of sleep paralysis perceived as a [[demon]]ic visitation.]]
The '''night hag''' or '''old hag''' is a creature sighted by various people which is used to explain the phenomenon of [[sleep paralysis]]. It is a phenomenon during which a person feels a presence of a supernatural malevolent being which immobilizes the person as if sitting on his/her chest or the foot of his/her bed. The word "night-mare" or "[[nightmare]]" was used to describe this phenomenon before the word acquired its modern, more general meaning.&lt;ref&gt;''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'', Volume 1, edited by Thomas A. Green, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S7Wfhws3dFAC&amp;pg=PA588 p. 588]&lt;/ref&gt; Various cultures have various names for this phenomenon  and/or supernatural character.

== Sleep paralysis ==
{{Main|Sleep paralysis}}
The original definition of sleep paralysis was codified by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' as ''nightmare'', a term that evolved into our modern definition. Such sleep paralysis was widely considered the work of [[demon]]s, and more specifically [[Incubus|incubi]], which were thought to sit on the chests of sleepers. In [[Old English language|Old English]] the name for these beings was ''mare'' or ''mære'' (from a [[proto-Germanic language|proto-Germanic]] ''*marōn'', cf. [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''[[mara (folklore)|mara]]''), hence comes the ''mare'' part in ''nightmare''. The word might be etymologically cognate to [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''Marōn'' (in the [[Odyssey]]) and [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Mara (demon)|Māra]]''.

== Folklore ==
* In [[Scandinavian folklore]], sleep paralysis is caused by a [[Mare (folklore)|mare]], a supernatural creature related to [[Incubus|incubi]] and [[Succubus|succubi]]. The mare is a damned woman, who is cursed and her body is carried mysteriously during sleep and without her noticing. In this state, she visits villagers to sit on their rib cages while they are asleep, causing them to experience nightmares. The Swedish film [[Marianne (2011 film)|''Marianne'']] examines the folklore surrounding sleep paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://lesgivresdlabobine.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/entretien-avec-le-realisateur-filip-tegstedt-a-propos-de-marianne/&amp;ei=BLVqTaK9D4nQceTO_Y0M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEAQ7gEwBg|title=Interview with director Filip Tegstedt, about Marianne |first=Aurore|last=Bjursell|date=13 December 2010|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Folk belief in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] describe the negative figure of the [[hag]] who leaves her physical body at night, and sits on the chest of her victim. The victim usually wakes with a feeling of terror, has difficulty breathing because of a perceived heavy invisible weight on his or her chest, and is unable to move i.e., experiences sleep paralysis. This nightmare experience is described as being "hag-ridden" in the [[Gullah]] lore. The "Old Hag" was a nightmare spirit in British and also Anglophone North American folklore.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}
* In [[Fiji]], the experience is interpreted as ''kana tevoro'', being "eaten" by a demon. In many cases the demon can be the spirit of a recently dead relative who has come back for some unfinished business, or has come to communicate some important news to the living. Often persons sleeping near the afflicted person say ''kania, kania'', "eat! eat!" in an attempt to prolong the possession for a chance to converse with the dead relative or spirit and seek answers as to why he or she has come back. The person waking up from the experience is often asked to immediately curse or chase the spirit of the dead relative, which sometimes involves literally speaking to the spirit and telling him or her to go away or using expletives.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

* In [[Turkey]] sleep paralysis is called ''Karabasan'', and is similar to other stories of demonic visitation during sleep. A supernatural being, commonly known as a ''[[jinn]]'' (''cin'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), comes to the victim's room, holds him or her down hard enough not to allow any kind of movement, and starts to strangle the person. To get rid of the demonic creature, one needs to pray to [[Allah]] by reading [[Al-Falaq]] and [[Al-Nas]] from the [[Qur'an]]. Moreover, in some derivatives of the stories, the jinn has a wide hat and if the person can show the courage and take its hat, the djinn becomes his slave.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* In [[Thailand]] it is believed that sleep paralysis and discomfort is caused by a [[ghost]] of the [[Thai folklore]] known as ''Phi Am'' ({{lang-th|ผีอำ}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lungkitti.tarad.com/img-lib/spd_20120725124110_b.jpg|title=ผีอำ|website=tarad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people claim that this spirit may even cause bruises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m2.truelife.com/foodhealth/d.php?sub=2656&amp;id=104700|title=Truelife|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories about this spirit are common in [[Thai comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j40/freeze_taker/toon/pheeum-ex.jpg|title=Phi Am comics|website=photobucket.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Southern states of the United States, it is sometimes referred to as "witch riding".&lt;ref name="Katherine Roberts" /&gt;
* In Eastern Chinese folklore, it is thought that a mouse can steal human breath at night. Human breath strengthens the mouse, allowing it longevity and the ability to briefly become human at night, in a similar fashion to fox spirits. The mouse sits near the person's face or under their nostrils.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

=== East Asia ===
* In [[Chinese culture]], sleep paralysis is widely known as "鬼壓身/鬼压身" ([[pinyin]]: guǐ yā shēn) or "鬼壓床/鬼压床" ([[pinyin]]: guǐ yā chuáng), which literally translate into "ghost pressing on body" or "ghost pressing on bed." A more modern term is "夢魘/梦魇" ([[pinyin]]: mèng yǎn).
* In [[Japanese language|Japanese]] culture, sleep paralysis is referred to as ''kanashibari'' ([[:ja:金縛り|金縛り]]), literally "bound or fastened in metal," from "kane" (metal) and "shibaru" (to bind, to tie, to fasten). This term is occasionally used by English speaking authors to refer to the phenomenon both in academic papers and in [[popular psychology|pop psych]] literature.&lt;ref name="shibaru"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=High prevalence of isolated sleep paralysis: kanashibari phenomenon in Japan |last=Fukuda |first=K. |last2=Miyasita |first2=A. |last3=Inugami |first3=M. |last4=Ishihara |first4=K. |journal=Sleep |year=1987 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=279–286 |doi= |pmid=3629091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Korean culture]], sleep paralysis is called ''gawi nulim'' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=[[:ko:가위눌림|가위눌림]]}}), literally, "being pressed down by something scary in a dream." It is often associated with a belief that a ghost or spirit is lying on top of or pressing down on the sufferer.
* In [[Mongolian culture]], nightmares in general as well as sleep paralysis is referred to by the verb-phrase ''khar darakh'' (written kara darahu), meaning "to be pressed by the Black" or "when the Dark presses." ''Kara'' means black, and may refer to the dark side personified. ''Kharin buu'' means "shaman of the black" (shamans of the dark side only survive in far-northern [[Mongolia]]), while ''tsaghaan zugiin buu'' means "shaman of the white direction" (referring to shamans who only invoke benevolent spirits). Compare 'karabasan' (the dark presser) in Turkish, which may date from pre-Islamic times when the Turks had the same religion and mythology as the Mongols. See [[Turkic mythology|Mythology of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples]] and [[Tengriism]].
* In [[Tibetan culture]], sleep paralysis is often known as ''dip-non'' (གྲིབ་གནོན་ - [[Kham]]) or ''dip-phok'' (གྲིབ་ཕོག་ - [[Ladakh]]), which translates roughly as "oppressed/struck by ''dip''"; ''dip'', literally meaning shadow, refers to a kind of spiritual pollution.

=== South-East Asia ===
* In [[Cambodian culture|Cambodian]], [[Lao culture|Lao]], and [[Thai culture]] sleep paralysis is called ''phǐǐ am'' ({{IPA-th|pʰǐi.ʔam}}, {{IPA-lo|pʰǐi.ʔàm}}) and ''khmout sukkhot''. It is described as an event in which the person is sleeping and dreams that one or more ghostly figures are nearby or even holding him or her down. The sufferer is unable to move or make any noises. This is not to be confused with ''pee khao'' and ''khmout jool'', ghost possession.
* In [[Hmong people|Hmong]] culture, sleep paralysis is understood to be caused by a nocturnal pressing spirit, ''dab tsog''. ''Dab tsog'' attacks "sleepers" by sitting on their chests, sometimes attempting to strangle them. Some believe that ''dab tsog'' is responsible for [[Sudden unexpected death syndrome|sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome]] (SUNDS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adler |first=Shelley R. |year=2011 |title=Sleep Paralysis: Night-mares, Nocebos, and the Mind-Body Connection |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey, and London |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-4885-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Superstition in Pakistan}}
* In [[Kashmir]]i mythology this is caused by an invisible creature called a ''pasikdhar'' or a ''sayaa''. Some people believe that a pasikdhar lives in every house and attacks somebody if the house has not been cleaned or if god is not being worshiped in the house. One also experiences this if one has been doing something evil or derives pleasure from the misfortunes of others.
* In [[Pakistan]], sleep paralysis is considered an encounter with ''[[Shaitan]]'' ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: شيطان ) ([[Satan]]), [[evil]] [[jinn]]s or [[demon]]s who have taken over one's body. This [[ghoul]] is known as ''bakhtak'' ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: بختک) or '[[ifrit]]'. It is also assumed that it is caused by the [[black magic]] performed by enemies and [[jealous]] persons. People, especially children and young girls, wear [[Ta'wiz]] ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: تعویز) ([[Amulet]]) to ward off [[evil eye]]. [[Spell (paranormal)|Spells]], [[incantation]]s and [[curse]]s could also result in [[ghoul]]s [[haunting]] a person. Some homes and places are also believed to be [[Haunting|haunted]] by [[evil]] [[ghost]]s, [[satan]]ic or other [[supernatural]] beings and they could [[Haunting|haunt]] people living there especially during the night. [[Muslim]] holy persons ([[Imam]]s, [[Maulvi]]s, [[Sufi]]s, [[Mullah]]s, [[Fakir|Faqirs]]) perform [[exorcism]] on individuals who are believed to be [[Demonic possession|possessed]]. The homes, houses, buildings and grounds are [[Blessing|blessed]] and [[Consecration|consecrated]] by [[Mullah]]s or [[Imam]]s by reciting [[Qur'an]] and [[Adhan]] ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: أَذَان), the [[Islam]]ic call to [[Salah|prayer]], recited by the [[muezzin]]. 
* In [[Bangladesh]], the phenomenon of sleep paralysis is referred to as ''boba'' ("speechless").{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
* In Tamil Nadu and Sri Lankan Tamil culture, this particular phenomenon is referred to as ''Amuku Be'' or ''Amuku Pei'' meaning "the ghost that forces one down."{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
* In Nepal, especially [[Newa people|Newari]] culture it is also known as ''Khyaak'', after a ghost-like figure believed to reside in the darkness under the staircases of a house.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Middle-East, Western and Central Asia ===
* In [[Arabs|Arab]] Culture, sleep paralysis is often referred to as ''Ja-thoom'' ({{lang-ar|جاثوم}}), literally "What sits heavily on something". In folklore across Arab countries, the ''Ja-thoom'' is believed to be a ''[[Shaitan|shayṭān]]'' or a ''[[ifrit|‘ifrīt]]'' sitting on top of the person or is also choking them. It is said that it can be prevented by sleeping on your right side and reading the [[Al-Baqara 255|Throne Verse]] of the [[Quran]].
* In [[Turkey|Turkish]] culture, sleep paralysis is often referred to as ''karabasan'' ("the dark presser/assailer"). It is believed to be a creature that attacks people in their sleep, pressing on their chest and stealing their breath. However, folk legends do not provide a reason why the devil or ifrit does that.
* In [[Persian people|Persian]] culture it is known as ''bakhtak'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: بختک), which is a ghost-like creature that sits on the dreamer's chest, making breathing hard for them.
* In [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] culture, sleep paralysis is often referred to as ''motakka''. It is believed to be a demon that attacks people in their sleep, and particularly children of young age, and steals their breath away as they breathe heavily and keeps it out of reach.
*In [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] culture, it is known as "Khapasa". It is believed that it is a ghost without thumb fingers. The ghost tries to suffocate you by pressing your throat and sitting on your chest. However, since the ghost has no thumbs finger that's why it can't suffocate effectively by using just the index and middle fingers of both hands.

=== Africa ===
* ''Ogun Oru'' is a traditional explanation for nocturnal disturbances among the Yoruba of Southwest Nigeria; ''ogun oru'' ("nocturnal warfare") involves an acute night-time disturbance that is culturally attributed to demonic infiltration of the body and psyche during dreaming. ''Ogun oru'' is characterized by its occurrence, a female preponderance, the perception of an underlying feud between the sufferer's earthly spouse and a "spiritual" spouse, and the event of bewitchment through eating while dreaming. The condition is believed to be treatable through Christian prayers or elaborate traditional rituals designed to exorcise the imbibed demonic elements.&lt;ref name="pmid17379609"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aina OF, Famuyiwa OO |title=Ogun Oru: a traditional explanation for nocturnal neuropsychiatric disturbances among the Yoruba of Southwest Nigeria |journal=Transcultural psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=44–54 |year=2007 |pmid=17379609 |doi=10.1177/1363461507074968}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Egypt, its believed to be an evil African Queen's ghost that is haunting souls which she is trying to capture before being chased off by guardian spirits. 
* In Zimbabwean [[Shona people|Shona culture]] the word ''Madzikirira'' is used to refer something strongly pressing one down. This mostly refers to the spiritual world in which some spirit—especially an evil one—tries to use its victim for some evil purpose. The people believe that witches can only be people of close relations to be effective, and hence a witches often try to use one's spirit to bewitch one's relatives.
* In Ethiopian culture the word ''dukak'' (ዱካክ, "depression") is used, which is believed to be an evil spirit that possesses people during their sleep. Some people believe this experience is a symptom of withdrawal from the stimulant [[khat]]. The evil spirit ''dukak'' is an [[anthropomorphic]] personification of the depression that often results from the act of quitting chewing khat. 'Dukak' often appears in hallucinations of the quitters and metes out punishments to its victims for offending him by quitting. The punishments are often in the form of implausible physical punishments (e.g., the ''dukak'' puts the victim in a bottle and shakes the bottle vigorously) or outrageous tasks the victim must perform (e.g., swallow a bag of gravel).&lt;ref name="gorfu06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gorfu| first1 = M. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2006| title = The Prevalence of Khat –Induced Psychotic Reactions among College Students: A Case in Jimma University College of Agriculture | url = http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ejesc/article/viewFile/41977 | journal = Ethiopian Journal of Education and Science | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 63–84 | issn= 1998-8907 | doi = 10.4314/ejesc.v2i1.41977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is attributed to result from a person sleeping on his back. Most people also recall being strangled by this 'creature'.
* In the Moroccan culture, sleep paralysis is known as ''bou rattat,'' which means a demon that presses and covers the sleeper's body so they cannot move or speak.

=== Europe ===
* In [[Finland|Finnish]] folk culture sleep paralysis is called ''unihalvaus'' (dream paralysis), but the Finnish word for nightmare, ''painajainen'', is believed to originally have meant sleep paralysis, as it's formed from the word ''painaja'', which translates to ''pusher'' or ''presser'', and the diminutive suffix ''-nen''.
* In [[Hungary|Hungarian]] folk culture sleep paralysis is called ''lidércnyomás'' (''lidérc pressing'') and can be attributed to a number of supernatural entities like ''lidérc'' (wraith), ''boszorkány'' (witch), ''tündér'' (fairy) or ''ördögszerető'' (demon lover).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02115/html/3-1332.html lidérc], Magyar Néprajzi Lexikon, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest 1977, ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''boszorkány'' itself stems from the Turkish root ''bas-'', meaning "to press."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02115/html/1-925.html boszorkány], Magyar Néprajzi Lexikon, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest 1977, ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Iceland]] folk culture sleep paralysis is generally called having a ''[[Mara (folklore)|Mara]]''. A [[goblin]] or a [[succubus]] (since it is generally female) believed to cause nightmares (the origin of the word 'Nightmare' itself is derived from an English cognate of her name). Other European cultures share variants of the same folklore, calling her under different names; Proto-Germanic: ''marōn''; Old English: ''mære''; German: ''Mahr''; Dutch: ''nachtmerrie''; Icelandic, Old Norse, Faroese, and Swedish: ''mara''; Danish: ''mare''; Norwegian: ''mare''; Old Irish: ''morrigain''; Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, Slovene: ''môra''; Bulgarian, Polish: ''mara''; French: ''cauchemar''; Romanian: ''moroi''; Czech: ''můra''; Slovak: ''mora''. The origin of the belief itself is much older, back to the reconstructed Proto Indo-European root ''mora-'', an incubus, from the root ''mer-'' "to rub away" or "to harm."
* In [[Malta]], folk culture attributes a sleep paralysis incident to an attack by the ''Haddiela,'' who is the wife of the ''Hares'', an entity in Maltese folk culture that haunts the individual in ways similar to a poltergeist.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} As believed in folk culture, to get rid of the Haddiela, one must place a piece of silverware or a knife under the pillow prior to sleep.
* In [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]], it is believed that sleep paralysis occurs when a ghost-like creature or Demon named Mora, Vrahnas or Varypnas (Greek: Μόρα, Βραχνάς, Βαρυπνάς) tries to steal the victim's speech or sits on the victim's chest causing asphyxiation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* In [[Catalonia]] legend and popular culture, the ''[[Pesanta]]'' is an enormous dog (or sometimes a cat) that goes into people's houses in the night and puts itself on their chests making it difficult for them to breathe and causing them the most horrible nightmares. The Pesanta is black and hairy, with steel paws, but with holes so it can't take anything.&lt;ref name="sapiens128"&gt;{{cite journal |  title = La pesanta | journal = [[Revista Sàpiens]]  | issue = núm.128 | publisher = Sàpiens Publicacions | place = Barcelona  | date = April 2013  | page =16 | issn =1695-2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Sardinia]], one of [[Italy]]'s islands, there is an old belief that identifies the cause of sleep paralysis in a demoniac being called "Ammuttadori". This ghoulish creature sits in the chest of the sleeping victim, suffocating him and, sometimes, ripping the skin with his nails. It is also believed, in some parts of the island, that this demon wears seven red caps on his head: if the victim resists the pain and succeeds to steal one of the caps, he will soon find a hidden treasure as a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paradisola.it/cultura/contusu-antigusu/912-s-ammutadori-demone-del-sonno|title=S'Ammutadori... demone del sonno|author=Domenico Corraine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Latvia]]n folk culture sleep paralysis is called a torture or strangling by ''[[Lietuvēns]]''. It is thought to be a ''[[soul]]'' of a killed (strangled, drowned, hanged) person and attacks both people and domestic animals. When under attack, one must move the toe of the left foot to get rid of the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latviešu tautas ticējumi|url=http://valoda.ailab.lv/folklora/ticejumi/lietuven.htm|work=Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|publisher=Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science University of Latvia|accessdate=21 February 2013|author=P.

* In Mexico, it is believed that this is caused by the spirit of a dead person. This ghost lies down upon the body of the sleeper, rendering him unable to move. People refer to this as "subirse el muerto" (dead person on you).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/575017.html |title = ¿Has sentido que se te sube el muerto? | publisher = El Universal | date= February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In many parts of the Southern United States, the phenomenon is known as a ''[[hag]]'', and the event is said to portend an approaching tragedy or accident.{{Citation needed|reason=needs to ref published folklorist research|date=October 2011}}
* In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], it is known as the 'Old Hag'.&lt;ref name="OldHag"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Firestone, M.|title=The "Old Hag": sleep paralysis in Newfoundland|work=The Journal of Psychoanalytic Anthropology|year=1985|chapter=Section 8|pages=47–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In island folklore, the Hag can be summoned to attack a third party, like a [[curse]]. In his 1982 book, ''The Terror that Comes in the Night'', David J. Hufford writes that in local culture the way to call the Hag is to recite the [[Lord's Prayer]] backwards.
* In contemporary western culture the phenomenon of supernatural assault are thought{{By whom|date=November 2011}} to be the work of what are known as [[shadow people]].

* In [[Brazil]], there is a legend about a mythological being called the ''pisadeira'' ("she who steps"). She is described as a tall, skinny old woman, with long dirty nails in dried toes, white tangled hair, a long nose, staring red eyes, and greenish teeth on her evil laugh. She lives over the roofs, waiting to step on the chest of those who sleep with a full stomach.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[Image:中国北京市西城区China Beijing, Xicheng District, China Xinjiang - panoramio (56).jpg|thumb|Throne in the Palace of Heavenly Purity]]
The '''Palace of Heavenly Purity''', or '''Qianqing Palace''' ({{zh|c=乾清宫|p=qiánqīng gōng}}; [[Manchu language|Manchu]]:{{MongolUnicode|ᡴᡳᠶᠠᠨ&lt;br&gt;ᠴᡳᠩ&lt;br&gt;ᡤᡠᠩ}}; [[Paul Georg von Möllendorff|Möllendorff]]: ''kiyan cing gung'') is a palace in the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. It is the largest of the three halls of the Inner Court (the other two being the [[Hall of Union]] and the [[Palace of Earthly Tranquility]]), located at the northern end of the Forbidden City. During the [[Qing dynasty]], the palace often served as the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]]'s audience hall, where he held council with the [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]]. 

The Palace of Heavenly Purity is a double-eaved building, and set on a single-level white marble platform. It is connected to the [[Gate of Heavenly Purity]] to its south by a raised walkway. In the [[Ming dynasty]], it was the residence of the Emperor. The large space was divided into nine rooms on two levels, with 27 beds. For security, on any one night the Emperor would randomly choose from any of these beds. This continued through the early Qing dynasty. However, when the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] ascended to the throne, he did not wish to inhabit the palace occupied by [[Kangxi Emperor|his father]] for 60 years. He and subsequent emperors lived instead at the smaller [[Hall of Mental Cultivation]] to the west.&lt;ref name="CCTV２"&gt;{{cite video | people=China Central Television, The Palace Museum |date=2005 | url=http://www.cctv.com/history/special/C15041/01/index.shtml| title=Gugong: "II. Ridgeline of a Prosperous Age" | medium=Documentary | location=China | publisher=CCTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palace of Heavenly Purity then became the Emperor's audience hall, where he held court, received ministers and emissaries, and held banquets. At the centre of the Palace, set atop an elaborate platform, is a throne and a desk, on which the Emperor wrote notes and signed documents during councils with ministers.&lt;ref name="Yu 78"&gt;p 78, Yu (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; A caisson is set into the roof, featuring a coiled dragon. 

Above the throne hangs a tablet with a [[Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts#Right-to-left_horizontal_writing|right-to-left]] script reading ''zhèng dà guāng míng'' ({{lang|zh|正大光明}}), penned by the [[Shunzhi Emperor]]. This tablet has been translated several ways but the loose transliteral meaning is "let the righteous shine". It is often used as a [[Chengyu|Chinese idiom]], meaning "to be decent, honest and magnanimous," or "to have no secret or do a shameless deed." Beginning with the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], who himself had ascended to the throne amid a succession dispute, Qing dynasty emperors had designated their heirs in secret, with one copy of the will hidden behind this tablet and another carried at all times by the Emperor himself.&lt;ref&gt;p 51, Yang (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Henderson Bryce''' (August 17, 1853 – January 15, 1932) was an official of the [[Ontario]] Health Department, [[Canada]]. As a public official he submitted reports that highlighted the mistreatment of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Indigenous students]] in the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] and advocated for the improvement of environmental conditions at the schools.

==Biography==
Peter Bryce was born in [[Mount Pleasant, Brant County, Ontario|Mount Pleasant, Ontario]] on August 17, 1853.&lt;ref name="FitzGerald"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=FitzGerald|first1=J.

BRYCE|journal=Canadian Public Health Journal|date=February 1932|volume=23|issue=2|pages=88–91|jstor=41976579}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his medical degree from the University of Toronto, where he studied natural science geology, and went on to study neurology in Paris. He lectured for a time at the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] in [[Guelph|Guelph, Ontario]] in science and applied chemistry.&lt;ref name="Lux"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lux|first1=Maureen K.|title=Medicine that walks : disease, medicine, and Canadian Plains native people, 1880 - 1940|date=2001|publisher=Univ. of Toronto Press|location=Toronto [u.a.]|isbn=9780802082954|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ejSqbqXHQqoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Maureen%20Katherine%20Lux%22&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryce served as the first secretary of the Ontario Board of Health from 1882 to 1904, when he was appointed the Chief Medical Officer of the federal Department of Immigration.&lt;ref name="FitzGerald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dickin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dickin|first1=Janice|title=Peter Henderson Bryce|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/peter-henderson-bryce/|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.com|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=5 September 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryce was hired by Indian Affairs Department in Ottawa to report on the health conditions of the Canadian residential school system in western Canada and British Columbia. His report was never released by the government but was published by Bryce in 1922 under the title ''The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921''.

Bryce claimed that Indigenous children enrolled in residential schools were deprived of adequate medical attention and sanitary living conditions. He suggested improvements to national policies regarding the care and education of Indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="TRCExec"&gt;{{cite web|title=Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future - Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Exec_Summary_2015_05_31_web_o.pdf|publisher=The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|accessdate=28 June 2016|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sproule-Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sproule-Jones|first1=Megan|title=Crusading for the Forgotten: Dr. Peter Bryce, Public Health, and Prairie Native Residential Schools|journal=Canadian Bulletin of Medical History|date=1996|volume=13|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1907 report Bryce cited an average mortality rate of between 14% and 24% at the schools and a shocking 42% infant mortality rate on the reserves, this due to sick children being sent home to die.&lt;ref name="LHF"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hope and Healing: the Legacy of the Indian Residential School System|date=March 2014|publisher=Legacy of Hope Foundation|location=Ottawa|isbn=978-1-77198-002-9|url=http://staging.legacyofhope.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Hope-Healing-2014_web.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} Bryce noted that the lack of certainty about the exact number of deaths was, in part, due to the official reports submitted by school principals and "defective way in which the returns had been made."&lt;ref name="TRCHistoryPart1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada's Residential Schools: The History, Part 1 Origins to 1939 |work=Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Volume 1|url=http://nctr.ca/assets/reports/Final%20Reports/Volume_1_History_Part_1_English_Web.pdf|publisher=National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation|author=Truth and Reconciliation Commission|accessdate=1 July 2016|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|405}}

He appealed his forced retirement from the Civil Service in 1921 and was denied, subsequently publishing his suppressed report condemning the treatment of the Indigenous at the hands of the [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|BNA]].&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/storyofnationalc00brycuoft/storyofnationalc00brycuoft_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pharmacy Care Systems Ltd v Attorney-General''' (2004) 17 PRNZ 308 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the seven elements of [[duress]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Pharmacy Care set up a high volume, low margin service to supply government institutions. One of these institutions was the Northern Regional Health Authority commonly referred to as "North Health".

Problems later developed when North Health discovered that PCS was recycling drugs, i.e. billing North Health for supply, unused drugs that had been previously returned by institutions, that North Health had previously paid for.

This resulted in North Health calling in an investigator, as well as with holding monies it owed from Pharmacy Care.

To resolve the matter, Pharmacy Care agreed to enter into a Deed of Settlement, agreeing to refund $80,000 to North Health.

However, 3 1/2 years later, Pharmacy Care sought to have the Deed of Settlement set aside, claiming it was entered into as the result of duress by North Health, claiming they threatened a fraud prosecution if it was not accepted.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal found no evidence that North Health had threatened a fraud prosecution. And even if it had found such evidence, the delay of 3 1/2 years in challenging the agreement amounted to affirmation of the contract.

"'''Segregationist'''" is a [[science fiction]] [[short story]] by American writer [[Isaac Asimov]].  The story was written in April 1967 and was first published in December in ''Abbottempo'', a magazine produced by [[Abbott Laboratories]], then later included in the collections ''[[Nightfall and Other Stories]]'' (1969), ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) and ''[[Robot Visions]]'' (1990).

==Plot summary==
The story depicts a future where robotic [[prosthetics]] for humans and artificially-created organic body-parts for robots (known as Metallos) are commonplace. Metallos have been granted equal status with 'normal' humans.

A man, who has been granted the right to long life (possibly immortality) by an official Board of Mortality, meets the [[surgeon]] who is to assist in the performance of [[Artificial-heart|heart replacement surgery]] on the man. The surgeon offers him a choice between a metallic or fibrous cyber-heart. The man stubbornly refuses the doctor's attempts to persuade him to accept a fibrous heart, saying that it's "weak," as compared to a metal heart.

Later, the surgeon remarks to a medical engineer that he would rather that humans and robots stick to being what they are instead of becoming similar. The engineer calls such talk "segregationist", to which the surgeon replies that he "doesn't care." At the end of the story, the surgeon is revealed to be a robot himself.

'''Mary Lillian Ellison''' (July 22, 1923 – November 2, 2007) was an American [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by her [[ring name]] '''The Fabulous Moolah'''. She began her career working with promoter [[Billy Wolfe]] and  his wife, wrestler and trainer [[Mildred Burke]], as well as working alongside professional wrestler [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|"Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers]]. She won the [[NWA World Women's Championship]] in 1956 and was the most prominent holder of the title for 28  years.

In the 1980s, she joined the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, later WWE) as part of the [[1980s professional wrestling boom#Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection|Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]] storyline, feuding with [[Cyndi Lauper]] and [[Wendi Richter]], the latter of whom defeated her for the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|WWF Women's Championship]]

In the 1990s, she returned to the WWF in a comedic role with longtime friend [[Mae Young]]. Ellison became the first woman to be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], when she was inducted with the [[WWE Hall of Fame (1995)|class of 1995]] and became the oldest champion in the history of professional wrestling when she won the WWF Women's Championship at age 76, in 1999. In 2010, WWE recognized her as the 43rd best wrestler ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1289602337 |title=Full list of WWE's "Top 50 Superstars of All Time" |accessdate=January 6, 2011 |publisher=WrestleView |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116084010/http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1289602337 |archivedate=November 16, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest of five children, Ellison was the only daughter of a part Cherokee father and an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother. Her parents owned a farm, a grocery store, and a service station.&lt;ref name=god26/&gt;

When her mother died of cancer, eight-year-old Ellison went to live with her paternal grandmother and worked on her cousin's cotton farm to make money. At age 10, Ellison was still deeply distraught over her mother's death; to cheer her up, her father took her to the local wrestling matches. Ellison liked the matches, but it was not until she saw Women's Champion [[Mildred Burke]] wrestle that "they began to mean much more" to her.&lt;ref name=god30&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellison returned to the Columbia home of her father and brothers.&lt;ref name=god36&gt;Ellison, Lillian.

''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
===National Wrestling Alliance===
==== Early career (1949–1955) ====
Ellison began her wrestling career with [[Mildred Burke]]'s husband [[Billy Wolfe]], the dominant women's promoter of the time.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; She competed with many other female wrestlers, stepping into the ring with the likes of [[Mae Young]], [[Cecilia Blevins]] and [[Mildred Burke]]. Wolfe was notorious for advising his wrestlers to enter into sexual relationships with either himself or competing promoters to ensure additional bookings, a practice with which Ellison refused to go along.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; She, however, soon began a romance with wrestler Johnny Long. Long later introduced Ellison to [[Jack Pfefer]] who gave her the moniker "Slave Girl Moolah".&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=god60&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 60–65.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1950s, Moolah was a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#V|valet]] for "Nature Boy" [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]], accompanying him to the ring while providing eye candy for the male audiences and assisting Rogers against his opponents.&lt;ref name=raging86/&gt;&lt;ref name=god60/&gt; Ellison broke up the partnership because Rogers kept pushing her to begin a sexual relationship.&lt;ref name=god60/&gt; She then served as the valet for the Elephant Boy (Tony Olivas).&lt;ref name=raging86/&gt;&lt;ref name=god60/&gt; Olivas was Mexican, but had very dark skin, which caused controversy when Ellison, a white woman, would kiss him on the cheek during their ring entrance routine.&lt;ref name=god68&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; At one show in [[Oklahoma City]], a man, who thought that Olivas was a black man, attempted to stab Ellison with a knife for kissing him.&lt;ref name=god68/&gt; Moolah later left Pfeffer's promotion and began wrestling under Boston promoters Tony Santos and [[Paul Bowser]].&lt;ref name=god90&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, she began working for [[Vince McMahon, Sr.]]'s [[WWE#Capitol Wrestling Corporation (1952–63)|Capitol Wrestling Corporation]].&lt;ref name=god90/&gt;

==== World Champion (1956–1983) ====
On September 18, 1956, Moolah defeated [[Judy Grable]] in a 13-woman [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] to win the vacant World Women's Championship, which shares a lineage with the [[NWA World Women's Championship]].&lt;ref name=raging86/&gt;&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=god2/&gt;&lt;ref name=god98&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt; She was not immediately recognized by everyone as the NWA Champion because Billy Wolfe, with whom she had conflict earlier in her career, still controlled the promotion.&lt;ref name=god104&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 104–107.&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Vince McMahon, Sr. dubbed Ellison with a new ring name – The Fabulous Moolah.&lt;ref name=god98/&gt; Subsequently, June Byers came out of retirement to challenge Moolah to a match for the title.&lt;ref name=god104/&gt; During the match, Moolah acted as the aggressor and pinned Byers to retain the championship.&lt;ref name=god104/&gt; Moolah's first World Championship reign lasted over ten years.&lt;ref name="schramm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingGuestColumn/oct5_schramm.html|title=Moolah:Twenty-eight years was the reign|author=Schramm, Chris|date=October 5, 1998|accessdate=January 22, 2009|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moolah successfully defended the belt against the top female wrestlers in the world, such as Judy Grable and [[Donna Christanello]], while also purporting to befriend some of the biggest celebrities of the day.&lt;ref name=god73&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Moolah claimed in her book, ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', that she formed friendships with [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].&lt;ref name=god73/&gt;

After June Byers retired in 1964, Moolah was subsequently recognized as official NWA Champion, thus making her the undisputed Women's World Champion.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite video|people=The Fabulous Moolah|title=Lipstick &amp; Dynamite – The First Ladies of Wrestling|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Moolah [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#D|dropped]] the belt on September 17, 1967 to [[Bette Boucher]], although she regained the title just weeks later.&lt;ref name=ringch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/halloffame/moolahbio.html|title=Hall of Fame: Fabulous Moolah|author=Slagle, Steve|work=The Ring Chronicle|accessdate=March 25, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526141104/http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/bios/halloffame/moolahbio.html|archivedate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also traded the belt with [[Yukiko Tomoe]] during a tour of Japan in 1968.&lt;ref name=ringch/&gt; On July 1, 1972, Moolah became the first woman allowed to wrestle at [[Madison Square Garden]], which had previously banned women's wrestling.&lt;ref name=raging86/&gt;&lt;ref name=god134/&gt; In fact, Moolah helped overturn the ban on women's wrestling in the entire state of New York, which the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] lifted in June 1972.&lt;ref name=god134&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 134–137.&lt;/ref&gt; During her quest to overturn the ban, she flipped football player [[Rosey Grier|Roosevelt "Rosey" Grier]] onto his back on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''.&lt;ref name=god134/&gt; Moolah continued an uninterrupted eight-year reign before losing to [[Sue Green]] at Madison Square Garden in 1976.&lt;ref name=ringch/&gt; Moolah regained her title a short time later.&lt;ref name=ringch/&gt; She also bought the legal rights to the championship in the late 1970s,&lt;ref name=ringch/&gt; and after losing the championship for two days to Evelyn Stevens in 1978, began another long reign, defending her title for another six years.&lt;ref name=ringch/&gt; Also in the 1970s, Moolah held the [[NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship]] twice with [[Toni Rose]].&lt;ref name=god143/&gt;&lt;ref name=title/&gt;

==== Semi-retirement (1987–2007) ====
Throughout the early 1990s, she made appearances in video packages and at live WWF events.&lt;ref name=raging87/&gt; On June 24, 1995, she was the first female wrestler to be inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=raging87/&gt; In the late 1990s, [[pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] and Ellison began jokingly discussing a comeback for her, which resulted in Patterson contacting WWF Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] about the possibility.&lt;ref name=god205&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Moolah and [[Mae Young]] re-emerged in the WWF (later renamed World Wrestling Entertainment, WWE).&lt;ref name=god205/&gt; The WWF women's division, however, had since moved away from the traditional athletic match-ups of the past and now featured women competing in sexually-themed [[bikini contest]]s and [[Professional wrestling match types#Strip matches|strip matches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingWM2000/apr13_ivory.html|title='Slop' matches haven't stopped Ivory|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM!

Moolah received a call from McMahon in late 1998 about returning to the company.&lt;ref name=god8/&gt; On the September 9, 1999 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', [[Jeff Jarrett]] invited Moolah, 76, into the ring and smashed a guitar over her head.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Moolah and Young then began appearing regularly in comedic roles.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; On the September 27, 1999 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', Moolah and Young defeated [[Ivory (wrestler)|Ivory]] in a Handicapped Evening Gown match, which led to a title match at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy]] on October 17, 1999.&lt;ref name=raging87/&gt; The match saw seventy-six-year-old Moolah defeat Ivory to regain the WWE Women's Championship, thus becoming the oldest WWF Women's Champion ever,&lt;ref name=raging87/&gt;&lt;ref name=god2&gt;Ellison, Lillian.

== Training and promoting ==
Ellison and her second husband Johnny Long began training women to become female wrestlers, which included [[Ella Waldek]], Daisy Mae, and Katherine Simpson.&lt;ref name=god55/&gt; Long later contacted promoter [[Jack Pfefer]], who agreed to book some of the wrestlers at his shows.&lt;ref name=god55/&gt; After marrying wrestler Buddy Lee, he began helping Ellison train the female wrestlers.&lt;ref name=god82/&gt; After she left Pfeffer's promotion in the 1950s, Ellison found it difficult to book her trainees in shows due to Pfeffer's influence over other [[National Wrestling Alliance]] promoters.&lt;ref name=god82/&gt; Ellison claimed Pfeffer would threaten to reveal the pre-planned nature of wrestling if any other promoters did not do as he liked.&lt;ref name=god82/&gt; As a result, Ellison began selling cosmetics door-to-door and Lee opened a service station to make enough money to pay their bills.&lt;ref name=god82/&gt; They later began to book their wrestlers, including [[Judy Grable]] in Boston, under promoter [[Paul Bowser]].&lt;ref name=god90/&gt;

In the late 1950s when the once-dominant promoter of women's wrestling, [[Billy Wolfe]], was out of business, Ellison and Lee began to book their female wrestlers for more and more shows.&lt;ref name=god108&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 108–112.&lt;/ref&gt; They began calling their promoting business Girl Wrestling Enterprises (GWE).&lt;ref name=god108/&gt; Ellison demanded a lot from the girls of GWE, including that they had to keep their hair and make-up done, act like a lady, and not date men who were in the professional wrestling business.&lt;ref name=god108/&gt; In addition to women, Ellison also trained [[Midget wrestling|midget professional wrestler]]s, including [[Katie Glass]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=god108/&gt; Ellison founded the Ladies' International Wrestling Association, a non-profit organization to help retired professional wrestlers, in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=moon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, she spent most of her time training female wrestlers at her school in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=god8&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt; She also began training men, including [[The Patriot (wrestler)|Del Wilkes]], and in 1995 trained more men than women.&lt;ref name=moon/&gt; She also spent time training in Los Angeles at Verne Langdon's Slammers Gym.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of exploitation==
===Financial and sexual exploitation===
Journalist [[Dave Meltzer]] wrote an obituary for Moolah in which he stated that "different promoters had very different ideas of what being professional meant."&lt;ref name="Deadspin" /&gt; Wrestling historian Tim Hornbaker said that Moolah "chose not to" break the "dishonest, greedy" practices established by her mentor Billy Wolfe.&lt;ref name=sisterh/&gt; Pat Laprade and Dan Murphy, in their book ''Sisterhood of the Squared Circle'', wrote that Moolah's "tactics could be just as ruthless and cutthroat as those of 'The Godfather,'" [[Vito Corleone|Don Corleone]].&lt;ref name=sisterh/&gt;

[[Wendi Richter]] and [[Mad Maxine]] both claimed that Ellison did not actually train the wrestlers at her wrestling school.&lt;ref name="Fernow"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fernow|first1=Bill|title=Mad Maxine has quite a story to tell|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2014/08/30/21908686.html|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shoot/&gt; According to Richter, Ellison accepted payment of the training fee (which at the time of Richter's training was $500) and had other female wrestlers within her camp (including [[Leilani Kai]], [[Judy Martin (wrestler)|Judy Martin]], [[Winona Littleheart]], and [[Joyce Grable]]) train the new recruits; these women did not get paid for their additional work as trainers. Richter also claimed that Ellison required all women that received training at her camp to sign a contract that allowed Ellison to function as their booker and receive 25% of their booking fee. Trainees were also required to rent duplex apartments on Ellison's property and they were responsible for paying her for rent and utilities. The training lasted six months and took place up to five hours per day inside a wrestling ring in a barn that lacked heating and air conditioning or fans.&lt;ref name=shoot/&gt; Mad Maxine said that due to owing Moolah both rent and training fees amounting to $1,500, the trainees "went into debt to [Moolah] and she controlled their lives... It was an environment ripe for abuse." Maxine also said that when she went to work for WWF, Moolah was taking at least half of Maxine's earnings.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt; Debbie Johnson, another former trainee of Ellison's, stated that she was required to give Ellison 30% of her booking fee, and her paycheck was further reduced as Ellison deducted travel expenses, food, rent, and utilities before paying her. As a result, Johnson worked for Ellison for two years before she received any money. Johnson stated that Ellison would refuse to book certain women in her training camp if they angered her, and that Ellison monitored her and refused to let her leave the physical constraints of the training camp unless she was accompanied by someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ladysports.com/stories/debbiejohnson.htm|title=LadySports: Shooting with Debbie Johnson |author=Shiai Mata|publisher=LadySports|accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, various female wrestlers have come forward with stories accusing Ellison of being a [[pimp]] who often provided various wrestling promoters with unsuspecting female wrestlers that would be used as sex objects. [[Penny Banner]] directly described Moolah as a pimp who "in return for money," rented her female trainees out "in bulk" to wrestling promoters so that the promoters and the male wrestlers could have sex with them. Banner said the women who were "sent on these tours were not told of this 'arrangement' ahead of time," and that "those who refused to have sex with wrestlers and promoters were raped."&lt;ref name=sisterh/&gt; One of the most notorious accusations is from the family of Sweet Georgia Brown (Susie Mae McCoy). McCoy, who was trained and booked by Ellison and her then-husband Buddy Lee, told her daughter that she was often raped, given drugs, and made an addict in an intentional attempt by Ellison and Lee to control her. [[Ida Mae Martinez|Ida Martinez]], who wrestled during the 1960s, also recalls that many of the regional promoters "[[casting couch|demanded personal services]]" before they would pay the female wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.free-times.com/index.php?cat=121304064644348&amp;z_Issue_ID=11012501070771714&amp;ShowArchiveArticle_ID=11012501071127229|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110711025943/http://www.free-times.com/index.php?cat=121304064644348&amp;z_Issue_ID=11012501070771714&amp;ShowArchiveArticle_ID=11012501071127229|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 11, 2011|title=Baby of Sweet Georgia Brown|author=Murfee Faulk|publisher=free-times.com|accessdate=August 14, 2008|date=December 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mad Maxine described Moolah as an "evil person," saying Moolah made money by sending trainees "out to this guy in Arizona and pimped them out."&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt; In a 2002 interview, [[Luna Vachon]] claimed that when she was sixteen years old and training at Ellison's camp, Ellison sent her out of state to be photographed by an older man. Although she remained clothed during the photo shoot, Vachon stated she felt taken advantage of by Ellison and the older man. Vachon also stated that her aunt, [[Vivian Vachon]], witnessed Ellison abusing alcohol and having sex with her female trainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesmartmarks.com/article_1248.shtml|title=Gangrel and Luna Vachon Shoot Interview|publisher=The Smart Marks|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandy Parker]], a lesbian former pupil of Ellison's, also claims that Ellison forbade her from going to any gay bars and tried to press her to date men. Parker says this enraged her, because "(Moolah) was two faced because she had her own little dalliances that we all knew about."&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/03/14/5009196.html|title=Sandy Parker: Addicted to wrestling|author=Kreiser, Jamie Melissa|publisher=SLAM!

However, several former co-workers have spoken out in Ellison's defense. Professional wrestler [[Shane Douglas]] said he never heard anybody speaking against Moolah during his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://411mania.com/wrestling/shane-douglas-moolah-allegations/|title=Shane Douglas Addresses Allegations Against Fabulous Moolah, Claims He Never Heard Allegations That She Prostituted Female Talents|website=411Mania|first1=Jeffrey|last1=Harris|date=March 31, 2018|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Prichard]] said she was a "wonderful human being" and "She was always good to me, and she treated me well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://411mania.com/wrestling/bruce-prichard-says-undertaker-will-always-welcome-wrestlemania-talks-fabulous-moolah-controversey/|title=Bruce Prichard Says The Undertaker Will Always Be Welcome at WrestleMania, Talks Fabulous Moolah Controversy|website=411Mania|first1=Jeremy|last1=Thomas|date=March 25, 2018|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former female wrestler Beverly Shade also defended Moolah, claiming "Moolah wasn't that kind of person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://411mania.com/wrestling/former-wrestler-beverly-shade-doesnt-believe-accusations-fabulous-moolah/|title=Former Wrestler Beverly Shade Doesn't Believe Accusations Against Fabulous Moolah|website=411Mania|first1=Larry|last1=Csonka|date=April 19, 2018|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Lawler]] also said he "never heard or saw anything like that when I was in the business around Moolah and her girls."&lt;ref&gt;https://411mania.com/wrestling/jerry-lawler-sad-see-moolahs-reputation-defamed-destroyed/&lt;/ref&gt; Former trainee Princess Victoria said Moolah never pimp any women or use drugs, but she did take money from them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.solowrestling.com/new/73312-princess-victoria-en-exclusiva-wwe-y-los-mcmahon-han-degradado-a-las-mujeres-durante-mucho-tiempo&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulation of the women's wrestling industry in the United States===
As well as allegedly exploiting female wrestlers sexually, Ellison was accused of using her influence to control the women's wrestling scene and ensure that other women did not gain greater recognition. In addition to being a key participant in [[Wendi Richter#The Original Screwjob|the original screwjob]] on Wendi Richter, Ellison used her influence to take over the spot originally held by her protégé Mad Maxine on the animated series ''[[Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling]]''. Maxine was about to receive a big push by [[Vince McMahon]] but left the WWF shortly afterwards, as Ellison was unwilling to provide her with additional bookings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspwfaq.com/?p=259 |title=Biggest, Smallest, Strangest, Strongest |author=Scott's Blog of Doom |publisher=rspwfaq.com |accessdate=August 14, 2008 |date=February 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722195434/http://www.rspwfaq.com/?p=259 |archivedate=July 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maxine said that Moolah never told her about WWF's plans for Maxine's character to be included on ''Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling''.&lt;ref name="Fernow"/&gt; Numerous other former trainees defected from Ellison after growing tired of sharing their paychecks with Ellison.

Both Judy Martin and Leilani Kai told in later interviews that Moolah would collect the women wrestlers' pay from promoters, and after taking out her own pay, would only give the girls half of the money they were owed (keeping half of their pay for herself, plus her own pay) and telling them that was all the promoter gave her to give them. Martin stated that shortly before Ellison left the WWF in 1988 (shortly after falling out with Martin and Kai due to Ellison no longer receiving their booking fees), she sabotaged the duo while they were touring Japan. Martin stated that Ellison contacted Japanese promoters and informed them that the [[Jumping Bomb Angels]] were supposed to drop the [[WWF Women's Tag Team Championship]] to [[The Glamour Girls]] before Martin and Kai returned to the United States. This was contrary to the booking decision made by [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] before the Japanese tour began. Unable to reach Patterson by telephone, Kai and Martin agreed to win the titles from the Angels since Ellison had already misinformed the Japanese promoters. Martin stated that upon returning to the United States, Patterson was angry with them and confirmed that nobody within the WWF made the decision for the title change and that due to her long-standing relationship with the company, the WWF refused to listen to their explanation of Ellison's deceit. Shortly thereafter, the WWF phased out the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship. In a later shoot interview, Leilani Kai told that had things gone as the WWF originally planned, The Glamour Girls would have had a title match against the Jumping Bomb Angels at [[WrestleMania IV]] and that Ellison's actions had cost the four girls what would have been ultimately their biggest ever payday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caulifloweralleyclub.org/2012/02/05/2012-cac-womens-honoree-judy-martin/ |title=2012 CAC Women’s Honoree Judy Martin |publisher=Cauliflower Alley Club |accessdate=February 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306170042/http://www.caulifloweralleyclub.org/2012/02/05/2012-cac-womens-honoree-judy-martin |archivedate=March 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women that chose to continue allowing Ellison to work as their booker were kept under tight control. [[Velvet McIntyre]] was forced to compete against Ellison (whom McIntyre stated she didn't care for) at [[WrestleMania 2]] instead of competing during an all-women tour of Kuwait with a group of Ellison's other female wrestlers. Their WrestleMania 2 match lasted less than two minutes with the referee ignoring McIntyre's leg being on the ropes while she was being pinned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/03/26/51393.html|title=Velvet's WrestleMania memories |author=Greg Oliver|publisher=Slam Wrestling|accessdate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women that did not agree to Ellison's booking fees faced limited options. [[Rhonda Sing]] stated that Ellison contacted her and offered to let her wrestle Richter in a couple of pay-per-view matches for the WWF in 1985, but demanded she receive half of Sing's pay check; a stipulation Sing was unwilling to accept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosS/sing_rhonda_01jan-can.html|title=SLAM!

==Legacy==

David Bixenspan of ''[[Deadspin]]'' pointed out that Moolah wrestled an "in-ring style low on athleticism and heavy on hair-pulling", and taught this style to her students. This "worsened the in-genre gender divide" and resulted in American women's wrestling becoming "much more of a sideshow" instead of the women's world title being a "legitimate headline attraction" in the era before Moolah. As such, he rejected WWE's characterization of Moolah as someone who "challenged the gender norms of a once male-dominated sport".&lt;ref name="Deadspin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bixenspan|first1=David|title=Fans Are Revolting Against WWE Honoring Fabulous Moolah, With Good Reason|url=https://deadspin.com/fans-are-revolting-against-wwe-honoring-fabulous-moolah-1823744298|work=[[Deadspin]]|publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]]|location=United States|date=March 14, 2018|accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dave Meltzer]] described that women's wrestling "went way way down" under Moolah's "tutelage", but he also said he did not know if it was her fault. Meltzer said that although women "used to headline and they were successful", "during the period Moolah controlled women's wrestling, the popularity and product didn't evolve." However, Meltzer noted that Moolah herself "stood the test of time" to remain culturally relevant long after the Japanese female wrestlers of the 1980s (more popular at that time) had faded from relevance.&lt;ref name="sisterh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laparde|first1=Pat|last2=Murphy|first2=Dan|title=Sisterhood of the Squared Circle: The History and Rise of Women’s Wrestling|date=2017|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1773050141|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=f_lsDQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, WWE announced "The Fabulous Moolah Memorial Battle Royal", a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] for the female wrestlers of the company scheduled for [[WrestleMania 34]] named in honor of Moolah.&lt;ref name="Raw03122018"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WWE Raw Live TV Review: Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns meet face-to-face, all roads lead to WrestleMania|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/03/12/wwe-raw-live-tv-review-brock-lesnar-roman-reigns-meet-face-face-roads-lead-wrest/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to hold a battle royal in honor of Moolah drew controversy after the allegations of exploitation against Moolah surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE face fans backlash after they announce the ‘Fabulous Moolah Memorial Battle Royal’|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/wrestling/wwe-received-deal-backlash-following-12179980|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|last=Stride|first=Sam|location=[[London]]|date=March 13, 2018|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stonehouse"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/5822452/wwe-wrestlemania-fabulous-moolah-memorial-battle-royal/|title=NOT SO FAB: WWE forced into Fabulous Moolah Memorial WrestleMania Battle Royal U-turn after allegations of pimping against legend|first=Gary|last=Stonehouse|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|location=[[London]]|date=March 16, 2018|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the announcement, WWE renamed the match "[[WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal]]", removing Moolah's name from the event.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="namechange"&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE changes name of Fabulous Moolah battle royal|url=https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/wwe-changes-name-fabulous-moolah-battle-royal-253621|work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Inc.|location=United States|last=Currier|first=Joseph|date=March 15, 2018|accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other media ==
An animated version of Moolah was included on a [[CBS]] [[Saturday morning cartoon]] during this lucrative time, titled ''[[Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingReviews/rocknwrestling.html|title=Rock 'n' Wrestling best left in the past|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=May 5, 2009|date=December 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, she appeared in one of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s music videos, "[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; An illness in the mid-1970s meant Ellison had to pull out of the [[Bill Cosby]] movie ''[[Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed]]'', which had a role written specifically for her.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Moolah wrote her autobiography, ''The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle''.&lt;ref name=raging87/&gt; The book has been criticized for keeping [[kayfabe]] (the stance that wrestling storylines are real) and did not reveal a lot about her time controlling women's wrestling.&lt;ref name=slam84&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/11/03/4628394.html|title=Fabulous Moolah dead at 84|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=June 18, 2009|date=November 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending herself against these claims, Ellison retorted it was hard to fit all of her almost five decade career into one book.&lt;ref name=slam84/&gt;

Moolah and Young, along with several other female wrestlers, starred in the 2004 film ''[[Lipstick and Dynamite, Piss and Vinegar: The First Ladies of Wrestling|Lipstick and Dynamite]]'' a documentary about the female wrestlers from the 1950s era.&lt;ref name="video"/&gt; They also appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' promoting the film.&lt;ref name=ajc/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Ellison's first husband was Walter Carroll, who became the father of her daughter Mary.&lt;ref name=god36/&gt;&lt;ref name=moon/&gt; Mary wrestled briefly but decided against pursuing the profession.&lt;ref name=god36/&gt; Ellison had six grandchildren.&lt;ref name=god36/&gt;&lt;ref name=moon/&gt;  Ellison and Carroll divorced shortly after their daughter's birth. Later, Ellison married wrestler Johnny Long.&lt;ref name=god55&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Marital conflicts developed when Long wanted Ellison to be a housewife instead of a career woman.&lt;ref name=god55/&gt; In addition, Ellison accused Long of being a "womanizer".&lt;ref name=god60/&gt;  Ellison and Long divorced. Ellison also says that she dated country singer [[Hank Williams]] for four months in 1952.&lt;ref name=god73/&gt; According to Ellison, Williams proposed to her,&lt;ref name=god73/&gt; but Williams's drinking and [[heroin]] abuse forced the couple to go separate ways.&lt;ref name=god73/&gt; She further claimed that he wanted Ellison to quit her wrestling career, which she did not want to do.&lt;ref name=god73/&gt;  Two months after the breakup, [[Death of Hank Williams|Williams died]] due to an overdose.&lt;ref name=god7377&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 73–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Ellison met a wrestler named Buddy Lee, whom she regarded as the "love of her life."&lt;ref name=god73/&gt; They were eventually married, and after divorcing in 1970 after nine years of marriage, they remained friends until Lee's death in 1999.&lt;ref name=moon/&gt;&lt;ref name=god82&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 82–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The divorce was attributed to Lee's affair with Rita Cortez, one of the wrestlers the duo was training.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, Ellison opened Moolah's Hideaway, a bar and grill which was operated by her daughter Mary and frequented by [[André the Giant]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1991, Ellison lived with [[Mae Young]] in a house in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=god8/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austin360.com/movies/content/shared/movies/reviews/L/lipstickanddynamite/ajc.html |title='Lipstick &amp; Dynamite': You'll fall for these ladies |author=Ringel Gillespie, Eleanor |publisher=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=July 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926105440/http://www.austin360.com/movies/content/shared/movies/reviews/L/lipstickanddynamite/ajc.html |archivedate=September 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her estate was located on a road named Moolah Drive.&lt;ref name=god8/&gt; A [[Midget wrestling|midget professional wrestler]] named [[Katie Glass]] also lived with Moolah for over 40 years.&lt;ref name=god8/&gt; Another wrestler, [[Donna Christanello]], also lived with Ellison on-and-off for 40 years, ending in May 1999.&lt;ref name=god143&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her return to the ring in 1999, Ellison began experiencing occasional dizziness, and as a result, her doctor requested that she begin to wear a heart monitor.&lt;ref name=god18&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', pp. 18–22.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Ellison was admitted to the hospital for what turned out to be two clogged arteries and viral [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=god18/&gt; She stayed at the [[intensive-care unit]] of the hospital for 24 days, during which she was unconscious for fifteen days.&lt;ref name=god18/&gt; After leaving the hospital, she again slipped into unconsciousness in the bathroom at her home, crushing several [[Vertebral column|vertebrae]].&lt;ref name=god18/&gt; She underwent successful back surgery in mid-December.&lt;ref name=god18/&gt;

'''The Originals''' is a [[database]] [[website]] founded and ran by Arnold Rypens in 2000 &lt;ref name="originals.be"/&gt; and based on a radio show and book series originally launched in 1982.&lt;ref name="originals.be"/&gt; It offers lists of the original versions of thousands of songs and musical compositions and adds every [[cover (music)|cover]] and [[sampling (music)|sample]] made of it since. As of 2017 the site counts more than 15.000 titles.&lt;ref name="originals.be"/&gt;

==Concept==

''The Originals'' was established to track down the original version of every possible [[song]], [[melody]], [[Musical composition|composition]] or [[sampling (music)|sample]]. In many cases the tune listeners would recognize as "the original version" turns out to be much older and far more obscure.&lt;ref name="originals.be"/&gt; Visitors can use a [[search engine]] to type in the name of a musical work or artist and find the corresponding article. Articles about artists or bands provide a list of all of their songs which are covers and/or songs which have been covered. Articles about songs or melodies list all possible musical covers and versions. In both cases the names of each artist, composer, band, songwriter and year of recording are listed. Whenever possible, historical context and background is provided as well. The info is made available both in Dutch as well as English.

==History==

The project is the brainchild of Flemish radio host Arnold Rypens (1952) who established a radio show, ''Domino The Originals'' in February 1982 aired on [[Omroep Brabant]] &lt;ref name="ravagedigitaal.org"/&gt;(nowadays [[Radio 2 (Belgium)|Radio 2]]). It aired nothing but original versions of hits of the day.&lt;ref name="originals.be"/&gt; The emissions sparked interest from listeners who were often surprised and intrigued how old certain songs were and how they sounded in their earliest embryonic versions. As such the show kept running and spawned a special book named ''The Originals - Prequel of the Hits'' (1987)&lt;ref name="standaard.be"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dst13122000_064|title=INTERVIEW. Nieuw monnikenwerk van Arnold Rypens|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Arnold Rypens.&lt;ref name="originals.be"/&gt; This first edition listed some 12.000 music titles,&lt;ref name="originals.be"/&gt; tracing back their earliest versions predating hit version(s) and other relevant covers. Since then up to five new book editions have been published, completely updated and expanded. In 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.be/boekenportaal/boekinfo_boek.php?isbn=9789090256832|title=EPO-boekinfo: The Originals - Arnold Rypens|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an English version has been published as well.&lt;ref name="originals.be"/&gt;

Rypens travelled the entire world, researched various libraries, audio collection, museums, archives of [[country music|country]], [[blues]] and [[soul music|soul]] and interviewed collectors and archivists like [[Joel Whitburn]] and [[Alan Lomax]].&lt;ref name="ravagedigitaal.org"/&gt; Rypens' radio show has been broadcast on [[Omroep West-Vlaanderen]], [[Studio Brussel]] and the regional channel Radio L1.&lt;ref name="ravagedigitaal.org"/&gt; To this day Rypens still has a daily segment in the radio program ''Pili Pili'' where he talks about one particular song whose origins he has discovered and mapped out.&lt;ref name="standaard.be"/&gt; The show was also broadcast on [[Radio 3 (Netherlands)|Radio 3]] in the Netherlands by Dutch host [[Hubert van Hoof]]. In 2000 Rypens established a [[website]] around the project.&lt;ref name="ravagedigitaal.org"/&gt;

'''ThingLink Inc.''' (Thinglink Oy in Finland) is a Finnish-American provider of in-image interaction tools.

ThingLink, launched in 2010 and led by [[Ulla Engeström]] and [[Janne Jalkanen]], develops tools for image interaction that allow content sharing via online images. The purpose of ThingLink, according to its developers, is to allow photos and other images to be made into web links, mainly for the purpose of advertising and education.

== Company history ==

ThingLink was developed by Social Objects Oy (a Helsinki-based incubator owned by Ulla and [[Jyri Engeström]]) in 2006. ThingLink was first incorporated in Palo Alto, California in 2008 by Ulla Engeström. A closed test version of the service was launched in 2009, followed by the public release in 2010. Thinglink Oy did initial fundraising and found financial backers in Helsinki. In 2011, ThingLink launched Rich Media Tags, an initial form for linking images to websites and social media. Rich Media Tags have so far been developed for several social content platforms, including [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[Flickr]], [[Spotify]], [[Vimeo]], [[Wikipedia]], [[SoundCloud]] [[Google Apps]] and [[Twitter]].

ThingLink and SoundCloud launched the first use of a sound/music player inside a digital image.{{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed#Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=noprint Template-Fact }}

[[Atlantic Records]] launched [[Simple Plan]]'s [[Get Your Heart On]] CD using ThingLink, the first major record company to tap into the engagement potential of interactive images.

ThingLink hired [[Neil Vineberg]], former head of Vineberg Communications, as CMO, to open up U.S. market to relationships with key companies in music, entertainment, publishing and digital marketing.

== Rich Media Tags ==
In 2011 ThingLink launched [[Rich Media Tags]], making interacting with different social content platforms possible within a single image.

When linked with a URL to one of the rich media enabled sites, a tag appears revealing the related content. These tags will then be revealed every time a viewer scrolls their mouse over the uploaded image. By using ThingLink, publishers can also include links to other social networks, blogs, news and commerce sites that are yet to have Rich Media Tags created.

A '''''Zmei Gorynich''''' or '''''zmey''''' ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:Змей (мифология)|змей]]}}), in  ''[[Skazka]]'' (Russian folktales) and ''[[Bylina]]'' (epic poetry), is a [[dragon]] or serpent, or sometimes a human-like character with dragon-like traits.

Zmei Gorynych and [[Tugarin Zmeyevich]] are well-known ''zmei'', and appear as adversaries to the [[bogatyr]]i (heroes) [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] or [[Alyosha Popovich]].

==Etymology==
The word '''zmei''' in Russian is the masculine forms of ''zmeya'', a feminine noun, meaning "[[snake]]".{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|p=83}}

==General traits==

===Gender===
The dragon in Russian folk fiction may be female, in which case she is called ''zmeya''. The tendency is for the prose folktale versions to have male dragons, and the [[Bylina|byliny]] poetry to have the females.{{sfnp|Warner|2002|p=68}} This will affect the behavior of the dragons. For instance, only the male dragons will capture or captivate a princes or a maiden as a love interest.

===Multiheadedness===
The zmei is often depicted with [[Multi-headed animal|multiple heads]], and the number of heads may be 3, 6, 9, or 12.&lt;ref name=kravchenko/&gt;

A three-, six-, nine-, and twelve-headed dragon are defeated on successive nights by the hero of the tale "Ivan the Peasant's Son and the Little Man the Size of a Finger" ([[Alexander Afanasyev|Afanasyev]] #138). The twelve-headed one was hardest to kill, and although the hero beheaded it nearly completely, the last head had to be taken by six men provided to Ivan by the Tsar.&lt;ref&gt;"Ivan the Peasant's Son and the Little Man the Size of a Finger with Moustaches Seven Versts in Length", {{harvp|Curtin|1890|pp=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|A three-, six-, and twelv-headed are killed in "Ivan Popyalov" (Иван Попялов, No. 135){{sfnp|Ralston|1880|pp=79–83}}}}

;Chudo-Iudo

In the variant "Ivan Bykovich (Ivan Buikovich)" (# 137),{{efn|Variant to "Ivan Popyalov" (#135), in Ralston's discussion, strictly speaking.}} an equivalent sets of these multi-headed creatures appear, but are not called ''zmei'', but a Chudo-Iudo (Chudo-Yudo). These are humanlike creatures, each one is riding a horse.{{Efn|The twelve-headed Chudo-Yudo rides a horse with twelve silver wings, which is gold-maned and tailed}} Even when decapitated, if the heads picked up the grow back on once a line is drawn on it with the dragon's fiery finger.&lt;ref name=ivan-bykovich-ru&gt;{{Wikisourcelang-inline|ru|Народные русские сказки (Афанасьев)/Иван Быкович|Иван Быкович}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Ralston|1880|pp=83–86}} As is pointed out below, a ''zmei'' can take human-form, and in the variant "Storm-bogatyr, Ivan the Cow's Son" (#136), the multi-headed Chudo-Iudo are described as using the word ''zmei'' also.&lt;ref name=burya-bogatyr-ru&gt;{{Wikisourcelang-inline|ru|Народные русские сказки (Афанасьев)/Буря-богатырь Иван коровий сын|Буря-богатырь Иван коровий сын}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other attributes===
The creature's appearance is not described in ''bylinas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2tq.ru/slovary/zmei.html Змей]. // Русский гуманитарный словарь. М., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent sources, the Russian zmei is described as being covered with either green&lt;ref name=kravchenko/&gt; or red&lt;ref&gt;[http://elib.bsu.by/bitstream/123456789/103289/1/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0%20%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%20%D0%A7%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D0%B8%20%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8B%20%D0%B2%20%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%20_%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D1%8B%D0%BD%D1%8F%20%D0%B8%20%D0%B7%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B9_%20%D0%B8%20%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%82%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BC%D0%B5%20_%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D1%8B%D0%BD%D1%8F%20%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%20%D0%B8%20%D0%97%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B9%20%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8B%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%87_.pdf Надежда Конобеева]&lt;/ref&gt; scales, and having iron claws.&lt;ref name=kravchenko/&gt;

===Shapeshifting===
The ''zmei'' may turn into a handsome youth. In that form he enthralls the sister or wife of [[Ivan Tsarevich]] in different versions of {{illm|"The Milk of Wild Beasts"|fr|Le Lait de bête sauvage}} (Afanasyev #204, #205), as described below. In one of these (#204) the ''zmei'' also transforms into kitchen implements to avoid detection: he becomes a broom&lt;!--besom--&gt;, a sort of mop ([[:ru:Помело (метла)|помело]] ''pomelo'') and {{illm|oven fork|ru|ухват}}. But Ivan's obedient animals are able to detect the  presence of an intruder in these implements.{{sfnp|Afanas'ev|Haney|2015|loc=#204}}{{sfnp|Mizukami|2015|p=62}}

The ''zmei'' assumes the form of a golden goat in another tale ("The Crystal Mountain", Afanasyev #162).{{sfnp|Propp|1968|p=15}}

==In fairy tales==
[[Image:Змей Горыныч.jpg|thumb|''Zmey Gorynych'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].]]
&lt;!--[[Image:Zmei Gorinich (colour fixed).jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Zmey Gorynych'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]--&gt;
The ''zmei'' occurs in the literature of [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] in numerous wondertales (''{{linktext|skazki}}''{{Efn|Plural form of ''skazka'' {{linktext|ска́зка}}.}}) such as those in [[Alexander Afanasyev]]'s compilation ''[[Narodnye russkie skazki]]'',{{sfnp|Mizukami|2015|p=53}} and in the byliny (epic ballads), and rendered as "serpent" or "dragon". They may also appear as a character with "Zmei" or "Zmeyevich" (Zmeevich, etc.) in their proper name, and these may exhibit more human-like qualities, such as courting women.

===As fabulous beast===

The ''zmei'' slain by the [[bogatyr]] [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] in the bylina "Dobrynya and the Zmei" can be male or female. It may happen to be Zmei Gorynishche{{Efn|"Zmei Gorynchische" {{Lang|ru|Змей Горынчище}} may be the correct transcription. The [[Cyrillic]] form is the one given by Stangé-Zhirovova.}} ("Dragon, the Son of a Mountain").{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|p=81}}&lt;ref&gt;Version collected by [[Kirsha Danilov]]. Printed in: Evgenyeva, A. P. and {{illm|Boris Nikolaevich Putilov{{!}}Putilov|ru|Путилов, Борис Николаевич}} (1977), ''Ancient Russian poems'', p. 184, cited by Stangé-Zhirovova.&lt;/ref&gt; This name is a variant form of "Zmei Gorynych" found in fairy tales.{{sfnp|Stangé-Zhirovova|1992|p=325}} Or it may be she-dragon without a name,&lt;!--The patronymic Gorynych would not fit a female--&gt; as in the byliny collected from [[Republic of Karelia|Karelian Russia]].&lt;ref name="dobrynya&amp;dragon-bailey"&gt;"Dobrynya and the Dragon" (English translation), in {{harvp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|pp=84–97}}, after the version collected by [[Alexander Hilferding|A. F. Gilferding]] from [[Olonetsky District|Olonets]].&lt;/ref&gt; The "Puchai River" was its haunt, but in the caves of the "Saracen Mountains" it raised its pups and kept hostages. It was capable of flight, and abducted a princess from [[Kiev]] by flying there.&lt;ref name="dobrynya&amp;dragon-bailey"/&gt;

====Zmei Gorynych====
Zmei Gorynych (Russian: [[:ru:Змей Горыныч|Змей Горыныч]]) has decidedly dragon-like characteristics, such as having [[Multi-headed animal|multiple heads]] (from 3 to upwards of 12&lt;ref name=mccullough/&gt;), spitting fire, and being associated with a body of water.{{Efn|In contrast to [[Tugarin Zmeyevich]], etc., who have "anthropomorphic traits" ({{harvp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|p=81}}).}}{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|p=81}}

However, "Zmei Gorynych" is not consistently beast-like, and he may appear in the guise of a human thoroughout in some works (See [[#Milk of Wild Beasts|§Milk of Wild Beasts]], [[#Dobrynya and Marinka|§Dobrynya and Marinka]]) below.&lt;ref&gt;Thus the Zmei Gorynych or Tugarin who feature as boyfriends of Marinka in ''Dobrynya and Marinka'' are noted as being "dragon-like figures" ({{harvp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|p=99}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropomorphism===
Sometimes there are "Sons of Zmei" (Zmeyevich being their [[patronymic]] surname) who are recognized as monsters with human qualities, or vice versa.&lt;ref name=zoomorphic-anthropomorphic/&gt;

====Tugarin Zmeyevich====
{{More|Tugarin}}
[[Tugarin Zmeyevich]] is one such with [[anthropomorphic]] characteristics.&lt;ref name=zoomorphic-anthropomorphic&gt;:{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|p=122}} "zoomorphic and anthropomorphic features are combined in him". Citing Propp (1958b), ''The Russian Heroic Epic'', pp. 206–24; {{illm|Boris Nikolaevich Putilov{{!}}Putilov|ru|Путилов, Борис Николаевич}} (1971b) "Сюжетная замкнутость и второй сюжетный план в славянском эпосе"&lt;!--Siuzhetnaia zamknutost i vtori siuzhetnyi plan v slvianskom epose --&gt;[Plot enclosure and plot background in the Slavic epic]", pp. 54–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The half-human quality is borne out by the {{linktext|sobriquet}} ''zmei-[[bogatyr]]''&lt;!--zmey-bogatyr--&gt; (serpent-hero) given him,&lt;ref name=1911-russlit/&gt;&lt;ref name=alyosha-afanasyev&amp;haney/&gt; and from him being able to ride a horse like a human being in the folktale "[[Alyosha Popovich]]". Tugarin thus faces off against the bogatyr Alyosha, and is slain.&lt;ref name=alyosha-afanasyev&amp;haney&gt;"Alyosha Popovich", {{harvp|Afanas'ev|Haney|2015|loc=#312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tugarin is a great glutton, which is suggestive of a dragon; however Tugar still retains human form, even in the scene where he displays the extraordinary feat of devouring a whole swan, moving it from cheek to cheek, and spitting out the bones.{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|pp=122, 126}} Tugarin also has flying wings like a dragon,{{sfnp|Magnus|1916|p=168}}{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|p=122}} but some songs rationalize these a paper wings, a device attached to the horse.&lt;ref name="alyosha&amp;tugarin-bailey"&gt;"Alyosha Popovich, his Squire Yekim, and Tugarin" (English translation), in {{harvp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|pp=124–129}}, after the version taken down by N. E. Onchukov from [[Arkhangelsk Oblast|Archangel Province]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Tugarin is referred to as a pagan{{sfnp|Magnus|1916|p=168}} and he has been given overlays of a [[Tatar people|Tatar]] tyrant around the folkloric dragon.{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|p=122}} Some support the conjecture that Tugarin's name derives from "Tugar-Khan", or Tugor-Khan, of the Turkic [[Polovtsi|Polovets]],{{sfnp|Hapgood|1886|p=345}}{{Efn|Tugar-Khan appears as the ruler of the fictitious "Tugars" in the 1956 film ''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]''.&lt;ref name=greenwood-soviet-films/&gt;}} but this etymology has been discounted by later commentators.{{Refn|Discounted in favor of derivation that derives Tugar from ''tug'' meaning "grief".{{sfnp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|pp=124–129}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= |first= |author-link=Sergei O. Prokofieff |title=The Spiritual Origins of Eastern Europe and the Future Mysteries of the Holy Grail |publisher=Temple Lodge Publishing |year=1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_y3nDzXvcB8C&amp;pg=PA488 |page=488}} {{isbn|0904693554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Milk of Wild Beasts====
The ''zmei'' also transforms into a handsome youth to seduce women (folktale {{illm|"The Milk of Wild Beasts"|fr|Le Lait de bête sauvage}},  #204, 205).{{sfnp|Propp|1968|p=15}} In one version, Zmei Gorynych seduces the sister of [[Ivan Tsarevich]]. She feigns illnesses and asks Ivan to perform the precarious task of retrieving the milk of the wolf, bear, and lioness. This plan fails. Later however, when Ivan is separted from his trusty pack of animals, zmei reveals his true nature and poises to devour him with his gaping mouth.{{sfnp|Afanas'ev|Haney|2015|loc=#204}}{{Efn|There is a later development where Ivan vanquishes a 12-headed dragon, but is beheaded by a water-carrier who sought to steal credit.}} In another version, Zmei Zmeyevich ("Serpent, Son of Serpent") and Ivan's adulterous wife play out a similar plot.{{sfnp|Afanas'ev|Haney|2015|loc=#205}}

===Other examples===
Zmei Gorynych or Tugarin Zmeyevich, in "Dobrynya and Marinka", play fleeting roles as the lover of Marinka the sorceress, and are instantly killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bailey|Ivanova|1998|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Warner|2002|p=68}}. Zmei Gorynych.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Warner|2002}}, ""Dobrýnya the Dragon-Slayer, and Marína", p. 118, Marína (Marínushka Ignátievna) has Tugarin Dragon's Son as "her dear friend"&lt;/ref&gt;

In some tales, this Zmei Zmeyevich is a [[tsar]].&lt;ref name="marko&amp;vasily"&gt;"Marko the Rich and Vasily the Luckless" or "Marko the Luckless" (Afanasyev #305)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other folktale literature==
===Eruslan Lazarevich===
{{more|Yeruslan Lazarevich{{!}}Eruslan Lazarevich}}
There is also the three-headed ''zmei'' defeated by [[Yeruslan Lazarevich|Eruslan Lazarevich]], hero of the story material found in [[popular print]] ([[Lubok|lubki]]).{{sfnp|Warner|2002|pp=67–68}}

===Saint George===
It was a ''zmei'', and not a ''drakon'' ({{lang-ru|драко́н}}) that was defeated by Saint George, or St. Egorii, as he was popularly known in Russia.{{sfnp|Warner|2002|p=19}} The saint appears as "Egorii the brave" ({{lang-ru|Егорий Храбрый}}, with the epithet "''chrabryii''") in religious verses.{{sfnp|Warner|2002|pp=67–68}}&lt;ref name=lunk/&gt; This can be seen in popular ''[[lubok]]'' prints of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Warner|2002}}, p. 68: See caption on the 19th century print photograph.&lt;/ref&gt; The scene is also often depicted in [[Russian icons]].{{sfnp|Warner|2002|pp=67–68}}
